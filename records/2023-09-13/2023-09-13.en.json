I hope it’s useful! ronyfadel 15 hours agoFor translation jobs, I&#x27;ve experimented with Llama 2 70B (running on Replicate) v&#x2F;s GPT-3.5;For about 1000 input tokens (and resulting 1000 output tokens), to my surprise, GPT-3.5 turbo was 100x cheaper than Llama 2.Llama 7B wasn&#x27;t up to the task fyi, producing very poor translations.I believe that OpenAI priced GPT-3.5 aggressively cheap in order to make it a non-brainer to rely on them rather than relying on other vendors (even open source models).I&#x27;m curious to see if others have gotten different results? reply kcorbitt 15 hours agoparentYes, if you&#x27;re just using Llama 2 off the shelf (without fine-tuning) I don&#x27;t think there are a lot of workloads where it makes sense as a replacement for GPT-3.5. The one exception being for organizations where data security is non-negotiable and they really need to host on-prem. The calculus changes drastically though when you bring fine-tuning in, which lets a much smaller model outperform a larger one on many classes of task.Also, it&#x27;s worth noting that Replicate started out with a focus on image generation, and their current inference stack for LLMs is extremely inefficient. A significant fraction of the 100x cost difference you mentioned can be made up by using an optimized inference server like vLLM. Replicate knows about this and is working hard on improving their stack, it&#x27;s just really early for all of us. :) reply bfirsh 12 hours agorootparentFounder of Replicate here. It&#x27;s early indeed.OpenAI aren&#x27;t doing anything magic. We&#x27;re optimizing Llama inference at the moment and it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to roughly match GPT 3.5&#x27;s price for Llama 2 70B.Running a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is surprisingly expensive. That&#x27;s where using Llama makes a ton of sense. Once we’ve optimized inference, it’ll be much cheaper to run a fine-tuned Llama. reply yixu34 3 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re working on LLM Engine (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llm-engine.scale.com) at Scale, which is our open source, self-hostable framework for open source LLM inference and fine-tuning. We have similar findings to Replicate: Llama 2 70B can be comparable to GPT 3.5 price, etc. Would be great to discuss this further! reply Arctic_fly 15 hours agoparentprev> Llama 7B wasn&#x27;t up to the task fyi, producing very poor translations.From what I&#x27;ve read and personally experimented with, none of the Llama 2 models are well-suited to translation in particular (they were mainly trained on English data). Still, there are a number of tasks that they&#x27;re really good at if fine-tuned correctly, such as classification and data extraction.> I believe that OpenAI priced GPT-3.5 aggressively cheap in order to make it a non-brainer to rely on them rather than relying on other vendors (even open source models).I think you&#x27;re definitely right about that, and in most cases just using GPT 3.5 for one-off tasks makes the most sense. I think when you get into production workflows that scale, that&#x27;s when using a small fine-tuned models starts making more sense. You can drop the system prompt and get data in the format you&#x27;d expect it in, and train on GPT-4&#x27;s output to sometimes get better accuracy than 3.5 would give you right off the bat. And keep in mind, while you can do the same thing with a fine-tuned 3.5 model, it&#x27;s going to cost 8x the base 3.5 price per token. reply kelseyfrog 12 hours agorootparentIs that because translation is typically an encoder-decoder task and llama is decoder only or is there something else about it that makes the last difficult for llama? reply FeepingCreature 11 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t make it learn other-language texts, it won&#x27;t be able to speak that language. reply AnonymousPlanet 14 hours agoparentprevCost isn&#x27;t the only incentive not to use an LLM service that resides in a foreign country.

You want a host with cheap consumer GPUs (like vast.ai) since the 4-bit requirements are so modest.You either need a backend with good batching support (vLLM), or if you don&#x27;t need much throughput, an extremely low end GPU or no GPU at all for exLlama&#x2F;llama.cpp.OpenAI benefits from quantization&#x2F;batching, optimized kernels and very high utilization on their end, so the huge price gap vs a default HF Transformers instance is understandable. But even then, you are probably right about their aggressive pricing.As for quality, you need a llama model finetunes on the target language (many already exist on Huggingface) and possibly custom grammar if your backend supports it. reply halflings 15 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think translation is a great use case for ChatGPT and LLAMA. These models are overwhelmingly trained on English, and LLAMA2 which should have more data from other languages is still focused on languages w&#x2F; Latin&#x2F;Cyrillic characters (so won&#x27;t work well for Arabic, Hebrew, or CJK languages).You&#x27;re better off using models specialized in translation; General purpose LLMs are more useful when fine-tuning on specific tasks (some form of extraction, summarization, generative tasks, etc.), or for general chatbot-like uses. reply og_kalu 13 hours agorootparent>You&#x27;re better off using models specialized in translationFor a couple dozen languages, GPT-4 is by far the best translator you can get your hand on so basically no. reply daniels11 12 hours agorootparentI will say that GPT-4 is just incredibly expensive. For my app I only use it for advanced translations&#x2F;corrections, and usually a combination of GPT-3.5+Wiktionary is able to get the more simple stuff done reply all2 12 hours agorootparent> GPT-3.5+WiktionaryCan you share more about your app and what you&#x27;re doing? reply daniels11 11 hours agorootparentSure! I&#x27;m building a personalized AI language learning tutor using Open AI&#x27;s API and ElevenLabs (for Text to Speech).Right now it&#x27;s basically a chat bot that you can use to practice conversing with. It provides corrections for the things you type. Eventually I&#x27;d like to try adding Whisper as well to allow users to speak out loud.When you hover over a word, you get a translation. Initially I thought using Open AI for every word translation would be too much, but I&#x27;ve been able to get it down to ~36-40 tokens&#x2F;request. (3-4 cents&#x2F;1000 requests). I also began parsing and uploading some of this [Wiktionary data](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaikki.org&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;rawdata.html) and am working on a feature that integrates the GPT-3.5 translation with this Wiktionary data.A lot of these features are still in the works but you can feel free to try it if you like (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trytutor.app). reply achileas 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are plenty of examples in the literature of using LLMs for translation beating the metrics of non-LLM models, even for languages for which there isn&#x27;t a lot of data. Transliterating non-Latin characters helps a lot with accuracy as well. reply daniels11 14 hours agorootparentprevwhat models would you use for translation? I am working on a language learning tutor (trytutor.app, very early) and GPT-3.5 turbo has been working fine, for the most part.For foreign language corrections (\"correct this German sentence and give a reason for the correction\"), GPT-3.5 doesn&#x27;t quite have the horsepower so I use GPT-4 reply nborwankar 11 hours agoparentprevLlama and GPT are auto-regressive decoder only architectures which for pure translation jobs are not the optimal architectures. Training seq2seq models or encoder&#x2F;decoder models on datasets of sentence pairs designed for translation will likely allow you to use much smaller models. You will not be wasting parameters on general “language understanding” capability that Llama and GPT have if pure translation is all you need. T5 or Flan-T5 might be good starting points. reply octacat 13 hours agoparentprevGoogle Maps was also cheap. Initially. So it is aggressively cheap now, but would aggressively change later. reply mrybczyn 14 hours agoparentprevYes, openAI is dumping the market with chat-gpt 3.5. Vulture capital behaviour at its finest, and I&#x27;m sure government regulations will definitely catch on to this in 20 or 30 years...It&#x27;s cheaper than the ELECTRICITY cost of running a llama-70 on your own M1.Max (very energy efficient chip) assuming free hardware.I guess they are also getting a pretty good cache hit rate - there are only so many questions people ask at scale. But still, it&#x27;s dumping. reply sacred_numbers 13 hours agorootparentBased on my research, GPT-3.5 is likely significantly smaller than 70B parameters, so it would make sense that it&#x27;s cheaper to run. My guess is that OpenAI significantly overtrained GPT-3.5 to get as small a model as possible to optimize for inference. Also, Nvidia chips are way more efficient at inference than M1 Max. OpenAI also has the advantage of batching API calls which leads to better hardware utilization. I don&#x27;t have definitive proof that they&#x27;re not dumping, but economies of scale and optimization seem like better explanations to me. reply hutzlibu 13 hours agorootparentI also do not have proof of anything here, but can&#x27;t it be both?They have lots of money now and the market lead. They want to keep the lead and some extra electricity and hardware costs are surely worth it for them, if it keeps the competition from getting traction. reply csjh 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes you think 3.5 is significantly smaller than 70B? reply haxton 13 hours agorootparentprevgpt3.5 turbo is (mostly likely) Curie which is (most likely) 6.7b params.

I haven&#x27;t really seen a business use-case that runs it on the user&#x27;s computer, but given the hardware requirements it wouldn&#x27;t be very feasible to expect.So you&#x27;ll have to figure out how to run&#x2F;scale the model inference. Cloud GPU instances are generally very expensive, and once you start needing to horizontally scale it&#x27;ll get messy fast.At least at the moment it&#x27;s expensive, especially if it&#x27;s either very light usage or very intensive usage - you either need just a few seconds of compute occasionally, or lots of compute all the time requiring scaling.The \"lucky\" ones in this scenario are small-medium businesses that can use one or a few cards on-site for their traffic. Even then when you take the cost of an A100 + maintaining it, etc. OpenAI&#x27;s offering still looks attractive.I know there&#x27;s a few services that try to provide an api similar to what openai has, and some software to self orchestrate it, I&#x27;m curious how those compare... reply hereonout2 12 hours agorootparent> once you start needing to horizontally scale it&#x27;ll get messy fast.It gets expensive fast, but not messy, these things scale horizontally really well.

To start, it&#x27;ll simply pipe the user&#x27;s requests to OpenAI or their existing model. So it&#x27;d be a drop in replacement. Then, it&#x27;ll every so often offer to the user - \"hey we think at this point there&#x27;s enough data that a fine tune might save you approx $x&#x2F;month based on your current calls, click the button to start the fine tune and we&#x27;ll email you once we have the results\" - and then the user gets the email \"here are the results, based on that we recommend switching, click here to switch to calling your fine-tuned model\"You just described our short-term roadmap. :) Currently an OpenPipe user has to explicitly kick off a fine-tuning job, but they&#x27;re so cheap to run we&#x27;re planning on letting users opt in to running them proactively once they have enough data so we can provide exactly that experience. reply NavinF 14 hours agoparentprev>GPT and other LLMs don&#x27;t allow you to use their output to train competing modelsToS is unenforceable and irrelevant to anyone that&#x27;s in this space reply skybrian 9 hours agorootparentThat seems mostly right, particularly for internal models, but I wonder about adding some ringers to prove that copying happened:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trap_streetAlso, it seems sort of like how cryptocurrency folks assumed their transactions were anonymous?

That gets you faster responses and lower inference costs. A fine-tuned Llama 7B model is 50x cheaper than GPT-3.5 on a per-token basis, and for many use cases can produce results that are as good or better!These comparisons are reductive to the point of being misleading. Even with all the optimizations in the ecosystem, it&#x27;s not trivial to get a finetuned 7B param model running at an acceptable inference latency. Even if you use a GPU such as an A100 for maximum speed, then you have scalability issues since A100s are scarce. Also, the \"50% cheaper\" assumes 100% utilization of a GPU which will never happen in production use cases.Quality-wise, a finetuned Llama 2 is not necessairly better than ChatGPT. Finetuning requires a high-quality dataset which is not easy to construct. And in my own experience with finetuning Llama 2, qualitivately it caused more frustration to get outputs on par with just using ChatGPT.The value of the ChatGPT API is more dependable scaling and not having to pay for an infra. reply kcorbitt 16 hours agoparentWe&#x27;re finding that when running Llama-2-7B with vLLM (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vllm-project&#x2F;vllm) on an A40 GPU we&#x27;re getting consistently lower time-to-first-token and lower average token generation time than GPT-3.5, even when processing multiple requests in parallel. A40s are pretty easy to get your hands on these days (much easer than A100s anyway).The 50x cheaper (that&#x27;s 2% of the cost, not 50% of the cost) number does assume 100% GPU utilization, which may or may not be realistic for your use case. If you&#x27;re doing batch processing as part of a data pipeline, which is not an unusual use case, you can run your GPU at 100% utilization and turn it off when the batch finishes.If you&#x27;ve got a highly variable workload then you&#x27;re right, you&#x27;ll have much lower utilization numbers. But if you work with an aggregator that can quickly hot swap LoRA fine-tunes (as a disclaimer, my company OpenPipe works in this space) you can get back a lot of that lost efficiency since we can increase&#x2F;decrease GPU capacity only when our aggregate usage changes, which smooths things out. reply hereonout2 15 hours agoparentprevDoesn&#x27;t this depend a lot on your application though? Not every workload needs low latency and massive horizontal scalability.Take their example of running the llm over the 2 million recipes and saving $23k over GPT 4. That could easily be 2 million documents in some back end system running in a batch. Many people would wait a few days or weeks for a job like that to finish if it offered significant savings. reply minimaxir 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s more of a fair use case.It though also demonstrates why the economics are complicated and there&#x27;s no one-size-fits-all. reply moonchrome 16 hours agoparentprevWe are talking about 7B models ?

In real world scenario, we don&#x27;t get inputs queued up to millions and wait for the GPU to inference them continuously at 100% utilization.

If you&#x27;re doing pure classification then there are smaller encoder-only models like DeBERTa that might get you better performance with a much smaller model size (so cheaper inference).But if you need text generation and are ok with a 7B+ parameter model, Llama 2 or one of its derivatives is what I&#x27;d strongly recommend. The community around it is much larger than any of the alternatives so the tooling is better, and it&#x27;s either state of the art or close to it on all evals when compared to other similarly-sized open models.If you&#x27;re comfortable sharing more details of the task you&#x27;re trying to do I might be able to give more specific advice. reply loudmax 14 hours agoparentprevThe Huggingface Leaderboard is mostly dominated by Llama 2 variants: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;spaces&#x2F;HuggingFaceH4&#x2F;open_llm_leaderb...It depends a lot on what you&#x27;re trying to do.

They&#x27;re quite capable and I think lots of folks assume they need to jump to a 70B model when really a smaller one would work fine.That said, you should be able to fine-tune a 70B model on an A100 using QLoRA. However, depending on the specifics of your dataset it might actually be cheaper to run on an 8xA100 machine since that way you don&#x27;t have to swap any weights out to the machine&#x27;s non-GPU memory, and you might get enough time savings from that that the more expensive machine pays for itself. reply indeyets 15 hours agorootparentThe plan was to do it in-house.

Like chatgpt knows quarkus 2 but not quarkus 3 reply kcorbitt 15 hours agoparent> What makes sense to fine-tune and what not?In general, fine-tuning helps a model figure out how to do the exact task that is being done in the examples it&#x27;s given. So fine-tuning it on 1000 examples of an API being used in the wild is likely to teach it to use that API really effectively, but fine-tuning it on just the API docs probably won&#x27;t.That said, there are a lot of interesting ideas floating around on how to most effectively teach a model purely from instructions like API docs. Powerful models like GPT-4 can figure it out from in-context learning (ie. if you paste in a page of API docs and ask GPT-4 to write something with the API it can usually do a decent job). I suspect the community will figure out techniques either through new training objectives or synthetic training data to do it for smaller fine-tuned models as well. reply Arctic_fly 15 hours agoparentprevGenerally speaking, fine-tuning a small model makes sense when the task that you want it to carry out is well-defined and doesn&#x27;t vary too much from one prompt to another. Fine-tuning facts into a model doesn&#x27;t seem to scale super well, but general textual style, output format, and evaluation criteria for example can all be instilled through the fine-tuning process. I would use lookup if you need your answers to include a wide array of information that the model you&#x27;re basing off of wasn&#x27;t initially trained on. reply carom 9 hours agoprevWhat are your thoughts on fine tuning vs low rank adaptations? reply idosh 14 hours agoprevCan you elaborate on your plans for OpenPipe?

Models hosted on OpenPipe enjoy a few benefits, like data drift detection and automatic reformatting of output to match the original model you trained against (think extraction \"function call\" responses from a purely textual Llama 2 response) through the sdk.Longer-term, we&#x27;d love to expand the selection of base models to include specialized LLMs that are particularly good at a certain task, e.g. language translation, and let you train off of those as well.

Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. The display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle. When measured as a standard rectangular shape, the screen is 6.06 inches (iPhone 15) or 6.68 inches (iPhone 15 Plus) diagonally. The actual viewable area is smaller. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are splash-, water-, and dust-resistant. They were tested under controlled laboratory conditions, and have a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions. Resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage is not covered under warranty. Crash Detection is designed for four-wheel passenger vehicle crashes with certain mass, G-force, and speed profiles consistent with severe, life-threatening crashes. It was designed for severe, life-threatening, high-impact front and rear collisions, sideswipe, T-bone, and rollover crashes. Crash Detection is available worldwide on iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and Apple Watch SE (2nd generation). Emergency SOS via satellite and Find My via satellite are currently available in 14 countries and regions, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, the U.K., and the U.S., and will be available in Spain and Switzerland later this month. Emergency SOS via satellite and Roadside Assistance via satellite were designed for use in open spaces with a clear line of sight to the sky. Performance may be impacted by obstructions such as trees or surrounding buildings. Roadside Assistance via satellite is launching in the U.S. with AAA and is included for free for two years starting at the time of activation of a new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max. This satellite service requires iOS 17. AAA may charge for roadside assistance services. iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 users who are not AAA members can take advantage of Roadside Assistance via satellite on a pay-per-use basis for AAA’s roadside assistance services. iPhone 15 supports 4K at 60 fps HDR video output using a USB‑C Digital AV Multiport Adapter to allow users to connect to an HDMI display, while also connecting a standard USB device and a USB‑C charging cable. Precision Finding for Find My friends requires Ultra Wideband and isn't available in all countries or regions. With iOS 17, Precision Finding will be available to Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users to help them locate their iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Later this fall, iPhone 15 users will be able to use Precision Finding for Find My friends to locate friends and family wearing Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.

Will have to buy more USB-C cables, though. (Technically the low highest end phone is higher, but higher spec, too).It comes with one USB-C to USB-C charging cable - not sure if it is a data cable, also.Pre-order Friday, delivery 22 Sept. Probably going to move on it just to get that USB-C, need to see what carrier deals I can find. reply fieldcny 6 hours agoparentThis is honestly the saddest thing I’ve read in years, maybe even decades.Tech is such an shitty abyss right now, ten years ago people got excited because of truly revolutionary features , like cameras that were better than $1000 digital cameras, 4G that made the internet not just usable but fast biometrics that actually worked, on a phone, in your pocket, like holy fuck that was mind blowing.We’ve gone so far down the hole that you are like fuck it I’m gonna buy it because of the god damn charging cable, and it’s not even something like the charging cable is crazy awesome and charges your phone instantly, it’s that it’s now just the generic port that everything from moms vibrator to your laptop to every other god damn phone on the planet uses.And this absurdly mundane and completely valueless “update” has moved you to take a perfectly good $1000 plus phone and junk it to buy a brand new $1000+ phone, just so it can share a charging cord with a used vibrator?!?!And this, this is the best that one of the most innovative companies in a generation, which generated profits that make the rockefellers and gettys look poor, can do.No wonder everyone’s so in love with chat GPT, we are awed by our absolutely stunning mediocrity. reply Keirmot 5 hours agorootparentI fail to understand your point. What kind of feature do you to be excited to see in a product that is 16 years old?Do you think the and thing when you buy a new dishwasher, a couch, a chair? That it’s mediocre?Smartphones are not the future anymore, there’s people starting university soon that always had one, and never lived in a world without the iPhone.Also, besides arguably the first few iPhones, Apple never distinguished itself from the competition with the technology it uses, but by the quality of its offering, which is why bending phones or poorly designed antennas are more important for them than having the newest tech available half a second after being commercially viable - that’s what Android OEMs do to differentiate.I know that for me, personally, having a new iPhone with USB-C is a must have feature, which is why I have my iPhone 11 still chumming along. reply onion2k 3 hours agorootparentDo you think the and thing when you buy a new dishwasher, a couch, a chair? That it’s mediocre?Those are things that you replace every 5 to 10 years. People do see innovation with those products because they only look at new ones occasionally.If people have the same expectations of their iPhone, and they get off the upgrade treadmill of a new phone every 2 years and start buying every 5 years that would mean Apple&#x27;s iPhone sales would drop by roughly a half among the core group who buy every new model. That would have a very significant impact on their share price. reply rusticpenn 3 hours agorootparentI am going to upgrade my phone after 8 years, and expect to do the same again. reply camillomiller 3 hours agorootparentprevLOL it would not. People buy iPhones on average every three year. The yearly upgraders are just a vocal minority. I’ve had moderately tech savvy people move from an iPhone X to an iPhone 14 and literally describe the jump as “mindblowing”. All is relative, but HN users on average want absolutes, and repeatedly fail to understand how they’re part of a mostly irrelevant opinion bubble when it comes to being relevant as average consumers. reply idkwhoiam 2 hours agorootparentHmm I wonder what was so \"mindblowing\" for them. I went from 6s plus to 13 pro and didn&#x27;t notice a difference other than battery life & speed. reply camillomiller 2 hours agorootparentHave you even tried taking a picture and looking at it? :D reply squeaky-clean 4 hours agorootparentprev> What kind of feature do you to be excited to see in a product that is 16 years old?The ability for it to replace a macbook air if you add a keyboard&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;screen for one. How about a 3d camera for integration with vision pro? There&#x27;s still so much they can do.Even the previous iPhone had lots of great actual new features. Always-on OLED display.

Your eyes are on average 6.3cm apart and these cameras on your phone appear to be about 1.5cm…I don’t believe software can bridge that gap so I suspect it’ll look very strange when viewed in 3D… reply tommit 3 hours agorootparentprevKeep in mind that you&#x27;re commenting in the thread about the iPhone 15, not the iPhone 15 Pro. With your comment you&#x27;re comparing the new iPhone 15 with the features of last year&#x27;s iPhone 14 Pro. The Pro features are always more extensive, just as this year&#x27;s. The following year, most of those features typically trickle down to the non-Pro iPhone. reply lostlogin 4 hours agorootparentprevThis isn’t a change in pace though is it?The iPhone has had a tick tock cadence forever. reply camillomiller 2 hours agorootparentprevUsing your smartphone as your computer is one of the most “tested as a consumer failure in the market” features ever. Many have tried, all failed miserably. Convergence is cool on paper until nobody uses it because it makes no practical sense. Useful to give great tradeshow demos, and that’s it reply rsynnott 16 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure about the current distinction between iOS and iPadOS (Apple seems to periodically decide that these are the same things or different things depending on mood), but plug a mouse, keyboard and monitor into a modern iPad and you have... a surprisingly okay desktop for many use cases. reply ClumsyPilot 56 minutes agorootparentprevThis is like saying that nuclear fusion is useless, because all reactors have been a failure.Just becauae you cant get it to work well, does not mean you can blame the consumer. reply misja111 2 hours agorootparentprev> What kind of feature do you to be excited to see in a product that is 16 years old?A battery that lasts longer than a day. reply Oreb 2 hours agorootparentThe battery in my two years old 13 Pro Max already lasts two days with normal use. I expect the new phones (at least the big ones) to last even longer. reply runjake 4 hours agorootparentprev> What kind of feature do you to be excited to see in a product that is 16 years old?Satellite communications.A 48 megapixel camera with ever improving computational photography. reply bayindirh 4 hours agorootparentCurrent 12MP cameras are actually 48MP sensors, which use pixel binning for better color and noise. You’re bound by physics here, not corporations.I didn’t check recent sensors, but 24MP ones would be 96MP with binning. Sony makes multi-mode sensors which can produce different sized outputs to optimize details and image quality for a given light amount.Computational photography is like artificial flavoring. It looks fine, but lacks the finesse of a big sensor. Also, “dreaming” things in photography is a no go in some contexts.Also, I think some iPhone models have emergency satellite communications already, no? reply thepostman0 3 hours agorootparentprevThey did say huge leap forward in the article. reply SkiFire13 3 hours agorootparentprev> which is why bending phones or poorly designed antennas are more important for themI see what you did there reply globular-toast 56 minutes agorootparentprevI buy a new dishwasher when the old one has broken beyond repair. I certainly don&#x27;t buy a new one following the latest BoschCon where they theatrically announce they are using the British Standard plug for power delivery now. reply typon 1 hour agorootparentprevWhen is the last time you watched a Keynote by GE CEO announcing a new dishwasher? The point is that they are pretending like its some sort of revolutionary new product instead of a run-of-the-mill minor cosmetic upgrade reply barrkel 55 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never seen a camera in a phone better than a $500 camera, never mind $1000.They are way more useful (portable, always present) and do lots of cool processing to get usable images in low light etc., but image quality is not competitive with a good lens on even an ancient DSLR. Shallow depth of field in particular - phones generally do it with software, and it&#x27;s always jarring how fake it looks. reply bluescrn 12 minutes agorootparentprevAt this point it&#x27;s the degradation of the non-user-replaceable battery that&#x27;s driving upgrades.Having to get a phone to an Apple store, let alone mail it in for a &#x27;battery service&#x27; and have no phone for a few days, is a surprisingly big obstacle to just replacing the battery and keeping an older phone running for another few years. reply m4rtink 5 minutes agorootparentNot to mention lack of software updates for many otherwise perfectly fine Android phones + lack of drivers&#x2F;specs&#x2F;image signing&#x2F;locked bootloaders making it hard for community to take over. reply bluescrn 1 minute agorootparentYeah, my last Android experience was a Pixel C tablet which was abandoned by Google with broken GPU drivers (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issuetracker.google.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;71522801?pli=1)(Not a hardware problem, older OS versions had been OK, and I eventually got it working with LineageOS for a while) jve 1 hour agorootparentprevThey had to comply with EU regulations, thus forced to make USB-C: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2022&#x2F;jun&#x2F;07&#x2F;all-smart... reply KingMob 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s a little ironic they tout how they&#x27;re moving to the USB-C standard when they had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to it. reply ClumsyPilot 46 minutes agorootparentby evil, inefficient and corrupt beurocrats, no less! oh the humanity! reply kakadu 1 hour agorootparentprev> This is honestly the saddest thing I’ve read in years, maybe even decades.You must live in quite an interesting world then.The fact that people are running to a megacorp&#x27;s aid because a bad EU forced them to quit being anti-consumer is staggering.So staggering in fact, that these commentators might not even comment in good faith and in fact be PR pawns.I&#x27;d really want to believe the latter because someone that gets so intimate with their phone brings out a sadness in me. reply coldtea 54 minutes agorootparentprev>Tech is such an shitty abyss right now, ten years ago people got excited because of truly revolutionary features , like cameras that were better than $1000 digital cameras, 4G that made the internet not just usable but fast biometrics that actually worked, on a phone, in your pocket, like holy fuck that was mind blowing.I also remember when the WWDC crowd and the buying public got excited for mundane evolutionary shit, like incremental iPod updates, like the introduction of an rudimentary color screen... reply kranke155 32 minutes agorootparentprevThe idea that computerised phone upgrades are a metric for the progress of our society (instead of I dunno, reducing hunger and suffering in the world) is revealingWhat else do you really want from this technology ? reply pflenker 2 hours agorootparentprevYour recollection of the past might be skewed. Approximately 10 years ago we also celebrated cables - the switch from the 30 pin cable to lightning.

I know that’s sort of possible in some places, but it isn’t where I live as many of the Apps necessary to interact with society require a smartphone.I’n sure the blame for this belongs more on the app makers than the device manufacturers, but I think it’s still an answer to what your asking. reply chipsa 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is: how well can you interact with a phone the size of a watch? I mean, for some things, yeah, it works fine. But other things? There&#x27;s a reason why phones have been getting larger (no iPhone Minis anymore). Even Android side, expect Google to always assume there&#x27;s a companion phone available, because the interface for adding in info will continue to be terrible, simply due to form factor constraints. reply rickdeckard 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think there is a blame to put on app-makers. The Apple Watch is a companion-product by design.Apple&#x27;s target-group for the Watch is every iPhone user, they know that with patience they can sell an Apple Watch to every iPhone user out there.So there&#x27;s little incentive for Apple to create a Watch that doesn&#x27;t require an iPhone, and little reason for app-developers to assume you own a Watch but NO iPhone... reply gvurrdon 17 minutes agorootparentI agree. The Apple Watch is very useful, but I&#x27;m not happy about having to buy an iPhone to go with it. With luck the Pixel watches might become good enough to replace it. reply achow 2 hours agorootparentprevTo add fuel to your fire: This USB C does not even support fast charge, it is same as last year&#x27;s 20W, whereas now some phones (if not vibrators) claim to support 100W fast charging over USB-C. reply enumjorge 2 hours agorootparentprevThe funny thing is the reason Apple is switching to usb c is that they were forced to by EU regulators. reply whywhywhywhy 4 hours agorootparentprevImagine how the timeline feels where Apple wasn&#x27;t forced to change the port. reply worthless-trash 4 hours agorootparentExactly like this, just with a lightning port.. weee reply chris222 4 hours agorootparentprevThe new system on a chip is an insane innovation but it’s “under the hood”. reply eklitzke 4 hours agorootparent10% faster P cores, E cores are the same speed. Some updates to the neural core thing that no one cares about. How is that insane? reply rsynnott 13 minutes agorootparentProbably best to reserve judgement until independent benchmarks come out, but the new GPU cores _may_ be quite a big deal. The GPU core used in the last few gens of iPhone chip (and the M1&#x2F;M2) is now quite old, and was actually supposed to be replaced last year. This one should be expected to be a significant leap forward (though, again, don&#x27;t believe Apple on this, wait for independent tests). reply liprais 3 hours agorootparentprevhow about ray tracing and playing RE 4 on your phone ? reply trompetenaccoun 2 hours agorootparentHow large is the overlap between people who care a lot about playing games on their phones and those who can afford buying the latest $1000 smartphone every once in a while? Because I&#x27;d think the former are mostly teenagers. reply liprais 1 hour agorootparentI guess by games you mean console games,mobile games are huge now. I have a steam deck and bought all nintendo and sony portables in the past,would be great if I can play some on my iPhone,which is always available to me. reply geon 2 hours agorootparentprevResident Evil 4, from 2005? reply ubercow13 2 hours agorootparentNo, Resident Evil 4 from 2023. reply3cats-in-a-coat 4 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re working overtime to figure out reasons to be aggravated by literally nothing. You want \"innovation\"? Then be wowed by Vision Pro&#x27;s lenticular display, sensor fusion, low latency and high resolution and what not.We care about phone charging cables because smartphones are no longer the toys we got wowed by 15 years ago. They&#x27;re now an indispensable and highly functional tools we use every day to do actual work. And guess what? We charge them every day.If you want to experience child-like wonder and be wowed by big movements, move into a field that&#x27;s developing. Smartphones are a developed field, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.Also, iPhone & iPhone Pro are offering some really decent upgrades. 48MP camera (that actually works, and not just says \"48MP\" like many others) prism optical zoom-in 5x and so on. Lightweight titanium is also a good improvement in day to day usability and comfort.And this \"charging cable\" for iPhone Pro also offers 10x faster data transfer which matters to many of us. reply komali2 5 hours agorootparentprevMakes me think of the Foundation series, and the late stage of the Galactic Empire, when science and culture both were stagnated.Cool new iphone feature: USBC!Cool new movie: It has Ironman and Spiderman in it! reply piyush_soni 3 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s funny how they show USB-C as a giant leap forward while they were literally forced to use that port and were never interested in doing it otherwise. All that transfer speed bump they&#x27;re now advertising with USB-C, would they admit that they were keeping their customers away from it just so that they could use their custom port and create an entire accessory ecosystem around it? reply rollcat 1 hour agorootparentLightning was a very good connector when it first came around. Ever notice how the phones are showcased standing up on just the connector? Try that with micro USB.Apple co-invented&#x2F;contributed to USB-C to address their own needs, and were the first vendor to shove it down on unsuspecting Macbook users, getting rid of each and every single other kind of port.Meanwhile they kept Lightning relevant and useful for a very long time, which I think is a good thing for a \"de facto\" standard. Should they have switched to USB-C earlier? Probably yes. But now is better than never (even if it&#x27;s somewhat forced). reply scns 2 hours agorootparentprevApple where always good at lying err scratch that marketing i meant, snark fully intended.

Use case (beyond charging) to have them right in the box is that they can be used to transfer data from a previous Mac to a new one upon setup (heir to the good old \"target mode\" that used to turn a Mac into a USB mass storage device), or for T2&#x2F;Apple Silicon to debrick the device by entering DFU mode.Just got a fourth (shorter, different from MacBooks) one with my new iPad, it has data too, which I just used yesterday to restore the encrypted local backup from my previous iPad and perform a new local backup.

And that&#x27;s fundamentally disappointing - fanboy wars should not be the basis for governmental policy and regulation. reply md_ 56 minutes agorootparentIn the shadow of encroaching regulatory despotism, the luminous innovation of the iPhone was threatened with bureaucratic shackles by the European Union. The relentless march of progress was halted, as the central planners decreed that every charging port must bow before the altar of uniformity. No longer could Apple&#x27;s vision for a sleek and efficient Lightning connector reign supreme; instead, the heavy hand of Brussels demanded compliance with the USB-C standard. The champions of individualism and choice saw their liberty erode, replaced by the stifling straitjacket of conformity. The spirit of innovation, once ignited by the entrepreneurial genius of Silicon Valley, flickered in the face of such top-down directives, leaving a world dimmed by uniformity, where the art of technological diversity was sacrificed at the altar of bureaucratic convenience.Or, like, you know...it&#x27;s just a charging cable. reply coldtea 4 hours agorootparentprev>Glorifying government intervention into market economics (and forcing a changeover of an entire ecosystem of hardware, producing innumerable e-waste) seems like an odd take for HN&#x27;s libertarian culture.Not everybody is libertarian here, many are pragmatic, and are not dogmatic when a regulation is good.For example, we also don&#x27;t lament how there are standards in power plugs, and we don&#x27;t have to juggle with 20 competing power outlets from different companies in our own country for the benefit of the \"free market\", nor are naive enough to believe that the better one would just have \"won\".

I joined Apple after they acquired our company, and our product required a three-button mouse. They wanted to show their acquisition off immediately at a trade show, but the fact that we brought proper third-party mice to our demo stations set off a minor storm of consternation and knitted brows among management. There was little they could do, however, and we ran the show with Logitech mice.In classic Apple style, when they finally capitulated and added secondary buttons to their mice, they hid them. Actually, that was the second stupid move. The first was making the entire mouse body the button... so you couldn&#x27;t keep the \"button\" pressed and then scroll, lift, scroll some more (because when you lifted the mouse, the button was released). So Apple&#x27;s workaround wasn&#x27;t to fix that stupid design, but rather to add little \"wings\" on the sides of the mouse that you could pinch with two fingers while somehow keeping the mouse mashed down with other fingers, in order to do multi-swipe scrolling.The \"Magic\" mouse was an attempt to one-up legit mice by adding a touchpad to the back of the mouse... which you were somehow supposed to swipe sideways across with some fingers, while using other fingers to hold the mouse in place. It&#x27;s just so gallingly dumb. There&#x27;s not much else to say.Oh... except the one where the charging wire goes into the BOTTOM of the mouse! I mean... you can&#x27;t make this stuff up.

I&#x27;m unclear on how Apple was able to choose Lightning instead of USB-C given that timeline. reply acdha 6 hours agorootparentprevI agree that proprietary connectors are problematic but consider that Apple started selling Lightning devices almost 3 years before the first USB-C phone shipped. They couldn’t have chosen USB-C before it existed - and the industry accelerated that process due to how much better Lightning was than the older USB designs – but by the time USB-C was standardized and shipped, Apple had somewhere north of 300 million devices with Lightning connectors to support. reply SirMaster 15 hours agoparentprevI understand why they did it.But just my perspective on it, I will have to replace all my lightning cables with usb-c, and the usb-c ecosystem seems like a nightmare to me from what I have seen.This would be my first usb-c device. reply faeriechangling 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s overblown how much of a nightmare USB-C is. Yes there are many problems with the ecosystem, but it&#x27;s still really not as bad as using both lightning and USB-C like Apple does, nor is it as bad as micro-usb.At my desk I have a laptop, keyboard, and mouse which typically all typically get charged off a single thunderbolt 4 cable. You can have anything from games controllers to bicycle lights to remote controls sharing a single charger. No need to fuss with adapters, or having a rats nest of different cables, or charge-only cables with microusb&#x2F;usb-c&#x2F;lightning at the end. C to C cables are also very nice since they allow phones and usb-c only laptops to charge any other USB-C device, and you can&#x27;t accidentally flip them around the wrong way.The technology itself is great. It&#x27;s the flawed implementations, the lack of standards enforcement, the confusing labelling of different types of cables, and the very gradual and slow death of lightning&#x2F;micro-usb&#x2F;USB-A that&#x27;s really holds things back.

They&#x27;ve been burned enough by the bad cable and are just savvy enough to know there is a made-for-iphone program of \"approved\" lightning cables that actually conform to standards- 5% of people buy OEM first-party cables from Apple...Now you will see:- 70% of people buying the absolute cheapest usb-c conforming cable they can find on amazon (which is not \"really\" usb-c but the plug fits so who cares). They will buy them in 3 packs, use them until they fray or catch fire and then throw it out and use the next one- 20% of people will buy the cheapest certified usb-c cable they can find on amazon because they are just tech savvy enough to know there is a difference and that its worth finding a good one. But this cable will likely only be usb 2 speeds.- 5% of people will buy a premium usb-c cable with usb 3 speeds for 10Gbs transfer because they actually use and care about it....As you can see, on the low end nothing changes. Most people will still buy the absolute cheapest cable they can find and have no idea what they are buying or care that there is a difference. These people will still benefit from being able to use the same cable for everything because it fits in the hole and thats all they care or understand.But at least now there are more options and power available to the tiny percent of the population that actually does care and understand the difference.All in all, its only upsides. Everybody wins. The only real downside is throwing out whatever collection of lightning cables you might already have.Remember that as cool as transfer speeds sound, almost nobody transfers stuff using a cable off their iPhone. 99% of people will airdrop a few photos off, download music from spotify&#x2F;apple music, and stream or maybe download from netflix or disney plus for offline viewing. But really VERY VERY VERY few people are transferring using the cable. For the people that do, they are probably transferring huge video files they recorded off their device and they will know to get a good quality usb 3 compatible usb-c cable. But thats like 1 out of 100 people, if that. reply Dylan16807 10 hours agorootparentprevWhile there are different kinds of USB-C cable, they all support at least as much as a lightning cable.

And only a few of my devices are still USB-A, so I imagine I’ll be all C soon enough (probably just in time for USB-D or something else). reply tpmoney 9 hours agorootparentUSB C devices are supposed to have resistors on the CC pins to help negotiate power delivery with the port supplying power and to allow detection of pin orientation[1]. But to save a few pennies (or because no one read the USB C specs), many cheap devices don&#x27;t have these resistors and USB-C chargers that implement PD are almost certainly configured to not supply any voltage at the VBUS pins until a connection is actually detected. As a result these devices won&#x27;t charge from a spec compliant USB C charger. Cheap chargers on the other hand may be nothing more than a basic 5V 1A USB A charger with a C port instead and happily supply power on the pins regardless of the CC pin status. Likewise A-to-C cables would do the same thing, since A chargers just supply 5V continuously without any negotiation.[1]:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ww1.microchip.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;en&#x2F;AppNotes&#x2F;00001914B.pd... reply JohnBooty 12 hours agorootparentprevFor phone users who only want to charge their phones, it&#x27;s fine.

Both with branded Apple cables and third party ones. I seemed to notice lighting users having more dead cables than USB-C users seemed to, and it seems to me that lightning cables more frequently omit robust strain relief for aesthetic reasons.The most frequent tendency I notice among people who have their cables fray is they use their phones while charging, but if you do certain things on your phone like long gaming sessions, you are almost forced to use your phone while it charges. So blaming the user feels a little bit like \"you&#x27;re holding it wrong\" to me.Where I did notice a difference between USB-C and lightning is that the lightning PORT seemed more durable than USB-C ports. I own multiple phones with flaky USB-C ports, whereas lighting ports seem much more durable. reply alexdbird 6 hours agorootparentI suspect they&#x27;re more durable too. We&#x27;re about to find out, I suppose. reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, it&#x27;s actually Apple cables that break pretty easily.

I&#x27;ve never killed a lightning cable myself, and only ever seen someone else (my own mother) do it once -- and it wasn&#x27;t the connector that broke, it was the cable at the strain relief. Hell, the cable still actually worked, but I was uncomfortable with the state of the cable and bought her a new one.When I was doing Android phones, I was going through a new Micro USB cable about every month or two. Never long enough to fray the cable itself, it was always the connector flaking out and refusing to make a good enough connection to charge reliably.Good riddance to Micro USB. reply JohnBooty 12 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely not a Lightning-specific thing.Flimsy cables are flimsy cables and they will break and fray.

Even when I am going out and extending the night until dawn, I usually have battery left until I go to bed. reply bondant 15 hours agorootparentprevBut if you know you won&#x27;t need to charge them simultaneously, then you can only carry one cable.For instance, I&#x27;m happy that my new laptop can charge on usb-c, so now I don&#x27;t need you bring a charger for my switch and a different one for my laptop. I just take the smallest one and charge my laptop and switch with it (but not at the same time). I&#x27;m happy to know that I will be able to ditch the lightning cable for my next apple smartphone and only keep a single cable for my three devices. reply the_other 14 hours agoparentprev> It comes with one USB-C to USB-C charging cable - not sure if it is a data cable, also.This is why USB-C is a user-hostile spec. reply crote 10 hours agorootparentNo, it is not. According to the spec, all C-C cables transfer data, even if only at USB 2.0 speeds. It is not the spec&#x27;s fault that some cheap knockoff brands violate the spec to save a few pennies. reply _jal 9 hours agorootparent> It is not the spec&#x27;s fault that some cheap knockoff brands violate the spec to save a few penniesYes it is.The spec could have been written such that different capabilities were reflected with different physical characteristics. That is exactly what standards exist to do.Even if we pretend spec writers wouldn&#x27;t ever have predicted the proliferation of crappy cables before publishing it, this is not a new problem with USB.It is absolutely a choice made by the USB Implementers Forum. reply CrazyStat 9 hours agorootparent> The spec could have been written such that different capabilities were reflected with different physical characteristics.And the cheap knockoff brands would have just violated the spec written that way like they violate the current spec. reply OJFord 8 hours agorootparentI suppose hypothetically you could have data capability built in to the power negotiation pairs, so that it wasn&#x27;t possible to offer charging without also some amount of data... but quite some complexity to add as a trade-off, not an obvious choice. reply chipsa 2 hours agorootparentConveniently, that&#x27;s actually the case. A USB-C port should provide no power if there&#x27;s nothing plugged in, and that&#x27;s sensed by the data connection pairs. However, to support A-C adapters, you can fake it through the normal connection there.This is why some things that have a C port won&#x27;t charge on a C-C cable, but will on a A-C cable, because they don&#x27;t actually talk to say they need power, but the A port will provide some power regardless, but a C port won&#x27;t. reply _jal 8 hours agorootparentprevMissing the point.Power-only cables should be specified to have a different connector. Vastly different speeds should have a different connector. It should be physically impossible to stick the wrong kind of cable in. reply brianpan 7 hours agorootparentI think you might be missing the point. Power and data in the same cable is a huge advantage of USB-C (both Apple connectors had power and data in the same cable).Third parties will make out-of-spec cables no matter what. Some of the ways that Apple has addressed this is the \"Made for\" program which goes back even to the iPod. And the devices themselves detecting and showing an \"Accessory may not be supported\" error message, again going back to the iPod. reply ninkendo 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is no spec for power-only USB-C cables. Anyone making one is doing so against the spec. You can’t use a spec to solve the problem of going against the spec. reply cchance 7 hours agorootparentprevThat ... wouldn&#x27;t be USB lol, if every version has a different connector it&#x27;s not... universal lol reply kalleboo 3 hours agorootparentprevSo now my phone needs 4 different ports on it for all the different capabilities it has? reply fomine3 9 hours agorootparentprevThey just ignore spec reply odensc 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not an issue specific to USB-C. There are also plenty of USB-A&#x2F;Micro-USB cables that don&#x27;t have the data pins connected. Typically this is only an issue with super cheap electronics that only use USB-C as a connector for power and don&#x27;t really follow the spec.I haven&#x27;t heard of a phone coming with a charge-only cable. Especially because that cable is usually used for syncing to a computer (iOS)&#x2F;transferring data from an old phone (Android). reply riskable 12 hours agorootparentEven \"power\" USB C cables can do data transfer. They just do so at USB 2.0 speeds (like a lightning connector would).Finding a truly power-only USB C cable is difficult but not impossible.

Obviously those that aren&#x27;t certified will say they are certified, so if there&#x27;s like a database of USB-C certifications somewhere that would be super helpful (particularly if it includes all the misc. stuff about USB-C that fall through the cracks like data rate, PD, supported voltages, etc.). reply nrp 5 hours agorootparentYes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usb.org&#x2F;products reply notatoad 7 hours agorootparentprevread the reviews? if a cable doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;ll get flagged pretty damn quickly. i&#x27;ve bought plenty of dirt cheap USB-C cables off amazon and they&#x27;ve all worked fine.you might get a charge-only cable bundled with some sketchy usb-c accessory. if you do, throw it out. but any standalone cable sold as a cable will do data transfer. the USB-C cables that only carry power and not data is an imaginary problem. reply bick_nyers 6 hours agorootparentDidn&#x27;t mean to give the impression that I&#x27;m worried about USB-C cables that are power only, that is indeed an imaginary problem.It&#x27;s moreso things like PD, is it 480Mbits or is it 5Gbit or is it 10 or 20 or 40.

    "originBody": "Home Memberships Archive Author Credit card debt collection Patrick McKenzie (patio11) • Aug 11th, 2023 One interesting lens for understanding how industries work is looking at their waste streams. Every industry will by nature have both a stock and a flow of byproducts from their core processes. This waste has to be dealt with (or it will, figuratively or literally, clog the pipes of the industry) and frequently has substantial residual value. Most industries develop ecosystems in miniature to collect, sift through, recycle, and dispose of their waste. These are often cobbled together from lower-scale businesses than the industry themselves, involve a lot of dirty work, and are considered low status. Few people grow up wanting to specialize in e.g. sales of used manufacturing equipment. One core waste stream of the finance industry is charged-off consumer debt. Debt collection is a fascinating (and frequently depressing) underbelly of finance. It shines a bit of light on credit card issuance itself, and richly earns the wading-through-a-river-of-effluvia metaphor. A disclaimer: I have had substantially more at-bats with debt collectors than most people, as a result of an old hobby of writing letters on behalf of debtors to their lenders and non-affiliated debt collectors. I did this over the Internet, on my own volition, because it seemed pro-social and I was extremely underused by my actual job at the time. This experience leaves me with strong opinions on the debt collection industry; a frequent archetypical person in need of a letter was a Kansan grandmother in diminished financial circumstances who had been harassed for months. I’m going to try to keep these views to a dull roar here, in the spirit of spending more mental energy on discussing why the system presents as so broken. The lifecycle of a defaulted debt The majority of debt which defaults in the United States is revolving credit card debt. (Without addressing the politics of it, the impression among many informed people that most defaulted debt is medically-related is the result of successful advocacy work rather than being substantially based in reality. Trustworthy numbers are not hard to come by, due to a combination of regulatory supervision and the U.S.’s almost unique degree of population-wide debt surveillance via credit reporting agencies. We’ll return to credit reporting some other day.) Assume I’m talking about credit card debt below, though the mechanics for medical debt bear overwhelming similarity. (I’d address it specifically except that healthcare economics is a fractally complex topic once you bring e.g. insurers, public programs, and the like into the mix.) Credit card issues bucket users into various archetypes, personas, and predicted lifecycles, because behavior is extremely heterogeneous and this is important from both a marketing and risk management perspective. Most users of credit cards, probably including readers of this column, believe they are the typical user of credit cards; no bucket is typical. If I were to make some informed guesses, relative to the population-wide distribution, you, reader, use credit cards in preference to debit cards as a payment instrument, do not routinely revolve balances, and hold some combination of student loan, auto, and mortgage debt which dwarfs your credit card debt. And so it is critical to understand that most defaulting credit card debt is not held by people who act like you. Most credit card debt which defaults non-fraudulently was incurred in the relatively distant past. Credit cards are revolving accounts; one’s balance can increase (even as one successfully makes payments) for years as one pays off a portion of prior balances but continues purchasing with the card. This is normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly, much like never carrying a balance is also normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly. A small percentage of borrowers, carefully tracked and generally oscillating between 2.5% and 5% depending on the overall health of the economy, will go delinquent on credit card debt. (Some issuers specialize in certain parts of the credit spectrum and, as a result, will have sharply lower or sharply higher delinquency rates. American Express, for example, specializes at the high end and typically has delinquency close to 1%. Capital One made its name in so-called subprime credit cards, though it has diversified since, and typically tends towards the high end among banks whose names you know. There is a largely hidden ecosystem of banks you don’t know that issue very expensive products to poor people; you can accurately predict their default rates exceed anything mentioned above.) Default typically begins by missing (or underpaying) a scheduled payment. That in itself is a theoretical breach of contract but not very outside the ordinary for a card issuer; they will generally automatically assess a fee but take very little action. Most borrowers will recover before they are 30 days late, which is the point at which most issuers start to treat an account as being a credit risk rather than a minor operational issue. After 30 days, issuers will typically work the account internally, using a combination of communication methods to nudge the user into payment, until one of a few things happens. The happiest is the customer gets current on their account. An outright refusal to pay is substantially less likely, and can result in an issuer moving up timelines. But the most common is that the borrower ghosts the issuer for a few months. Consumer debt issuance is generally, by law, an exclusive privilege of regulated financial institutions. (The other big one is taking deposits.) Society wants many things from regulated financial institutions; one of those things is having accurate books, because stealth losses cause financial institutions to fail and frequently leave society holding the bag. As a result, the Federal Reserve has a Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy. This tail wags the dog. Many decisions about account servicing, which a naive conception of debt might assume are between borrower and lender, are done with the goal of aligning servicing to accounting standards. In this way, the books impose their will on reality, and where the books and reality differ, reality frequently adjusts itself to accommodate the books. (As my buddy Kevin frequently muses, states are gonna see. Organizations which are tightly tied to the state, like regulated financial institutions, will develop a vocabulary and processes for seeing like the state sees, and that edifice tends to capture non-state methods of seeing that they run in parallel.) In particular, credit classification requires that financial institutions “charge off” delinquent debt. Mechanically, they have previously accumulated an allowance for delinquency on their books as a liability; they move a bit of that allowance to a bad debt expense. In principle, nothing has to happen to the actual debt. In practice, financial regulators encourage institutions to seek certainty and finality around this. Financial institutions achieve certainty and finality by packaging portfolios of bad debt together and selling them to non-financial institutions. This durably moves them off of the books and realizes a very, very small residual value. The debt collection industry There are essentially two halves of the debt collection industry. A portion of it works on an agency model: a lender can have e.g. a law firm or similar work a debt on its behalf during the several month period where the delinquent debt lingers on their books, in return for a performance fee (often 15-30% of face value) should the borrower make good on the debt. But debts, much like people, only age in one direction. Unlike people, debts universally decline in value as they age. We’ll return to that topic in a moment. Most debt which is not being serviced successfully by the first party lenders will not long be worked by their agents. It is instead sold to debt buyers, who will then attempt to collect the contracted amount (plus fees provided for in the contract, which are legally legitimate, and not infrequently fees which were not provided in the contract, which are frequently extremely questionable). Subtract the original cost of buying the portfolio and their substantial operational costs and the remainder is profit. Most defaults are small. This fact drives everything about debt collection; it has to be done scalably, by the cheapest labor available, with a minimum of customization or thoughtful weighing of competing interests. The average defaulted credit card debt is on the order of $2,000, the median is between $500 and $1,000. These are processed like McDonalds burgers, not like grant proposals. Debts are sold as part of a portfolio, where (typically) thousands of relatively similarly situated debts in a cohort are sold as a packet. The value of portfolios is a huge discount to the face value of the debts; at the point where a lender has only worked it themselves and the debt is a few months delinquent, portfolios generally fetch about 5 cents on the dollar. That value will continue to decay over time. There is an entire ecosystem of brokers supporting contractual infrastructure to convey these debts to buyers and insulate the issuing financial institutions from the actions of the debt buyers. Partly, that is due to regulatory risk. (Particularly in recent years, regulators have begun using prudential regulation of financial institutions to strongly suggest that financial institutions adopt their social goals. There is a tortured argument by which a debt collector being unsavory in the process of debt collection would damage the reputation of the bank, which could damage an item on its balance sheet, which could damage its financial stability, which fact a regulator actually has jurisdiction over, and therefore regulators can discourage debt sales.) Probably more surprisingly, financial institutions care acutely about brand damage, particularly to their own partners that can contractually obligate that. Many credit cards are co-branded; you, as an unsophisticated consumer, might think you have a credit card from Amazon, Best Buy, or Apple. You don’t, but those three firms are acutely aware of your miscomprehension, and they want to continue earning your business for the next 40 years. And so they might have hypothetically contractually bound Chase, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs (respectively) to never mention their co-branding partner in connection with debt collection and to bind subsequent debt buyers to the same. This is a frequent cause of debtors mistakenly believing that debt collectors are confabulating debts against them. “But I haven’t ever done business with Citibank!” I’m slightly-more-than-unsympathetic to that, because of the relative sophistication of borrowers versus Best Buy’s marketing department. On the topic of true confabulation, oh yes, that happens minimally hundreds of thousands of times a year; debt collectors adopt business processes which simply make debts up because accuracy requires competence and costs money. The debt collection industry is, and I say this as someone who is capitalist as the day is long and attempts to be non-political in public, among the most odious hives of scum and villainy as exists in the United States. The business is sordid and virtually immune to reform, despite decades of trying. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed in 1978! It is older than me! I learned to cite it in 2004 against the same abuses it was designed to prevent! The situation did not markedly improve in the last 20 years! This is not because of a lack of virtue or a lack of laws; the structure of the industry colliding with the socioeconomic reality of defaulting debtors basically ensures that it will be a miserable place populated by miserable people who will project leveraged amounts of misery into the outside world in the hopes of collecting a tiny sliver of defaulted debts. Debts are conveyed to the debt buyers as large CSV files with minimal supporting documentation. The legal reality of a credit card debt begins with a contractualized promise to pay. You might assume that the owner of the debt necessarily has read that contract. Reader, if the debt has been sold, they have not merely not read that contract, they have likely not received a copy of that contract. They might have the contractual right to ask the seller of the portfolio to ask the entity it bought the portfolio from to follow a few more links in the chain to eventually ask the financial institution for a copy of the contract. In principle, financial institutions always have the contract… somewhere. In practice, they will frequently not organize themselves to actually locate it; this business is off their books and Operations has better things to do than hunting in the archives for a paper copy of a low-value contract signed several years ago. Again, we’re talking about promises frequently denominated in the hundreds of dollars. It is a consensual social fiction that there is actually a legal process operating here. That consensual social fiction has real consequences, and sometimes bubbles up uncomfortably in actual courts of law, which we will return to in a moment. The rights of debtors are observed by both primary lenders and eventual debt buyers mostly in the breach. One of those rights is to a written “debt verification”, with specified information in it, and (surprisingly, if you haven’t worked in this field) despite that being the law many debts are sold in such a fashion that the buyer couldn’t produce a responsive verification even if they wanted to. That isn’t even a political claim; it’s just the engineering reality of which columns are in their CSV file. The former advocate in me will observe that the single most effective method for resolving debts is carefully sending a series of letters invoking one’s rights under the FDCPA (and other legislation) to a debt collector who is operationally incapable of respecting those rights, then threatening them with legal or regulatory action when they inevitably infringe upon them in writing, leading to them abandoning further attempts at collection. This effectively makes paying consumer debts basically optional in the United States, contingent on one being sufficiently organized and informed. That is likely a surprising result to many people. Is the financial industry unaware of this? Oh no. Issuing consumer debt is an enormously profitable business. The vast majority of consumers, including those with the socioeconomic wherewithal to walk away from their debts, feel themselves morally bound and pay as agreed. Why are debt collectors so bad at debt collection? Partially it is because credit card issuers are large national institutions with large, automated processes sitting atop a legacy of corporate acquisitions, IT migrations, and similar that makes availability of non-critical information extremely fragmentary. They then want to dump that complexity through a very small pipe (CSV files) onto the debt collection industry. That industry is largely not characterized by large, nationally scaled, hypercompetent operators who happen to have decades of institutional inertia. Instead, it is heavily fragmented into strata of mid-market and smallest-of-small-business firms, governed by a patchwork of regulations on the national, state, and local levels, and runs (in large part) on faxes and post-it notes. The operations of a debt collection firm Roughly three quarters of debt is bought by ten large firms and one quarter is bought by so-called mom-and-pops, but this is complicated by the resale of portfolios which were worked by the majors. Mom-and-pops then buy them at a deep discount with the goal of getting the residual value which the majors did not successfully capture. Suppose a debt collection firm has bought a portfolio. They will first \"scrub\" it, which means using automated or semi-automated processes to enhance the fragmentary data they have and prioritize the portfolio for collection efforts. For example, one stage of the scrub will be associating a credit profile with as many debts as possible. Credit scores are extremely good predictors of who pays their debts; that is what they are designed to measure. You will get sharply better results on a per-call basis calling people with a 750 FICO versus a 450 FICO, accordingly, you should call all the 750s first and more frequently. A second scrub will typically remove dead debtors, because they infrequently answer their phones. (Debts are not inherited in the United States, a fact which the debt collection industry frequently demonstrates strategic ignorance of.) While reading government reports, I chanced across a mention that a novel form of scrub uses third party databases of so-called litigious debtors. This was surprising to me (as far as I know, it was Not A Thing when I was doing advocacy), but makes a lot of operational sense. You can trivially Google providers with [litigious debtor scrub] as a keyword. The FDCPA and state legislation provides for automatic damages for illegal behavior from collectors, the incidence of illegal behavior is extremely high, and a debt collector with a high school education and three months of experience will frequently commit three federal torts in a few minutes of talking to a debtor then follow up with a confirmation of the same in writing. (You think I am exaggerating. Reader, I am not. “If you don’t pay me I will sue you and then Immigration will take notice of that and yank your green card” contains three separate causes of action: (frequently) a false threat to file a suit where that is not actually a business practice of the firm, a false alleged affiliation with a government agency, and a false alleged consequence for debt nonpayment not provided for in law.) As a result, private companies compiled databases of (public in the U.S.) court filings and organized them by Social Security number, address, and similar to allow debt collectors to identify which debtors are aware of their legal rights. In principle, a debt collector could do anything they wanted with that fact, like being extra careful to follow the law in contacting them. But the economics of debt collection do not counsel careful, individualized consideration of credit card debt. I will bet you that, in practice, they simply avoid collecting against anyone who demonstrates ability and financial resources to enforce their rights. This is one for the history books of borked equilibriums. We devoted substantial efforts to pro-consumer legislation to address abuse of (mostly) poor people. We gated redress behind labor that is abundantly available in the professional managerial class and scarce outside of it, like writing letters and counting to 30 days. (People telling me they were incapable of doing these two things is why I started ghostwriting letters for debtors.) We now have literal computer programs exempting heuristically identified professional managerial class members from debt collection, inclusive of their legitimate debts, so that debt collectors can more profitably conserve their time to do abusive and frequently illegal shakedowns of the people the legislation was meant to benefit. After scrubbing their lists, debt collectors will attempt to locate contact information for the debtors. You would think this would be fairly straightforward, given that they were given that information in the CSV file they purchased. But information is fragmentary and outdated, and people likely to default on debts also have complicated and frequently changing relationships with their addresses and phone numbers. So there exists an ecosystem of “skip tracing” providers, delightfully (ugh) borrowing the jargon from the business of bounty hunters, to match up fragmentary information with current contact information. Operational and IT issues at this stage create a lot of the harm in the debt collection industry. For example, to use an example ripped from my own experience (which was part of over $100,000 of confabulated debt that caused me to fall down the credit advocacy rabbit hole), consider a fragmentary piece of information identifies a P.J. MacKenzie at an unspecified town in Illinois as owning a debt in the few hundred dollar range. That name is a fuzzy match to one Patrick Johnathan McKenzie of Chicago, Illinois. Here you are welcome to your moral intuitions as to whether simply asserting that I owe you a few hundred dollars is legitimate. The debt collection industry frequently assumes, as a matter of business practice, “I mean, probably you do factually owe me, and if you don’t, oh well, then you won’t be one of the ~8% of people who we successfully collect from.” No individualized application of human labor is required to reach this conclusion. No one is accountable for the mistake; no one made it, not in the usual sense of people making mistakes. People architected a system which generates this outcome by default. And then begin the calls. To you, if the above processes have successfully found you. To your friends and relatives, if they have not. (The FDCPA provides that debt collectors are only allowed to contact a debtor’s family to find current contact information. They do this with gusto, including when they have current contact information. It is used coercively, because many debtors will make sacrifices to find $250 so their mother stops getting calls.) Debt collectors typically work in call center environments, assisted by technological improvements to greatly increase the number of calls per hour each collector can do. These include so-called predictive dialers, which (as a sketch) dial several debtors in parallel for each collector, since most calls will not be answered or will go to voicemail, then connect only those that pick up to a debt collector waiting in the queue. Maximizing the efficiency of callers is key to the economics of debt collection; labor frequently costs more than than underlying debt does, even when one is paying four cents on the dollar and hiring collectors straight out of high school. An unhappy consequence of this is that debt collection firms build extremely scaled systems to project externalities into the phone network and the people attached to it, including very many people who never owed them a dime. But for the (dubious) cover of law, this is what technologists would call a volumetric denial of service attack: a relatively small expenditure of resources allows a collector to disable a relatively large number of phones. If there is one thing that unites debtors, it is the cacophony. The phones ring and ring and ring. They ring at all times legally permissible and many times not. They ring from the same collector calling you twice a day. They ring from the same debt being collected by multiple different agencies, several of which sold the debt on but neglected to update their internal systems to stop collecting on the debt they no longer own. They ring from dozens of different firms, because the circumstances which caused you to go delinquent on one debt caused you to go delinquent on several debts. Each of those is collected in parallel by a process which considers every other debt collector a competitor for your scarce dollars and must outcompete them by ringing you harder, faster, and more persistently. What does a debt collector hope to get from a call? The goal of calls is to get a verbal promise to pay and payment credentials. The most useful payment credential, from the perspective of a debt collector, is a checking account number, but in a pinch they will also usually take debit cards or credit cards. (Many people who have defaulted on debts still have access to credit, because in deteriorating financial circumstances one could default on some but not all credit lines. There is also an extremely efficient financial industry capable of extending credit profitably at a wide variety of predicted repayment likelihoods.) Many promises to pay are not promises to pay in full, but rather “a plan” to pay the face value of the debt plus accumulated (and accumulating) interest over time. Most debtors who agree to payment plans will not successfully complete those plans. This is, from the perspective of a debt collector, not a problem. If they paid five cents on the dollar for your loan, and successfully convince you to pay twenty cents today and the balance over monthly payments over a year, you know what they’re left with in month three when you default? Ability to collect from you again, or to sell your debt for more than they paid for it, because you are a better credit risk than most people in the portfolio. You proved that, by paying. Many less sophisticated customers assume that they have substantial control over sending payments via check. All checks have the account number, printed on the face of them, and collectors will push aggressively to get that number over the phone versus waiting for a check to arrive. The goal of having the number is to present the bank holding the checking account with an electronic ACH debit or a “demand draft”, in both cases representing that the account holder has pre-authorized the debit. How many debits did a debtor agreeing to the above sketched plan pre-authorize? Not less than thirteen. They will frequently be very surprised to learn that, and they will be frequently surprised when their financial institution backs the debt collector, who often has a sudden fit of competence and manages to record this part of the conversation. The amount of gamesmanship that debt collectors get up to regarding payments could use its own column. The verbal authorization to debit your account (“payment plan”) was probably silent on timing, so they will use their substantial experience in dealing with people in poor economic circumstances to target the dates and times of day when benefits payments or paychecks have posted to your account. They’ll surge collection attempts at 3 AM on the 1st of the month, learn the differences between various banks as to when Social Security payments post, etc. They’ll also do things like e.g. splitting the agreed upon payment into smaller payments, with the goal of getting at least one rather than having the payment declined for insufficient funds (NSF, in financial industry parlance). This has frequently magnified fees assessed by banks to debtors, because NSF fees are frequently assessed per-occurrence. Why does this continue being so broken? Incentives rule everything around us. The structure of the industry, technical issues, and similar alluded to above cause most of this, and they have continued causing it despite decades of effort to correct. There are also human capital issues at play. Discussing them is a bit difficult, because the people who physically make phone calls for debt collectors share many of the life challenges of debtors as a class. They are poorly educated, poorly paid, poorly managed, and churned through viciously. The work is soul crushing; turnover at the large firms is 75-100% annually. Call centers are already generally a high-stress, terrible working environment even when one is doing routine customer service or order entry work; a debt collector is the type of call center worker that no one wants to talk to. Successful debt collectors need to both harden their hearts against tales of woe (and personal abuse) from debtors and also successfully execute on some combination of moral suasion and threats to eke out a few percentage points at the margin in collections. Success in the field is the difference between e.g. 7% and 8% collection. Few competent people remain in this field over an extended period of time; an effective, morally upright debt collector would be a better telephone sales rep at a tenth the stress and two to five times the total compensation. As a result, most calls being made today are not by effective, morally upright debt collectors. Illegal threats may be more effective than diligent suasion and management frequently, through incompetence or careful refusal to watch the sausage being made, ignores that collectors are making threats but tracks per-collector productivity very carefully. Solve for the equilibrium. As a former advocate, I’d report that it is never in a debtor’s interest to verbally speak to a debt collector under any circumstances. One’s likelihood of being abused or lied to, including in financially consequential fashions, is high, and one’s ability to counter that is minimal. Instead, force them to do all correspondence on paper, where lies are self-documenting, illegal threats are immediately admissible to regulatory processes or court, etc. The incentives and hiring pool available to debt collection firms cause them to put most of their limited competence into scaling phone teams and very little competence into individualized written correspondence. That would require them to successfully keep a folder about a debtor for a month and route communications to the desk with that folder; this is an edge case for them and uneconomical to do at the hundreds of dollar range. This means they will, through a combination of incompetence and strategic decisions by management, frequently simply abandon collection activity where that would require them to read and write. Suing people with robots Most debts are not litigated, but various debt collection firms have various strategies here. Almost no consumer debts are worth serious amounts of professional attention, but above about $1,000 or so (depending heavily on jurisdiction), they can be worth doing high-frequency lawyering on. Basically, the debt collector will either itself or, through use of a law firm, file hundreds or thousands of lawsuits in a single court against its roster of uncollected debtors. Those lawsuits will be entirely templated. A frequent detail that emerges in news reporting is that they’ll often be physically robosigned, so that the relevant lawyers don’t give themselves repetitive stress injuries by needing to affix their name to all of the things they are swearing to under penalty of perjury. You might have a view of the judicial system where two highly educated advocates joust in front of a neutral finder of fact like a judge or jury. This ain’t that. The goal of this business process is generating so-called default judgements. They’re both judgment that a default happened and also the judgment that happens by default; the overwhelming case for issuance is when one party is summoned to court and does not show up. Many debtors will ignore correspondence about court cases believing that ignoring them will make the problem go away; this is the opposite of the truth. Many will lack transportation, not be able to take off work, etc. In any event, filling 100 court cases means that, in expectation, your lawyer will collect 60-95 default judgements or more. Not a bad day’s work. Default judgements turn a debt that hasn’t been collected voluntarily into a financial asset with value. They can be used to garnish the contents of bank accounts or wages paid to debtors, in many jurisdictions. For debtors who own property, which is a fact pattern that occurs much more commonly than you probably would guess, a default judgment can frequently be turned into a lien against the property. This swaps an unsecured consumer debt for a senior claim against the debtor’s home equity. That claim is itself salable into an ecosystem of lien investors, and the debt collector will frequently sell it for (say) 80 cents on the dollar, realizing a profit over their low basis in the debt and collection costs. Should a debtor actually show up to the courthouse, the lawyer will almost invariably offer an on-the-spot settlement. Fifty cents on the dollar seems to be popular, anecdotally. Avoid the expense and stress of a legal proceeding, etc etc, this is obviously incentive compatible. When debtors actually contest their debts, or have competent legal representation, the debt collectors frequently get beaten like drums. Many judges take an unsurprisingly dim view of lawyers who profess to have personal knowledge of the facts of the case then can’t locate the contract they are suing over. (Again: they do not and never did possess a copy of the contract. The lawyer does not actually know any facts of the debt other than that the firm purchased a name, address, and perhaps a Social Security number in a CSV file. They don’t have the contents of any previous correspondence about the debt, owing to some combination of incompetence and unwillingness to present evidence of crimes in court.) Then comes some gamesmanship, where the debt collector will attempt to ask for an extension to get their paperwork in order and the debtor’s attorney will push for dismissal, claims under the FDCPA and similar, and costs. This makes for good human interest pieces occasionally, but the economics make the lawsuit machine very profitable to run even accounting for losses, and accordingly it continues robosigning cases by the tens and hundreds of thousands. What can be done about this? Many people have suggestions for obvious improvements here, which might rhyme with the Federal Trade Commission’s suggestions from 2010 or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s spate of rulemaking from 2021 through 2023 or the FDCPA from 1978. I’ll leave rulemaking to the rulemakers, as this essay has gone on long enough. The state of reality is very bad, not because any single person woke up this morning attempting to maximize evil, but because a complex interaction of structural factors over multiple different parts of society got us to where we are. Untangling that Gordian knot is hard and has empirically eluded us. Requiem for a bank loan → Want more essays in your inbox? I write about the intersection of tech and finance, approximately weekly.

I use debit cards for daily payments, that&#x27;s just the most standard expected payment method in Europe (with mobile payments now replacing it. Is a mobile payment app more like a debit or like a credit card? I have no idea actually!).But credit cards for online payments on the internet because (despite some debit card based systems existing which don&#x27;t seem to work by default) on the internet credit cards seems to be the main supported payment method, including e.g. through Paypal, but also for local online shops, airlines, ...So in the US credit card vs debit card is probably an important distinction between buying on actual credit or not and all the fun stuff they have there like credit ratings, but in Europe the main distinction seems to simply be which one works for online purchases or not. Of course some reward programs for credit cards do exist here, I think American Express specifically has some benefits to the user but isn&#x27;t accepted everywhere (Heard from other users, don&#x27;t have this one myself. I&#x27;m not really into rewards programs myself, why not just make the stuff you buy cheaper instead?). Also, visa and mastercard seem to have no practical difference and some banks just give both.If this view is naive or incomplete, it probably just shows credit cards are indeed not as important in Europe, if they gave some huge benefit I&#x27;d have known! reply williamdclt 13 minutes agoparent> Is a mobile payment app more like a debit or like a credit card?My understanding is that the mobile payment app is just a medium for a virtual debit or credit card> on the internet credit cards seems to be the main supported payment methodOver many years, I&#x27;ve never had any issue paying with debit cards on the internet, except _once_ to rent a bike on a taiwanese website (bc they do a credit card hold). reply Reason077 3 hours agoprevOne thing that&#x27;s not mentioned in this article is that credit card companies will sometimes make last-ditch \"clear your debt at a discount\" offers before passing your debt on to a collection agency.This happened to me many years ago. In the wake of the &#x27;08 financial crisis, I&#x27;d lost my job abruptly and decided to go travelling.I&#x27;d accumulated a balance that was fairly substantial for me at the time (on the order of $10-15k, IIRC) and had been struggling to make the payments. I&#x27;d probably been 2-3 months behind on multiple occasions over the course of a year or so when a letter appeared that essentially said \"we don&#x27;t like you and we&#x27;re going to close your account and pass your debt to a collection agency. However, if you pay off a portion of your balance in 4 monthly payments, and don&#x27;t miss any of those payment dates, we&#x27;ll wipe the rest.\"I don&#x27;t recall exactly what the discount was, but it was very substantial. In total I only had to pay something like 30-40% of the balance that I owed, so it was a very good deal. I&#x27;m not normally one to skip out on my debts but this was a huge relief to have a chance to be free of that debt: I pulled a lot of strings to make those payments on time!True to their word, they wiped my entire balance and closed my account, and I never heard from them again (nor any collection agencies). reply worldwidelies 2 hours agoparentsame experience, except it wasn&#x27;t that simple. A family member told me I should settle with them, because that&#x27;s what they did too. They wiped the balance and closed the account but the settlement stayed on my credit score for 7 years. I had a friend who was getting calls by a debt servicer and was making it seem like no big deal.

He ran up about $100,000 of debt on his cards on purpose and stopped making payments. He then approached his bank to settle the debt and negotiated a 60% discount. The account was marked \"paid by customer\" so it never appeared on his on his credit report as a default. He did get dinged for missing payments though, but was $60,000 richer. reply standardUser 2 hours agorootparentprevHigher rates on what exactly? Isn&#x27;t it pretty much just mortgage rates?

If you don&#x27;t show up, collector gets a kind of automatic win called a default judgement, and that&#x27;s how you end up losing your house or having money vanish from your bank-account. If you do show up, they might instantly offer you a discount deal, often because they know their position is very shaky and they don&#x27;t actually want to spend money fighting a court case that might be unwinnable against a strong opponent.* Ask for proof. Debt collectors often lack documentation that you are legally-entitled to. (\"Debt verification\" under the \"FDCPA\".) Many never got it form the original bank, and don&#x27;t want to spend time&#x2F;money getting it. Asking for that proof means they may just give up and move on to a cheaper&#x2F;easier person.* Don&#x27;t be fooled into paying for other people&#x27;s debt. At least in the US, debts end when the original debtor dies, except in the sense of money taken away from the debtor&#x27;s stuff before it reaches heirs. You can&#x27;t ever \"inherit negative money\". Spousal stuff is more complex, but don&#x27;t get fooled into paying something you don&#x27;t even owe.* Debt collectors will often make threats that are both impossible and illegal. This means you can only benefit from having everything in writing. (Or by clearly announcing that you will record a call, and then recording it.)* The law (FDCPA) only allows debt collectors to call family members in order to get your contact information... But some of them use this as a form of harassment&#x2F;coercion. There&#x27;s no magic-wand for this part.* If you agree to a vague \"payment plan\" and then send them the first check or bank-account info, watch out: Even if you don&#x27;t write another check, they will find ways to withdraw money out of that account at the exact worst moments for you... but the best for them. reply spdustin 5 hours agoprevIt’s even more cathartic to show up in court with a motion in hand to dismiss with prejudice and a second motion barring them from both servicing and selling the alleged debt. That’s almost a money maker, since winning their suit entitles you to compensation for filing fees, and violating the second order can be wildly punitive if you haul the collector back into court. reply tptacek 7 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a point in this article where Patrick suggests you Google \"litigious debtor scrub\" to confirm a point he&#x27;s making, and when you get to that point --- not before --- I highly recommend doing the search and reading some of the links, because they&#x27;re pretty funny. reply bradleybuda 4 hours agoparentAmazing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;media.guidebook.com&#x2F;upload&#x2F;z5nhuRkp... reply rconti 4 hours agorootparent\"Kicking Them When You Have Them Down\"wow. reply spelunker 4 hours agorootparentprevThat was great.

The issue is - one negative thing like a 30 day lack of payment - tanks a score based on things you mostly can&#x27;t control aside from paying bills.I had this happen recently because in the US mortgages get sold repeatedly and on one propery I have it was sold 3x in a year and somehow I missed one thing. Shouldn&#x27;t have, but multiple addresses, shifting mortgages, etc. The funny thing, once the \"deliquenct\" account agency wasn&#x27;t involved, the score ticked back up.In the US - credit is a game, it&#x27;s based on how much you make (or how much you claim you can make), making payments, an keeping a score high. If you hit a high threshhold and suddenly sink after years of relationships...those old relationships can help with debt and collection.At a certain point, institutions you have dealt with want to maintain healthy relationships.I&#x27;ve have great credit situations with Amex and Citi going back decades and leveraged those to offset&#x2F;erase turmoil issues. reply PeterStuer 3 hours agoprevAround 2015 I saw the IT inards of a local debt collector.

This is one for the history books of borked equilibriums. We devoted substantial efforts to pro-consumer legislation to address abuse of (mostly) poor people. We gated redress behind labor that is abundantly available in the professional managerial class and scarce outside of it, like writing letters and counting to 30 days. (People telling me they were incapable of doing these two things is why I started ghostwriting letters for debtors.) We now have literal computer programs exempting heuristically identified professional managerial class members from debt collection, inclusive of their legitimate debts, so that debt collectors can more profitably conserve their time to do abusive and frequently illegal shakedowns of the people the legislation was meant to benefit.That is such a common pattern. Growing up, I saw the same happen with the German welfare system: there&#x27;s enough of a social safety net in that country that no one would have to be homeless. But, to access the social safety net, you have to navigate some minimal amount of bureaucracy and paperwork.That bar isn&#x27;t very high, but if you have at least that minimal skill with paperwork literacy, you are also much more likely to have a job and much less likely to need the welfare.So all in all, Germany still has homeless people, despite welfare programs generous enough in principle that no one needs to be homeless.Addendum: Singapore has an ingenious system to ration the amount of subsidies you get on hospital bills without any bureaucracy. The basic idea is that when you go for a hospital stay, you get to pick how much etxra creature comforts you are getting, like your own private room vs an open word with many beds. The copay for the fancier options rises &#x27;progressively&#x27; enough, that the absolute amount of government subsidy goes down. People tend to self-sort voluntarily.The medical care you receive is the same for any of the options.I can imagine an argument that this is somehow against the dignity of poor people to put them into comparatively crowded wards, and that everyone should get the same treatment (like eg the British NHS does, modulo the option to go to a private hospital for enough money). But I suspect many of the poorer people are happier to put up with that &#x27;indignity&#x27; than with paperwork and privacy-invading bureaucratic means testing.In total, adding up private and public expenditures, Singapore spends about half as much on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than the UK does, which spends about half as much as the US. Medical outcomes are no worse in the cheaper systems. reply repiret 5 hours agoparentA little over a decade ago I knew a young adult in the US that had a pretty rough life and I was trying to help her get back on her feet.When you’re homeless, it’s hard to get mail, and hard to keep your stuff; going from nothing to your standard documents is tricky.To get your birth certificate, you need to write a check to the state at some address where you’ll be able to receive mail in 2-4 weeks.Once you have that, you can go into the social security office and request a replacement social security card. Which they’ll mail to you in 2-4 weeks. There’s also a lifetime limit to how many times you can replace your card, which is surprisingly small.State ID cards also get mailed to you. Moreover, you need to provide proof of your address, and the address gets printed on the card. We used my address, but no good deed goes unpunished - the address on your ID card gets published in the paper when you’re arrested. Then my nosy neighbor asks if everyone is alright because someone living at my house got arrested for possession of meth.On top of each of those steps costing money and being hard to do when you’re homeless, there’s a dependency chain. You got to do them one at a time.Navigating the public bureaucracy is an annoyance for someone in what patio11 calls the professional&#x2F;managerial class.

You have to fill in a 160-page form and turn up to an appointment. They interpret everything you have written on the form as evidence of ability, including turning up to the appointment itself. Ability to fill in a form and turn up to an appointment is used as evidence that you should be capable of having a job, and are therefore ineligible for help. You are denied.You then take the case to tribunal, where it is put in front of a normal non-rigged judge who interprets the law in a reasonable manner, and are awarded your disability benefits.This process takes about a year and is basically impossible unless you get help from someone who is \"professional managerial class\" enough to work the system for you.Coda: periodically they write to you to check that e.g. the two legs you lost have not grown back.

A week later they sent me a bill for over $1k. They had not applied my $300 payment towards the total. They had not waited for insurance to reimburse them. They simply decided they could arbitrarily charge me more, and they did. Fortunately, my wife is somewhat familiar with medical billing and we did not pay. Insurance reimbursed them, then we called them and told them to apply the $300 we had already paid, at which point we owed nothing. If we had paid the $1k+ bill, I am sure we would not have been reimbursed.2. I went to a clinic for a minor sports injury. They charged me a $60 consultation fee which I paid up front; I then spoke to the doctor for 15 minutes and got a prescription. A week later, I got a bill demanding an additional $180, and in that bill they claimed they had already been paid by my insurance.

Meanwhile, software vendors of all kinds have universally decided that they shouldn&#x27;t be spending any money on any form of technical support that comes with a heartbeat.Down in the home and small-business markets, there are a lot of people that get absolutely screwed by this.

For a while, you could call me, and for several years, I mostly enjoyed building a business out of fixing these sorts of things (and helping people navigate the sometimes very tricky update process so that this wouldn&#x27;t be a recurring problem).Unfortunately, software kept getting worse, documentation kept getting harder to come by, Google kept getting worse, everything kept getting converted into subscription SaaS (which meant that most of my answers started becoming, \"yeah, that&#x27;s just how it works now, I can&#x27;t do anything about it, yeah, it sucks, yeah, lots of other people are complaining too, no, there&#x27;s nobody you can call, sorry\"), and I never felt good charging a lot of money for getting people out of bad spots.I eventually noped out of this in favor of relaxing for a while in a slightly less hopeless part of the industry, but there&#x27;s still a huge, under-served market of people who are getting hosed by sociopathic technology and would pay someone just to make it work again. reply Aperocky 6 hours agoparentprevMicroservices reply verve_rat 7 hours agoparentprevBurnt out developers?Start ups that could have been viable small&#x2F;medium business but were scaled to death? reply NineStarPoint 7 hours agorootparentAlso businesses that could have been profitable, but failed due to being out competed by businesses that secured 10X the venture capital and sold things at unsustainable prices for years. reply expertentipp 5 hours agoparentprevAngular and corporate Java codebases with >95% test coverage. reply kibwen 7 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s the thing, the software industry is the waste processor of open-source software development. reply adev_ 5 hours agoprevIt might be a very European view to the problem but: Why does the American government does even tolerate this credit card garbage business in the first place ?We are in the 21th century.

So, if you have a dispute, you don&#x27;t have to pay the disputed amount until the dispute is resolved. With a debit card, you&#x27;ve already paid, and so you&#x27;re out the money until the dispute is resolved. Now, if the dispute is not resolved in your favor, you may have to pay interest on the credit card.Related to the above, you don&#x27;t need to make sure you have the money in your debit card account before buying things. You can just charge it and then make sure you&#x27;re good to pay later. Example: you don&#x27;t have the cash handy right now for an emergency car repair.

Eg American Express explicitly has high fees and high rewards, and competes against Visa and Mastercard (and against domestic systems in eg Germany or Japan).A monopoly (or oligopoly or cartel) argument could perhaps explain why the smallest fees you can find are still &#x27;high&#x27; by some arbitrary standard, but it couldn&#x27;t explain why American Express is a viable competitor.See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upgradedpoints.com&#x2F;credit-cards&#x2F;us-credit-card-marke... for market shares of the different payment networks in the US. reply pavlov 5 hours agorootparentprevThere’s nothing productive in the system creating that output.

A bank account shouldn’t cost more than $2 &#x2F; month. An overdraft shouldn’t be possible unless you opt in to a loan facility. reply anovikov 1 hour agorootparentWhy is the market like this? It&#x27;s naturally harder to make money off poor people because they have less money. It&#x27;s also not how retail banking works in Europe, they tend to make money off the rich here in ridiculous ways (\"keep $400,000 frozen on your deposit for an almost zero interest rate and get a few useless perks like a red-carpet priority lane at the airport\"). And i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s regulation. Maybe European poor and American poor are different (can&#x27;t do the math, don&#x27;t care, have planning horizon too short)? reply pavlov 52 minutes agorootparentThere are a lot of poor Americans. 22% say they have absolutely no emergency savings. That’s 57 million adults who get milked by banks at every turn.In Europe, exorbitant fees paid by the poorest would end up getting paid by the welfare system. It would be more obvious that it’s a wealth transfer from the state to the banks and other corporations. So the government has a direct interest in enacting regulation that prevents this.In America, the welfare system avoids transferring actual money to people as far as possible (because the system doesn’t trust poor people to handle money). Instead these transfers are made indirectly using systems like “food stamps” that you can use only to buy groceries. When the government is giving food stamps to someone, and simultaneously the same person is paying $100 in overdraft fees to a bank, it’s much less obvious who’s really paying the bank’s profit here, but it’s still the taxpayers. reply anovikov 37 minutes agorootparentWhy is there no government action to prevent social assistance recipients of any sort from access to credit? reply pavlov 21 minutes agorootparentIt’s not even credit, you’ll get hit with fees for just having a bank account when poor.Wells Fargo, one of the largest national banks, charges $15 &#x2F; month for a checking account (last I checked) unless you keep a balance of over $1500.And overdraft fees are hard to avoid because the American banking system is fundamentally flawed. Companies can make charges from your account if they know the number. (This is mentioned in the debt collection article too.) If you don’t have money, your account can suddenly go negative because some company somewhere decided to pull some money from you, and then the bank charges you $50 for the overdraft.The system is so broken, it’s hard to believe from a European point of view. The USA only got European-style bank transfers this year! Until now, almost all money transfers were being bolted onto a system meant for handling paper checks. replynevir 5 hours agorootparentprevBut those thousands of dollars are effectively subsidized by every one making a credit card purchase (e.g. merchant fees) - and not everyone being able&#x2F;savvy enough to utilize them wellConsider how much cheaper things might be across the board with lower fees reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprevThat money still comes from your spending with the merchant, so ultimately out of your own pocket.But you are right, that the system is not very transparent, and merchants probably seldom give people the full discount of the costs saved when they use non-credit card payments. reply relyks 5 hours agorootparentMost sadly don&#x27;t give a discount for not using a credit card.

Other places say they will charge a credit card transaction fee even if you use a debit card (which still has costs for the merchant but not as much as credit cards) reply eru 5 hours agorootparentAgreed.You can indirectly see some of this happening though: lots of places with lower margins (ie cheaper prices) won&#x27;t accept American Express, but might accepts Visa and Mastercard. That&#x27;s exactly because of the difference in fees.If you go shop at merchant A that accepts American Express, you pay a higher price no matter how you pay. But if you have a non-American Express means of payment, you can shop at merchant B, which has lower prices overall (no matter how you pay).

When the central bank injects money into the economy, they don&#x27;t earmark it to be only spend in specific ways.Just to forestall one pseudo-explanation: yes, a central bank usually injects money into the economy by buying government bonds. However (a) they buy the bonds at market prices and (b) the whole process is very well known and announced in advance, so market participants can and will anticipate what is happening. Money in the economy does not act on &#x27;hydraulic&#x27; principles where it has an effect first on where it enters the economy and then slowly works its way through.As a hypothetical: assume that the US Fed credibly announces today in 2023 that in 2030 they are going to keep printing money until American Dollar and the Japanese Yen are at par. (At the moment, 1 USD buys about 147 Yen.)You can bet your hat that prices in the US would react long before 2030 has arrived, and thus long before any of that new money had been printed and had any chance to slowly work its way through the economy.

Why ?Because the fraud \"real\" cost is mainly thrown in the wild on the merchant that have to deal with their goods being sent and their payment being reverted.It is a liability issue.I am pretty sure that with a little law that, lets say, enforce Banks to reimburse their customers under 24h00 for a small fee, lets say 10$, in case of fraudulent transaction: This entire system of scam would fade away pretty quickly. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprevThat might be true (I don&#x27;t know), but then we are left with another mystery: why do credit card companies spend more effort combating fraud than debit card companies do?(Also keep in mind that it&#x27;s often the same companies that do debit and credit cards. For example, I have debit cards in the Mastercard and Visa networks, but no credit cards. I assume most of the fraud prevention efforts benefit my debit cards as well.Also that relying on a bunch of numbers alone is pretty sketchy. But I am choosing to interpret fraud more widely, than just card number theft. I am pretty sure card number theft is pretty low(er) in parts of the world where people pay with chip-and-pin, and don&#x27;t use numbered cards.) reply seanmcdirmid 5 hours agorootparentprevNot all countries apply this protection to their credit cards, even if they are issued from visa&#x2F;master card&#x2F;Amex. For example, we knew if a Chinese restaurant in Bellevue WA would target Chinese visitors using ICBC AmEx cards because ICBC (a big bank in China) puts the onus on the consumer to prove they didn’t make the charge rather than in the business making the charge. American credit card issuers would never do that and just let you make the charge back. reply sebazzz 5 hours agorootparentprevDebit cards in the Netherlands at least don&#x27;t have a number that can solely be used for payments. You need the physical card (with a pin code which isn&#x27;t written on the card but memorised), or a virtual card like Apple Pay coupled to that card.It seems that fraud protection is rather something that is necessary because fraud is so easy. reply cscurmudgeon 5 hours agoparentprevYou conveniently left out the part where credit cards offer ... credit.

Essentially quick loans upto a limit with zero collateralYou say this like it is an unequivocal good, but I don&#x27;t think it necessarily is. The world functioned before it was common to have instance frictionless access to a no-collateral high-rate loan.Also, may I remind you these are for-profit loans, and the very article we&#x27;re commenting under is about how they are disproportionately used to shake down poorer people.I&#x27;m sure you can twist numbers in either way to say credit cards are net good or net bad for poor people, but it&#x27;s not unquestionably good at the very least.> Remember, nobody forces you to use credit cards.Except two factors realistically do encourage you to. Merchants generally charge fixed prices regardless of whether you pay with credit&#x2F;debit&#x2F;cash. That price includes their expected credit card fee overhead, so because everyone else pays with a credit card, the price is higher. You pay that higher price whether you use a card or not, and only get the points&#x2F;miles&#x2F;cash back&#x2F;whatever if you also use a credit card.Secondly, credit scores force me to use a credit card. For some reason, private companies control my credit score, and my salary, savings, etc have no bearing on it.Originally, I refused to use credit cards since I find them an unethical tool to transfer money from the poor to the rich, and so I had no credit score. When I went to rent an apartment, the landlord checked my credit score, and then could legally turn me away for not having one. Jobs I applied for checked my credit score, and could legally reject me.I feel like the private credit agencies, and how widely credit scores are used, has in fact forced me to use a credit card, or else run the risk of each landlord running a credit check and then turning me away. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprev> If the govt. banned credit cards, you will then ask why poor people can&#x27;t get credit.Or alternatively, poor people would get their credit more from alternative providers. Like payday loans or pawnshops, or even loan sharks.Those alternative sources of credit have exactly the same problem with shady collectors. The article alludes to that, but decides to focus on credit card debt.The article also implies that perhaps regulation that encourages banks to offload credit card debt from their balance sheet might be to blame. If you instead had regulations that encouraged banks to keep credit cards on their balance sheets, and&#x2F;or to make it so that debt collection agencies have to keep mentioning the co-branded sponsors (like Apple and Amazon etc), then collectors might have more of an incentive to be less shady to protect the reputation of established brands.Reputation of established brands is very, very valuable, and does not require a lot of paperwork or bureaucracy to self-enforce.

Join us on Slack Products Docs Pricing Blog Learn Earthly Blog / News Table of contents We built the fastest CI in the world. It failed. Here’s what we learned 20 minute read Updated: September 12, 2023 Vlad A. Ionescu Imagine you live in a world where no part of the build has to repeat unless the changes actually impacted it. A world in which all builds happened with automatic parallelism. A world in which you could reproduce very reliably any part of the build on your laptop. Fairy tales, right? Well, that’s what we built, and to everyone’s surprise, nobody wanted it. It’s like flying cars - they sound amazing, but in practice, things are more difficult than they might seem. Back in April 2020, we at Earthly set out on this quest to improve CI/CD tooling. We dared to ask questions like “What if the CI could run on your laptop?” And “what would the fastest CI system on the planet look like?” With these questions in mind, we came to a pretty strange, but pretty interesting answer… the build system and the CI need to be the same. And it needs to be distributed. Now we all know dreaming big is easy. Execution is where things get hard. What Does Success Look Like? In a startup, you don’t have the luxury of building a mature product with all the possible bells and whistles before shipping it to your customers. Mature products take many years and many engineers to build out. And yet, you are going up against the incumbents - companies that have hundreds of millions in funding, (maybe even IPO’d), they have hundreds of engineers, they have a 10-year head start, and a ton of reputation. How can you even compete? Well, you know what they say… “Competition is for losers”. The answer is that you don’t. At least not on the same level. You’ll never be more mature, or have more features, or more integrations. Instead, you can be 10x better in one, very specific way. And you’ll appeal to the few teams where the very specific problem you’re solving is so painful that they’re willing to make compromises on everything else. You’re not going after the whole market in the beginning. You’re just going after just enough enthusiasts, mavens, early adopters - whatever you want to call them - for whom the solution that you built on a shoestring budget is dramatically better in their specific situation than any incumbent. So much better, that they’re willing to pay the cost of adoption, and they’re willing to suffer through the bugs and the missing bells and whistles. Then, once you have captured that segment, you invest more, extend to a wider audience, get more feedback, then again invest more, extend again, and so on. It’s important to understand this dynamic in order to gauge what success looks like at the earliest stages. So if your MVP is not getting enough validation, you can’t just slap more features on it, because, again, features are not what will make you successful. Incumbents win feature contests. Successful products will show validation at a small scale, despite all their limitations, bugs, and general annoyances. If you can’t find a small group of people passionate enough about your product in its experimental stage, you’re going to have a hard time capturing an audience even with a feature-rich product. It’s a recipe for building something nobody wants. What early-stage validation looks like is a small group of people who have a lot of passion for what you do. Nobody has heard about your stuff, but your users are passionately shouting from the rooftops about it. You walk into their office and everyone has stickers with your company on their laptops, and everyone wants to talk to you. The Master Plan for Earthly CI To build out the vision of Earthly CI, we devised a master plan. We knew that we didn’t want to go on a crazy complex implementation for 3 years only to emerge from a cave with a product that would not fit the needs of the real world. So we split up the end-vision into several independent products that we would validate along the way. Thus, instead of building Earthly CI from day 0, we first built the syntax, and the general experience around running builds on-demand. The key value we delivered was build consistency: there is a level of guarantee that the build will execute the same, regardless of the environment it runs in. The syntax of this build tool is the same as the CI down the road, but it only ran locally initially and in other CIs. We called this first milestone Earthly. Then we built remote runners that can be invoked from anywhere - again your laptop or any CI. These remote runners bring you all the key benefits of Earthly CI but without being a CI. The key value is build speed. And I’m talking 2-20X faster CI pipelines, thanks to the caching and parallelism. We called this second milestone Earthly Satellites. And finally, the third milestone, Earthly CI - the platform that brings everything together, the CI that is ridiculously fast and can run anywhere. This is the full CI that is meant to compete with all the other big CIs like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins and so on. What was particularly appealing about this plan was that Earthly, the build system, targets one problem: build consistency, while the final version, Earthly CI, targets another problem: build speed. This meant that Earthly, which is free, would not cannibalize in any way the monetization of Earthly CI. We wouldn’t be giving away too much for free – as Jenkins did – and instead, it would serve as a sustainable and scalable business model. It made sense to use the build system as a way to then create bottom-up adoption for Earthly CI - and the fact that we were building it first allowed us to build traction that one day will magically just convert over to Earthly CI users. Little did we know that this difference in value proposition – consistency vs. speed – actually became a problem down the road… Milestone 1: Earthly Earthly was the lowest-stakes validation. I just built the first version on my own, threw it up on GitHub, and then launched it on Reddit and HackerNews. Zero funding (apart from my wife’s patience), so close to zero risk. If it takes off, I go raise money. If it doesn’t I’ll try something else. We now know that Earthly is used widely across thousands of repositories, by companies big and small, like VMware, Adobe, Namely, Roche, ExpressVPN, Bluecore, and many others. But the early signs were that people were using Earthly even when it was a one-person unfunded project riddled with bugs and limitations. That’s validation. Milestone 2: Earthly Satellites After fixing the obvious issues in Earthly, and widened support to appeal to more types of organizations, we were now building momentum. And with enough capital, we were able to now work on the next milestone: Earthly Satellites. The interesting thing about Satellites was that we were getting the validation even before we built them. Earthly being open-source, you could already run your own Earthly remote runner (since we use Buildkit underneath, it was essentially a remote Buildkit), connect Earthly to it, and get similar benefits to Satellites even before this was a commercial offering. And so people did this on their own, hosting it in their own environment, without us managing it for them. Once we had this packaged up in a managed offering, people were flocking to it, mainly because they did not want to manage remote runners on their own. The initial version of Satellites was buggy, inefficient, and unstable. Yet people came to it despite those inefficiencies, because there was nothing else that would give them CI/CD speed at that level. That’s validation. Interestingly, we didn’t really see it for what it was at the time. We were only thinking of the end vision of taking over the CI world completely, and Satellites was just an implementation milestone that we happened to publish as a product along the way. So we just shrugged and figured, “Ok, if this is how people react to this incomplete offering, imagine how they will react to the full vision of Earthly CI!” Milestone 3: Earthly CI Almost everyone who was using Satellites was using them in a CI/CD use case. Meaning that they executed remote Satellite builds via CI with the main goal of speeding up their pipelines. In this configuration, the CI vendor is merely a pass-through that deals with triggering pipelines. The actual execution happens on the satellites. To us, that was validation that Earthly CI was needed. Why not just simplify the stack? Why pay both the CI vendor and us, when you can just pay us? Plus, many Earthly community members were asking about the possibility of hooking up Earthly Satellites directly to GitHub. More validation. Whenever we spoke to VPs of engineering, the promise of 2-20X faster builds was making their eyes light up! The closer we were getting to the Earthly CI launch, the more of a slam dunk it seemed it was going to be. But, as you already know what this blog post is about, making Earthly CI successful turned out to be more challenging than we thought. The Early Symptoms For Earthly CI, we did a solid launch, landed on TechCrunch, and lined up a few blog articles for Reddit and HackerNews. From the launch we got about 50 emails signing up on the waitlist in the first week or two, outpacing the goals we had. We started setting up calls with these people, and, right off the bat, we could sense a big difference between existing Earthly users vs. people who were coming to us for the first time. These weren’t the raving fans we were used to talking with. New people would look at Earthly CI with a skeptical eye. They were mostly thinking that “all CIs are the same - they just have different syntax,” and then they would not really look any further as to why we might actually be different. As a result, the conversation invariably turned to the cost of migration. How difficult would it be for them to rewrite and adapt a bunch of existing scripts to be able to use Earthly effectively? Existing users, by contrast, were already fans, had already done the work of the migration, and already saw the benefits of Earthly. They were ready to champion us in their organizations, even if not everyone in their organization was on board yet. We kept talking to as many teams as we could, to understand the apprehension toward Earthly CI, but it always came back to weighing the cost of migration vs. the benefit. And we could never win this up-front, mainly because these prospects had no idea whether we could deliver on the benefits we promised at scale. We don’t have a long-established reputation like our incumbents. Existing users claimed we were 10x easier to use, but how can you prove that to a new client on a quick Zoom call? So it didn’t make sense for them to jump head-first into an expensive and time-consuming migration effort just because some startup they had never heard of promised to deliver the sun and the moon. We also tried getting existing Earthly Satellite customers to switch to Earthly CI – after all, they were all using Satellites in their CIs. The problem with this group was that they were already getting 95% of the value of Earthly CI through Satellites. Their builds were already really fast. Compared to a GitHub Actions + Satellite setup, Earthly CI wasn’t better, or at least, it wasn’t better enough to warrant the switch. And then, after the launch traffic died down… There was silence. The Most Ridiculous Negative Lead Qualification Criteria Ever The odd thing about direct calls with prospects was that we could never convince them to try out any of our products when talking to them face to face. Not Earthly CI, not Satellites, not even Earthly. At this point, we probably had over 100 calls with prospects. We were hearing over and over how they spent 2 years migrating to their current setup, how they put so much effort into it, and how throwing all that away would be so wasteful. And how annoying it is to switch CIs. And yet, when users were coming on their own to our website, through a mix of product-led / word of mouth and content marketing, the adoption of Earthly was happening every single day. At a very significant and increasing rate. What seemed like absolutely impossible with one approach was being proven as very much possible - perhaps even easy - with a different approach. In retrospect, it’s of course obvious that there’s no way to sell developer products via traditional means. And we already knew that. We were just shocked at how stark of a difference the approach could create. It became clear that a direct GTM approach would not help us validate a product like Earthly CI. We ended up with the most ridiculous negative qualification criteria I have ever heard of: if the prospect requires a demo, then they’re not worth going after. The type of prospect that does convert will come to us after they downloaded Earthly, read some docs, and wrote a bunch of Earthfiles. These teams never need a demo. It’s weird, but demoing is one of the strongest negative signals we have. The moral of the story here is that when you introduce a developer tool that requires integration work (work outside of the development team’s commonly expected flow, work that replicates already existing work, and work that requires learning a new syntax or API), you can never force, or hurry anyone to adopt it. This can only happen on the user’s schedule. People will buy a developer tool, but you can’t sell it. We all know that engineers like to get their hands dirty and explore things on their own. This conclusion is the corollary of that well-known fact. That’s why you can’t hard sell to engineers. You can only soft-sell. Problems Converting Earthly Users Our other big channel was converting existing Earthly users into Earthly CI users. This was a key segment because there is no migration concern - everyone in this segment has already converted to Earthfiles. It should be just a flip of a switch, right?… Right?… Not so fast. What about the GitHub plugins ecosystem? Do you have a codecov action? Do you have manual triggers? Can I trigger based on a git tag creation? Can I select the machine size? Can I cancel stale builds? Can I trust your platform with our build secrets? Our Earthly CI MVP, despite being the fastest CI ever, never met some key requirements for people. Sure, there were a few enthusiasts who did play around with Earthly CI and started using it. But there were no sizeable organizations, with budgets, willing to use it more widely than just 2-3 engineers. And even the few Earthly CI users, after a while converted into Satellites users, to get the benefit of the combination of a richer GitHub ecosystem and the speed of the Satellites. But for the most part, the Earthly community came to our product mainly for the value proposition of consistent builds. Since we were now trying to sell the fast builds value prop instead, well, our audience just wasn’t qualified that way. The match was poor. And the few organizations that did have both of these needs ended up becoming Satellite customers instead. Not that we minded the Satellite customers, but it wasn’t helping to validate Earthly CI as a product. Validating the Invalidation At this point, we could see that things weren’t going according to plan. Calls weren’t converting. Existing Satellite customers weren’t converting. And existing Earthly users weren’t converting. We knew that we needed to change things up, but we weren’t yet thinking that Earthly CI itself was the problem. At this point, the messaging on our website was saying “Earthly makes CI super simple” and most of the content on the first page was about CI, CI, CI. Gavin Johnson, our PMM, had the interesting idea to A/B-test swapping the word “CI” for the word “build” on our website: “Earthly makes builds super simple”. Inside I kinda thought that it was somewhat of a ridiculous idea… we’re trying to push for our grand vision, and we don’t want to be bucketed into the “builds” space by investors (a space with limited commercial success). CI is where it’s at. But I didn’t have any better ideas either, so we went with it. And then the results came in. This one-word change ended up doubling conversions to the “Get Earthly” page – the main CTA on our website. 🤯 Now we were starting to get really doubtful about this Earthly CI thing. Lessons From Another Life In the fall of 2016, long before Earthly, I, along with two co-founders, a really smart code analysis scientist, and an incredibly dedicated team, started ShiftLeft (nowadays called Qwiet.ai). Our vision was to build a security agent that you could install in production and it would protect your cloud app from attacks on vulnerabilities that you have in your source code. This was an incredibly complex system, which required that we build an entire code analyzer that would work with multiple programming languages, runtime agents for individual runtimes, and a distributed backend to integrate everything. The complexity was akin to three companies, all being built by one tiny startup. And yet, we somehow got one programming language to work end-to-end after over a year of effort, even if it was incredibly buggy initially. We tried to put it on the market - after all “if you’re not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late”. After several attempts, we realized that it wasn’t appealing to the market. ShiftLeft being a security product, our target audience was heavily regulated enterprises. These enterprises, by definition, have a lot of red tape, and it is difficult to put anything in production without extensive bureaucracy. To make matters worse, you had to put this both in CI/CD, for the code analysis, and in production, for the runtime protection, thus creating a virtually impossible insertion motion. But to overcome the difficulty of insertion, we always thought that it just needed more features. With enough features, surely the customer will accept the difficulty of insertion anyway! I mean… looking at the product it was obvious that it had all these rough edges. Maybe it’s more appealing if we smooth out the rough edges. It just needs to bake in the oven for a bit longer. And bake it we did. For another year and a half. And still… Nobody. Wanted. It. Looking back on the experience, we made many mistakes, which, at this point, sound like startup cliche: We did not build the product incrementally, with user feedback informing every step of the execution. There were some early signals that certain aspects of the product did not align with what the industry needs, but we didn’t listen. We just kept building. Luckily, we later realized that this complex product can be split into two other products: a security code introspector for security experts, and a standalone code analyzer that is 40 times faster than any other code analyzer on the market. Yay! But we lost over a year of work and hired too many people to execute in a direction that never materialized into anything successful. It would have been so much more efficient if we started out by building smaller components of the end vision and selling those components as independent products first. The team would have been leaner, we would have had an MVP faster, and we would have had customer feedback much sooner, to help direct the roadmap. My biggest regret from the experience was that we did not stop earlier when the signs were there. Fast forward to today, learning from mistakes of the past, at Earthly we built everything incrementally. And we even put products on the market that initially seemed like purely engineering intermediate milestones. Each product builds on top of the previous achievements, thus allowing for incremental iteration with the customer in mind. We’re now seeing our latest incremental iteration not working in the marketplace. And, knowing what I know about early products, it’s not the missing features that are the problem. What’s Next for Earthly? Here’s how I rationalize what’s happening: People want faster builds. People hate switching CIs. There is a stigma toward new CIs in general. Specifically that they are undifferentiated. It’s hard to shake that bias, and we scare people off as soon as they see “CI” on our website. Design-partner type of engagements don’t work when we try to engage with customers directly, due to the perceived high cost of migration. The Earthly CI MVP isn’t validating, failing to create a significant enough early adopter group. When we tell people that they can get faster builds without switching their CI (i.e. through Earthly Satellites), their eyes light up. Failing to create enough meaningful initial traction with an MVP, for some the conclusion might be simple: “It just needs more features,” or “just put it back in the oven.” But I know what a promising product’s initial traction looks like, and this is not it. If this were the real deal, there would be a group of people tolerating the absence of features for the benefits. But that’s not happening here, or at least not to a meaningful enough degree. So, our conclusion is that we need to shut down Earthly CI and refocus our energy on what is working: Earthly and Earthly Satellites. [^1] But Vlad, you’re deprecating the thing you just launched? Well, yes. We failed fast. And that is a success in my book (or at least that’s what I keep telling myself to feel better about it). Imagine if we had built only Earthly CI from the get-go. Just like with ShiftLeft, the components of the end-vision ended up being more valuable than the original end-vision itself. Only this time, we discovered that much more efficiently. Wrapping Up Earthly CI is shutting down on October 1st, 2023. If you are a user, you have my sincere gratitude for experimenting with Earthly CI - it’s because of people like you that there is any innovation in the world. You took a chance on us, and we appreciate it from the bottom of our hearts. Migration off Earthly CI is really easy because Earthly works with any CI. And if you want to keep getting fast builds, you can plug in Earthly Satellites (there’s now a free tier too - yay!). Despite Earthly CI having been marked as beta / experimental, we will fully support your transition off of it. We will be hands-on in the Earthly Slack community to help you out every step of the way! We remain committed to serving our users with the utmost care. It seems that Earthly Satellites are taking off, not just because we are delivering fast and consistent builds, but also, crucially, because we are letting users keep their own CI. Given this signal, it makes sense for us, as a company, to continue to invest in this direction. In fact, by shutting down Earthly CI, we have more time to execute on a number of things that the Earthly community have been asking us about: Satellite metrics – including CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O usage. Build history – for both local and Satellites builds – in the web UI. Auto-skip – the ability to skip a build instantly if the changed files don’t impact it. The ability to execute Dockerfile builds remotely on Satellites, as a fast drop-in replacement for docker build. Self-hosted Satellites (a better-supported version of our self-hosted, remote Buildkit). The ability to spread a single build onto multiple Satellites for added speed. Compute v2 - fully distributed, serverless Satellites (this one will take a while to get right). If you’re not a user and you came to this post just for the story, then boy do I have some goodies for you to check out 🙂. Earthly Satellites are ridiculously fast remote build runners that work seamlessly with any CI. It is available via Earthly Cloud and free to get started. Satellites are built on top of our open source build framework, Earthly. Earthly gives you write once, run anywhere build consistency, making it super easy to reproduce CI failures on your local computer. Earthly and Satellites together are like peanut butter and jelly – fast, consistent builds that work with any CI and are easy to debug locally. Come check us out at earthly.dev! Earthly makes CI/CD super simple Fast, repeatable CI/CD with an instantly familiar syntax – like Dockerfile and Makefile had a baby. Learn More Vlad A. Ionescu Founder of Earthly.

The issue was really this: Earthly being open-source, Earthy Satellite users were already seeing the benefit from 95% of Earthly CI.I’m a huge fan of open source, however, if your business model includes an open source model - you need a differentiator. Beyond blazingly fast(tm). You need a reason for people to offer up their credit cards, or better, their accounting PO process. You need a feature you withhold or a service you provide from the open source offering to make it appealing.GitLab restricts CI&#x2F;CD to paying customers. Travis&#x2F;CircleCI limit on build time&#x2F;credits unless also open source. Azure DevOps is the devil. ArgoCD is complicated. GitHub actions are nice if you have hardware to run the runners. Swarm’s of Jenkins is what most are used to in the enterprise.As a former Director of DevOps, my immediate question will be what features make me want to buy vs host myself. I’m technically capable. Why should I buy with you when I can run my cloud and my DevOps pipelines for my workforce the way that makes the most sense for my business? Help me make the most sense.*EDIT* I&#x27;m not suggesting withholding features that are critical for the software to operate, but withholding business features that provide support or enterprise-level integration. Even making it tiered so the power users pay less because they support it more themselves? reply dpeckett 17 hours agoparentI&#x27;m not sure feature withholding has traditionally worked out well in the developer space. The churn rate for tooling is so high that if Earthly were to intentionally cripple their product I&#x27;m sure the majority of developers would just move on to other inferior, but free, options (eg. taskfile). Maybe those that remain could be converted successfully but it&#x27;s quite a gamble.A great turn around story in recent times though is probably Docker. But that required them to abandon strict open source and make controversial license&#x2F;product changes. reply imiric 16 hours agorootparentFor the open core model to work, the OSS product should be standalone and featureful. If users feel like it&#x27;s just used to advertise a commercial product, it doesn&#x27;t work. And the commercial product should offer value-added services and features that are not strictly required for the base OSS product. These should be features directed towards advanced or corporate users, and preferably something that competitors lack, or don&#x27;t do a good job of.It&#x27;s very tricky to balance the open core model correctly, which is why not many companies get it right. You need to invest equally, if not more, in the OSS product, and make sure users are happy with it before you even mention a commercial addon. Grafana is another example of companies that understand and do this well. reply caseyohara 12 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m not sure feature withholding has traditionally worked out well in the developer space.I think it&#x27;s worked out well for Sidekiq (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekiq.org). I really like their model of layering valuable features between the OSS &#x2F; Pro &#x2F; Enterprise licenses.The trick is you have to do that very early on. Nerfing your open source offering by making some existing features paid-only is always going to get some backlash. reply tazjin 14 hours agorootparentprevIn this particular case, developers could also move on to a superior and completely open alternative (Nix), so making even a semi-closed alternative with much fewer people contributing etc. was already a hard sell. reply JustLurking2022 14 hours agorootparentSeriously, is there an email distro or something to notify Nix users when there&#x27;s a new post to go troll? It&#x27;s not suitable for 90%+ of users, which seems a far cry from superior. reply tazjin 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s just very noticeable when half of what the industry seems to spend its time on is solved problems. You and all the others have to learn why touching the hot stove is a bad idea the same way most children do. It&#x27;s frustrating to observe.It&#x27;s fine to criticise Nix for its various flaws, but any suggestion of an \"alternative\" that has learned nothing from it is just a collective waste of time. replypjmlp 4 hours agorootparentprevThat is why most developer products have gone back to the timesharing days. reply ljm 12 hours agorootparentprevThe open source version has to be good and valuable enough for you to bring it in as a dependency in a basic setup, and then the paid versions provide support for larger scale setups where the requirements are a bit different.There are many ways to do that, depending on what you&#x27;re offering. Limits and quotas are easy enough. reply BlackjackCF 15 hours agorootparentprevI think a nice compromise is the CircleCI&#x2F;Travis model of providing limited build credits&#x2F;hours. If you’re a small shop or single dev, you can use the core product for free, with the hope that you’d convert to a paying user if your business grows past the free constraint. reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, not suggesting feature withholding per se, but a differentiator on why one would buy vs run the OSS build. reply staunton 16 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the difference? reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparentplugins, hardware, hosting, support, there&#x27;s a number of ways to offer a service for an open source project. Open Core models come to mind. Another is not having enterprise SSO as part of the core. Or not having clustering. Something that would make a VP think twice about adopting your open source solution vs using you as a vendor. reply justin_oaks 15 hours agorootparentI know these are examples, so I don&#x27;t want to pick on you too much, but I have one nitpick: Reserving SSO for enterprise customers is awful. Please don&#x27;t do it.See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sso.tax&#x2F; for details but I&#x27;ll quote this from it \"SSO is a core security requirement for any company with more than five employees\" reply imiric 15 hours agorootparentIf a company requires SSO, they&#x27;ll surely have a budget for paying for the products and services they use. The majority of OSS users won&#x27;t have this requirement, and likely won&#x27;t have the budget to pay for commercial features. So it doesn&#x27;t make sense to give away a service that has a maintenance cost to everyone, as long as it&#x27;s fairly priced. reply debarshri 14 hours agorootparentprevLet me give a contrarian argument. I dont think it is awful to have sso reserved only for enterprise customers. I think enterprise customer who are going through compliance will definitely have to but into that tier therefore.If you think you need SSO and but you do not have the budget for upgrading to their enterprise tier, may be you are not the right customer that they are targeting to sell. It is not you, it is them. reply justin_oaks 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right. I was thinking from the position of the consumer for which SSO is both convenient and a security feature.I wasn&#x27;t thinking as the service provider that needs a way to force the folks with the big bucks to pay up.It sucks for the little companies, but it may be necessary for the service to do so. reply rhaps0dy 15 hours agorootparentprevBut it should be OK to reserve SSO for paying customers. reply lelanthran 4 hours agorootparentprev> I know these are examples, so I don&#x27;t want to pick on you too much, but I have one nitpick: Reserving SSO for enterprise customers is awful. Please don&#x27;t do it.SSO is expensive, adding maybe $10&#x2F;user&#x2F;month if the team adds in a purchased solution (passing the cost directly onto the client).If the customer doesn&#x27;t want to pay for it because they aren&#x27;t an enterprise, you can&#x27;t blame the supplier for not supplying it at a lower price than $10&#x2F;user&#x2F;month. reply BoorishBears 14 hours agorootparentprevAs others are pointing out, once you&#x27;ve grown big enough that you can&#x27;t trust everyone with the keys go the kingdom: enterprise pricing is for you.SSO Tax is a fun meme, but it misses the point: Whether it&#x27;s 5 people or even 3, you&#x27;ve scaled your business enough to hire people who aren&#x27;t in the inner circle.That&#x27;s a fair place to consider you an enterprise. reply justin_oaks 12 hours agorootparentNot sure what you&#x27;re talking about. It&#x27;s not like without SSO everyone in the company has to all use the same password. Services allow people to have separate users with separate privileges. reply BoorishBears 11 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you&#x27;re unaware of why SSO is considered a security feature at all them, but it&#x27;s covered right on the site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sso.tax&#x2F;It&#x27;s to allow centralized access management. Stuff like firing someone and revoking their access from one platform instantly, instead running around and changing permissions in every tool manually. Or ensuring people in department A can&#x27;t be invited to some platform for people in department B in order to limit information access.SSO tax is predicated on the idea that the moment you outgrow the informal arrangements and liberal access, you&#x27;re really a business. Seems pretty fair? reply smaudet 10 hours agorootparent> It sounds like you&#x27;re unaware of why SSO is considered a security featureTechnically it&#x27;s an anti feature...The \"feature\" you are talking about is really identity management not sign on (which, btw, users have different identites, outside of the scope of a single company).At its core it&#x27;s just a delete function for a username. Putting that in a script with http access should be enough (and not put behind a ridiculous price tag).Separate services otherwise are enough, no need for SSO. reply lelanthran 3 hours agorootparent> At its core it&#x27;s just a delete function for a username. Putting that in a script with http access should be enough (and not put behind a ridiculous price tag).Can you explain more about how this works for SSO?Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to launch a product (which I am), and want to have SSO as part of the package (which I do), how do I implement what you just said?I looked into SSO services and they&#x27;re bloody expensive, so if I can cheaply do it myself, I will. reply BoorishBears 10 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree: I communicated how SSO&#x27;s value prop is defined by essentially the entire SaaS industry... if you have a problem with that value prop, Okta alone is 13B worth of short potential for you once everyone realizes they could just use a script with http access. replygabereiser 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you have more than 5 employees, I’m sending you a sales rep to sell SSO to you. reply mavelikara 8 hours agorootparentI am going to the competitor. I am paying for the software, but I don’t want your “enterprise tier”, which is really designed for 1000+ employee companies.BTW, I did just this this morning. The AE came back to offer the enterprise package for the price of the mid-tier package. reply justin_oaks 12 hours agorootparentprevI see, I see. The world isn&#x27;t fair. We have 5 employees and we want SSO but don&#x27;t need SSO. So we&#x27;ll go without it. It&#x27;s annoying for us but it allows your business to exist because enterprise needs SSO. reply caloique 12 hours agorootparentprevCo-founder of BoxyHQ here - We&#x27;ve crafted an open-source enterprise SSO because we firmly believe that robust security shouldn&#x27;t be a privilege limited to large organizations. Ideally, essential enterprise-level features like this should become commonplace for all.While we acknowledge the reasons behind SSO being in the enterprise tier, we&#x27;re all on a collective journey to enhance our security measures. Open Core models are indeed a good option (my preference), yet the dynamics vary across solutions and industries. It&#x27;s up to each of us to explore, experiment, and discover what resonates with our market. In doing so, we can foster growth while maintaining our commitment to supporting the community in the long run. reply gabereiser 8 hours agorootparentWell stated. I was merely showing how one could implement an open core strategy. I’m a firm believer in SSO for all (and not limited to social platforms or GitHub). replyhnlmorg 13 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m not sure feature withholding has traditionally worked out well in the developer space.It’s worked well for GitHub, Slack, and pretty much every service that only offer SSO behind enterprise subscriptions.The trick is to offer enough to make people productive but not so much that there isn’t a worthwhile upgrade path. reply dpeckett 13 hours agorootparentTrue (for web apps and multiuser applications).Earthly is a single binary CLI on top of Docker buildkit so it&#x27;s a bit trickier for them. reply hnlmorg 2 hours agorootparentI’m not claiming it’s easy. Just that withholding features while still offering free tiers is a tried and tested business model that has demonstrated a lot of success for a lot of companies. reply edgyquant 10 hours agorootparentprevNeither GitHub nor slack are open source reply hnlmorg 2 hours agorootparentBoth GitHub and Slack have free tiers. Same principle, different software license. reply maratc 15 hours agoparentprev> Swarm’s of Jenkins is what most are used to in the enterprise.Thanks, I thought we were one of the last places with that setup, nice to know this unholy contraption is actually somewhat standard. reply gabereiser 8 hours agorootparentIt’s the one true daemon of the enterprise. Unholy. Can’t die. You’ll find it in the darkest places. But it does it’s masters bidding. reply ilyt 15 hours agoparentprevFrom my experience hosting our own instance of Gitlab + few CI&#x2F;CD workers was few weeks of initial work (integrating with company&#x27;s LDAP etc.) then around one ops-week per year worth of maintenance over last few years (50+ developers, dozens and dozens of projects).Before that we had just \"a git server + jenkins + some slaves\" that took even less maintenance (althought I&#x27;d imagine more fumbling on dev side with job config)Earthly isn&#x27;t cheaper than any of those options and none of our clients use it (and we occasionally have to work on client&#x27;s gitlab instances). reply gabereiser 14 hours agorootparentYou just described a great starting point for a small shop, I would recommend this route 100%.Initially your CI&#x2F;CD needs to be close to the code. It needs to be close to developers. Not a DevOps department. It needs to be almost forgettable. Include a config in your repo, bam, welcome to the pipeline.Where this breaks down is when you don’t have LDAP, you have Azure IDP + Amazon’s Cognito + Keycloak 3rd Parties + SAML (barf) + Form Login for contractors + JWT&#x2F;OAuth for services.This is the inflection point where you need DevSecOps + Architecture + Cloud Engineers to ensure everyone’s playing nicely. Enjoy your pods. Let us know when you need that VPN tunnel to your customers backend because they don’t trust SSL. reply maccard 13 hours agorootparentprevWe use buildkite but if I was starting fresh now I would just use github with github actions. reply jangxx 17 hours agoparentprevYou can self-host Gitlab CI runners and use them even in the free community version. reply gabereiser 17 hours agorootparentI know, this is what I’ve been doing for years. (edit on GitHub, not GitLab, didn’t know GitLab allowed community CI now) reply prometheon1 15 hours agorootparentI thought using your own runners for free in Gitlab was already an option before Github Actions even existed reply gabereiser 15 hours agorootparentWhen it was an open source project, yes. You are correct. Ever since GitLab went commercial, it&#x27;s been behind a paywall. Apparently you can run runners on self-managed CE so I&#x27;m going to look into that. reply jcrawfordor 10 hours agorootparent(GitLab employee but familiar with this because I use it personally as well)You can always connect your own runners to GitLab, whether SaaS or self-hosted, and whether free&#x2F;CE or premium&#x2F;ultimate&#x2F;EE. GitLab SaaS also comes with free use of the central runners up to a quota. I&#x27;m not sure about the history here but as far as I know this has always been the case. reply gabereiser 8 hours agorootparentCirca 2013? I remember vividly implementing gitlab at a certain cable company I worked at because they were too cheap for GitHub. I remember sometime in 2012 some merging of worlds of GitLab CI and GitLab.com, it was around that timeframe until 2015 or so when the unofficial runner because official and CI and Repos were merged? You work there, ask the oldest grey beard if this was the case. I could very well be mistaken and have false memory. reply smashed 12 hours agorootparentprevOn Gitlab.com you need to input a valid credit card once in order to validate your account, but you can still get 400 minutes on shared runners for free.This is used to combat abuse and crypto miners, they don&#x27;t actually charge the card.You can also connect your own private runner to either the saas or self-hosted gitlab-ce for free, you just have to provide your own runner. reply mindwok 11 hours agorootparentprevGitLab is still an open source project (the core of it is MIT licensed) and using your own runners has always been an option. Also, free accounts on the SaaS version get free CI&#x2F;CD minutes as well. reply nivenhuh 11 hours agorootparentprevI run a self-managed CE GitLab with my own runners — works as expected (no payment required). reply bottled_poe 11 hours agorootparentSame, been doing this for many years and upgrade frequently. reply jangxx 17 hours agorootparentprevThen I guess I misunderstood \"GitLab restricts CI&#x2F;CD to paying customers\"? reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparentSorry, I misread your comment as GitHub, not GitLab. I was unaware you can run CI runners on GitLab community version. reply Spivak 17 hours agorootparentprevAnd honestly I can&#x27;t even imagine ever using the public runners because they&#x27;re permissionless. It&#x27;s way easier to have them live in your own network and doling out permissions via tags that get picked up by different runners with different iam roles. reply chrisweekly 16 hours agorootparent(mods: please forgive the off-topic personal question here)Hi Spivak, You&#x27;re not Lee Spivak (formerly of Upromise in the early 2000&#x27;s), are you? reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparentThis is why some people don’t leave the house. reply stavros 8 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re too happy to have their username recognized by strangers on internet forums? reply gabereiser 8 hours agorootparentWell, in this case, leave the house… replysanderjd 14 hours agoparentprevI know this is controversial, but I wish commercial \"source available\" were the more mainstream &#x2F; not-shat-upon approach to services, rather than \"open core\".I find it very frustrating to not be able to read the code or contribute bug fixes or self-host anything outside the \"open core\", and I have no need for any of the things that distinguish \"open source\" licenses from \"source available\" ones. reply dpeckett 13 hours agorootparentStallman was right. I think it&#x27;s inevitable we&#x27;ll see the next generation of developer focused tooling go in the direction of AGPL or source available (eg. BSL). Ironically enough Earthly started off as BSL. reply sanderjd 12 hours agorootparentWhat did Stallman say about this? reply AlphaSite 4 hours agoparentprevI think the main competitor is gitlab and GitHub, it’s very hard to compete with them. It’s not competing with earthly OSS. Personally the reason we haven’t used earthly satellites or CI is because we can’t use them inside the corporate firewalls, nor does it integrate with our existing CI tools super well, e.g. gitlab.We use it and love it but it’s missing important enterprise features like that and SSO. reply hhh 17 hours agoparentprevI feel almost certain someone could wrap ArgoCD into a product if they handled the &#x27;patternization&#x27; of applicationsets. D2iQ already do it with Flux, but we bailed on D2iQ before we even got to try it. reply gabereiser 16 hours agorootparentArgoCD is almost worthless if your DevOps teams are IaC wielders. Honestly, just a bash script to push a container to the pods is all that’s required for DevOps deployment. A build pipeline should be get artifacts -> put artifacts in container -> push container to registry -> trigger a pull on your pods. If you didn’t have a standard cloud architecture, I can understand the frustration and reasoning behind looking at ArgoCD. If you have a standardized cloud practice, it’s moot. reply hhh 12 hours agorootparentMy needs are more 1 application, 150 configurations, 150 clusters. reply isoprophlex 16 hours agoparentprev> Azure DevOps is the devil.Amen to that! reply shandor 16 hours agorootparentIs there an actual technical point beyond ”MS bad” for this sentiment?Honestly asking, as I’ve been mostly hearing positive things about AzDO, and from developers of all people. reply WorldMaker 15 hours agorootparentAzDO is \"decent\", depending on your needs, but it&#x27;s in an unfortunate zombie state where Microsoft is supporting it just enough to keep it stable and keep certain enterprises happy and consistently insisting that AzDO has a roadmap and is still beloved, but it is very clear that all of the actual resources are going to the GitHub side of the house in 2023.(One of the most recent signs of this crazy zombie state that a recent feature for AzDO was given the absurd only Microsoft could do brand name \"GitHub Advanced Secure for Azure DevOps\", and it is indeed a bundle of GitHub features several years old at this point finally provided to AzDO users. Other signs include all sorts of AzDO libraries and roadmaps and related repos openly hosted on GitHub with last updated dates in 2019 and 2020.)From an outsider perspective, Microsoft probably has a lot of sentimental and internal engineering reasons it doesn&#x27;t want to truly wrap up so much of its operations in North Carolina (AzDO&#x27;s ancestral home going back to early days of TFS), but the writing seems to be on the wall that what&#x27;s left is a skeleton crew mostly working for GitHub full time and then sort of applying things part time back to AzDO. It doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be sustainable long term, and every day it feels more like an Old Yeller situation where Microsoft is just prolonging the inevitable and making the pain worse for everyone involved. reply hotnfresh 15 hours agorootparentUgh, they’re busy bringing bad project management to GitHub, in a quest to make it suck as much as all the others.The old issues + tags + milestones was perfect. Now it’s the same needlessly-heavy thing as all the rest, with their reimagined “projects” thingy.But then again I’ve not once seen a PM embrace any version of GitHub’s project management, with the only explanation forthcoming being “it’s confusing for non-technical users” (fucking how? More confusing than Jira or Asana? No friggin’ way) so maybe they have to shit it up and make it hard to use and easy to get lost in or miss info in, to get any traction with PMs. reply WorldMaker 15 hours agorootparentIt does seem a case where Microsoft dogfooding GitHub may be actively making it worse. They&#x27;ve done several BUILD and GitHub Universe videos \"How Microsoft Uses GitHub to Build [X]\" and their PMs certainly need all those complex features to track stuff and those videos are the closest to training materials on how to use some of it, and it is definitely a lot going on.It definitely seems one of those sorts of \"every system PMs touch is doomed to become unmanageable complexity\" laws and GitHub \"Projects\" does seem to be exponentially closer to being \"Jira 2: Electric Boogaloo\" every day. reply gabereiser 15 hours agorootparentprevThis. AzDO will die. It will be replaced entirely by Github. It originally was only designed as a way to get people onto Azure using their already-existing MS partnership to give it away for free. The only purpose, drive adoption of Azure Cloud. In runners, resources, stickiness, and preventing abandoning ship. reply rhaway84773 14 hours agorootparentAzure Devops existed well before GitHub was owned by MS under Visual Studio Online moniker.It was intended to be a SAAS version of the on Prem offerings MS has provided since before GitHub even existed. reply gabereiser 8 hours agorootparentI know it’s history and I know it’s future. reply datadrivenangel 16 hours agorootparentprevADO makes me yearn for Jira.The boards are terrible, the UI is hard, the permissions are incomprehensible, it doesn&#x27;t even integrate that nicely with Azure.On paper it does everything, it practice it can be made to do everything, but it&#x27;s like getting citrus drenched sandpaper papercuts every day. reply shandor 16 hours agorootparentHah, thanks for that mental image.As I said the positivive sentiments I heard came from developers, and TFA is about CI (rather than boards etc. that JIRA handles, so is there maybe anything remotely positive in how AzDO implements CI, git integration, testing, etc? Or is it just rotten to the core?Hard to imagine someone would hate it more than Bitbucket Pipelines or, god forbid, Bamboo. Buuut I’m more than open-minded if need be. reply WorldMaker 15 hours agorootparentAzDO Pipelines was directly the first draft of what became GitHub Actions, so technically it does have a lot to recommend it, especially if you learn the Multi-Stage YAML approach which does sort of directly feed into GitHub Actions for the eventual day you decide to migrate. reply datadrivenangel 13 hours agorootparentYeah, the Pipelines are okay all things considered. replyAaronM 16 hours agoparentprevDid you mean argowf instead of argocd?

The pretty UI is mostly secondary to its main purpose for me, which is to keep the declarative \"truth\" in source control, and have ArgoCD be the control loop that keeps the cluster in sync with that truth. Accidentally nuked namespace? No worries, ArgoCD&#x27;s (or whatever alternative, like flux) got your back! reply rrrix1 12 hours agorootparentExactly this. The critical difference being who deploys and when&#x2F;how your resources are deployed - a human, or a machine.Having git be the source of truth of your production environment is a blessing and a curse which is directly related to the maturity of the deployment system.If you have low confidence in your deployments (as in, you don&#x27;t deploy very often and don&#x27;t have full e2e tests & monitoring), GitOps is nightmarishly scary compared to classic, battle tested Ops team CLI scripts. reply gabereiser 7 hours agorootparentprevI don’t accidentally do anything in production.

Developers don&#x27;t want slow pipelines, but that does not mean they want fast pipelines. The speed that the pipeline works is more depending on how the pipeline is setup than the overhead of the pipeline service, and other CICD services are already blazing fast.

Caching and parallelization _also_ works locally, so I see that speedup in development. reply Too 5 hours agorootparentDependency graph is a feature of the build system with better understanding of the language import rules than the CI system can have (or whatever terminology you want to use). Good ones can hermetically, concurrently and deterministic build only the files that were changed.Earthly is just a thin wrapper on top of docker multi stage builds[1]. Such docker layers are one-dimensional, meaning if one of the steps are calling “make”, that step will have to rebuild that entire layer, not just the one c++ file that changed. There are solutions to this with --mount,type=cache but they take away the reproducibility and and are equally possible with plain dockerfiles.[1] tbh I don’t know if this is the case, but that’s how others explain it. This is core problem with Earthly. They don’t say how it works, just that you will magically get 20x faster. Without understanding how, I don’t know how to take that seriously and I can only assume it’s snake oil.I mean, there is a need for a better Dockerfile syntax. But then market it as such! Not as magic 20x faster builds. reply rewmie 2 hours agorootparentprev> How do you usually do caching for complex, multi-language projects in this case?As a software engineer, I do my best to keep my systems as simple as possible.

Other than saving a few pennies here and there in pipeline runs, you do not have anything to gain.

Not sure how containers solve these problems. My point being that this tool solves some problems for some teams and maybe for a lot of teams that struggle with this problem, but hard problems remain and this isn’t a silver bullet for that. You can’t outsource stability of the project-specific test infrastructure which is where most of the cost lies these days I think. replyalexvitkov 19 hours agoprevWhat does fast CI even mean?CI is an overgrown shell script running your build and telling you when it fails. In general build tooling has gotten so slow that the cost of whatever CI runner relative to it should be nil.If you want fast CI you need fast tsc, clang, rustc, etc... not a faster program that calls exec on them.A bit more on topic, if you&#x27;re selling CI and your business fails it&#x27;s because people you&#x27;re providing no value - people can run their build scripts fine without you. reply jcranmer 19 hours agoparentPerusing this article quickly, it means a CI that is automatically handling things like caching build artifacts so that you don&#x27;t need to recompile your entire repository every single commit.

This let&#x27;s it be 100% certain about whether it can cache parts of the build.If you are familiar with docker layer-based caching and Bazel, you can imagine how Earthly works to eliminate rework in builds.Here is a small monorepo example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;earthly&#x2F;earthly-solutions reply aidos 19 hours agorootparentprevI looked at Earthly just a couple of weeks back.

Maybe will save some time on dependencies if they take some time to install and devs were too lazy to set up own workers and used ephemeral runners instead.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.earthly.dev&#x2F;basics&#x2F;part-1-a-simple-earthfile reply danudey 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s step one, &#x27;how to write a basic Earthfile that just does the thing&#x27;, so they don&#x27;t delve into the details of caching and how it works, but look at the whole block and not just that one line; it operates like a Dockerfile: build: COPY build.gradle .&#x2F; COPY src src RUN gradle build RUN gradle install SAVE ARTIFACT build&#x2F;install&#x2F;java-example&#x2F;bin &#x2F;bin SAVE ARTIFACT build&#x2F;install&#x2F;java-example&#x2F;lib &#x2F;libThe COPY phases copy files into the build context. If the files haven&#x27;t changed, then the commands don&#x27;t need to be run. In other words, if `build.gradle` and `src` are unchanged, it won&#x27;t run `gradle build` or `gradle install`, and it&#x27;ll just give you the artifacts from the previous build.They have a golang example in part three[0], which they redesign to use caching effectively: build: # Download deps before copying code.

RUN go build -o output&#x2F;example main.go SAVE ARTIFACT output&#x2F;example AS LOCAL local-output&#x2F;go-exampleThey copy in go.mod and go.sum and then run `go mod download`.

If the `main.go` file hasn&#x27;t changed, `go build` doesn&#x27;t need to be run.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.earthly.dev&#x2F;basics&#x2F;part-3-adding-dependencies-w... reply brabel 17 hours agorootparentGradle can do the caching of tasks itself in a level of granularity no CI can. If you keep your build cache \"live\" in the CI, Gradle knows to only recompile what has changed, and to only run tests which changed (or tests something which changed). I am not sure if many other build systems do that, but this is something I would absolutely expect from the build system, not CI. Do you not expect caching when building locally??The whole idea with CI doing this is wrong IMO. All I want CI to do is call a couple of commands after setting up the environment (which would include the Gradle cache or whatever to speed up things - no need for your revolutionary CI build system). reply theamk 14 hours agorootparentprevsure, but in a java project, how likely you are to have a commit with no changes to src&#x2F;? or for a go project, how likely is it that you want to duplicate you entire dependency tree in a clunky, non-parallel dependency description language, vs just doing \"COPY * .; RUN go build\" and letting golang figure it all out and build in parallel using all the cores?Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there is definitely value in caching dependencies, and I can see Earthly approach help if you have, say, a Python app, with 10 minutes of dependency install time, 0 build time, and 10 seconds of tests - you&#x27;ll see huge improvement. But you&#x27;ll also see almost the same improvement if you use Dockerfile on a persistent host instead, and as a bonus you won&#x27;t have to learn new system.One place Earthly might shine are monorepos with multiple independent projects that even use multiple build systems... but I am not sure how many of those exist _and_ don&#x27;t have some other caching solution already. reply nvm0n2 16 hours agorootparentprevA CI system like TeamCity will give you that sort of thing for free though, without needing an Earthfile. It just dedupes builds at the same commit, and keeps checkout directories between builds on the agents, so if the build tool has a cache then it&#x27;s automatically reused. Works great.Given that it&#x27;s hard to understand what exactly this is for? Build systems normally try to avoid redundant work for local purposes anyway. Is it some hack for companies that insist on resetting build environments to zero on every single build, and then decide they want caching back? If so, why not just ... let the builds take place in directories containing previous builds, and fix the problems? That&#x27;s what we do at my company and it works great (using gradle), there are only rarely problems with unclean builds and it&#x27;s easy to rerun with a clean checkout if that&#x27;s suspected to be an issue (the bugs are mostly in our own code which does a layer of caching above the build system anyway). reply oftenwrong 8 hours agorootparentOne of the chief benefits of Earthly is builds that are always clean and predictable. This is especially important on a shared build server. reply nvm0n2 1 hour agorootparentSo they claim. And yet ultimately they do it by caching things, same as every other system. replydgb23 18 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t this a complex solution for a problem that shouldn&#x27;t exist? reply crabbone 16 hours agoparentprev> CI is an overgrown shell script running your build and telling you when it fails.Oh, I wish it were that simple...But, I also don&#x27;t know what they measured. But, I&#x27;ll give you just one example. Jenkins default landing page is a disaster in terms of speed. It tries to display data on recent builds everywhere across your cluster. For even not so big clusters this can be hundreds to thousands of items to pull from individual nodes running those builds. I&#x27;ve managed to crash Jenkins more times than I could count by simply loading the landing page w&#x2F;o a particular configuration added that prevents it from its default behavior.CI server will have its own database, typically, managing all sorts of CI entities: jobs, artifacts, users, secretes... It could be quite big and you&#x27;d do well taking care of proper indexing etc.CI will have its assortment of runners, which are often provisioned dynamically (think VM or Docker images that need to be deployed to runner nodes), distributing them across the cluster is also not an easy task, if you want that to work fast. Of course you also want to be able to distribute the artifacts across the cluster -- this also takes time and resources.CI will have its own bookkeeping necessary to, essentially, do garbage collection, reporting and self-diagnostic.In big enough clusters this stuff can have a very high latency, if you don&#x27;t specifically work towards reducing that latency.> If you want fast CI you need fast tsc, clang, rustc, etc... not a faster program that calls exec on them.Ever heard of ccache?But, really, this is also super-naive. To make builds fast in a distributed system that CI is you would also need to figure out how to distribute this cache, how to modularize the builds... You might have heard about how one of the most difficult things in programming is cache invalidation? -- That&#x27;s only partly a joke. reply jnwatson 17 hours agoparentprevThe only part of the Earthly pitch that resonated with me was the ability to run the CI locally. When debugging your CI, it is just faster to find problems when you can run on your own box.I have a gnarly GitHub Actions script that took forever to get right because the debug cycle was 10 minutes long. reply fireflash38 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s one of my biggest complaints about gitlab-ci.

No way to simulate based on vars or anything else.

If there is any situation at all where you use the cached file when you should have rebuilt your tool is not useful.Note that you can go too far. If you rebuild a file on linux even though the only changes were in a \"#ifdef freebsd\" (windows, mac...) section that is a waste of time, but not harmful. However we already have tools that do that. reply esafak 18 hours agorootparentThis is a solved problem; modern build tools and workflow orchestrators face the same challenge. You declare your inputs for a given task and cache the output as long as the inputs are unchanged, as determined by their hash. So there is no wrong guessing, only an incomplete specification of inputs. It&#x27;s an elegant solution, if I do say so, and has worked well at companies I&#x27;ve seen it used. reply duped 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a solved problem, very few builds in the wild are deterministic and reproducible. You have to build up the universe from scratch (like guix and nix) for the caching to be sound enough to be reliable.Just because an algorithm exists that can help doesn&#x27;t mean that the universe of software can fit cleanly into a model where that algorithm is perfect.The other fundamental problem with this model is that it cannot model cyclical dependencies (a degenerate case: glibc needs python which needs glibc). Since you can&#x27;t hash the output until you&#x27;ve hashed the input, and the input hash depends on the output hash you need a way to break the dependency cycle. Tools have varying ways of mitigating this but it&#x27;s not exactly \"solved\" in an elegant sense.And finally, a lot of build steps are faster than hashing their input and outputs. So if you want the utmost performance you need heuristics or a model that allows for some things to be hashed and others to always be considered fresh. reply IshKebab 12 hours agorootparentIt is a solved problem - you need to use a build system with sandboxing like Bazel, and also vendor all your tools.Almost nobody does that because very few people realise it is the solution and even fewer realise they&#x27;re going to need that before they set up their build system. reply smaudet 10 hours agorootparentSwitching to a build system like Bazel can be a significant cost, though.There&#x27;s no easy solution to making your builds go faster, if they aren&#x27;t already.

Sure I can (probably) build curl ten times and get ten technically different binaries, but the differences aren&#x27;t relevant to the functioning of the actual result.Assuming my build environment isn&#x27;t changing out from underneath me (i.e. if I&#x27;m using the same versions of the same dependencies on the same platform with the same compiler toolchain, and I&#x27;m not passing in different arguments or environment variables) then the end result should be functionally identical.> You have to build up the universe from scratch (like guix and nix) for the caching to be sound enough to be reliable.This is a false assertion. If I&#x27;m building (again, as an example) curl, then I don&#x27;t need to be rebuilding the kernel, glibc, kerberos, libssh, gnutls, brotli, etc. all in order to get a working curl build; I just need to make sure the libraries and toolchains I have installed are valid. If I create a docker image with all of the dependencies and toolchains preinstalled, and then I build the exact same curl code inside of that docker container on two separate occasions, then the end result is going to be indistinguishable without hashing the build artifacts.> Just because an algorithm exists that can help doesn&#x27;t mean that the universe of software can fit cleanly into a model where that algorithm is perfect.It doesn&#x27;t need to be perfect, it just needs to be correct for the vast majority of cases (which are not somehow inherently broken already and just haven&#x27;t failed yet).> a degenerate case: glibc needs python which needs glibcBecause you&#x27;re not rebuilding the entire world (in 99% of cases), this doesn&#x27;t actually matter. If you&#x27;re building glibc use the existing build of python that you already have installed, which is the same identical version to the one you used last time you built glibc.If I&#x27;m rebuilding glibc, do I also need to rebuild python? If the glibc code hasn&#x27;t changed, but maybe python has so I get a different result? Well okay, has the python source changed? No? Okay, have the dependencies for python or glibc changed? No? Okay, well problem solved then.I&#x27;m not sure why people have this philosophy of \"this problem isn&#x27;t solved because of some imaginary, unrealistic corner case that either shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place, isn&#x27;t actually a real problem, or that no one will run into\". In 99% of cases it works, and if it&#x27;s not right for a particular circumstance then just don&#x27;t use it in that circumstance. Sometimes makefiles aren&#x27;t the right tool. Sometimes a GUI isn&#x27;t the right tool. Let&#x27;s not argue that we shouldn&#x27;t have GUIs because sometimes running a command on the CLI is easier, and let&#x27;s not argue that an extremely basic caching system that makes sane assumptions that are almost always valid isn&#x27;t a good idea.And the parent is right: if you correctly define your inputs and outputs, then the system works. What those inputs and outputs are is up to you to determine. Maybe for you, the outputs are a working build of glibc, and maybe the inputs are all of the tarballs necessary to build Linux from scratch and a working bootstrap environment, but if all of those inputs and that whole environment are identical to last time, what&#x27;s the point of rebuilding any of them? Maybe there is one, but that&#x27;s up to you to determine and model. reply Karellen 16 hours agorootparent> Sure I can (probably) build curl ten times and get ten technically different binariesI think assuming the same build environment, then building curl is actually deterministic and reproducible:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tests.reproducible-builds.org&#x2F;debian&#x2F;rb-pkg&#x2F;unstable...(It says reproducibility fails if CFLAGS is different, but I&#x27;d count that as a change in build environment?) reply duped 15 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you, but my point is ultimately that content hashing inputs like GP is arguing \"solves\" the problem doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem.Take your curl example. Its inputs are its dependencies. Now say you depend on libcurl and a more recent version of glibc than curl was compiled against. If you only track the hashes of inputs to determine if something needs to be rebuilt, then in this scenario you will have to rebuild libcurl.What you&#x27;re talking about (determining if your dependencies are \"valid\" and don&#x27;t need to be rebuilt) involves tracking compatibility metadata out-of-band of the actual content of the build artifacts, which is not a solved problem.The point about reproducible builds is that they&#x27;re required for any kind of build system that depends on content hashing to determine if something needs to be rebuilt, because it&#x27;s actually impossible to track that based on the content alone.It gets hairier when you start abstracting what a build artifact that depends on another build artifact is, because there&#x27;s more to builds than object files, dlls, and executables. reply zelos 17 hours agorootparentprevFrom my experience with Gradle, it&#x27;s fairly tricky at the build tool level, trying to do it at the CI level must surely be harder.If (for example) I change a value in gradle.properties at the top level, do I need to rerun every test in every sub project? You need detailed knowledge of how the build is structured to decide that. reply danudey 17 hours agorootparentprev> you have to be 100% perfect in guessing when the cache file must be rebuiltOr, you make reasonable assumptions that are correct in most cases, and rely on the user to provide hints as to when the cache should be invalidated.Assuming your code, environment variables, and `args` are all factored into invalidating the cache, there are few situations in typical builds where using the cache is a bad idea. The biggest ones I can think of are if your build system is going out and fetching data itself to decide what to do, e.g. if you&#x27;re downloading source code (e.g. a shared library) from an external source which may have updated it.That said, if you&#x27;re just arbitrarily pulling down whatever the latest build of libcurl is or something, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time eventually anyway, so you should either put a static version into an arg or just put the download into a separate step; at which point the cache will correctly invalidate when it&#x27;s changed.Maybe if a build is only valid for 90 days from the build date or something (e.g. a preview build) and that&#x27;s built into the binary at compile time, but in that case you can pass that in as an arg anyway and then your cache is going to be invalid every morning regardless.I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s never an issue, but the same code with the same environment and the same arguments, built on the same platform with the same versions of the same dependencies, using the same versions of the same tooling to run the same commands and copy the same artifacts to the same locations should very nearly never produce a valid output now which is not an equally valid output in the future unless it is fetching and acting on external information (which can be easily parameterized). reply jrockway 16 hours agoparentprevThe tricky part of CI is figuring out what work doesn&#x27;t need to be done.

But with all that somewhat confusing prose, I ended up in the neighborhood of: \"I&#x27;m happy for u tho. Or sorry that happened.\"Was the heart of this that they assumed that radically faster builds was the killer feature, but they hadn&#x27;t actually validated that assumption before building it? Or was it more they hadn&#x27;t really segmented their users, so they hadn&#x27;t realized that the high-dollar customers had different needs? Or that they just gave away the thing that was the real-problem solver for paying customers?And given that the somewhat chaotic article was written by the CEO, I have to wonder to what extent the chaos was just a lack of editing versus there being a lot of actual chaos in the company throughout the process. Long ago Steve Blank wrote an article called \"Founders and dysfunctional families\" [1] where he talked about how a lot of founders are really good at managing chaos because they grew up in it, something that certainly describes me. He added that something that can make the difference between success and failure is the extent to which founders can also handle non-chaos. Because the ones who can&#x27;t tend to \"throw organizational hand grenades into their own companies\" to get things back to the level of chaos that they&#x27;re good at.

And the bottom half of the audience by competence, which Moore called the Late Majority and the Laggards, can be well more than half your revenue in a SaaS context because they will create problems for themselves (like slow&#x2F;buggy builds) that mean higher per-user revenue.

Our current release workflow for our open-source components:1. Run the CI build&#x2F;test pipeline 2. If it passes, run the &#x27;Publish&#x27; promotion (manually, on any pipeline you want) 3. The pipeline runs a make target 4. The make target starts up a VM (from the VM it&#x27;s running on) 5. The make target SSH&#x27;es to the VM to run a make target 4. The make target builds a binary 5. The binary runs more make targets 6. The make targets run various scripts in docker containers on the VM the other VM started 7. The scripts in the docker containers build the components 8. The binary from step five runs more make targets to publish the releases 9. We test everything with another promotion which runs make targets which build docker containers to run python scripts (pytest)This is also built by a complicated web of wildcarded makefile targets, which need to be interoperable and support a few if&#x2F;else cases for specific components.My plan is to migrate all of this to something simpler and more straightforward, or at least more maintainable, which is honestly probably going to turn into taskfile[0] instead of makefiles, and then simple python scripts for the glue that ties everything together or does more complex logic.My hope is that it can be more straightforward and easier to maintain, with more component-ized logic, but realistically every step in that labyrinthine build process (and that&#x27;s just the open-source version!) came from a decision made by a very talented team of engineers who know far more about the process and the product than I do. At this point I&#x27;m wondering if it would make &#x27;more sense&#x27; to replace it with a giant python script of some kind and get access to all the logic we need all at once (it would not).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taskfile.dev&#x2F; reply hedora 13 hours agorootparentTaskfile looks worse than make to me in every possible dimension (except maybe windows compatibility, but I don&#x27;t believe that it meaningfully supports that).You should at least read and understand the paper \"Recursive Make Considered Harmful\" before attempting to replace make with something \"better\":https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aegis.sourceforge.net&#x2F;auug97.pdfMost people use make incorrectly (and it sounds like the system you describe makes most of the classic mistakes). The paper I linked explains how to use Make&#x27;s templating language to help it scale to complicated setups.Here are a few critiques of taskfile (from skimming their documentation):- The syntax is incredibly verbose and weird. For instance, you have to write a tree of yaml nodes to loop over a set of files. Make&#x27;s syntax is weird, but at least it is not verbose.- The documentation makes no mention that I could find of deriving a set of tasks from a list of files (Make&#x27;s $(wildcard) macro, or stemming rules like \"%.o : %.c\"). So, I guess the taskfile will end up being huge (like the size of autogenerated makefiles from autoconf or cmake), or you&#x27;ll end up using additional ad-hoc build systems that are invoked by your taskfile.- From the documentation, they haven&#x27;t thought through having more than one project per unix account \"When running your global Taskfile with -g, tasks will run on $HOME by default, and not on your working directory!\"- They seem to have partially reimplemented the bad ideas from recursive make: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taskfile.dev&#x2F;usage&#x2F;#including-other-taskfiles- I suggest taking an idiomatic but non-trivial bash script (which is 99% of what make is invoking, and that taskfiles support), and then trying to port it to python directly.

But it looks like the information is there.It sounds to me like they ended up with an encapsulation layer between language-specific build systems and the continuous build systems that kick them off.A comparison might be with something like Bazel, which does everything, but full adoption requires going all-in on using their build language to replace language-specific build systems, often including moving source files to make it work. This feels foreign compared to using a language’s own build system, but it might seem natural for C programmers, where the language doesn’t have its own build system. Similarly, Java went through several unfortunate build systems before unfortunately settling on Gradle.Language-specific build systems end up not doing everything because each language has its own conventions and ecosystem. Modern ones don’t try, they know what they’re good at and stick to it.So, the tool that actually knows about multiple languages and their artifacts is often a shell script, makefile, docker file, or the continuous build itself. Or even doing it by hand. That’s the layer they’re trying to improve.I don’t have a clear idea what their fundamental insight is that makes their way of doing it better, though. reply pxc 15 hours agoprevI looked briefly at Earthly a while ago for work because I have to write CI integrations for a whole bunch of CI platforms (GitLab, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and maybe GitHub Actions). I ended up going with a very similar product (i.e., another nice BuildKit frontend with integrations into a bunch of CI systems), Dagger, because the DSL it used for defining pipelines at the time seemed better to me. I ended up deeply regretting this decision, as the Dagger devs have de facto abandoned that language entirely in favor of churning out SDKs for the most popular programming languages— all imperative, all Turing-complete, and all, imo, bad fits for the space. So now I&#x27;m back in hell, integrating with all of these systems by hand, hesitant to trust this kind of tooling to a startup again.To me this is still the most appealing use case of something like Earthly. Push-and-see-what-happens is still the norm on almost all CI systems, and it&#x27;s an abominable workflow. If you are at a large organization and have to support teams that use a wide variety of CI&#x2F;CD platforms, something like Earthly could potentially save quite a lot of pain. But the appeal is precisely in supporting existing CI platforms, rather than in adding another one. reply shykes 4 hours agoparent> Dagger devs have de facto abandoned that language entirely in favor of churning out SDKs for the most popular programming languages— all imperative, all Turing-complete, and all, imo, bad fits for the space.Disclaimer: I’m the CEO of Dagger.You’re right that we offer SDKs for popular languages, which happen to be imperative. But Dagger remains a declarative system, so what you liked about the earlier versions is still there. The trick is that we moved the declarative layer from static CUE configurations to dynamic GraphQL queries. Then we generated client libraries in various languages from the GraphQL schema. So not only can you still declaratively construct your DAG like before, you can do it in whatever language you prefer. You can even run a DAG directly in pure GraphQL: see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.dagger.cloud which lets you do this straight from the browser.A useful analogy is SQL: it’s a declarative language that is commonly combined with another, often imperative, language.I hope you find this message useful and consider giving Dagger another chance. reply geggo98 3 hours agorootparentWhile you are here: the Node.js syntax highlights on you QuickStart docs seems to be broken.

The main issue with the old CUE implementation is that they had to try and align BuildKits DAG solver with CUE&#x27;s DAG solver, and they worked in opposite ways. I tried to help them through this about 3 years ago (being a CUE expert). I definitely think the SDKs is a much better solution for them. Whether we like it or not, a lot of the industry is moving this way.

I usually end up having to push a bunch of commits to debug stuff, and there&#x27;s a lot of configuration hell. I don&#x27;t know if Earthly solves this, perhaps it does. But if I were considering moving onto a new CI, I&#x27;d immediately think about having to redo this painful process. And that&#x27;s at the team level. At the org level, switching CI would be even worse.That does make me wonder, how much of CI adoption is actually moving from one provider to another versus new projects adopting CI for the first time? I&#x27;d guess that barring a really extreme reason, most projects pick a CI provider and stick with it. reply mrweasel 18 hours agoparentCI systems are important to me, but my requirement is pretty much: Can it run a bash script. Every CI I&#x27;ve ever used has degraded into a bash script runner. It starts out well enough, you try to use all the build in features but at some point you fallback to running a shells script and then slowly more and more move to the script, because it&#x27;s easier.Someone should just build a bash CI, something that can manage secrets and then run one or more shells scripts. reply kerblang 18 hours agorootparentOnce you have hooks into source control for commit-based callbacks into CI, everything else need only be shell. Like, if you build a triggers-shell-scripts-off-source-repo-hooks web service, does putting the results in a pretty web server really matter for anyone besides executives who want dashboards dashboards dashboards? I&#x27;m already sending script output to text files and our chat system via curl to boring web service APIs. reply dpeckett 18 hours agorootparentprevIn a lot of ways that&#x27;s pretty much what Earthly is, except those bash scripts run inside containers (that you can configure inside Earthly itself) and you pass files&#x2F;artifacts between steps&#x2F;containers. reply angio 13 hours agorootparentprevBuildkite encourages that, even plugins are just a bunch of bash scripts that are sourced at specific steps of the build. reply verdverm 14 hours agoprevThere are a bunch of these next-gen CI &#x2F; container building systems. They all pretty much build on BuildKit like Docker, but unlock way more of the potential, namely DAG layers (think multi-stage docker on steroids), and better &#x2F; more granular caching. These next-gen CI tools are fighting to be the UX on top of BuildKit.Dagger is where it is at, and it&#x27;s built by the creators of Docker, based on their lessons learned. If you&#x27;re looking to try something out, try Dagger. You write in the same languages you do every day, no need for some weird syntax like Earthly or the flatness of a Dockerfile. Their CLI&#x2F;TUI is pretty sweet too, but you don&#x27;t even need it. reply wesleyyue 18 hours agoprevFor anyone looking for fast ci, I&#x27;d highly recommend webapp.io. it automatically caches layers if it detects it doesn&#x27;t need to be run, and you can split a VM to shard test execution. Runs way faster than GitHub actions, you can ssh into any layer to debug, and it&#x27;s just like a Linux machine&#x2F;dockerfiles so no crazy syntax&#x2F;mental model to learn. Support is great and we&#x27;ve been super happy with the experience. Best CI platform I&#x27;ve used by far. reply shepherdjerred 17 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s literally what Earthly does reply 0xbadcafebee 15 hours agoprevThere is no real business advantage or value add to switching CI&#x2F;CD systems. The only people that do it no longer have anyone working for them that knows how the existing CI&#x2F;CD system works, so the new person just replaces it with something else. They&#x27;re all basically the same crap. Run a job, evaluate its output, maybe run another job, send a notification.Whenever you run into a problem with a CI&#x2F;CD system, it&#x27;s because the system is \"opinionated\" and \"tightly integrated\", but of course lacks some obscure and subtle capability that you need to solve a problem. The fact that you are using a specific CI&#x2F;CD system is what dooms you to eventually need another one to solve the problem that you current one cannot solve.It&#x27;s ridiculous that here we are in 2023 and nobody has completed an open source project that replaces general use CI & CD (for modern best practices & use cases; Jenkins is a curse from the pit of hell). Both CI & CD are just loops of jobs and logic that then decides what next job to run. What those jobs do are all different, but so what? Make an open source library of jobs and logic.(for what it&#x27;s worth, Drone.io is the best system I&#x27;ve ever used, and WoodpeckerCI is the open source equivalent, but it doesn&#x27;t have a large community so work is very slow) reply adamgordonbell 19 hours agoprev\"People will buy a developer tool, but you can’t sell it.\" reply wrs 18 hours agoparentFor me the killer quote was “if the prospect requires a demo, then they’re not worth going after” — because as a prospect, if your product requires a demo, I’m already halfway to no. I am so tired of “enterprise” products that have to be purchased as a pig in a poke because they can’t stand on their own during a trial period. reply deepspace 18 hours agoparentprevThat line caught my attention too, and it looked superficially true. I have certainly never purchased a tool based on a phone call from a vendor. However, that only pertains to cold-calling, which is the absolute worst way to sell anything.Advertising is a trillion dollar market for a reason – it works. The trick is to find the correct message and media for the audience.Effective advertising takes a lot of skill, a lot of money, or both. A large portion of HN posts (including this one) are contain \"hidden\" advertising, and they absolutely work.I have purchased more than one developer tool based on reddit and HN reviews, which originated as posts by the seller. On the \"lot of money\" side, a poster in the arrivals tunnel at SFO is an excellent way of raising brand awareness; even for developer tools. reply nathanfig 17 hours agoparentprevI think HN will eat this up because few of us enjoy being sold to but like most absolute statements it&#x27;s probably only applicable in specific circumstances. Enterprises sell tons of developer tools and move millions because of demos done well. AWS and Azure are definitely getting on planes and doing demos. reply huijzer 19 hours agoprevI have no personal experience with selling a SaaS, but read that AWS mostly sold to startups at first because there were no migration costs yet. Out of curiosity, has the same been attempted with Eathly and, if yes, did that work? reply oooyay 19 hours agoprevIs the concept that requiring a demo for developer tools is a negative signal that strange?CI is also notoriously expensive to migrate, which the author alluded to. The pumpkin spice latte of software engineering is disdain for things like Jira and Jenkins but what keeps them in their seat is all the custom integration work that has to be done. reply a1o 18 hours agoparentThe thing with Jenkins is you can also make it custom enough so you have different teams handling different parts (say the building and the deployment, or the releases). In most CIs this is a bit harder to do - I think the Azure Classic pipeline also had interesting ways to delegate responsibilities. In the end the good thing of the different CIs is they apply to different problems and one can use them all at different parts of a company - teams that work in more innovative developments vs teams that maintain products that have to be trusted and adhere to many regulations. reply progx 16 hours agoprevYou get customer when you solve a real problem for them. CI-Systems exists, slow or fast doesn&#x27;t be a problem for most of the devs, cause you run normally everything local and only on publish in a remote CI-system. So CI-Systems exists and solve their problem.I think only for a really small market the CI-performance is a real pain. Sure, everbody wants it fast, but that is not a reason to change a huge complex setup. reply pharmakom 17 hours agoprevThe issue is trust. I dislike trusting GitHub &#x2F; GitLab with my code but I already do, so I choose them for CI.I can already get fast builds using Bazel (or maybe Buck 2) so why do I need another tool &#x2F; provider? reply maxloh 17 hours agoparentGitLab is open sourced.

We will also add cloud-based asset storage, Unity DevOps tools, and AI at runtime at no extra cost to Unity subscription plans this November. As many of you know, the Unity Engine is in fact two substantial software components – the Unity Editor and the Unity Runtime. The Unity Runtime is code that executes on player devices and makes Made with Unity games work at scale, with billions of monthly downloads. We are introducing a Unity Runtime Fee that is based upon each time a qualifying game is downloaded by an end user. We chose this because each time a game is downloaded, the Unity Runtime is also installed. Also we believe that an initial install-based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement, unlike a revenue share. Thresholds for revenue and installs Games qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee after two criteria have been met: 1) the game has passed a minimum revenue threshold in the last 12 months, and 2) the game has passed a minimum lifetime install count. We set high revenue and game install thresholds to avoid impacting those who have yet to find scale, meaning they don’t need to pay the fee until they have reached significant success. Only games that meet the following thresholds qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee: Unity Personal and Unity Plus: Those that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs. Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs. Flexibility and discounts for Unity Personal, Pro, and Enterprise With this new policy, as of January 1, 2024, we will offer Unity Personal to anyone regardless of how much revenue they make to provide more flexibility in how creators manage their licenses. Once a game passes the revenue and install thresholds, the studio would pay a small flat fee for each install (see the table below). To adjust for scale, Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscribers will be eligible for volume discounts that rapidly reduce the per-install cost of the Unity Runtime Fee. This means that in addition to other benefits, the cost of Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise licenses can be offset by the savings as the game grows. Finally, we structured our fees so that they take into account the variability of game monetization between more established regions like North America and Europe versus emerging gaming regions such as India. A breakdown of the pricing and discount structure is below. See the FAQ for additional details. Unity Runtime Fee Schedule Check if the Unity Runtime Fee applies to your game and estimate any applicable fees. The fee applies to new installs beginning January 1, 2024, billed monthly. Step 1: Check Your Eligibility Your game must meet both revenue AND install thresholds for the fee to apply.Unity Personal and Unity Plus Unity Pro Unity Enterprise Revenue Threshold (last 12 months) $200,000 (USD) $1,000,000 (USD) $1,000,000 (USD) Install Threshold (lifetime) 200,000 1,000,000 1,000,000 Step 2: Calculate the Fee If your game meets both thresholds, the tiered rates apply and will be charged once per new install.Unity Personal and Unity Plus Unity Pro Unity Enterprise New installs per month Standard rate (if thresholds are met) 1–100,000 $0.20 per install $0.15 per install $0.125 per install 100,001–500,000 $0.075 per install $0.06 per install 500,001–1,000,000 $0.03 per install $0.02 per install 1,000,001+ $0.02 per install $0.01 per install New installs per month Emerging market rate (if thresholds are met) 1+ $0.02 per install $0.01 per install $0.005 per install Fee reduction for use of Unity services Qualifying customers may be eligible for credits toward the Unity Runtime Fee based on the adoption of Unity services beyond the Editor, such as Unity Gaming Services or Unity LevelPlay mediation for mobile ad-supported games. This program enables deeper partnership with Unity to succeed across the entire game lifecycle. Please reach out to your account manager to learn more. New services and tools. No seat price changes. This November, we will update some of the Unity subscription plans to add extra value. New capabilities include better collaboration (Unity DevOps), cloud-based asset management (Unity Asset Manager), role and access controls (Team Administration), and the ability to add AI functionality at runtime (Unity Sentis). These new tools and services will come with no increase in seat prices as we continue to help creators adapt to the growing complexity of game development. Here’s a breakdown: All Unity plans will get Unity Sentis, which enables you to embed a running AI model in the Unity Runtime, inside your game or application, without needing to pay additional cloud-compute costs or introducing latency. Unity Personal will include the Unity Asset Manager free tier (10GB storage total), a maximum of 3 Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes, and Team Administration base roles. Unity Pro will include the Unity Asset Manager (50GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats featuring 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools to manage access will also be included. Unity Enterprise will include the Unity Asset Manager (120GB of storage per seat, pooled for a team to share) along with an equal number of Unity DevOps seats with 5GB of storage and 200 Windows build minutes. Team Administration tools, including custom roles and SSO, provide a higher degree of control. Finally, Unity Plus is being retired for new subscribers effective today, September 12, 2023, to simplify the number of plans we offer. Existing subscribers do not need to take immediate action and will receive an email mid-October with an offer to upgrade to Unity Pro, for one year, at the current Unity Plus price. For more information, see the detailed FAQ, contact Unity support, talk with us on the Unity forums, or contact your account manager. Thank you for creating with Unity.

They use different terms and don’t define them in various places throughout the announcement and FAQ.It is a disaster trying to consume this announcement and make future plans based upon it reply Kapura 19 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s a shame Unity seems so intent on making itself unattractive to developers. I prefer writing c# to c++, and I think Unity&#x27;s onboarding experience is much better than Unreal. But when it comes to a non-solo-development effort, when you need to start thinking about businesses and numbers and all the things that aren&#x27;t making the game, Epic has made Unreal attractive, and partnerships with the Epic Games Store can boost that value even further.Unity&#x27;s recent moves to me speak to a fear that they&#x27;ve more-or-less hit their market saturation point, and now they&#x27;re looking to extract more from the developers who live in their slice of the pie.

The actual \"money\" (dollars in a bank account) comes from lenders who look at a bunch of factors and make determinations about how much $$$ to give.

It still has some advantages over godot atm (such as big install base, and a pre-existing network&#x2F;momentum which is hard to dissipate), and my guess is that unity is trying to get revenue up before godot takes their lunch in a few more years. replyAuryGlenz 18 hours agoparentprevIf Unreal (natively) adopted C# that would absolutely be a killing blow to Unity, to the point where I&#x27;m amazed they haven&#x27;t done it. reply Kapura 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, and I don&#x27;t think the juice would be worth the squeeze. Unreal&#x27;s flavour of C++ is heavily managed, relying on preprocessing of header files to create garbage collecting pointers and a whole heap of other things you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re signing up for when you think about a C++ codebase. There is no simple place to begin if you&#x27;re trying to make it C# friendly.But most of my issues have been with engine philosophy, where Unreal has bent over backwards to expose things to their visual scripting language. It feels like every single feature has a mandate to work in a blueprint tech demo, and as a result few of them are pleasant to code against and almost none of them work together coherently. These are not issues that depend on the language used. reply AuryGlenz 7 hours agorootparentC# being the deciding factor an incredibly common refrain in game development \"what engine do you&#x2F;should I use?\"Whether or not it&#x27;s justified is another manner. I haven&#x27;t personally dealt with the modern Unreal Engine but natively supporting C# would, at the very least, make people a lot more likely to switch over. reply dgellow 17 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, Unreal C++ isn’t that bad or hardcore. It’s fairly high level, and Unreal APIs are pretty well designed. You spend way more time dealing with Unreal specific stuff and your game objects than dealing with C++ issues. reply abrolhos 17 hours agorootparentprev>> [...] I&#x27;m amazed they haven&#x27;t done it.Never interfere with an enemy while he’s in the process of destroying himself. reply kkukshtel 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been tracking this (Epic Megagrant awarded!) project for a while that attempts to do very much that: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nxrighthere&#x2F;UnrealCLRI&#x27;m also surprised though they haven&#x27;t just gone and added C# support as a first class option, it seems like such an obvious win. reply kriro 15 hours agorootparentprevDisagree. Unity is pretty strong on mobile and multi-plattform. Enough to survive on this alone (imo). I also think Blueprints is already a strong competitor for the share of users who find C++ too complicated (non-programers and people who have only dabbled in scripting). I think for \"traditional programers\" the difference between C++ and C# isn&#x27;t big enough to make a difference and frankly people with a gamedev background probably prefer C++.That being said as a non mobile guy who occasionally dabbles in engine stuff I&#x27;ll be migrating to Unreal for good now. I haven&#x27;t been a paying customer for a while now but I used to pay for Unity back in the super early days of AR.Or I guess take another serious look at Godot :D reply ummonk 12 hours agorootparentMobile is the kind of use case where the pricing changes will be massively impactful though. If you&#x27;re selling a non-mobile game for $10+ then you can just eat the per-install fee, but if you&#x27;re shipping a free to play app or a $1 app? The per install fee could make your business model nonviable. reply Fire-Dragon-DoL 6 hours agorootparentprevI mean, knowing c++ and c#, I am always terrified about the former.

And it&#x27;s just a different type of tool. To be honest I know many more better engineers who primarily work with dotnet over CPP.

Just a different tool in a toolbox. reply fnordpiglet 18 hours agorootparentprevI think a lot of people find the learning curve of c++ fairly extreme, especially when considering the amount of knowledge to do idiomatic programming in c++ required to “do things elegantly.” C# and related languages tend to have idioms baked in closer to the syntax and grammar. My view of c++ after 30 years of it is it’s great if you’ve got 10 years experience programming it within a team of seasoned c++ programmers who shows you the ropes. Even then I think rust is the language I wished for all these years (albeit not for game dev yet). Finally, for the reasons rust isn’t great for game dev, c# and ilk generally have excellent reflective and dynamic natures making them sort of the sweatpants and old T-shirt language for game programming.That said, it locks you into using stuff like mono and stuff for cross platform which makes me a sad. reply whoisthemachine 15 hours agorootparent> That said, it locks you into using stuff like mono and stuff for cross platform which makes me a sad.Microsoft&#x27;s .Net Core runtime (now just .Net) has supported Linux and MacOS since 2016, so this information has been out of date for 7+ years.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;announcing-net-core-1-... reply fnordpiglet 14 hours agorootparentOh thanks!

Raw speed is likely similar; the cost overhead comes from GC cycles and the general approach to managing memory primarily in the heap vs stack, although C# can stackalloc if you&#x27;re really diligent.

These languages are mostly equivalent to C&#x2F;C++ in speed, but lose the benchmark shootouts because of GC. reply neonsunset 10 hours agorootparentCalling Go blazing fast would be a stretch at best...the path to performance in C# is same as in Rust or C++: struct generics (aka templates), as short hot paths as possible, static partitioning of the work, sometimes hands on memory management and minimization of locking. reply kevingadd 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is a pretty wild generalization to make.

Everywhere else it&#x27;s $0.02I don&#x27;t personally like this whole business model that much, but financially it seems to be pretty reasonable (I guess as long as you can somewhat predict your expected install count in advance which might not be that easy in some cases). reply sbergot 1 hour agorootparentIt does seem reasonable as an incentive for successful studios to switch to pro. However the issue is not purely with the price only.The issue is the fact that the wording is unclear. Also a price per install seems like a bad target overall. How is it reported? Now they are saying that there are exceptions like gamepass installs. It is going to be a mess.Also the change is retroactive.

Whereas your game going temporarily viral would have been huge , now it’ll be a huge burden. Meanwhile Unreal is 5% after 1M.A progressive fee would have at least made some sense.As it is, Unity lags severely behind Unreal for both features and sentiment. The big markets for Unity were indie and enterprise. They’d ceded everything in the middle to Unreal.Epic provide megagrant funding to Godot, in what I imagine is a play to eat Unity from the bottom up. Unity will just accelerate that.And enterprise is fickle. They’ll switch to something else as soon as any project lead feels like it.Imho this is one more step down the road to the death of Unity.

But then you have to pay for users acquisition (marketing to get installs) so the actual revenue is more like 0.19$ per user (still profitable!) BUT then I have to pay 0.20$ for any installs regardless of it made any money, so I&#x27;m effectively at a loss -0.01$ per user when I could&#x27;ve been profitable.I made up the number up but you get the idea. With a % of revenue share (or at the very least do not count installs that generated 0$ revenue) it could be a profitable game, now it risks of being shutdown. reply WillPostForFood 15 hours agorootparentYou wouldn&#x27;t pay anything to Unity in that scenario - you need 100k installs and 200k in revenue for the game before the fee applies.And the charge is incremental after the 100k and 200k in revenue, so if you had 101k installs and 200k in revenue, you&#x27;d only pay $15. reply starburst 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m going to use the Personal &#x2F; Plus pricing instead of Pro, on a f2p mobile game, but let&#x27;s say you made 200k$ on the first 200k install, but only 20k$ on the next 200k installs (for whatever reason, different market, whale spending 10&#x27;s of thousands $ skewing the data, etc.), you owe Unity 40k$ and are now in the negative for those new installs when you could&#x27;ve still turned a profit, albeit less.Of course Unity deserve to be paid and receive revenue, I&#x27;m absolutely not against that and if you are on the Pro subscription, it is only a concerned once you reach 1M$ which at this point means the project should be profitable and manage to pay that tax (otherwise maybe that project isn&#x27;t commercially viable).But it just feel very harsh for the mega popular indie hit that have very low revenue per user you know...

And the users you have to pay $0.20 for are likely to be generating significantly more ad&#x2F;IAP revenue for you than the rest.But yeah, if you can&#x27;t get to $1-2 even for NA&#x2F;etc. users are you&#x27;re actually selling your game for $1-2 the 20 cent fee seems pretty extreme. reply starburst 15 hours agorootparentNot sure I understand? I just made those number up to give you an example, be it realistic or not hardly matters. You get X per user and it cost you Y per user and Unity take Z per user. Now `X - Y` is profitable but `X - Y - Z` is not, that&#x27;s it. If it was instead a % at least it would still be profitable if only less, it doesn&#x27;t put the revenue per user in jeopardy of being in the negative.Plenty of games are profitable at scale with only a few pennies per user. reply qwytw 15 hours agorootparent> I just made those number up to give you an example, be it realistic or not hardly mattersThat&#x27;s pretty much the only thing that matters. there is a huge difference whether they make $0.5, $1 or $2 etc (and especially how much more do they make per user in a \"rich\" country since Unity seems to think that they are worth up to 10x more than everyone else.> Plenty of games are profitable at scale with only a few pennies per user.Beyond a certain point (over 1 mill users) it will only cost $0.01 per install.

They could still probably just pay ~2k for Unity Pro per seat and stay under the 1 million revenue threshold.To me it almost seems that the &#x27;$0.20 per install&#x27; is only there to encourage developers to upgrade to pro if they have more than a few hundred k. users.> If it was instead a %True, I&#x27;m not arguing that wouldn&#x27;t be more fair.

There isn&#x27;t one truth, the numbers I gave up could very well fit a real project.Of course you would be pretty stupid to not subscribe to Pro once you notice your game going to 200k.

No other proprietary engine has as even remotely comparable market share in the freemium&#x2F;Ad&#x2F;IAP-funded&#x2F;shovelware mobile game market.Also Epic isn&#x27;t trying to pay for 8000 employees (especially not just with their engine revenue) or service billion in debt accrued from (possibly unnecessary) acquisitions. It feels to me that Unity pushed themselves into a corner by increasing and don&#x27;t really have any choices but to try and maximize their revenue any way they can.e.g. Epic seems to have about 4000 employees and compared to Fortnite Unreal seems to almost be just a side gig for them.Also let&#x27;s be fair a 5% royalty would be much more likely to scare off their best paying customers. And looking at their current leadership and overall philosophy I find it easy to understand why they might not care that much what will happen to some indy&#x2F;small developers who can&#x27;t afford&#x2F;don&#x27;t want to pay for Pro or have more than 1 million users but can&#x27;t generate more than ~$0.2 - 0.5 in profit per install. reply starburst 14 hours agorootparentI get that, but I feel like there must&#x27;ve been a much better way to do so than with this proposal that seems to have burn the last remaining goodwill that developers had left in Unity and making sure most future projects won&#x27;t get done on Unity.A lot of people have been thinking about switching for years, Unity is becoming slower and slower with time, more buggier, etc. I feel like this is the tipping point where the number of developpers is going to go down, so was it worth it? Maybe, maybe it was the correct decision, time will tell.I&#x27;ll still continue to use it for on-going projects I have and pay the tax no problem, but I won&#x27;t pick it for any project in the future personnaly because of how out of touch and ridiculous I personaly feel this business decision is (and other decisions they&#x27;ve made). reply qwytw 3 hours agorootparentI get why would people be opposed to these changes on a more \"philosophical\" level (and I think I am) but I&#x27;m not sure that much changes financially for most developers who make less than 1 million in revenue per game (and they overall seem to be somewhat fair(ish) in relation to what Unity provides and compared to 30% storefront fees or what ad companies skim):- If your company was making over $200k you already couldn&#x27;t be on Personal&#x2F;Plus and would have had to upgrade to Pro, so the $0.2 fee seems irrelevant.- The current limit is based on company&#x27;s entire revenue, it seems they changed it to per game? If so you&#x27;re actually now better off if you have many games which make about $100k or so.- The only issues I see is that if there is huge unexpected surge in downloads&#x2F;sales which might leave with a large bill (which you could&#x27;ve mostly avoided by upgrading to Pro in advance). Which is not the most unlikely scenario.You sold you game for a fixed fee to Apple&#x2F;MS&#x2F;etc. (Gamepass, Arcade..). I doubt many games there cost less than 200k (thought I don&#x27;t really know)? So you&#x27;re probably on Pro. But if your overall revenue for the game is over $1 million you&#x27;d still be on the the hook to pay for additional downloads (above 1 mil) with zero increase in revenue.. replykevingadd 14 hours agorootparentprevthe average is skewed by games like Genshin Impact with gross exploitative monetization, not to mention literal casino games. So smaller developers with more reasonable monetization are not getting anywhere close to those averages and will be punished hard by these fees, especially because it&#x27;s per-install not per-user.If a user installs your F2P mobile game on 2-3 devices (not uncommon), you now owe 40-60 cents, not 20. Hope your average revenue is good enough that you can afford that after Apple&#x2F;Google take their 30%. reply qwytw 11 hours agorootparentAverage cost per install should be significantly lower than 20 for most games (it&#x27;s just 2 cents for most country&#x27;s in the world after all). However yeah it seems pretty excessive.I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that 20 cent cost is just there to encourage developers who&#x27;d have to pay to update to pro (e.g. a seat for a year seems to be equal to about 10k installs, but with pro you get extra 800k free installs and increase your revenue limit by another 800k so you&#x27;ll likely won&#x27;t even have to pay extra for users at all) replybcrosby95 17 hours agorootparentprevMost Unity games are mobile apps.

So this makes this decision even more baffling because instead of sharing the revenue these developers will just change to a different engine (it&#x27;s not like that market will disappear, so if using Unity is unprofitable or too big of a dent in the revenue, they won&#x27;t stop making those games, just use a different engine) reply qwytw 15 hours agorootparent> instead of sharing the revenueI&#x27;m sure one reason Unity did this is that are pretty certain that many of those developers won&#x27;t be willing to share their revenue.

For Epic, you have to make several times the amount. 200k of success is a lot more achievable than 1M of success for an indie.The issue is that, Unity are in a very odd place of the market. They completely ceded high end gaming to Unreal. They have reasonable alternatives like Godot on the other end. So their main markets are:1. Enterprise - which is fickle2. Indie devs aspiring for success - who are going for cheap3. Mobile (which might include 2)4. A very few AAA gamesI think this move will alienate a lot of their indie clients in the hopes of getting more money from their higher end clients. For those indie clients, hitting 200K of revenue is a much closer dream than 1M of revenue, and they&#x27;ll see that Unreal gives them more \"high end graphics\".So I understand Unity&#x27;s position, I just think they&#x27;re alienating one of their biggest bases.

I can&#x27;t imagine why would anyone do that though.You&#x27;d basically have to have about 300-400k installs and revenue but require 10-20 seats so that paying per install would make more sense than upgrading you subscription.I can only imagine this might be the case in some third world sweatshop where you pay you developers less than 10k per year.. reply bodge5000 13 hours agoprevA great move by Unity. Sometimes I find myself missing features from Unity after moving to Godot; a general purpose, strongly typed programming language and live editor changes whilst the game is running are my biggest examples, but thanks to these changes I&#x27;ll never look back longingly at Unity again. Good work team!Funnily enough the changes have also made me look back into Unreal, I hear they have a proper Linux editor now and that their flavour of C++ is a bit nicer than I expected. I doubt I&#x27;ll switch from Godot anytime soon, but worth a look.EDIT: I see the point being made a lot that this won&#x27;t affect many smaller devs as they&#x27;ll never make enough money to meet the threshold, however it seems to me that if your choice of engine makes you hope your project isn&#x27;t successful, then it might be time to choose a different engine. Unreal engine devs hope their game will make enough to qualify for the revenue share, not because the revenue share is a good thing for them, but because it means if they&#x27;re making that kind of money it won&#x27;t be a problem. reply LarsDu88 17 hours agoprevBoy, this is demoralizing. Unity needs to make money, but they just gave folks a great reason on the lower end a reason to switch to the completely free Godot which: - Will soon reach performance parity - Now supports C# - Is less bloated - Is FOSSUnity did have some great and useful libraries for doing things like animation rigging and editor customization.

(I always think of Paul Grahams story about beating out the competition using Lisp.)I&#x27;ve been working with UE since 2014, originally started in UE4 C++ and avoided blueprints and kept everything in C++. Was great &#x27;for performance&#x27; and code diffs but now 10 years later I&#x27;m 99% blueprint and only go down to C++ if the performance requires it for the 1% of hot paths. My iteration time in UE using blueprints makes me shutter to think of all the time I spent waiting for C++ to compile. reply _gabe_ 17 hours agorootparentI just started using Unreal 5 to prototype a VR game (lots of quirks but this engine is amazing). I’ve been writing C++ for 5ish years now and am pretty comfortable with it. I’ve also been slowly converting all the blueprints in the VR template provided by Unreal to C++ for a few reasons and was curious if these effect you.I tried using blueprints for awhile, but it just feels so cumbersome and time consuming. I can bang out 10 lines of code basically as fast as I can think, but converting those same 10 lines of code to blueprints often involves much more time. You have to click around a bunch, rearrange the routing wires, make it look readable, abstract a lot of stuff into functions that usually don’t need it just because it helps condense the blueprints. Then the blueprints end up sprawling a large area and are very difficult to keep in my head at once (whereas it would normally take less than a page of C++ code to write it out and you can easily hold that in your head).Basically, I was wondering if these downsides to blueprints effect you much or if you’ve developed suitable workarounds? I want to like blueprints, but the time it takes to click around and make it readable is painful, in my opinion, more painful than compile times for the C++. reply mentos 13 hours agorootparentYea its unfair to taught Blueprints as the answer when they have a serious learning curve.It took me a while to build up enough experience where I could become more expressive with Blueprints than C++. The Lyra example has some good Blueprint hygiene worth reviewing where they organize all variables underneath a function call.. but until you have serious experience with Blueprints they are going to feel like a cumbersome mess.My advice is to do what you feel most expressive with, doing the thing you enjoy more will lead to more hours of experience. Start with C++ and build up a good understanding&#x2F;mental model of the engine and then eventually give Blueprints a try in a few more years and you will see them in a new light. reply _gabe_ 6 hours agorootparentI’ll have to check out the Lyra example!

Especially not their major customers who have negotiating power and who end up paying $0.01 per install.

A rev share means that every month everybody has to have the fight about what the actual revenue numbers are. I expect the way this work is that Unity will be tracking every game and looking at their app store metrics. If in their opinion they think you&#x27;re making enough money to be worth squeezing, they&#x27;re going to have an account rep call you. And if you don&#x27;t engage, eventually they bring in the lawyers. So it&#x27;s a one-time pain versus a monthly pain.

Sure, I buy that you save some effort for studios that are clearly over the threshold, but it sounds like you&#x27;re primarily talking about smaller companies anyway, and (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) I don&#x27;t see how it would be harder for a company to say \"last year our 5 games each only made $190,000, it was a slow year for us\".> They&#x27;re going to miss x% of the installs and have y% of spurious extras, and whether or not this approach advantages one side or the other is going to depend on a lot of factors down in the noise.

In any situation where it&#x27;s simple to check install numbers (ie, Steam) -- Steam will also be tracking revenue. Where sales numbers are hard to track would be across multiple storefronts where... I mean, installs are also going to be hard to track. Unless they&#x27;re planning to require an Internet connection for installing GoG games and Itch games because those installs aren&#x27;t otherwise tracked. But I feel like that&#x27;s going to be an issue for users if they do. Tracking revenue on a platform like GoG should be significantly easier than tracking installs, GoG has very little infrastructure I&#x27;m aware of to track installs of DRM free games.I&#x27;m not an accountant, I don&#x27;t want to make a serious claim, I could be wrong about the complexity, but it sounds like there is still going to be fighting over what installs failed, what was and wasn&#x27;t pirated, etc... is that fight easier to have than \"how much revenue did you take in?\" :shrug:Also bear in mind that this is not \"you cross the threshold and then pay us for all installs\", it&#x27;s \"you cross the threshold and pay us for installs after that point.\" So it&#x27;s not just enough to ask if a company is making $200,000. When did they hit $200,000 in the current calendar year? How many installs happened specifically after that point? You still have to have that conversation with the company&#x27;s accountants and you still have to try and confirm dates. And you have to do that yearly, and if you&#x27;re already going to companies yearly and working with their accountants per-game to figure out when exactly installs start costing money... I don&#x27;t know, again I&#x27;m not an accountant. I see that as a similarly complicated problem. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.----My take is that Unity isn&#x27;t saying that this makes their accounting easier, they&#x27;re saying that it&#x27;s going to encourage more \"deep collaboration\" with developers who purchase additional services, and that it supports the \"continued investment\" of the runtime. I&#x27;m inclined to believe the motivations that they&#x27;re saying publicly. I&#x27;m sure that if they&#x27;re pressed they won&#x27;t reject a framing of accounting&#x2F;ease of use, but it strikes me that it&#x27;s not the motivation they&#x27;re leading with.

I (!)&#x27;d the yearly part there, because you still need to be pulling in a yearly $1M of revenue (I&#x27;m assuming Unity Pro here cause the math is simpler) after your 1M of installs.So while there are some edge cases here that are legitimately ludicrous, it&#x27;s not the case that you&#x27;re on the hook for the game in perpetuity, because if your game falls off a cliff and you make $500k in revenue next year, you owe nothing in runtime fees. In other words, you&#x27;re not incentivized to take it off the market after 1M installs unless the runtime fees made it so you started losing money on the game after your $1M of revenue-- there are some examples where this is possible but none of them are very realistic. reply jay_kyburz 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also not clear if its $1M in the previous 12 months, or in the past calendar year, or if they have any rights to audit us, or which financial entity is on the hook.

What about the folks that do our PS5 and Xbox ports for us?Unity attempted to clarify their position around Game Pass telling devs not to worry because Microsoft will pay, but that makes me more worried because MS will just pull those games. I think there are 25 million Game Pass subscribers, and that&#x27;s a lot of 20c installs.We were hoping for another stint in Game Pass as a follow up to Void Bastards. replyindymike 12 hours agorootparentprev> Unity says they&#x27;re shifting away from revenue shares, presumably because they can&#x27;t track purchase revenue and are tired of having a bunch of small fights with people who have every incentive to hide revenue from them.So now they are charging developers for something users have an incentive to try to do without paying the developer. reply charcircuit 18 hours agorootparentprev>Are there any app stores that charge developers per install?Ad platforms. It&#x27;s common especially for mobile games to have a monetary rate where you pay per install. reply danShumway 18 hours agorootparentI would not categorize an ad platform as an app store. Plenty of streaming services and content licensing models charge per-stream&#x2F;impression as well, but I feel that&#x27;s a pretty separate category.I&#x27;d be open to more clarification if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing, but I still don&#x27;t think this is comparable to app store fees. reply charcircuit 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the only thing I can think of that also charges on a per install basis. reply hobs 16 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t forget malware for your botnet! reply danShumway 16 hours agorootparentDo stuff like DDoS attack services or botnets charge per-install instead of directly for usage or compute time? Honestly kinda predatory pricing if that&#x27;s the case. Seems a little problematic.&#x2F;j replyflutas 19 hours agorootparentprev> it seems like it&#x27;s in the ballpark of what the app stores are chargingBut now that&#x27;s on top of the app store fee. So, using your example and the \"standard (aka 30%)\" app store fee, after that 200k cliff, the game makes $0.50 for every $1 sale. That is going to drive people away from using Unity on mobile games imo. Who cares about a $0.20 fee for a $70 (rip $60) game, but for a $1 game where 30% of your rev is already gone... it changes the dynamics.Maybe that&#x27;s what they want though? Maybe they are trying to use this to angle as Unity is a \"serious\" engine now? reply wpietri 19 hours agorootparentYeah, the case that interest me is mobile games with a high install&#x2F;revenue ratio. If I install a popular game, try it out for 3 minutes, and decide it&#x27;s not for me, then am I costing some indie developer $0.20 even though there&#x27;s no revenue?My guess is that the answer there is in this bit: \"Qualifying customers may be eligible for credits toward the Unity Runtime Fee based on the adoption of Unity services beyond the Editor, such as Unity Gaming Services or Unity LevelPlay mediation for mobile ad-supported games. This program enables deeper partnership with Unity to succeed across the entire game lifecycle. Please reach out to your account manager to learn more.\"My guess is that as long as Unity is getting a slice of your ads, you don&#x27;t have to worry about per-install fees. So this may be more about driving free-to-play mobile devs to use their ad services.Depending on how the legalese is worded, we might also see the comeback of demo versions and paid versions. So the free version has lots of installs but zero revenue, and the $0.20 bite only comes out of things you&#x27;re charging for. reply jsharpe 19 hours agorootparentprevThey want 20% of that, PER MONTH. reply wpietri 19 hours agorootparentSorry, where does it say per month? I don&#x27;t see that. reply jsharpe 19 hours agorootparent\"Standard monthly rate\" above that section of the fee table. reply semanticist 19 hours agorootparentThat just references that the fee is charged monthly and for pro&#x2F;entprise plans based on monthly install numbers.But you&#x27;re at least the second person just in this discussion to make that mistake, so they probably need to reword that table! reply wpietri 19 hours agorootparentprevAh, I see what you&#x27;re saying, but in the linked FAQ it says, \"Creators only pay once per download.\" replyJoeOfTexas 19 hours agoparentprevits bonkers, considering most games fail lol, no way some college student is going to pay that reply cheeseomlit 19 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re telling me.

I should&#x27;ve known better than to trust a publicly traded company with anything ever. reply cptcobalt 18 hours agorootparentGodot is reasonably better than Unity, especially with Godot 4 and onward. A bit of a learning curve, but that&#x27;s the same with any engine. You can certainly prototype and ship more quickly with Godot than Unreal. reply KronisLV 17 hours agorootparent> Godot is reasonably better than Unity, especially with Godot 4 and onward.I actually made a post explaining how the only terrain plugin available at the time didn&#x27;t really work well in neither Godot 3, nor Godot 4: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kronis.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;terrains-in-godot-not-quite...Then, a while later, a new plugin came out that&#x27;s made by the community, which seems to address some of my concerns: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NwJEXOglBrQ (video by Gamefromscratch)To me, it feels like Godot has a pretty nice future ahead of it. I&#x27;ll probably stick with Unity for the time being, since I don&#x27;t actually expect any of my small game projects to ever get big, so the change in pricing doesn&#x27;t really affect me at the time. But in the future? Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to Godot, even their C# support is getting much nicer now! reply jsharpe 19 hours agorootparentprevCollege students don&#x27;t have to, since they don&#x27;t meet this criteria to be charged the monthly fee: \"Those that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.\"That said, wow. Charging a monthly fee on game installs is absolutely wild. The personal fee (for first world countries) is $0.20 &#x2F; month. If you charged $10 for the game, you&#x27;d be losing money after only 50 months (around 4 years). reply marcosdumay 16 hours agorootparentThey managed to create a price that inviabilizes both ads-for-playing (and the more devious variants, like pay-for-win and lottery) and upfront paid games. That&#x27;s just amazing, and will probably become a case study somewhere after the company fails. reply meheleventyone 19 hours agorootparentprevYou’re reading it wrong the monthly bit refers to the reporting&#x2F;billing period and volume discounts. So each month you pay for the installs past the thresholds that month. reply meheleventyone 19 hours agorootparentprevYou need to meet minimums in terms of revenue and installs so for college students it’d be a success problem. It’s still going to put a load of people off because who needs the added worry and reporting involved! reply no_wizard 19 hours agorootparentprevThey have thresholds based on revenue and install counts. You have to meet both before you pay anything.After reading the FAQ though I’m not sure it’s a good deal.It also seems like you 100% have to enable spyware reply stuckinhell 17 hours agorootparentpreva college student wouldn&#x27;t pay anything until they are making money reply ceeam 19 hours agoparentprev20 cents MONTHLY reply flutas 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s only once per install.

Invoicing will be the same method as for your Unity plan subscriptions, though it will be monthly regardless of your Unity plan payment cycle.I&#x27;m assuming that $0.20 is paid every time it&#x27;s downloaded based on their wording, so that could introduce a new way to harm competitors.

Isn&#x27;t that the (admittedly unfair but true for the mobile market) stereotype? reply pavlov 18 hours agorootparentUnity merged with an ad network last year.The engine now exists as a vehicle to show more ads, since that’s the primary revenue source of the company. reply hightrix 12 hours agorootparentAds are a technological cancer that seem to have no cure in sight.It is really frustrating how ads have ruined so many good products&#x2F;platforms. reply mrguyorama 17 hours agorootparentprevMobile users put up with even directly \"pay to win\" mechanics and blatant gacha bullshit. They seem unwilling or unable, for whatever reason, to even conceive of a different paradigm. \"Mobile gaming\", read mobile unregulated casinos where you can never withdraw, are the biggest and most profitable gaming sector.Don&#x27;t worry, companies like EA are looking at that market, licking their chops, and continue to try and push such concepts as gacha into what used to be perfectly fine video games, and plenty of consumers eat up any excuse just so they don&#x27;t have to go a year without the exact same videogame as last year but worse. reply pavlov 19 hours agoprevLast year Unity merged with IronSource, a mobile app ad network.The writing was on the wall then. These “pricing upgrades” today are designed to drive more adoption of Unity’s ad network. Popular free games will have to start showing ads via Unity to pay for the new runtime distribution fee. reply nugget 19 hours agoparentMost of the talent from IronSource has left or checked out, and they started to slip in competitiveness and lose clients as a result. This pricing model seems designed to slow those losses, but if it increases developer adoption of Godot or another rival platform (other than Unreal), it seems like Unity is playing with fire here. reply Kerbonut 19 hours agoparentprevThey are literally disincentivizing installation of games made by their engine, hilarious. reply BonitaPersona 14 hours agorootparentWell, this is in line with their wonderful incentive for devs to pay to REMOVE the mandatory Unity logo.This has made +10 years of high-quality, unforgettable, GOTY games made in Unity to not have the logo, while all the humble, low-quality, full of free-asset-store assets, practice projects of newbies, show the Unity logo first and foremost.Literally attaching your brand recognition to the projects exactly opposite of the ones you want your brand to be recognized with. reply KMnO4 19 hours agoprevThe pricing is a bit weird. Their criteria is based on gross revenue of >=$200k. But instead of charging a percentage of that, they charge per install at a rate of $0.20&#x2F;install.So if you made $200k off of 1M installs, you’ll now pay $200k and your total profit will be zero.I guess the assumption is that each install will earn you >>$0.20, but that’s a very generous assumption. What about a F2P game that has millions of installs but only a fraction support the game with microtransactions?There’s definitely going to be some cases where studios will owe more money to Unity than their game makes. reply DuctTapeAI 12 hours agoparentThey&#x27;ve been pushing hard recently to get people to use their ads platform, my bet is they&#x27;re hoping to push \"under-monetized\" games to run a ton of ads in order to make any money. This kind of a pricing model forces games to think about ads and monetization from the beginning instead of building a large happy user base. reply meheleventyone 19 hours agoparentprevI think you need to read the table again. If you have that volume you shouldn’t be on the most expensive per install plan. And if you’re on a higher plan you wouldn’t qualify for the per install pricing at all. reply KMnO4 19 hours agorootparentBefore this change, there would be no reason to spend $2100&#x2F;seat on Unity Pro. The Personal&#x2F;Plus plans would be more than sufficient for indie devs.You’re right, some studios are going to be forced to switch to the Pro plan to save on per install pricing. That just seems like a really frustrating forced upgrade. reply krajzeg 19 hours agorootparentIn fact, the Plus plan is being removed completely. It&#x27;s only mentioned off-handedly in the last paragraph of the article, but it&#x27;s another giant change for indie devs (who have no choice but to migrate from Plus to Pro).They are offering a free upgrade from Plus to Pro for one year, but that does nothing once that time elapses - you have to pay the Pro fees or drop down to Personal, which is not viable for most games. reply meheleventyone 19 hours agorootparentprevIn your presumed case the studio would already be breaking Unity’s terms to be using Personal or Plus as companies making over $200,000 in the last 12 months need to have Pro subscriptions! Dunno how flouted that is though. reply grogenaut 19 hours agorootparentprevIs they&#x27;re cranking out that many sales and games is $2100 unfair? reply yalok 17 hours agorootparentThose are life time installs.My game has been around for a few years and has over 500k life time installs.I May be getting very small install rate per month now, but would still have to pay a lot. reply grogenaut 4 hours agorootparentmy understanding is that the $2100 removes the life time install part, and that it&#x27;s only for games going forward so you&#x27;d be able to do the math up front.

Who is charging 20 cents for their games? reply Mydayyy 18 hours agorootparentHis point stands tho. Think about mobile games, where games are significantly cheaper (0.99€-5€). That install fee will hit a lot different than for high priced desktop titles (30€+). In addition think about the turnover in mobile games.The Unity Page does not mention free games with micro transactions, but especially there the user turnover is way higher. A lot of people will install it, play it for a few minutes (or days) and remove it again. Will the developer pay those install fees too?This entire thing seems not really thought out.I am also wondering what about trolls, who spoof HWID (or whatever the unique install id is based of) and spam-install it reply hightrix 12 hours agorootparent> I am also wondering what about trolls, who spoof HWID (or whatever the unique install id is based of) and spam-install itYou don&#x27;t even need to get that technical.

Selecting Unity as your game engine is a business decision and part of your business model.

I called it turdPy.I released it under a commercial license of $20000 per CPU thread per developer device per day to use. With an additional 80-20 revenue share model (80% going to me) once the devs sell their game.I never got any customers, and I always wondered why. But now I understand that it was because game studios simply didn&#x27;t have a good enough business model. reply fzeroracer 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat about the fact that Unity is changing their business model and making it retroactive to fuck over people? reply BizarroLand 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re just going to spam the same thought over and over again then you should go to reddit where that lack of originality is appreciated. reply TillE 18 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s completely realistic for a F2P game. reply peteforde 12 hours agoprevThis is brutal and devastating.

Now, Guin­ness World Re­cords has con­firmed that mythen broke the pre­vi­ous world ac­cel­er­a­tion re­cord for elec­tric vehicles. On the Switzer­land In­nov­a­tion Park in Duebendorf, Switzer­land, dir­ectly op­pos­ite the stu­dents’ work­shop, their ra­cing car ac­cel­er­ated from zero to 100 km/h (zero to 62.15 mph) in just 0.956 seconds, ac­com­plish­ing this feat over a dis­tance of merely 12.3 metres. At the wheel was Kate Mag­getti. This beats the pre­vi­ous world re­cord of 1.461 seconds, set in Septem­ber 2022 by a team from the Uni­ver­sity of Stut­tgart by more than a third. (Video: ETH Zurich / JG VIDEO GmbH) “Work­ing on the pro­ject in ad­di­tion to my stud­ies was very in­tense. But even so, it was a lot of fun work­ing with other stu­dents to con­tinu­ally pro­duce new solu­tions and put into prac­tice what we learned in class. And, of course, it is an ab­so­lutely unique ex­per­i­ence to be in­volved in a world re­cord,” says Yann Bern­ard, head of mo­tor at AMZ. Lighter, stronger, more trac­tion All of mythen’s com­pon­ents, from the prin­ted cir­cuit boards (PCBs) to the chassis and the bat­tery, were de­veloped by the stu­dents them­selves and op­tim­ised for their func­tion. Thanks to the use of light­weight car­bon and alu­minium hon­ey­comb, the race car weighs in at only around 140 kilos (309 pounds). Four-wheel hub mo­tors that the stu­dents de­veloped them­selves and a spe­cial power­train give the vehicle its im­press­ive power of 240 kilo­watts, or around 326 hp. Photo gal­lery from the race track 1 / 13 (All Pho­to­graphs: Aless­andro Della Bella / ETH Zurich) “But power isn’t the only thing that mat­ters when it comes to set­ting an ac­cel­er­a­tion re­cord – ef­fect­ively trans­fer­ring that power to the ground is also key,” says Dario Messerli, head of aero­dy­nam­ics at AMZ. Con­ven­tional For­mula One cars solve this through aero­dy­nam­ics: a rear or front wing pushes the car to the ground. How­ever, this ef­fect only comes into play when the car has reached a cer­tain speed. To en­sure strong trac­tion right from the start, the AMZ team has de­veloped a kind of va­cuum cleaner that holds the vehicle down to the ground by suc­tion. Hotly con­tested world re­cord The AMZ team had set the world ac­cel­er­a­tion re­cord for elec­tric cars twice be­fore – in 2014 and again in 2016. In the fol­low­ing years, their re­cord was broken by a team from the Uni­ver­sity of Stut­tgart. Now the world re­cord is back in Swiss hands, and the ETH Zurich stu­dents are con­fid­ent they will not re­lin­quish it again any time soon. About the Aca­demic Mo­tor­s­ports Club Zurich (AMZ) AMZ was foun­ded by ETH Zurich stu­dents in 2006. Since then, its 30, or so, mem­bers have de­veloped a new race car each year, which they have entered into vari­ous in­ter­na­tional design com­pet­i­tions – known as For­mula Stu­dent in Europe. After ini­tially de­vel­op­ing three vehicles powered by an internal-combustion en­gine, since 2010 AMZ has been build­ing purely elec­tric­ally powered race cars. The club of­fers stu­dents the op­por­tun­ity to put their ac­quired the­or­et­ical know­ledge into prac­tice in an ex­traordin­ar­ily com­plex, tech­nical en­vir­on­ment. AMZ is fin­an­cially in­de­pend­ent and is sup­por­ted by nu­mer­ous spon­sors as well as vari­ous Swiss uni­ver­sit­ies.

It seems they&#x27;re taking old tricks and building a \"sucker car\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.roadandtrack.com&#x2F;motorsports&#x2F;a32350&#x2F;jim-hall-cha...Still neat stuff.Race sanctioning bodies will need to update their rules or these will just be one off bragging rights. reply radicalbyte 18 hours agoparentIn Micromouse (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Micromouse) - a competition where autonomous devices solve a mouse maze - the fastest competitors are all using fans to increase traction (and thus speed). reply underlines 17 hours agorootparentradicalbyte, you&#x27;re absolutely right that the use of fans in Micromouse increases the traction, and therefore the speed at which the maze is solved. Suction allows for impressive performances.However, a small caveat that might be worth considering is that while the suction indeed increases speed, it might be more accurate to say that it primarily improves acceleration instead of car speed: The issue often lies with achieving rapid acceleration rather than with maintaining high speed. Even systems with relatively low traction can reach high speeds given enough time and distance, but the ability to accelerate quickly is crucial in competitions like Micromouse. reply HPsquared 17 hours agorootparentSpeed = ∫(acceleration) dt reply westurner 12 hours agorootparentDerivatives of relative displacement as defined by a distance metric in a [e.g. metric tensor] space: Length = Point2 - Point1 Length * Time^-1 = Velocity or Speed Length * Time^-2 = Acceleration Length * Time^-3 = Jerk Length * Time^-4 = Snap or Jounce Length * Time^-5 = Crackle Length * Time^-6 = PopDisplacement (geometry) > Derivatives: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Displacement_(geometry)#Deriva...Fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of position: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fourth,_fifth,_and_sixth_deriv... reply jameshart 8 hours agorootparentSomething weird about this is that humans very often ascribe the sensation of d^ns&#x2F;dt^n, to feeling d^n-1s&#x2F;dt^n-1.So people will say that something which accelerates quickly is &#x27;fast&#x27;. Or they will say, when they feel themselves initially being pressed back into their seat as a plane starts its takeoff roll, that they are experiencing &#x27;acceleration&#x27; when what they are experiencing is actually jerk.The thing is, you can&#x27;t actually feel motion at a constant speed - so the only thing that tells you you are acquiring speed is your body&#x27;s experience of acceleration - so when you feel yourself accelerating, you associate that with speed. Likewise, your body also can&#x27;t really tell the difference between constant acceleration and just... being at a different angle, and maybe a bit heavier than normal. So it&#x27;s when you experience changes in the apparent direction of &#x27;down&#x27; and the overall &#x27;weight&#x27; you&#x27;re feeling that you think &#x27;oh, we&#x27;re accelerating&#x27;.My favorite way to get a sense of what acceleration, jerk and snap feel like is to focus on what happens when you&#x27;re in a car that&#x27;s braking hard. You&#x27;re decelerating at a relatively constant rate while the brakes are applied - it feels as if &#x27;down&#x27; is pointing slightly forward, meaning you&#x27;d be sliding off the seat if it weren&#x27;t for your seatbelt holding you back. When the car finally stops though, there&#x27;s a very abrupt change in acceleration - a &#x27;jerk&#x27;. &#x27;Down&#x27; switches to pointing straight down again, very quickly. You&#x27;re pulled back into your seat. That&#x27;s jerk. And specifically the sudden onset of that swing in what direction &#x27;down&#x27; is pointing, and then its rapid disappearance is snap. Your body feels like it&#x27;s being &#x27;jerked&#x27; around when the car stops precisely because that motion has high snap - you experience a sudden high amount of jerk, then the jerk ends. reply pixl97 8 hours agorootparent>The thing is, you can&#x27;t actually feel motion at a constant speedIn a vacuum. If you roll the window down, or if the atmosphere starts ablating you into a hot plasma then you may realize you&#x27;re going very fast. reply lambdasquirrel 6 hours agorootparentOh cmon, who rolls down the windows in an airplane? ;) reply jameshart 7 hours agorootparentprevOr the air&#x27;s going very fast past you. Who can tell? reply brokencode 7 hours agorootparentUnless you’re in a wind tunnel or a hurricane, you can be pretty confident in the reason for the fast air. reply uoaei 4 hours agorootparentprevThen you&#x27;re experiencing acceleration, just in the opposite direction. reply codethief 5 hours agorootparentprevHmmm, from a Newtonian perspective I would have argued (or at least my personal impression is) the only thing we actually perceive is force (i.e. acceleration). All the situations you described are just (higher-order) changes of acceleration and even if you give them a name: At the end of the day, the only thing that matters to our bodies is the force. reply anikan_vader 16 hours agorootparentprevSure, but once you have speed you can use aerodynamics to get grip (e.g., F1 cars). So this is really only relevant if you need acceleration from low speed. reply AmericanChopper 6 hours agorootparentF1 has featured a car that used a fan to generate downforce.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brabham_BT46An issue with aero features (other than not producing their effects at low speed) is their ability to stall. Ground effect was especially dangerous (back when high-ground-effect designs were allowed) because if it stalls during a high speed corner (say from driving over a bump, like a kerb maybe) you can instantaneously lose a huge amount of downforce, which is obviously quite dangerous. reply epolanski 12 hours agorootparentprevExactly, thus you can simply integrate over a longer time span.But if you want to increase the acceleration you need traction, your tyres need to be glued to the asphalt. Since you don&#x27;t have aerodynamic pressure at those speeds you need to suck the vehicle to the ground. reply mtillman 10 hours agorootparentprevGordon Murray was ahead of his time: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brabham_BT46 reply chen_dev 11 hours agorootparentprevInteresting topic.

Back in the day he used to take his kids to school in his Ferrari 250 GTO. These days the car is so valuable I got the impression he has to call his insurance company to get permission to take it out on the road. Years ago he published a book called \"Into the red\" with some of his cars. The book had a companion CD of the engine noise made by a selection of the cars. They took each car to the track to record it.Perhaps the most intense car he owns must be the BRM V16 which, to quote someone who saw it race back in the day \"would make your ears bleed\". https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fZMPDCNyQxE?si=e97ihEFRW7DU_UcC reply ryukoposting 12 hours agorootparentprevSuddenly I remember a Top Gear episode where Nick Mason drops off his F1 (maybe it was a Ferrari Enzo?) at the test track, then his personal helicopter lands on the strip, picks him up, and flies him out of the scene, all while \"Money\" by Pink Floyd plays in the background. reply kQq9oHeAz6wLLS 6 hours agorootparentEnzo.

Where I would expect to see an axle or something to provide torque to wheels from the engine, there is just a yellow wire.I know that&#x27;s how electric cars work. But something about it in the racing car context just brings it home to me - electricity just works differently to all our other intuitions about the world. Factories used to have bands and axels taking power from one central steam engine to all corners of the building. And then they got redesigned once electricity came in.I got a gut realisation from that photo that something similar is &#x2F; has happened.I like to emphasise using \"boring tech\" at work to avoid chasing too many rainbows. But sometimes there is a pot of gold and I need to remember that, else my factory will remain steam powered. reply michaelteter 10 hours agoparentThe \"instant\" torque provided by electric motors compared to traditional IC&#x2F;drivetrain systems is really sexy, but what is perhaps more useful is the vastly quicker power modulation that is possible with electric systems.Electric cars can manage traction control so much more precisely that they can do seemingly impossible things. This snow climb comparison between various Audis - IC and electric, demonstrated that electric traction control could easily manage low friction scenarios which seem unimaginable. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HJRRvHlvhAI reply jamiek88 9 hours agorootparentEven in mid range tech this is true. My fricken KIA of all things (EV6) has AWD and a ‘snow mode’ that is fucking magic.Climbing an iced over driveway on a hill in Utah on vacation while $90k big ass trucks were abandoned at the foot of the hill was awesome.I’ve had some very high end 4x4’s in my time and none of them could climb, stop or accelerate like this $50k hot hatch.The instant response to all 4 wheels being updated at kilohertz is a whole other paradigm. reply 1-more 16 hours agoparentprev> Factories used to have bands and axels taking power from one central steam engine to all corners of the building.From my own experience: a popular home woodworker tool from the middle of the 20th century is a Shop Smith. It had a motor that you would couple to the various mounted attachments to run the lathe or the band saw or the table saw etc one tool at a time. I guess part of the appeal was certainly the size savings, but I have to think it was also only having to buy one electric motor. Life changingly good motors are now commodity parts, and artisanally crafted ones are setting acceleration world records. Cool time to be alive. reply munificent 14 hours agorootparentTractors, still widely used today, as essentially a mobile version of this.One of the main purposes of a tractor, compared to other farm vehicles, is that it has a power take-off [0] to enable the engine to drive other farm implements like combines.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Power_take-off reply JshWright 10 hours agorootparentEasily one of the most dangerous bit of farm equipment.

Flails tend to throw less things(which is why highway maintenance use them for mowing along the road). reply kQq9oHeAz6wLLS 6 hours agorootparentEarly tractor PTOs where especially, um, fun. No built-in overrunning clutch and no \"live\" PTO means the inertia of spinning implements could turn the PTO, and thus the drive wheels. Nothing like standing on the brakes while the tractor just...keeps going for a few feet.Fortunately overrunning clutch attachments are cheap to add. reply pests 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never actually thought about what a tractor actually is.

In all of those cases the weight and breakdownability of having another motor in the tool attached to the tractor seems like a real hassle compared to a PTO. reply mdorazio 15 hours agoparentprevKind of. This team is specifically using hub motors, thus bypassing the need for traditional axles. Hub motors are notoriously inefficient, though, so you don’t see them in normal BEVs which typically mount the motors near the center of the axle (as part of an “e-axle”). Basically, this team’s car is purpose built only for acceleration and thus gets away with doing things you wouldn’t see in cars that need to maintain speed or drive efficiently. Great ingenuity by them! reply tromp 14 hours agorootparentThey needn&#x27;t be inefficient, as demonstrated by their use in the hyper efficient Lightyear0 solar powered car.

And then they got redesigned once electricity came in.Fascinating fact you might enjoy: many modern industrial facilities use compressed air to power many of the devices inside.At a lot of Amazon facilities, a main compressor is somewhere on site keeping a large tank full. The compressed air is piped throughout the facility[0], and used to power a lot of moving parts in an open loop, making a distinctive &#x27;hiss&#x27; sound[1] as the device moves and releases air. Not everything, certainly, but a lot of simple devices that need to move quickly and with some force.It&#x27;s all computer controlled and yes, electricity is a major part- but the driving force is coming from compressed air. And that&#x27;s pretty neat.[0] (Or so it was explained to me by the controls tech guys there)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y5Hf08XrI_A (the first 30 seconds or so it&#x27;s really noticeable). reply mannyv 13 hours agoparentprevYeah, they&#x27;ve taken the \"distribute mechanical work\" part out of the process.It&#x27;s amazing that all those car cylinders going up and down (or technically, being forced up and down by tiny explosions) are transformed into work.Rotary motion -> work has been part of humanity for a long time.

There are practical limits on the strength of the magnetic force because you can only cram so many amps through a confined space, which is even more confined on a small motor.It will still make high power at high RPMs, but you have to gear it down to convert that power into more torque at low speeds. A gearbox makes it not really a Hub Motor at all any more. Terminology aside, a gearbox also adds even more weight and complexity inside the wheel.

Even back in the &#x27;60s, a sports car enthusiast would have chosen an MGB over a much faster Camaro, because the MGB is a sports car and the Camaro is not.Engagement, dynamics, and \"feelsomeness\" are not vague at all. Handling is the product of engineering. It is largely objective. Some cars really are easier to control than others. Some really do hold on better in the corners. Cars really do have more or less body roll and more or less oversteer. What \"character\" is best is a matter of opinion, but the car really does have that \"character\".

(x = 8.4194515 m)Gravitational acceleration (for a point mass) is: the gravitational constant, multiplied by the mass, divided by the radius squared, and we want the result in Earth gravities: $ qalc G * 2.5e12kg &#x2F; 8.4194515² m² to gee (newtonian_constant * ((2.5 * (10^12)) * kilogram)) &#x2F; ((8.4194515^2) * (meter^2)) = approx. 0.24 geeYou&#x27;re only one order of magnitude off — if this is correct, which I am really not sure about!Sources: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;White_dwarf · https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Olympic-size_swimming_pool · https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=volume+of+a+sphere&ia=answer · https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input?i=surface+gravity+calcula...What I&#x27;m even less sure how to calculate is whether an 8-meter sphere can be that heavy. Uranium is ~2e4 kg&#x2F;m³, but under its own gravity, things shrink until they reach black hole status (infinite smallness; perceived size coming from its event horizon). Basically I&#x27;d want to turn the above 1e9kg&#x2F;m³ into an unknown, but what&#x27;s the formula for mass given your specified radius and gravitational acceleration?

It seems like the front wheels and the rear wheels each share a single coilover and they use hydraulic cylinders at each wheel to transmit the force. I&#x27;m sure this saves a lot of weight but I&#x27;m interested in how the suspension dynamics are changed by two independent wheels sharing the same spring and damper.Do any other vehicles do this? Are there are any other applications where it would make sense? reply gladoskar 16 hours agoparentThis is actually fairly common in Formula Student cars. They often use decoupled heave&#x2F;roll suspension systems, where one spring&#x2F;damper is for the heave of the entire axle and another one for the roll on the axle. It has some advantages over separate springs, but I&#x27;d have to ask our suspension guys.The graphics in this article show its function fairly well, but don&#x27;t explain the calculations eitherhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marekdostal.com&#x2F;suspension-design&#x2F;Recently, some teams have added the hydraulic relocation of dampers, and some (like Dresden) even have software control of them. reply Nick87633 13 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the go-kart suspension still somewhat competitive, though?

Basically if the driver is wearing a helmet (and a fire suit at more formal places) you can run it. To compete they&#x27;ll often require roll cages but most pulls are just against the clock so on many nights they let any random joe schmo pull up and get a time.The crowd often line the lanes behind small concrete barriers and people are usually welcome in the staging area and right up next to the burnout boxes..Explosions and fires are common, as are crashes.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;O7P_2voFMRE?t=35https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QeIwAJK3iBg?t=128 reply sottol 16 hours agorootparentMaybe it&#x27;s the traction control thenhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yellowbullet.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;evs-got-banned-from-rac... reply poniko 18 hours agorootparentprevIn ten years it&#x27;s all going to be solid state, no more fires. reply sroussey 18 hours agorootparentFor sure, assuming we haven’t switch from Lithium to Aluminum by then. reply sottol 18 hours agorootparentprevI hope so! reply orangepurple 18 hours agorootparentprevDrag racers used to use hydrazine which would slowly convert into a contact explosive when mixed with gasoline.

This is an uninstaller! The mystery function is almost certainly DeleteFileW. It’s waiting for the main uninstaller to exit, so it can delete the binary. There is a page on CodeProject that shows how to write a self-deleting file, and it seems that multiple companies have decided to use that code to implement their own uninstallers. (Whether they follow the licensing terms for that code I do not know.) Okay, so why did we crash? What went wrong with DeleteFileW? According to the dump file, the spot where DeleteFileW was supposed to be instead holds 7077c100. This is a function pointer into some mystery DLL that isn’t loaded. How did that happen? My guess is that the DeleteFileW function was detoured in the Contoso uninstaller. When the uninstaller tried to built its table of useful functions, it ended up getting not the address of DeleteFileW but the address of a detour. It then tried to call that detour from its payload, but since the detour is not installed in Explorer (or if it is, the detour is in some other location), it ended up calling into space. Neither code injection nor detouring is officially supported. I can’t tell who did the detouring. Maybe somebody added a detour to the uninstaller, unaware that the uninstaller is going to inject a call to the detour into Explorer. Or maybe the detour was injected by anti-malware software. Or maybe the detour was injected by Windows’ own application compatibility layer. Whatever the reason, the result was a crash in Explorer. Which means that people like me spend a lot of time studying these crashes to figure out what is going on, only to conclude that they were caused by other people abusing the system. If you want to create a self-deleting binary, please don’t use code injection into somebody else’s process. Here’s a way to delete a binary and leave no trace: Create a temporary file called cleanup.js that goes like this: var fso = new ActiveXObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\"); fso.DeleteFile(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Name\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\cleanup.js\"); var path = \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Contoso\\\\contoso_update.exe\"; for (var count = 0; fso.FileExists(path) && count nul & del \"%~f0\" Log in to Vote or Reply Marcus André September 12, 2023 1:42 am 0 collapse this comment copy link to this comment Insane way for simple tasks, lol.

This is mostly useful for removing or replacing files that are in use at the time you’re trying to remove/replace them . Many installers or uninstallers use it for that purpose (any installer that asks you to reboot usually does so because it has done this, especially if you find the app in question does not work until you actually reboot). Log in to Vote or Reply Dan Bugglin September 13, 2023 12:23 am 0 collapse this comment copy link to this comment If a jscript dependency is somehow a concern, you can fairly easily rewrite the script in batch. Then all you need is cmd.exe which everyone has. A bit of IF EXISTS, a bit of DEL, a GOTO loop and label, and finally run cmd.exe with no window to keep things nice and tidy. The only bit that could be trouble is there’s no built in delay function. But it’s fairly easy to find a command that implements a delay itself and abuse the hell out of it for our own purposes. ping.exe will work just fine. You just need to craft a command you know will always fail via timeout, and do a single ping with your desired delay as the timeout. Turns out localhost subnet’s multicast IP address works fine for this. Multicast addresses are reserved and can’t actually point to a single device. And apparently ICMP doesn’t multicast, I guess. ping -n 1 -w [delay in milliseconds] 127.255.255.255 Another completely unrelated approach is to use MoveFileEx with no new file name and MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT flag, to indicate the file should be deleted next boot (If you’re patient.)

Why isn&#x27;t this handled by Windows itself? reply highwaylights 1 hour agoparentI don&#x27;t think any major desktop OS handles this well.I suspect the final form for software installation is probably where iOS and Android are going in the EU, where there&#x27;s a single means of installing software to the device so that everything can be sandboxed properly, but the acquisition&#x2F;update process can be pointed to a URL&#x2F;Store that the user has pre-approved.macOS comes pretty close to what I&#x27;d ideally want in an OS with regards to installation - independent packages that are certified&#x2F;notarised, but I&#x27;d like to see the OS allow for user-specified authorities beyond just Apple. That being said, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d ever use them as it&#x27;s part of what I&#x27;m paying Apple for, I&#x27;m really thinking more of Linux there.A kind of flatpak&#x2F;snap approach, but that has signing of the package and centralised management of the permissions for the sandbox at an OS level would be ideal in my view. That way it&#x27;s still free-as-in-speech as the user can specify which notarisation authority to use (or none at all).I really don&#x27;t understand why seperate programs are handling removing their mother program in 2023, that&#x27;s registry spaghetti messy. reply mschuster91 1 hour agorootparent> macOS comes pretty close to what I&#x27;d ideally want in an OS with regards to installation - independent packages that are certified&#x2F;notarised, but I&#x27;d like to see the OS allow for user-specified authorities beyond just Apple.It&#x27;s easy to run unsigned binaries&#x2F;app packages on macOS: right click on the .app, hold down Option, then click Open and confirm the warning. reply tmpX7dMeXU 46 minutes agorootparentThat is not a user-specified authority. reply tobias3 1 hour agorootparentprevYou are basically describing what Windows has as appx&#x2F;msix.

Thanks!I’d need to educate myself a bit more in terms of whether there are third-party authorities beyond Microsoft for the packages.Found this introductory video for anyone else interested:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=phrD081sMWcNote: I didn’t intend the Surface pun above, but it happened and we can all be glad that it did. reply mike_hearn 1 hour agorootparentYes there are a few certificate authorities. For example DigiCert, SSL.com and others. You can also create your own e.g. for enterprise deployments. Or you could even set up a public CA if you wanted to, the process is standardized.So whilst Microsoft will sign for you if you distribute via their store, otherwise you pay per year for certificates and can distribute outside the store.There are problems with the system (cost, bugs, usability problems) but it is decentralized. reply daemin 59 minutes agoparentprevIt allows you to install applications from any source, not only the official store.It allows for a variety of installers to exist with different features for different use cases.It allows you to install the application in any location you choose.It allows for portable installations and to run software just copied from other sources. reply damentz 40 minutes agorootparentWhat is \"it\"? reply daemin 28 minutes agorootparentSpecial installers &#x2F; uninstallers and also the ability to install and run things outside the official OS store. reply remram 30 minutes agorootparentprevI guess \"special installers&#x2F;uninstallers\" reply mike_hearn 1 hour agoparentprevIt is, these days. Windows 10 onwards has a native package format called MSIX that somewhat resembles packages on Linux. They&#x27;re special zips containing an XML file that declares how the software should be integrated into the OS (start menu, commands on the PATH, file associations etc). Windows takes care of installation, update and uninstallation.The system is great, in theory. In practice adoption has been held back by the fact that it was originally only for UWP apps which almost nobody writes, and also only for the MS Store. These days you can use it for Win32 apps outside the store but then you will hit bugs in Windows. And packages must be signed.Still, the feature set is pretty great if you can make it work. For example you can get Chrome-style updates where Windows will keep the app fresh in the background even if it&#x27;s not running. And it will share files on disk between apps if they&#x27;re the same, avoid downloading them, do delta updates and more. It also tracks all the files your app writes to disk outside of the user&#x27;s home directory so they can be cleanly uninstalled, without needing any custom uninstaller logic.One interesting aspect of the format is that because it&#x27;s a \"special\" (read: weird) kind of zip, you can make them on non-Windows platforms. Not using any normal zip tool of course, oh no, that would be too easy. You can only extract them using normal zip tools. But if you write your own zip library you can create them.A couple of years ago I sat down to write a tool that would let anyone ship apps to Win&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux in one command from whatever OS they liked, no harder than copying a website to a server. I learned about MSIX and decided to make this package format. It took us a while to work around all the weird bugs in Windows that only show up on some machines and not others for no explicable reason, but it&#x27;s stable now and it works pretty well. For example you can take some HTML and JS files, write a 5 line config file pointing at those files, run one command and now you have a download page pointing to fully signed (or self signed) self-updating Windows, Mac and Linux Electron app. Or a JVM app. Or a Flutter app. Or any kind of app, really! Also IT departments love it because, well, it&#x27;s a real package format and not an installer.Writing more about this tech has been on my todo list for a while, but I have now published something about the delta update scheme it uses which is based on block maps, it&#x27;s somewhat unusual (a bit Flatpak like):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydraulic.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;20-deltas-diffed.htmlThe tool is free to download, and free for open source projects if anyone is wanting to ship stuff to Windows without installers:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conveyor.hydraulic.dev&#x2F; reply rootw0rm 20 minutes agorootparentthat&#x27;s a cool project, will definitely try it out later reply tetris11 1 hour agoparentprevOne thing I like about Linux package managers is that you can query any file to see which package owns it.

It&#x27;s very much conceivable that a scan tool will try to resolve code like this for 10 layers, and then if the result is not found to be malicious, consider it safe.This is similar to how compilers will often have recursion limits for things like generics, though in that case it&#x27;s easier to reject the program if the recursion limit is reached. reply sim7c00 55 minutes agorootparentprevBecause of potential false positives, and the speed at which files need to be analyzed at runtime (suspend process executing it and then analyze it), having files which take a long time to unpack and identify can cause these to be allowed to run. They get offloaded to a sandbox or other systems to be analyzed while the file is already being executed. The sandboxes are too slow to return a verdict before the main logic of the file will be executed. IF those dynamic systems cannot identify a file, an engineer will manually need to look at it.In very strict environments or certain systems it might be practical to block all unknown files, but this is uncommon for user systems for example where users are actively using javascript or macro documents etc. (developers, HR, finance etc.) The FP rates are too high and productivity can take a big hit. If all users do 20% less work that&#x27;s a big loss in revenue (the productivity hit can be much more severe even!). perhaps this impact &#x2F; loss of revenue ends up being bigger than a malware being executed depending on the rest of the security posture&#x2F;measures.technically its possible to identify (nearly?) all malware by tracking p-states&#x2F;symbolic execution&#x2F;very clever sanboxing etc.. but this simply takes much too long. Especially if the malware authors are aware of sandboxing techniques and symbolic execution and such things as they can make those processes also take extra long or sometimes even evade them totally with further techniques.I wish it _was_ possible to do all of the cleverness that malware researchers have invented to detect things, but unfortunately, in practice this cannot happen on like 90+% of environments.If you run like a DNS server or such things, it&#x27;s possible to do it as such a system would not be expected (ever?) to have unknown files. (gotta test each update and analyze new versions before deploying to prod). As you can imagine, this is also kind of a bummer process but imho for such &#x27;static&#x27; systems its worth it. reply rightbyte 3 hours agorootparentprevWith enough conditional evals() with dynamic inputs you can make the search space unsearchable big. reply heavenlyblue 2 hours agorootparentThe search space is linear as the algorithm is linear. reply sigmoid10 1 hour agorootparentThis stuff is mostly done to make static analysis harder. replymark_and_sweep 4 hours agoparentprevBeen using this for years.

Think of it as they had a fork of Firefox (much like Firefox had a stripped down fork of the SeaMonkey stuff).Also, I think one of the Start Menus (might have been XP‽) was kind of HTA-ish? Not sure about that part, though. reply jraph 2 hours agorootparent> they always built their own binary> Think of it as they had a fork of FirefoxYep indeed, you are right.Notable projects using actual XULRunner included Songbird (a music player) and BlueGriffon, an WYSIWYG HTML editor (a successor of Nvu and KompoZer, themselves succeeding Netscape Composer). Both released after 2006 indeed.I liked XUL, I strongly believe Mozilla could have dominated the market taken by Electron, had they pushed XULRunner more, and perhaps make it transition to pure HTML, like they did to Firefox&#x27;s core, because that&#x27;s what people know and because XUL was a maintenance burden. I think XUL tags made more sense than HTML to build UIs, though, and with XUL, Gecko have had a CSS flex-like mechanism for a long time by the way.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Songbird_%28software%29[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BlueGriffon reply vidarh 1 hour agorootparentThere was an experiment back in the hazy past around that time called Entity that did something similar. It was never complete enough to be a competitor to XULRunner, but it was fascinating for two reasons:1) You could write event handlers in multiple languages, including C. If you wrote them in C, it spawned gcc and compiled it into a library, and dynamically loaded it... The overall idea of a polyglot runtime like that was fun.2) #1 is only really weird because this could be done at runtime. One of the demo apps was an editor for the GUI itself, where you could add buttons to the editor, then write that event handler in C, and have it compiled and loaded into the editor itself...It was a fascinating starting point, though full of heavy duty foot guns, and I&#x27;m still sad nobody took it further. reply mananaysiempre 1 hour agorootparent> The overall idea of a polyglot runtime like that was fun.Active Scripting, which powers scripts in both WSH and old-school IE including HTAs, is polyglot and extensible. It’s why Active{Perl,Python,Tcl} are called that—the original headline feature (IIUC) was that they integrated with it. It’s also why you could write VBS in IE: IE just passed the text of the script along with the language attribute to AS and let it sort things out.Nobody did ever a C interprerer, though, I think—perhaps because you basically have to speak COM from Active Scripting, and while speaking COM from C is certainly possible it’s nobody’s idea of fun. (An ObjC-like preprocessor&#x2F;superset could definitely be made and I’ve heard that Microsoft had even entertained the idea at the dawn of time, but instead they went with C++, and I haven’t been able to find any traces of that project.)That’s not to say AS is perfect or even good—the impossibility of caching DISPIDs[1], in particular, seems like a design-sinking goof. And the AS boundary was also why DOM manipulation in IE was so slow.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ericlippert.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;09&#x2F;16&#x2F;why-do-the-script-engines... replymark_and_sweep 2 hours agorootparentprevWell, you can use IE 9 in HTAs - that browser is plenty capable. :) Been using this as a Windows-only Electron alternative for years. reply mark_and_sweep 2 hours agorootparentFor the curious: Here&#x27;s a completely unfinished guide to how you might start developing such an application: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marksweb.site&#x2F;hta&#x2F; From HTAs, you have access to the file system, the network, the registry, the shell - everything.

It&#x27;s a variant of the language called JScript, which is what was used in old versions of IE too. reply p_l 1 hour agorootparentIt was about Windows 98 that Windows Scripting Host ended up prominent.WSH btw allowed you to run any language that you had interpreter for - they had to support necessary COM interfaces (and to be truly usable, allow you to call COM objects), and register their interpreter class with ActiveScripting (WSH internal) engine.Then you could use them not just for desktop automation, but also for scripts inside Internet Explorer (essentially, classic IE used WSH engines to implement scripts, iirc)I&#x27;ve seen WSH (including HTAs) used with Perl, Python, Tcl, Rexx...so long as you install the interpreter with compatible COM service, you could use it. reply parasti 4 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s technically JScript. reply xxs 1 hour agoparentprevabout what a sibling mentioned &#x27;JScript&#x27; - not javascript; the infamous Microsoft EEE (the 2nd part) It has been there for decades. reply xinayder 2 hours agoparentprevAnd it&#x27;s even funnier that the solution the author gives is \"hey execute this javascript code that uninstalls a program and deletes itself afterwards\"like, really? can&#x27;t you write that in C? I don&#x27;t think most Win32 apps use JavaScript for their installers. reply mananaysiempre 1 hour agorootparent> can&#x27;t you write [a self-deleting executable] in C?The point of the exercise is that, on Windows, you can’t, because Windows won’t let anyone delete executables that are currently in use (try it, you won’t be able to delete one either). Upgrading shared DLLs in the face of this fact is why installers for Windows programs often have to have you reboot the system (and in more civilized times asked you to close other programs before installation to reduce the probability of hitting a locked DLL). It’s also why there’s a registry key[1] containing a list of rename and delete actions to be performed on next reboot (usually accessed via the MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT flag to MoveFileEx).You can’t (straightforwardly[2]) make a self-deleting batch script, either, because the command interpreter parses a command at a time and so wants the batch file to exist. The Windows Scripting Host, on the other hand, will parse the whole file at once, close it, and then forget about it, so you can write self-deleting WSH scripts.The workaround used by the uninstaller under discussion is instead for the executable to inject some code into the Windows Explorer (on the assumption that it’s always running and the user has to have access permissions for it) that accomplishes the deletion through return-oriented programming, so that the stack it’s executing from can then disappear into the wind (apparently? I’m not seeing how they plan to clean that up).On a POSIX system you are explicitly allowed to delete any open file—including an executing one—making it languish in a kind of system-managed limbo (and take up disk space, invisibly) until it’s closed. The tradeoff is then that it’s impossible to ensure you’ve opened the same file as somebody else when all you have is its name. (I think you can at least check for success, provided you also have the device and inode numbers for it.)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superuser.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;58479&#x2F;is-there-a-registry-ke...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;20329355&#x2F;how-to-make-a-b... reply dolmen 38 minutes agorootparentI wonder why Raymond Chen suggest a WSH solution.

Over the years I&#x27;ve encountered approximately zero problems with that behavior on Linux and dozens of problems with the Windows behavior, both as a user and as a developer.I&#x27;m sure it would be hard to add such a thing to Windows while minimizing compatibility problems but I&#x27;m equally sure that it&#x27;s possible and that it&#x27;s worth the effort. reply yrro 2 hours agorootparentprevAt this point the Windows package manager omnimisery has metastasized and now idiot developers are insisting on writing their own installers even for platforms where it&#x27;s totally un-necessary (harmful in fact!) reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentprevSince Windows 2000, however Microsoft isn&#x27;t Apple, in being a dictator regarding OS API adoption. reply tinus_hn 2 hours agorootparentprevOh, they have, many times!

It&#x27;s unfortunate that MSI files aren&#x27;t used more often, because they&#x27;re more reliable than their uninstall.exe counterparts. They&#x27;re not unlike .deb&#x2F;.rpm files, except they integrate with the system GUI better when it comes to prompts and variables.I believe MSI files were originally supposed to be almost atomic in use (software is either installed or uninstalled), providing transactional operations for installing software and limited UI options.

(AP Photo/David Keyton) BY CHARLENE PELE Updated 12:42 AM UTC, September 11, 2023 Share STOCKHOLM (AP) — As young children went back to school across Sweden last month, many of their teachers were putting a new emphasis on printed books, quiet reading time and handwriting practice and devoting less time to tablets, independent online research and keyboarding skills. The return to more traditional ways of learning is a response to politicians and experts questioning whether the country’s hyper-digitalized approach to education, including the introduction of tablets in nursery schools, had led to a decline in basic skills. Swedish Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm, who took office 11 months ago as part of a new center-right coalition government, was one of the biggest critics of the all-out embrace of technology. “Sweden’s students need more textbooks,” Edholm said in March. “Physical books are important for student learning.” OTHER NEWS On the brink of joining NATO, Sweden seeks to boost its defense spending by 28% Swedish citizen goes on trial on charges of collecting information for Russia Clashes erupt in Sweden’s third largest city after another Quran burning and at least 3 are detained The minister announced last month in a statement that the government wants to reverse the decision by the National Agency for Education to make digital devices mandatory in preschools. It plans to go further and to completely end digital learning for children under age 6, the ministry also told The Associated Press. Although the country’s students score above the European average for reading ability, an international assessment of fourth-grade reading levels, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, highlighted a decline among Sweden’s children between 2016 and 2021. In 2021, Swedish fourth graders averaged 544 points, a drop from the 555 average in 2016. However, their performance still placed the country in a tie with Taiwan for the seventh-highest overall test score. In comparison, Singapore — which topped the rankings — improved its PIRLS reading scores from 576 to 587 during the same period, and England’s average reading achievement score fell only slightly, from 559 in 2016 to 558 in 2021. Some learning deficits may have resulted from the coronavirus pandemic or reflect a growing number of immigrant students who don’t speak Swedish as their first language, but an overuse of screens during school lessons may cause youngsters to fall behind in core subjects, education experts say. “There’s clear scientific evidence that digital tools impair rather than enhance student learning,” Sweden’s Karolinska Institute said in a statement last month on the country’s national digitalization strategy in education. “We believe the focus should return to acquiring knowledge through printed textbooks and teacher expertise, rather than acquiring knowledge primarily from freely available digital sources that have not been vetted for accuracy,” said the institute, a highly respected medical school focused on research. The rapid adoption of digital learning tools also has drawn concern from the United Nations’ education and culture agency. In a report published last month, UNESCO issued an “urgent call for appropriate use of technology in education.” The report urges countries to speed up internet connections at schools, but at the same time warns that technology in education should be implemented in a way so that it never replaces in-person, teacher-led instruction and supports the shared objective of quality education for all. In the Swedish capital, Stockholm, 9-year-old Liveon Palmer, a third grader at Djurgardsskolan elementary school, expressed his approval of spending more school hours offline. “I like writing more in school, like on paper, because it just feels better, you know,” he told the AP during a recent visit. His teacher, Catarina Branelius, said she was selective about asking students to use tablets during her lessons even before the national-level scrutiny. “I use tablets in math and we are doing some apps, but I don’t use tablets for writing text,” Branelius said. Students under age 10 “need time and practice and exercise in handwriting ... before you introduce them to write on a tablet.” Online instruction is a hotly debated subject across Europe and other parts of the West. Poland, for instance, just launched a program to give a government-funded laptop to each student starting in fourth grade in hopes of making the country more technologically competitive. In the United States, the coronavirus pandemic pushed public schools to provide millions of laptops purchased with federal pandemic relief money to primary and secondary students. But there is still a digital divide, which is part of the reason why American schools tend to use both print and digital textbooks, said Sean Ryan, president of the U.S. school division at textbook publisher McGraw Hill. “In places where there is not connectivity at home, educators are loath to lean into digital because they’re thinking about their most vulnerable (students) and making sure they have the same access to education as everyone else,” Ryan said. Germany, which is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, has been famously slow in moving government programs and information of all kinds online, including education. The state of digitalization in schools also varies among the country’s 16 states, which are in charge of their own curricula. Many students can complete their schooling without any kind of required digital instruction, such as coding. Some parents worry their children may not be able to compete in the job market with technologically better-trained young people from other countries. Sascha Lobo, a German writer and consultant who focuses on the internet, thinks a national effort is needed to bring German students up to speed or the country will risk falling behind in the future. “If we don’t manage to make education digital, to learn how digitalization works, then we will no longer be a prosperous country 20 years from now,” he said in an interview with public broadcaster ZDF late last year. To counter Sweden’s decline in 4th grade reading performance, the Swedish government announced an investment worth 685 million kronor (60 million euros or $64.7 million) in book purchases for the country’s schools this year. Another 500 million kronor will be spent annually in 2024 and 2025 to speed up the return of textbooks to schools. Not all experts are convinced Sweden’s back-to-basics push is exclusively about what’s best for students. Criticizing the effects of technology is “a popular move with conservative politicians,” Neil Selwyn, a professor of education at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said. “It’s a neat way of saying or signaling a commitment to traditional values.” “The Swedish government does have a valid point when saying that there is no evidence for technology improving learning, but I think that’s because there is no straightforward evidence of what works with technology,” Selwyn added. “Technology is just one part of a really complex network of factors in education.” ___ Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco; Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland; and Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed reporting. by Taboola You May Like Mariners and Angels meet to determine series winner SmartAsset What the Fiduciary Is a Fiduciary?

Preschools are required by law to use tablets in the \"education\" of toddlers, which is completely insane since more and more research are saying that using screens as a small child might disturb cognitive development. Call me old school but I think toddlers should play with sticks and balls.Side note: the general view in Sweden is that the school is working terrible and many parents do all they can to teach their young childs to read, write and count because they don&#x27;t trust the school system to do that for them. I think it&#x27;s great to teach your kids as much as you can, but it&#x27;s a bit sad that the reason is this one. reply farialima 2 hours agoparent> the general view in Sweden is that the school is working terribleIt&#x27;s quite universal to find that schools in your own country are terrible :)Having lived (and raised children) in multiple countries, I can tell you I&#x27;ve never seen a country where people would say good things about their own education systemsNot sure why... probably simply because everybody has (good !) ideas on how it could be better, but they are not easy to implement ! :). Probably also because that&#x27;s really something people care about reply drt5b7j 1 hour agoparentprev> Preschools are required by law to use tablets in the \"education\" of toddlersWhat the actual fuck. reply sandos 1 hour agorootparentYes, my childrens preschool was awesome but at the same time I did wonder why the need for tablets at such a young age. One reason stated was that it was a matter of equality, parents who could not afford tech means their children are at a disadvantage later on when they dont know how to use... touchscreens I guess? :) reply drt5b7j 10 minutes agorootparentClassic socialism approach. Make everyone equally worse off. Frankly I&#x27;d rather move country than give my 2yo a tablet. And if I&#x27;d learn I have to by law well that&#x27;d just reinforce my conviction.Any idea if this ludicrous situation is the same in Norway, Finland, Denmark? reply roody15 10 hours agoprevHaving worked in 1:1 schools and seen phone use &#x2F; laptop has in the classroom this seems a step in the right direction. Tech is not the answer to everything in education it is just a useful tool that can and should be used from time to time like. Like a calculator but a more versatile.What we have in many classrooms is a tech nightmare where tasks are digitized for just the sake of digitizing and attention span is lost, deep learning and concentration is lost and meaning relationships between student &#x2F; student or student &#x2F; instructor are diminished. reply jjav 3 hours agoparent> What we have in many classrooms is a tech nightmare where tasks are digitized for just the sake of digitizingI am glad that my child has been able to go to a school that only uses computers for tasks that can&#x27;t practically be done otherwise (CAD for 3d printing, move editing, etc). Everyting else has been analog. Real books, real paper, writing by hand (cursive, even). Zero cell phones in elementary school by any kid. This is in silicon valley, so every kid has one or both parents in tech, so there is broad understanding of how problematic it is to let it dominate over the real world. reply TaylorAlexander 6 hours agoparentprevRecently I got in to mechanical typewriters for writing. I really like them! It&#x27;s fascinating to have a machine which has no apps, no screen, no internal memory, and no distractions. You don&#x27;t even have to \"print\" your page after writing it as the printing and the typing are the same operation.The other day I was writing poetry at my computer and I had a Slack message pop up. I immediately clicked on it and responded, and then I went back to my poem and had totally lost my train of thought.I am not suggesting schools use typewriters, but I wonder if there is value in considering limited functionality devices for specific classes in schools and similar situations. reply vhanda 5 hours agorootparentI bought some cheap Chromebooks (100-150 euros, second hand), and removed nearly every app on them, apart for one for writing.Having a separate device for separate tasks, can often be quite useful. reply anta40 6 hours agorootparentprevI still remember learning to use typwriter in 1998&#x2F;1999 (already knew some computer basics). Correcting typos wasn&#x27;t particularly fun. reply Moru 4 hours agorootparentWe learned typewriter in school, I think it was around 85-89. Most of the typewriters where completely mechanical and to erase you either had a fluid you painted over the character to delete, waited for a few seconds to dry and then could type over. Or you used a small piece of paper that had a white sticky backside. You pressed the go-back-button and then typed the letter that you wanted to erase while holding the paper in front of the paper.We also had a slightly more modern typewriter that was electric and had memory for a few characters, automating the delete function by switching to an erase-ribbon and hitting the right key for you.And some of the typewriters even had two colors you could switch between. Oh the memories :-) That is one class that I still have use for every day. Can&#x27;t say that about many of the others. reply TaylorAlexander 6 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s right. I use them for personal journals, where I can just use the X key to write over typos and then rewrite the word. If a high standard of presentation is not required, it&#x27;s easy to write with. reply anta40 5 hours agorootparentAhh... I remember old docs from my dad office. You&#x27;ll see \"Tipp-Ex\" (correction fluid) used here and there to hide thse typos.Hey, for the sake of fun, maybe I should try this again. I think I still have a typewriter stored somewhere... reply Moru 4 hours agorootparentIf you have kids, do! They will be amazed about the old tech :-) Took mine out last spring and the daughter was all \"Oooh!\", \"Hahah\", \"I want!\". Ofcourse it&#x27;s just standing in a corner forgotten now but it was fun for a day :-) reply lb1lf 3 hours agorootparentThis. I did the same thing with my kids a couple of years ago, and the youngest one really took a liking to it, to the extent that she (At 7 years of age) insist on handing in the occasional schoolwork typewritten.After trying it out a little, she settled into a rather efficient workflow, drafting her homework in pencil, then typing it up once she&#x27;d figured out what to write and what layout she wanted. reply atoav 5 hours agorootparentprevBut it forces you to think and then write, instead of the other way around, by adding more cost to mistakes. As foe handwriting there have been studies that showed that handwritten notes are better memorized rhan computer-written ones. reply jjav 3 hours agorootparent> studies that showed that handwritten notes are better memorized rhan computer-written onesI don&#x27;t care that I look weird, but I still take a notebook (as in a physical notebook) to meetings and take notes by hand.With rare exceptions, I never read those notes. But by writing them, I remember it, so I don&#x27;t need to. Whenever I&#x27;ve experimented with taking notes on the computer, I can&#x27;t remember any of it. reply squirrel6 9 hours agoparentprevDuring the process of replacing old processes with new ones, it’s hard to know what aspects of the traditional process (in this case, books and writing) are more valuable than understood. It seems like we are making a step in the right direction, but I wonder how we will prevent ourselves from making this and similar mistakes in the future. reply xormapmap 8 hours agorootparent> I wonder how we will prevent ourselves from making this and similar mistakes in the futureJust listen to the teachers, parents, and students. In high school I was among the last year groups to be pen and paper. All the younger students had laptops and iPads. I distinctly remember during the change that very few people thought it was a good idea, except for those students who got a free laptop or iPad out of it. I imagine the change was mostly brought about by administrators and politicians. reply miguelazo 6 hours agorootparent> I imagine the change was mostly brought about by administrators and politicians.They are a specific type of “influencer”. People who claim the crown of “innovation” simply by jumping on the hype train of whatever the new hot thing is. Many companies are falling into this trap with AI right now.

Or psycho peoples are limiting themselves to just making money ? reply ibizaman 7 hours agorootparentprevPlease, just listen to the teachers. They probably know best how to teach. reply bmer 6 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not the tech itself that is the problem, and I think viewing it as the problem would lead one to miss a key trio of problems, that is equally applicable to books.The problem has three interrelated parts: a) we do not value developing the capacity to think, b) the ability to think is not valued (by whom? I&#x27;m not quite sure), and c) we do not value doing things slowly.a) Most have the mistaken notion that the capacity to think is fixed with respect to various biological factors. Putting aside whether the biology truly does fix this (I do not know enough here) the fact remains that this misses that there exist tools which can help us organize our thinking so that it appears to be \"better\". Examples of this are plenty in mathematics, where the symbolic \"language\" you use alone can make a massive difference to your \"ability\" to deal with a problem.Some tools are more like internal narratives: if one develops a narrative that isn&#x27;t constantly judging whether they are \"thinking fast enough\" or are \"being productive enough\" they ironically end up thinking more effectively.(For examples of people interested in making such tools better known:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691156668&#x2F;th...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;barbaraoakley.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;)And some tools are simply more biological: a person in good physical health can think more clearly than a person for whom this is not true, for the simple reason of nutrient supply to the brain being more efficient in the former than the latter.Schools fail us on all these points. In particular, many current widely accepted textbooks are part of the problem here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookstore.ams.org&#x2F;view?ProductCode=SPEC&#x2F;80There&#x27;s also what our culture tends to portray in entertainment. Contrary to what other think, I think entertainment is not harmless enjoyment due to the nature of our brain: as far as I know, there is no good way to consciously choose the weights you are applying to various inputs, while receiving that input (unless, ironically, you have training). Advertisers realize this, which is why \"product placement\", or \"paid\" narrative tweaking (presenting a story that is \"cleaned up\") work.But more importantly, our entertainment industry does a terrible job of showing what is actually beautiful and exciting about problems in the real world. Instead, it defaults to shooting bullets, and adrenaline driven excitement. In a \"biopic\" about a scientist, it cares not about the immense beauty of their patient struggles, or what habits they purposefully cultivated in order to think more effectively, and instead prefers to view their achievements through a dramatic lens of romance and \"lightning bolts of inspiration\".It is just as easy to put such entertain in the form of a book (e.g. Sherlock Holmes).b) my contention that the ability to think is not valued, and perhaps actively devalued, is due to the fact that people are very willing to pollute information highways and entertainment feeds, in order to make profits. They are willing to distract people constantly from things they would prefer to be doing. They are willing to interrupt with needless reminders and notifications. They are willing to use Skinner Boxes to keep a person engaged regardless of what their conscious mind is interested in. Most importantly, they are willing to pay thoughtful people to figure out the best ways to do this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;1843&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;the-scientists-who...This is why technology is so disruptive. It is not usually designed to prioritize our ability to think, but is instead designed for other purposes. Which common place operating can you point to which has in-built tools to help a person manage over-use, or help a person track their time usage, or help someone stick to their goals around usage, or provides notifications in order to help a person get back on task? How many Skinner Boxes exist that around getting people to stick it out over the long term and engage with difficult material? (Most mathematics textbooks would be better as games.)None. The issue could equally exist with, and without books. Dilution of quality of information, misinformation, de-focusing information: none of those ideas are tied to a particular medium.c) To create something new that is truly valuable is time consuming. You cannot be overly prideful and expect to just \"disrupt\" things. You need to understand fairly well what the old process was, and work with people who use the old process. Perhaps even hire them as parts of the product-testing loop. You need to spend time thinking about the design, or employ people who are willing to do this. You need to spend time maintaining things, rather than just making the next new thing, yet you also need to be able to realize that \"backwards compatibility\" is not productive for humanity (who does backwards compatibility truly serve well? why are their wants prioritized).None of these are ideas that are common in tech. So, the products the tech industry produces are for $$$ are overall, pretty likely to be garbage. But again, there is nothing unique about this to technology as it stands today: mass production, thoughtless production...these can be problems in any industry, and are problems in other industries too (e.g. the building industry).I don&#x27;t think the students will do better only because they are spending more time handwriting or reading books. reply MandieD 5 hours agorootparent“And some tools are simply more biological: a person in good physical health can think more clearly than a person for whom this is not true, for the simple reason of nutrient supply to the brain being more efficient in the former than the latter.”Most important learning aid: easily-available, nutritious breakfast and lunch. Quit fooling around with school lunch accounts and debt, financial qualification for free or reduced-price meals; just feed the kids decent food.Hungry, malnourished kids can’t begin to concentrate. Disadvantaged American kids aren’t (usually) short of total calories, but they are often short of good food available at the right times. Good meals at home require more money and&#x2F;or time and thought. Little home economics programs throughout the school years would be both good academic opportunities (apply those fractions we’ve been working on, see what baking soda does when it meets an acid) and cultivate the thinking that makes cooking at home an easier routine as an adult.Second-most important: physical activity that doesn’t feel like a punishment. This is trickier. reply bmer 3 hours agorootparentRe: food, I don&#x27;t disagree, but how do we get decent food? It&#x27;s hard enough to find decent food if you&#x27;re an adult. For example: sugar is commonly used in the food industry to help make everything taste better, including savoury food! This is not yet something I have confirmed, but I suspect also that most food comes from farms that cannot provide nutritious vegetables, fruits, eggs, or milk due to exhausted soils and poorly fed (and cruelly kept) animals. In the second case: apart from the incredible cruelty, how nutritious do you think the milk of factory cows, or the eggs of factory chickens, if they themselves, are not healthy? Similarly, how do we know that plant produce that comes from farms that tend to grow only one type of crop still meets nutritional standards? Is anyone measuring? Would love to get some clarification on this.).Re: physical activity. It might be easier than food because of the above concerns, because it is much more within our control?We&#x27;re helped out in part by the fact that physical exercise feels good.The issue is that the way physical exercise is presented in school tends to be through competition and&#x2F;or sports. From here, and due to other signals being received, it&#x27;s not hard for kids to develop immense self-consciousness which makes it something they wish to avoid.Kids also don&#x27;t learn to combine meditation and physical exercise. Meditation to help manage the social anxiety, and to help manage the physical discomfort. Yoga is surprisingly simple (no equipment required) yet effective for maintaining flexibility, posture, and strength, while also being easily amenable to incorporating meditation.For cardiac health: there is little science employed in helping a student gradually improve their physical capacity, in a gradual fashion. HIIT is some of the best we know of for time-efficient exercises that also naturally take into account personal limits. How do you know you&#x27;ve done enough HIIT for the day? You&#x27;re panting hard. You&#x27;ve hit your goal, your body will do the rest. Tolerance for discomfort improves hand-in-hand with improvements to self-image, and increased cardiac fitness. Before the student knows it, it isn&#x27;t \"awful drudgery\" to consider doing a \"12 minute run\".

I read once that it looks a ton better and the strokes are better-motivated if you’re using a nib pen, because lots of the back sides of loops get a thinner line which improves legibility, and the style helps orient the nib the right way as you go, which I hope is the case because otherwise I have no clue why anyone would have ever liked it or selected it to teach childrenI’ve seen tons of others that are simpler, closer to print writing, and much easier to read (fewer extra loops and hoops on letters, crap like that) and I wish they’d taught us one of those, if they had to teach us cursive. reply Symbiote 3 hours agorootparentLast time this was discussed on HN, I was surprised how &#x27;loopy&#x27; the standard American handwriting style taught in schools was.In Britain it&#x27;s much less fancy [1].

If a child can’t carry that (and I’m thinking 7+ here, but realistically you carry larger text books later in your school life) then they have some health issues already.If they do have health issues accommodations should be made of course! But the vast majority can carry a couple books.I agree fighting obesity is not going to be solved by carrying books BUT I think this attitude towards coddling children is partly responsible, along with food as you mention which is also very important.Edit: Just so this isn’t anecdotal points, here’s a survey that found no evidence backpacks cause issues in children https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bjsm.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;52&#x2F;19&#x2F;1241 reply asutekku 3 hours agorootparentprevHow many kids you&#x27;ve seen with spinal cord issues because of schoolbooks?

It isn&#x27;t really meaningful that their grandfather, who grew up in a time when handwriting was the only option when not seated at a desk, thought clear handwriting was a matter of respect. To put the extent of the fundamental cultural change in perspective, in a class I was teaching earlier today, there was an incident of many students asking others for pens to sign an attendance sheet with because even if they do handwrite their notes, it&#x27;s with a digital pen. Even I hadn&#x27;t carried or owned a regular pen in many years, having only about a year ago bought some and decided to keep them in places I might need them so I don&#x27;t have to go digging in the handful of times a year that I might actually need one.Then there&#x27;s the other issue that comes with making anything a matter of respect, where, as a child I had ended up with a somewhat &#x27;custom&#x27; writing style that was a mix of both cursive and print due to frequently moving between countries which taught things differently. It was easily legible while still being fast enough to take notes with, but because it wasn&#x27;t the \"respectable\" style, I got plenty of grief from teachers at the school even though they too insisted that any assignment of actual value be typed up and the handwriting was only for classroom notes which would end up in the bin at the end of the year anyway.It&#x27;s fine if you want to try to encourage your child to improve the quality of their handwriting, but telling them that they need to do it for respect is, in my opinion, an outdated idea on par with the previously common ideas about how being a lefty needed to be &#x27;corrected&#x27;. Wanting to teach them to take pride in their work is good too, but, pride in one&#x27;s work comes from the quality of the work, of which the handwriting is an increasingly miniscule part. A doctor shows pride in their work by providing the most effective care for their patients, not by writing an especially legible note. reply sebzim4500 16 hours agoparentprev>I still remember my grandfather telling us, everything you do, you must strive to do it well.

Although I suppose it does still require you to have a mature sense of priorities, since skipping all assignments to party every day is obviously not healthy.I take pride in all of my work, but at this point, as a PhD student, if I put my 100% into everything, I&#x27;d have to forgo even sleep.

Being intelligent and hard working is (to me) obviously better than being intelligent and lazy. The latter just thinks great thoughts, but does nothing about them. reply ramblenode 3 hours agorootparentHere is my insight, as it applies to managers in companies:There is a certain type of manager who is \"hardworking\", which in this case probably means something more along the lines of overzealous. The overzealous manager enters the organization and starts puting processes into place that assume a bunch of \"hardworking\" subordinates rather than average subordinates, which most of them are (by definition). When the subordinates don&#x27;t meet expectations and the process fails, the manager blames subordinates for not working hard enough, so he drives them harder, which then causes issues with morale, retention, etc. damaging the organization.So, the \"hardowrking\"&#x2F;overzealous manager believes problems can be solved by working harder, rather than trying to craft a process that realistically works for the average employee. The \"lazy\" but intelligent manager finds a way to get just enough done to satisfy business goals. The hardworking manager gets a lot done in the short term, but burns out the team in the long term. The lazy manager keeps their division humming at an unexceptional but reliable pace and keeps the business printing money.A giant bureaucracy like the military is more concerned about reliable, predictable, fool-proof plans and execution than brilliant and gallant leadership that could backfire in the wrong circumstances.

Who knows how true it is but..\"Due to complexities in their manufacturing line, a popular toothpaste company would occasionally, accidentally, ship empty boxes to their customers.Not only did the boxes cost money to ship, but when customers received the boxes they would often complain. Ultimately the toothpaste company began to lose customers who would seek out inventory for their stores from other, more reliable suppliers.One day the factory gathered their top managers and creative minds and told them they would need to focus their efforts on solving the empty box problem.After nearly six months and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on research and ideation, the factory came up with what they thought was a fairly smart smart solution to their problem. They would add highly sensitive scales to the factory line.Any time an empty box would reach the scale it would be weighed, the line would stop and a loud buzzer would sound, at which point a factory worker would need to walk over and remove the empty box. Problem solved, right?Yet the company quickly ran into another issue: just a few months after rolling out the new scale system there were no empty boxes being reported. The scales weren&#x27;t encountering any empty boxes at all.Confused by the results, the factory manager traveled down to the factory from his city office to see what was going on. He noticed that by one of the supply lines, just a few feet before one of the new scales, someone had placed an inexpensive desk fan. The manager noticed that as boxes rolled down the line, empty ones would merely be blown off the belt by the desk fan.When asked about the fan, an employee on the factory line standing nearby explained: \"Oh that? We put it there when we got tired of hearing the buzzer ring.\" reply amenhotep 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s important that he&#x27;s talking about military officers, not random people chilling at home.

Like, listen to a lecture and write notes on a pad, and then go to the lecture the next day and type them on a computer.Then, wait a week, and take a test without reviewing anything.My money, based on my experience, is on you better remembering the handwritten notes. I think this is because you cannot write as fast as you type, so you have to hear, think about what is important, and summarize when handwriting. When typing, you can get almost all the words someone says typed out. So you switch to \"hear-to-type\" mode without thinking.So, I think it is important for learning to have that skill. I think it is better in the real world too, for some use cases. If I am in a meeting with a counterparty, I take hand written notes. I rarely look at the notes after. Why? I remember what we talked about.I used to bring a computer and type out notes - and I still do if I need perfect information to reference later - but when I do that, my notes take the place of my memory.It seems more efficient to handwrite my notes and have my memory be my memory instead. reply whatisyour 16 hours agorootparentResearch has shown that writing notes by hand leads to better retention than typing even if the notes are never read in the future.

But it&#x27;s not whether it&#x27;s outdated or not, it&#x27;s just not something which easily improves with practice (at least, in my experience). Even when I spent a lot of time and energy trying to slowly draw individual letters the end result was still messy.My problem was exacerbated because I sat next to a kid who was a great artist. He used to draw comic strips (at age 9-10) and the lettering looked professional (at least to my eyes).

People are talking about the fact that there are no ads, but I would think it&#x27;s because of the bounce rate. I could see there being a lot of people learning Python who go to the docs, see a large chunk of text with OK examples, and then bouncing to go to the other sites that have more examples. This is something that&#x27;s happened to me a lot when I was doing Python development. Some of the stuff is very helpful on the docs (e.g. asyncio), but for other things the actual stuff that I want to do gets lost in the details of the docs. So while ads probably play a part, I think the bounce rate is a bigger factor, especially for people who aren&#x27;t necessarily developers. reply cloverich 16 hours agoparentI often skip python docs for this reason: I find myself scrolling to find actual usage examples of the functions I am looking up, preferably 3 short examples showing typical use cases + idiomatic code.

It&#x27;s a huge list of types and a correspondingly huge page!I suspect if there were separate pages for each type then it would be ranked higher... and it would actually be more useful. I don&#x27;t get why they&#x27;ve done it like that.The higher ranked pages admittedly have a whole page just for a single method, which is too far in the other extreme and is obviously more for SEO than use. But with the Python docs the way they are, we&#x27;ll never know whether a more sensible official page would beat them or not.As some evidence that it&#x27;s not just Google allowing spammers to shine through - sometimes for a search about a built-in type I actually do get official docs at the top, but it turns out to be the tutorial page about the class (which is not a giant mish-mash). reply Apreche 18 hours agoprevThe real question is, why are these content farm sites indexed at all?

With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the Main camera also supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. Great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple’s most advanced stabilization system yet. Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and better low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Additional features that benefit all cameras on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max include: Night mode gets better with sharper details and more vivid colors, now powered by the Photonic Engine, including Night mode portraits, enabled by the LiDAR scanner. New Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. The best quality video in a smartphone is upgraded thanks to A17 Pro, with improvements in low-light video and Action mode. The preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers gets even better with new pro workflows. Users can now get up to 20x faster transfer speeds with an optional USB 3 cable. iPhone and third-party solutions like Capture One also help photographers create a pro studio, allowing them to shoot and instantly transfer 48MP ProRAW images from iPhone to Mac. ProRes video can be recorded directly to external storage, enabling higher recording options up to 4K at 60 fps, and greater flexibility on set when using iPhone as the main camera. iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Color Encoding System, a global standard for color workflows. Coming later this year, iPhone 15 Pro will add a new dimension to video capture with the ability to record spatial video for Apple Vision Pro. Users will be able to capture precious moments in three dimensions and relive those memories with incredible depth on Apple Vision Pro when it is available early next year in the U.S. Next-Level Wireless Performance and Connectivity The iPhone 15 Pro lineup offers convenient new ways to charge, find friends in busy places, and stay connected while traveling. Both models use the USB‑C connector, a universally accepted standard for charging and transferring data, allowing the same cable to charge iPhone, Mac, iPad, and the updated AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Users can also charge AirPods or Apple Watch directly from iPhone with the USB‑C connector. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support USB 3 for data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, up to 20x faster than before. Both models feature the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, enabling two iPhone devices with this chip to connect at three times the range as before. This opens up a new way to use Precision Finding for Find My friends, so iPhone 15 users can share their location and find each other, even in crowds. Precision Finding is built with the same privacy protections that users have come to trust in Find My.5 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now support Wi-Fi 6E for greater wireless performance, including up to 2x faster speeds, and introduces the first Thread-enabled smartphones, opening up future opportunities for Home app integrations. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come equipped with super-fast 5G,6 and include: Support for MagSafe and future Qi2 wireless charging. Improved audio quality on phone calls, including those made on FaceTime or third-party apps. Sound quality gets even better when users select Voice Isolation, so conversations come through loud and clear, even if they are somewhere noisy. eSIM with support from more than 295 carriers. When traveling the world, users can stay connected through affordable international roaming plans from their existing carrier, or purchase prepaid eSIM plans in over 50 countries and regions, including Australia, Italy, Thailand, and more. Expanded Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection7 and Emergency SOS via satellite.8 Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month. Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.9 An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.10 Featuring iOS 17 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature iOS 17,11 making iPhone even more personal and intuitive with new features: The Phone app gets major updates, with Contact Posters that allow users to customize how they appear to their contacts, and Live Voicemail, which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message. Messages gets a new stickers experience, more powerful search, transcription of audio messages, and Check In, which allows users to automatically notify friends and family when they have made it to their destination safely. NameDrop gives users a new way to use AirDrop to more easily share contact information by simply bringing two iPhone devices together. The same gesture can be used to AirDrop content and more, and now users can step away from each other and finish sending large files over the internet.12 StandBy gives users a customizable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. With the Always-On display of iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, StandBy stays on to show useful information — perfect on a desk, nightstand, or kitchen counter. Interactive widgets on the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and in StandBy allow users to take action with just a tap, making it easy to complete a to-do, or play or pause a song right from the widget. Safari adds greater protection for Private Browsing and introduces profiles, helping users separate their browsing for topics like work and personal. iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal,13 a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, improvements to autocorrect and Dictation that make entering text faster and easier than ever before, password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain, and much more. Better for the Environment iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025. To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

    "commentBody": "Apple iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro MaxHacker NewspastloginApple iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max (apple.com) 229 points by jnieminen 15 hours ago| hidepastfavorite444 comments highwaylights 15 hours agoThe most interesting part of this to me isn&#x27;t the titanium or the camera (impressive as it looks), it&#x27;s the GPU.They made a point of saying that the GPU had been completely ground-up re-designed, and I assume they&#x27;re intending to keep scaling that up over the next few iterations.They didn&#x27;t talk about it for very long, but that the phone is able to convincingly run AAA games, even at playable if not great frame-rates, is really impressive. This puts the iPhone up against devices like the Switch and Steam Deck for a lot of users. Granted, they don&#x27;t have Nintendo&#x27;s games, and they don&#x27;t have Steam&#x27;s massive back catalogue, but looking forward it does make a dedicated handheld gaming system harder to justify, or at least makes the phone easier to justify if you&#x27;re not buying both.It also makes me really interested to see where Apple is going with Apple TV and the Mac. With the game porting toolkit already announced (and the results people are already getting just using it directly to run Windows games), it seems like Apple really could eat at least some portion of the gaming market by already having a handheld (phone), console (Apple TV), and gaming PC (Mac) ready to go in the next few years.I&#x27;m expecting the new M3 Macs next month to lean really heavily into discussing the GPU advances and (hopefully) announce a lot more support from big studios to bring more games to the Mac. reply paxys 15 hours agoparentIs it though? The promise of gaming on iPhone (and mobile gaming in general) has been taken over and destroyed by freemium games whose only goal is to push microtransactions. What is a marginally better GPU going to accomplish? Help games sell me their \"bundle of gems\" faster?Developers simply do not have the incentive to build any other kinds of games when the current crop of addictive shovelware is so damn profitable. The sad part is that Apple encourages this practice because it is easy money for them (via their 30% cut). The problem needs to be fixed by better quality control and transaction&#x2F;gambling rules, not a faster processor. reply mdavidn 13 hours agorootparentEarly mobile games were such a delight. I have fond memories of Angry Birds, Plants vs Zombies, Cut the Rope, Flight Control, Threes, Monument Valley, Bad Piggies...But then predatory freemium games like Clash of Clans and newer replacements for Angry Birds and Plants vs Zombies burned me out. They eliminated any desire I had to invest time or money or attention into mobile games. Popular freemium games in the App Store now bury any new gems. It&#x27;s quite disappointing.A better GPU isn&#x27;t going to help the situation. reply earthnail 3 hours agorootparentIMO this has so much to do with how Apple advertises the App Store. They were able to get people to spend some money on apps, which was a HUGE improvement over no money at all. But then, instead of managing to get people to pay higher upfront prices, they heavily supported a race to the bottom and micro transactions, which inevitably resulted in freemium games that felt like casinos.Unfortunately that isn&#x27;t just true for games but also for apps. I wish Apple had focused more on building a healthier App Store ecosystem. reply simondotau 3 hours agorootparentOne could argue that Apple Arcade is exactly that healthier ecosystem. Games with less bullshit and no in-app purchases. reply goosedragons 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s a tiny garden in a dump of shit. Some titles probably can&#x27;t make money from a revenue share of service that costs $6 a month. reply jerojero 11 hours agorootparentprevI still play Threes! to this day, still haven&#x27;t been able to get a 6000 card even after all these years.I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a mobile game out there that has given me more entertainment. reply itishappy 11 hours agorootparentprevAnybody remember GeoDefence or Tap Tap Revenge?These weren&#x27;t hidden gems either, these were front and center promoted links in the App Store. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible to find experiences like these in modern games, but I&#x27;ve given up hope long ago. I don&#x27;t have time to sift through the trash. reply simonh 12 hours agorootparentprevIt’s still a bit thin on top class games, but I still hold out hope for Apple Arcade. reply firecall 10 hours agorootparentApple Arcade is excellent value IMHO! reply krsna 9 hours agorootparentprevTiny Wings and Alto&#x27;s Adventure were standouts for me. Also Device 6 gave me some hope that puzzle games could be special on mobile. But that dream never materialized unfortunately. reply candiodari 1 hour agorootparentprevTouchHLE supports emulating a bunch of these (only on android devices, windows or macos, because, you know, Apple) reply javajosh 12 hours agorootparentprev>Angry Birds, Plants vs Zombies, Cut the Rope, Flight Control, ThreesMy list of games is basically the same. I think they are legitimately rare, and we believe at the time that they are not. It&#x27;s like YouTube. You find one 3blue1brown or Adam Neely and you think there are a hundred more. There aren&#x27;t. reply gretch 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is a really short sighted and defeatist view on the potential of mobile gaming. Mobile gaming started before iPhones, and it will be around probably for the rest of human civilization.There is no way 1 generation of games can \"take over and destroy\" the \"promise of gaming\" because there are no restrictions on what future innovators can do with the tools and the platforms. The existence of some bad games doesn&#x27;t preclude future good games.As an example, my favorite mobile game is Slay the Spire reply pradn 14 hours agorootparentNothing will change barring a change in economics (subsidies for quality games, Apple not taking a 30% cut on microtransactions, somehow prices for good indie games going up) or a change in human nature (people seem to just play shitty games from what I see in the NYC subway).We already have beautiful mobile games, like Monument Valley. But that&#x27;s not what the market is about. The very term \"mobile game\" reeks of low quality at this point. I don&#x27;t see it changing. reply gretch 13 hours agorootparent> We already have beautiful mobile games, like Monument Valley. But that&#x27;s not what the market is about. The very term \"mobile game\" reeks of low quality at this point.What exactly is it that you are after? It seems like you are not content simply getting the games you want, such as Monument Valley. You also need everyone else to live their life a certain way?Why not simply conclude that the market is big enough for everyone to coexist. And as long as there&#x27;s games for you, you don&#x27;t have to lament other people sitting around enjoying candy crush. reply derefr 12 hours agorootparent> You also need everyone else to live their life a certain way?Well, yes, I need — or rather, would prefer — all the people who are addicted to portable slot machines, to stop throwing their lives away being addicted to portable slot machines.But I don&#x27;t blame those people for that, nor do I think that trying to get them to each personally attempt to overcome their addiction would be practical.People with gambling addictions are people with a particular cognitive vulnerability to variable-scheduled rewards. Unlike people with other addictions, who \"go overboard\" on something that other people can \"enjoy responsibly\" (and so which society has a reason to otherwise permit), people with gambling addictions are the targets of products and services produced solely to target them, that people without gambling addictions just... don&#x27;t see the point of. Slot machines of all sorts exist to commercially exploit gambling addicts. And they do so very well.That very exploitation was why the US had outlawed casinos in almost every state; why casinos are 19+ to enter, even when not serving alcohol; why \"casino game\" video games must be rated M; why even depictions of gambling affect the age-ratings for TV shows and movies.But now that exploitation has leaked. It&#x27;s no longer limited to casinos; it&#x27;s now everywhere in the palm of your hand — and not just bare-faced as \"casino games\", but also in the guise of everything from shooters to RPGs, all with their own variable-scheduled rewards that can suck up unbounded amounts of your very real money.Obviously, I blame the exploiters — the \"gaming\" [i.e. casino] industry, and the ex-\"gaming\"-industry professionals infecting the games industry with their exploitation tactics. And also, I blame society, for not punishing the exploiters, not outlawing the exploitation.> sitting around enjoying candy crushMy dude, Candy Crush is a great, fun, classic, and ethical game compared to what they have these days. Have you looked at the mobile casual games market in the last five years? If the words \"rare JPEG\" don&#x27;t mean anything to you, then you should really spend a few minutes looking into the people throwing away their life savings on some of these \"games.\" reply makeitdouble 10 hours agorootparentprevI share parent&#x27;s sentiment, with a slightly different angle: we already see what good mobile games are. They&#x27;re on the Switch, SteamDeck, portable emulators etc.In comparison games that can&#x27;t survive under the Nintendo rules but still need a wide platform flourish on smartphones. That&#x27;s where we see the split between games that can stand without micro-transaction and dark patterns, and those that can&#x27;t. Genshin has been announced to come to the Switch for years now, and I&#x27;m not holding my breath given their mechanics, while the new iPhone&#x27;s GPU capabilities are straight aimed at letting Hoyo thrive. reply __loam 13 hours agorootparentprevSteam also takes 30% from the first $10 million in sales, so I&#x27;m not sure what it is about the app store that incentivizes this. The incentives are arguably identical on Steam. I think it has more to do with the nature of the device (Touch controls, people using it on their bathroom breaks, etc) than it does with any economic situations. reply internetter 12 hours agorootparentTo be fair, steam offers a massive amount of goodies on top, including a built in mod store, tools for multiplayer, forums, and many more. I&#x27;d argue that the platform is worth at least 10% if used to it&#x27;s fullest (and after a certain threshold the 30% goes down anyway — though imo it should start low for small studios)The same cannot be said for the app store.

Or you can self-publish on your own website and infrastructure (Minecraft did this and it worked out pretty well for them).Most developers (not all!) clearly have decided that the value Steam provides (features+audience) is worth it. But, crucially, with Steam, it&#x27;s a choice. With iOS, it&#x27;s not. You are forced to go through the App Store whether you like it or not (for now, at least). And if tomorrow Apple decides that 30% is not enough and they&#x27;d like a bit more, there&#x27;s not much you can do about it.(Apologies if this is not terribly relevant to the rest of the thread, but it bugs me when I see this kind of \"apples to apples\" comparisons between Steam and the App Store) reply mey 2 hours agorootparentEven on my Steamdeck I have itch.io and other launchers installed.

Rami from Vlambeer said it well.“You earn $3 and then you update it for the next 10 years. If you’re making free-to-play games, if you keep earning money with a game, yeah, that’s a great model because you can make more money by updating.”Ismail pointed to Vlambeer’s “Ridiculous Fishing,” which won a number of awards from gaming publications and Apple.“‘Ridiculous Fishing’ is never going to make more money,” he said. “Yeah, some new people might buy it, but we made our money with ‘Ridiculous Fishing’ in 2013 and that money is spent, It’s spent on ‘Luftrausers.’ It’s spent on ‘Nuclear Throne.’ If somebody upgrades their phones to the new iPhone. Yeah. You have ‘Ridiculous Fishing’ in your account, Yeah you paid $3 for it. Yeah, it’s broken.”That’s what caused the last major update Vlambeer did for the game. A major change by Apple in 2017 that switched from 32-bit to 64-bit apps, breaking a slew of content on their phones … including “Ridiculous Fishing.”“All games broke,” he said, “Every game that wasn’t programmed for it broke. We updated ‘Ridiculous Fishing’ then but it feels like a mistake almost. It feels like, OK it’s 2018 and this game that we made money with that somebody bought in 2013 is now broken outside of our fault. We didn’t change anything. We didn’t break the game. We didn’t introduce a bug, but this continuous ecosystem that Apple has created, that comes with you with every new phone, broke it. “Ismail said that either Apple has to start designing for backward compatibility support on their end or that people are going to have to get used to the idea of games dying and disappearing.“Some of the best ios games from 2010 are gone,” he said. “Those developers, they don’t exist anymore. They went out of business. They split up. They started a new thing and they just don’t have the money or time to do it.”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;features&#x2F;android-ios-apple-g... reply absoluteunit1 13 hours agorootparentprevI really wish micro transactions were made illegal in applications on the app stores…and video games in general. It encourages additive behaviour and lowers the quality of games as the purpose becomes to make the additive micro transaction aspect as addictive as possible.If some new policy changed this, I think we’d see a whole new wave of higher quality games reply NeoTar 11 hours agorootparentHow would you define a micro-transaction?Maybe we need a pornography-like definition (\"I know it when I see it\") but I think there is certainly a continuum from high-quality DLC &#x2F; expansions to existing games (which can be basically a new game) down to crystals which allow you to instantly buy something which you&#x27;d have got anyway if you had waited.So, consider a basic, Mario-kart like racing game - which of these are OK, and which are micro-transactions?- buying additional courses,- buying additional characters (drivers), vehicles, or components of vehicle (e.g. wheels, engines, bodies),- buying purely cosmetic changes (e.g. driver outfits, vehicle colours),- buying permanent upgrades to your vehicle(s) (i.e. more speed, better acceleration, better handling)- buying one-off power-ups that last for a single race, or are time-limited (+50% acceleration for 1 hour)- buying &#x27;cheats&#x27; - obvious play-to-win items (e.g. needing to complete 1 fewer lap than your opponent),- buying regular game-progression; e.g. maybe 100 races&#x2F;wins&#x2F;hours of play are normally required to unlock all courses, but this can also be instantly purchased.- any of the above options, but not bought directly, but rather via purchasing &#x27;crystals&#x27; which can be exchanged for the above.- any of the above options, but in a &#x27;gatcha&#x27; style (i.e. loot boxes; you cannot choose which upgrade you want),I think I&#x27;d be totally OK with the top three, maybe OK with buying permanent upgrades, and unlocking game progression (in this case), but the others are too far for me. reply jquery 9 hours agorootparentAll of them are micro-transactions.Some micro transactions are tolerable, some of the time, but every single one of these commercializes the product. IMO if they exist, the game should be free-to-play. Where I really get annoyed are games like Lego2K (racing game) where you pay $60 to play, and then it&#x27;s also full of microtransactions (for cars, courses, cosmetics, you name it).I think it&#x27;s a different matter when it&#x27;s a content-filled DLC add-on to the game. Yes, the line for that is a bit arbitrary, but the classic example would be Starcraft: Brood War (well, technically that was an expansion pack, but same idea). Adding a single additional course to a racing game blurs the line, I generally think content should be bundled so the gamer isn&#x27;t constantly making financial decisions while playing. reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentprevApple&#x27;s new gaming strategy (as of today) is ports of console games.

Apple themselves was promoting the iPhone with gachapon games earlier today, it&#x27;s not like lootbox titles magically disappeared with good DRM.

As person working with large publisher I am still in shock and disbelief that it is legal and works well in practice but here we are.

All the phone games make as much money as all the consoles and PC gaming together. Apple, with its command of all the valuable phone customers, is pulling an estimated 14 billion dollars in 2021 in mobile gaming. So Apple is very dumb if they don&#x27;t care about 14 billion in annual services revenue.What you&#x27;re thinking is that traditional gaming is big-boy gaming and where the big bucks are. The growth market is mobile gaming, with the other segments being stagnant outside of big hits. The reality is that Apple is a bigger gaming company, by revenue, than Microsoft or Sony, is controlling the growth sector, and is thinking accordingly. They have financed all on their own a new GPU generation for their phone and justified it as a need for gaming and gaming alone.

We spent 8 tragic years watching them wheel out Tomb Raider demos each keynote as if it was a shiny new release. Larian Studios came, Blizzard Studios went, but nobody changed the tide of gaming on iPhone or Mac. The fact that Boom Beach is more profitable than dear esther is not exactly an allegorical victory for Apple.So... here we are. A world where a $300, 20nm Nintendo Switch is a better gaming console than a shiny new $800 3nm iPhone.

They&#x27;re trying to get the Mac to gain steam, but it&#x27;s clearly very difficult and their heart&#x27;s not in it.In the end it&#x27;s a business, whoever makes the most money is the market leader.

Most Indie Games would also run fine on most Smartphones, but never succeeded. Stuff that sold great on the Switch.

I spent $20 on Monster Hunter for iPhone and one day iOS updated and it just didn’t work anymore.My Switch games will assumably work until the console dies.Another reason I completely stopped buying games on iOS was when The Binding of Isaac was suddenly delisted from the App Store. I never got a refund or anything, and because of this new versions of Binding of Isaac aren’t compatible with Macs either. I have hundreds of hours played in that game and it’s ridiculous that Apple censored it as “depicting child abuse”. reply mortenjorck 14 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know if this is still the case, but for a long time, your game would get rejected from the App Store if it required an external controller to play. And yet being able to design games around that baseline is critical for triple-A.I’m super curious to see what they’ve done with this current–gen, mainline Assassin‘s Creed game coming to iPhone: there is no way the core gameplay of that franchise could translate to touch controls, so either Apple dropped the requirement, some poor team had the doomed project of building an abysmal fallback touch control scheme, or they implemented some kind of semi-automated scheme for touch that makes traversal and combat less interactive. reply gambiting 13 hours agorootparent>>there is no way the core gameplay of that franchise could translate to touch controlsI mean.....millions of people play proper console games on their phones now using various streaming services and touch controls.....turns out playing games using shitty touch controls is preferable to not playing them at all I guess.

Similarly, you should get the Good Guardians and Good Lock apps from the Galaxy store (or apkmirror if in Canada) and tinker with the settings to taste. This is necessary to get 4K60 support or anything more than 1080p.-I use Kiwi Browser, which supports all Chrome extensions and otherwise works like normal desktop Chrome. You&#x27;ll want to go into the flags and enable the zoom thing (search for zoom) and then enable the zoom option under Accessbility in Kiwi settings, to fix websites that don&#x27;t scale correctly. Tabs get unloaded&#x2F;lazy loaded in background due to RAM issue.-Doing anything moderately describable as \"productive\" or \"intensive\" (example: google maps website) creates more heat than the phone can handle over more than 10 minutes. Do not buy a Snapdragon 888, or other weak processor device (I am aware it is old but some people like used phones). Things like particles.js, hidden autoplays, etc that don&#x27;t cause issues on desktop waste TDP on phones. The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily that the phone overheats, it&#x27;s that Samsung makes it so that not only does the battery stop charging if it gets over 36 C, it actually starts draining. For reference, your body temperature is around 36 C. On the S23 Ultra, with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, it&#x27;s more or less usable now, with some battery drain from time to time. Weirdly, the battery drain issue is solved if you use a charger that supports USB PD PPS. The PPS part is VERY important. If you look at Samsung schematics, you will see that the PMIC does normal USB PD and there&#x27;s a separate chip for PPS. Not all docks support PPS, in fact I&#x27;m not certain if ANY do. This is an area where more research is required. Of course, the fact that the PPS chip isn&#x27;t affected might not be a thermal issue, but rather a \"Samsung forgot to throttle charging on PPS\", which would not be a good thing to talk about then because I don&#x27;t want them to \"fix\" this.-I cannot imagine development would be particularly easy on this device. I briefly looked into getting VSCode on there and whatnot but the Android Linux projects seem to have fallen quite some from their former glory. While web based stuff is likely fine, the aforementioned memory and CPU problems will make this difficult to use for anything too serious.-All of the current common remote desktop solutions i.e. RustDesk (slow performance), Parsec (keyboard issues, no zoom), Reemo (mostly works, no keyboard shortcuts, lag, thermal problems), TeamViewer (3fps), Moonlight (mouse capture issue, thermal problems), RDP (low fps) etc have some kind of usability problem that makes them difficult to use for this application, in case you wanted to use the phone as a thin client. reply rcarr 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand why you wouldn&#x27;t just use VSCode&#x2F;Codespaces or Cloud9&#x2F;CodeCatalyst. The big cloud providers have their own remote desktop solutions now e.g AWS Workspaces, Azure Virtual Desktop that you can just use in the browser or if you want to stream a single app there&#x27;s AWS AppStream and Azure RemoteApp. reply lostmsu 14 hours agorootparentprevSounds like Samsung Dex + something like VS Code on Android. reply saiya-jin 1 hour agorootparentprevS22 ultra works out of box.

It took nearly a decade for them to get keyboard support working properly on the iPad, and they have zero incentive to copy Samsung DeX given they prefer to sell 3 different devices to people.What they will do is allow you to record video directly to storage devices and preview photos on large displays as they are taken. reply Xylakant 15 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t think Apple will ever do that, to be honest.Apple sells lightning->HDMI adapters that could drive a display at 1080p and it’s been possible to pair a keyboard with your iPhone. I know folks that used that setup for writing longer texts while traveling.Given that a lot of the infrastructure was already there, I wouldn’t be surprised if it trickles in over time.You can see the same trajectory with iPads: At first they could mirror screens only, but with the recent changes to stage manager, they’re a pretty full-featured laptop if you use a keyboard and trackpad.

If Assistive Touch is disabled, the mouse \"works\" but you don&#x27;t get a visible pointer which is completely stupid.Possibly connecting to an external display won&#x27;t have that issue, or iOS 17 will make the experience a bit better for non-assistive mousing. reply konradb 15 hours agoparentprevWould be interesting to see how it can use a larger screen.

Please note that certain information may have changed since the date of release. September 07, 2023 Sony Semiconductor Solutions Develops Energy Harvesting Module That Efficiently Generates Power from Electromagnetic Wave Noise Helping to Resolve Power Supply Issues Arising from IoT Device Popularization and Sophistication Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation Atsugi, Japan — Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS) today announced that it has developed an energy harvesting*1 module that uses electromagnetic wave noise energy. The new module applies technology that SSS has cultivated in the tuner development process to generate power from electromagnetic wave noise with a high level of efficiency. For example, this technology can use the constant electromagnetic wave noise generated by robots inside factories, monitors and lighting in offices, monitors and TVs in stores and homes, and the like to provide the stable power supply needed to run low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment. With attention on the challenge of providing power to the increasing number of IoT devices as they grow in popularity and sophistication, this highly efficient energy harvesting technology shows promise for a wide range of applications. SSS aims to employ the new technology as part of its effort to build a power circulation model, thereby contributing to the development of a sustainable IoT society. *1: Technology that harvests minute amounts of energy that exist in the environment and living things for conversion into electricity. Energy harvesting framework using electromagnetic wave noise Usage scenarios Factory (Left), Office (Middle), Retail (Right) Energy harvesting is a technology that is expected to contribute to both the development of IoT and the sustainability of the global environment, with research being carried out mainly in fields such as electrical waves, light, heat, and vibration. SSS’s new technology is the energy harvesting technology to generate power utilizing the electromagnetic wave noise that all electrical equipment generates. Based on antenna technology created during tuner development at SSS, this new module uses the metal parts of electronic devices that serve as the source of electromagnetic wave noise as part of an antenna and employs a rectifier circuit*2 with enhanced electricity conversion efficiency, for a highly original structure. This allows it to convert electromagnetic wave noise in a range of several Hz to 100 MHz into electrical energy and supply power to low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment, or to charge batteries, despite its compact size. This is the industry’s first*3 energy harvesting technology based on this method that achieves highly efficient power generation. By efficiently utilizing previously ignored electromagnetic wave noise as a new power source, it enables a stable power supply for equipment. The minimal number of constituent components used in the module yields a compact design that allows for greater freedom of installation. Also, as long as electronic devices are powered, energy can be harvested even while they are not in active use, making this technology promising in a wide variety of usage situations such as factories, offices, stores, and homes, both indoors and outdoors. *2: An electrical circuit that converts alternating current to direct current. In general, alternating current is used to transmit electrical energy, so a rectifier circuit is used in power sources of equipment that require direct current. *3: As an energy harvesting technology. According to SSS research. As of announcement on September 7, 2023. Developed module (size: 7 mm square) Main Features High level of power generation Utilizing electronic equipment that generates a significant amount of electromagnetic wave noise such as household appliances, computers, lighting equipment, vending machines, elevators, automobiles, and industrial equipment as an energy source enables this module to harvest from several dozen μW to several dozen mW of power. Doing so makes it possible to supply power to low-power consumption IoT sensors and communications equipment Applicable to a wide range of use cases - As long as electronic devices are powered, power can be harvested even when they are not in active use. This method therefore differs from other energy harvesting methods which use sunlight, electrical waves, and temperature differences, all of which are susceptible to environmental factors such as lighting brightness and indoor environments. Thus, the new module enables continuous harvesting. - The minimal number of constituent components used in the module yields a compact design that allows for greater freedom of installation. Device status can be identified Because this technology continuously harvests electromagnetic wave noise from electronic devices, it can also identify the internal status of the electronic device by detecting changes in the harvested voltage. This means, for instance, that it can be used for applications such as detecting whether lighting is functioning normally or predicting device failure, for example in robots with built-in motors. SSS looks forward to working with partners from various industries to develop products based on this technology, which shows promise across a wide variety of applications. back to the list Contact Us For inquiries about Sony Semiconductor Solutions Group and products / solutions, specifications, quotation / purchase requests, etc., please contact us using the Inquiry form from the button below.

We have an energy management problem, which we have yet to localize at the individual, and are instead spreading the problem across our society.But, in between builds on this project, I would often daydream of a scenario where computing devices ran simply on background radiation, and there was no longer any need for cables, really, in order to compute.Its fun to note we&#x27;re getting closer and closer to that point. Okay, I could build a solar powered computer and also feel such satisfaction, but .. an all-in-one wafer that simply ran on cosmic noise?Hell yeah, gimme that, sparkies!!! reply simonbarker87 18 hours agorootparentThis was basically my feeling when doing my PhD - there is energy everywhere and if we make systems power efficient enough there is no real reason we can’t make significantly great use of that energy.That being said, it’s not the energy per se that we can tap into, it’s the gradient created as it dissipates&#x2F;moves that we tap into. Heat is great, but not if it’s uniform, solar is great, but not if it harvesting it casts an area in shadow that needs it, vibration is great so long as it doesn’t damp and further load the system it’s being taken from. reply rpaddock 16 hours agorootparent\" doesn’t damp and further load the system it’s being taken from.\"Don&#x27;t all of these Harvesting systems load a system? For example one of the transmitters somewhere. Yes it is microwatts and no transmitter will notice a single unit. However if we start to talk large quantity of sensors, who is really paying the price? Otherwise we are admitting that Free Energy is a real thing.You and others may find the recently released Nexperia NBM5100 and NBM7100 of interest. While aimed at batteries it functionally translates high impedance power sources to lower impedance to charge up caps for IoT usage.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexperia.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;analog-logic-ics&#x2F;power-ics...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexperia.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;analog-logic-ics&#x2F;power-ics... reply themoonisachees 15 hours agorootparentI mean yeah obviously thermodynamics aren&#x27;t being violated, I think the base idea is that the background noise you&#x27;re harvesting from was going to be lost as inverse square law losses anyway. Large amounts of sensors would ultimately be as a whole coupled to antennae broadcasting on those frequencies, damping them, and causing the gain circuits to automatically increase output power. reply simonbarker87 16 hours agorootparentprevOh for sure, it’s relative to the system being harvested from and the amount of energy being extracted though.If it’s a train cart&#x2F;carriage then not really a problem as there is so much mass and vibration to go around, if it’s the surface of a small industrial machine that needs to be reasonably balanced only producing a few hundred milli g then more of a concern. reply samus 15 hours agorootparentprevIt would need a lot of these devices for the odd mW to really make a difference. It adds up, but it&#x27;s in the ballpark of a router&#x27;s status LEDs. These costs are already accounted for as part of the device&#x27;s operation. Critical systems might start to better direct their transmissions and to reduce side bands instead of saturating the area with energy. reply amelius 15 hours agorootparentprevWell it may push for better EMI compliance. reply user_7832 18 hours agorootparentprevSpecifically for moving object like air tags, watches “automatic” movements are already a “solution” that would be easy enough to implement, and probably even provide up to a few joules (!!) per day.(If you want to start a business off this idea feel free to contact me ;) half joking but half serious) reply helpfulContrib 17 hours agorootparentI have zero interest in this idea, business-wise - it is already a crowded space, Apple are mere new-comers to this - as the more you see these sensor nets grow, the more you realize we are making a big, big psycho-social &#x27;smog&#x27; around the ways they can be used ..So yeah, I&#x27;d rather make musical instruments. If anyone wants to talk about that idea, I&#x27;m all in.:) reply guyomes 2 hours agorootparentAs a user, I would emphasis the importance of analogical input and feedback to musical instruments. The more analogical input means the more freedom to express nuances. Some but few electronic instruments include easy to use analogical input, with sliders, gyroscope or even the voice directly for example.For example, the Dualo touch uses a slider and a gyroscope for analogical input:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dualo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;dualo&#x2F;The voice recorded through a mic can also be a nice anological input, such as in the Rc-505 loop station:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boss.info&#x2F;global&#x2F;products&#x2F;rc-505mk2&#x2F;Even better if there is an analogical feedback. For example with springs under buttons, rubber bands attached to finger rings or other crazy ideas. reply aramachandran7 16 hours agorootparentprevWith you on this, haha. Big tech has heavily crowded the wearables space, with questionable intentions and uses of personal health data.Additionally, when doing research around kinetic &#x2F; thermal energy harvesting technology for a wearable design project (gesture recognizing smart ring) for school, we found modules to have far too low a volumetric energy density (W&#x2F;mm^3) to be useful, where size matters more than anything else.Musical instrument design is a well saturated space as well… reply usrusr 16 hours agorootparentBig Tech may have crowded the wearables space, but Garmin is still quite a player in that field and the description \"Big Tech\" seems almost as bad a fit for them as \"Olathe tinkerer collective\" would be. reply helpfulContrib 16 hours agorootparentprev>Musical instrument design is a well saturated space as well…Yeah, thats sort of the point. :) reply xyproto 11 hours agorootparentprevI wish there was a small and affordable guitar pedal that had shimmer and bitcrush, and only that, with two potmeters and a passthrough button.

Always on connectivity is silly if it sits idle most of the time (think monitoring systems that take a temperature and moisture readings every 15 minutes), especially if it can communicate via a low power&#x2F;low bandwidth channel.I build a system for an agriculture client like this with each node only having a very small solar panel (6in^2) and some super capacitors that kept it reporting data throughout the night. We even used performance metrics from the voltage being output by the solar panel to measure how cloudy it was. These devices reported via LoRa to a base station setup that was connected to a PoE system so we just ran a single Cat-6 STP line to a pole in the middle of the property. reply nocsi 14 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S03787...I think the other aspect of “always on” is that the operator isn’t going to pick up the sensor years down the line. They’re just going to leave it dead and buried, especially if the sensors have to live inside the earth There’s ongoing work on harvesting electricity out of soil reply buescher 10 hours agorootparentprevAirTags get about a year of battery life from a 2033 in moderate&#x2F;typical use cases, according to Apple. That’s 0.675 Wh (Panasonic 2032) &#x2F; 1 year = 77 microwatts. Or about 7 joules&#x2F; day. That’s a lot to guarantee for production. Watch movements are also at least an order of magnitude more expensive than batteries and have a service life. reply zoomablemind 19 hours agoparentprevDoes this sort of harvesting rely upon some internal accumulator like a capacitor before the energy could be fed elsewhere?Also a question if such harvester need its own power source to be able to operate?They cite a super wide range of EM freqs from Hz to MHz, and an efficient antenna... reply simonbarker87 18 hours agorootparentYes, you need a reservoir to store the charge (energy) which in my case was the limiting factor to deployment in high temperature environments as capacitors get very leaky as temperature increases.Harvesters don’t need their own power supply and ideally the system can come back to life from totally empty (meaning it doesn’t need to be deployed with any charge level)I was doing my thing back before the packaged harvester management chips were available and I made a PIC based microcontroller system that could monitor the charge level in a capacitor fed from a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester and decide when to wake up and transmit a data reading based on the capacitors charge level.The trick was getting the PIC’s sleep current draw low enough that the capacitor was charging even at milli g level vibration levels - from memory you can get a PIC’s sleep current well down in the tens of nano amp range.PICs have a built in voltage reference that is stable (a zener or schotkey diode from memory of 0.6V?) and a way to read what the Vsupply (basically the capacitor) is compared to it. So the PIC would wake up every 30 seconds, check Vsupply to the built in reference and, when high enough fully wake up, take and transmit a reading and go back to sleep.From memory I got it running at 50mg transmitting every few minutes.I got a nice journal publication in IEEE for that work. reply biomcgary 16 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t be so modest.

You sound like a former academic like me. All those papers&#x2F;citations were so important (publish or perish), but now you just have to get things done, not so much writing. reply zoomablemind 17 hours agorootparentprevCool project. Thanks for sharing the details!So the harvester sustains itself, keeps filling up the bucket, and periodically reports out the progress.I guess it&#x27;s a balancing game, as the filling up process is probably slow, so the target&#x27;s draw needs to be low too. reply simonbarker87 16 hours agorootparentThanks, it didn’t report back progress of charging, it was connected to a sensor (light sensor in this case but could be anything really) and would transmit that back to a base station.The main use of energy harvesting is for powering wireless sensor nodes, so this was a simple implementation of that. reply jacquesm 10 hours agoparentprevHow did you deal with the &#x27;black start&#x27; scenario where you need to bring up the harvester after it is first assembled? Did it require a jump start with an external energy source or did it auto start? And did you use Silicon or something more exotic? reply simonbarker87 39 minutes agorootparentBlack start wasn&#x27;t problem as the current draw from the PIC waking up to check vref was so tiny it didn&#x27;t stop the system charging (so long as there was a base line minimum amount of vibration).I forget the minimum amount but so long as there was more than say 20 mG (milli-gravity) of vibration acceleration then it could harvest from empty. reply Workaccount2 19 hours agoprevSeems like a potential nightmare when your sensor network&#x27;s operation is contingent on one badly tuned power circuit in a crappy Chinese LED floodlight in the janitors closet being perpetually left on. reply tzs 18 hours agoparentIt is not just ambient electrical noise that contains usable energy. Others have demonstrated practical sensor energy harvesting from ambient WiFi and ambient broadcast TV signals. I&#x27;d expect that the Sony device can probably use those too, so if you&#x27;ve got WiFi in your building you should be fine.If there is ambient radio, you can also use that for extremely low power data transmission from your sensors. The trick there is to not actually transmit any of your own energy. You instead either absorb or reflect the ambient radio. This is called backscatter communications.Here is a video showing a demonstration of both energy harvesting from ambient radio and backscatter data transmission [1].If you use WiFi signals as your ambient radio for backscatter, the research group in that video has also demonstrated that you can make your backscatter data stream match standard WiFi protocols so that you can use ordinary WiFi equipment for the receiver.The above was fairly short range, but even so there are a lot of interesting applications. For instance you might want to have moisture sensors inside a wall to detect water leaks early. If your sensors are powered by ambient EM energy (noise or radio), you don&#x27;t have to limit the sensors to places where you can easily reach them later to change batteries. They are fine if they are behind brick or drywall with no openings.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gX9cbxLSOkE reply mabbo 18 hours agoparentprevSeems like an interesting way to identify machines that are breaking down.If these devices can be built cheaply, just place them all over a factory, chirping their ID whenever they have enough power to do so. You map the IDs to locations and get a real-time map of where there&#x27;s EM noise spitting out. When the map starts changing from it&#x27;s usual patterns, then you identify the source of that change. reply dclowd9901 8 hours agorootparentReminds me of a neat video I saw once on the inner workings of a sheet metal stamping factory (for car parts). They used a directional microphone array pointed at the inspected machine and compared audio waves and overlayed “hot spots” on a display to see how the machine was working and where it was malfunctioning. reply __MatrixMan__ 16 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t worry, by the time you work out the source of your data outage, Sony will have a wireless power module to sell you as well. It will be wildly inefficient however, so you&#x27;ll want to only run it when there is actually a data outage. By the time you work that out, there will be orchestration services available that notice the outage and respond by temporarily flipping on the wireless power module. A sensor on one side of the room driving a machine on the other side, and somehow we&#x27;ve got it dependent on a cloud service on the other side of the planet. The future is looking bright. reply vestrigi 19 hours agoparentprevQuestion is whether this could harvest enough energy to store it in a small battery to continuously provide power. But really sounds frightening if you change the setup of a few appliances and then suddenly half of your autonomously powered devices don&#x27;t get enough power anymore because the noise is not high enough anymore. reply Workaccount2 19 hours agorootparentOn a more serious note, I&#x27;m sure that if you needed a reliable network, you would use purpose built emitters to power everything. reply rusabd 18 hours agorootparentcould be very useful in-doors where solar is not possible and wiring is not practical.

I have only very basic knowledge so not enough to make an estimation of the kind of things this can power reply rpaddock 14 hours agorootparentWhile possible it is unlikely. It would take a considerable amount of time to accumulate that amount of energy needed from these sources. These systems are generally used for transmitters that transmit for a couple of seconds at most and may be off for the rest of the day. Enough energy would have to be accumulated to run the GPS long enough to get a valid fix etc. reply ChuckMcM 15 hours agoprevOkay, this is pretty cool. Effectively lowering the EM noise floor in their vicinity by rectifying the energy is a neat trick. The catch has always been that the level of energy was such that the conversion circuitry for ambient noise was unable to process enough to both power itself and provide a bit extra (efficiency losses effectively prevented any net energy conversion). That they managed to do that is what I find so impressive.The second thing is the low frequency stuff. Its taught in most EE programs that you can use an antenna that is tuned to a frequency to transfer energy wirelessly from xmitter to receiver (see NFC or RFID) but antennas that tune sub-MHz frequencies are typically quite long in order to have some level efficiency. That they do this by exploiting geometry of various conducive elements and get enough energy is super impressive too.If you followed the old BEAM stuff[1] that Mark Tilden promoted, you could see some ideas about two-phase devices that live in a \"collect\" phase charging up an energy reservoir and then an \"execute\" phase where they dump that energy doing their thing. BEAM was focused on robotics and bug like behaviors but there is no reason you couldn&#x27;t have a sensor that measures temperature and humidity and transmits that to a receiver somewhere. Or a passive \"game\" camera that, once it has collected enough energy, takes a snapshot when it detects motion and sends that along.I&#x27;ll be interested to see this stuff get commercialized and designed in. It does have shades of \"Smart Dust\"[2] though which is pretty ripe for abuse.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BEAM_robotics[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nanowerk.com&#x2F;smartdust.php reply iancmceachern 10 hours agoparentYes, BEAM! It&#x27;s been years since I thought of that.What a great point of entry into robotics and hardware design it was for a whole generation of engineers and roboticists. It provided a very low cost (it was encouraged that the parts for these robots came from old broken electronics. They were also super simple designs which were explained in great detail, very well. This combination made for a very good education in the foundations of robotics, engineering, mechatronics, hardware and system design, etc.BEAM, the Parallax Basic Stamp, the Tandy 1000RLX, and the RB5X robot and the summer classes I took with the makers the RB5X all had a huge impact on my ability to architect, design and build robots professionally. reply foobiekr 17 hours agoprevThe nice thing about RF harvesting is you can have a beacon that keeps an area charged. Atmosic powered remotes with some TVs do this by having a beacon in the TV providing power. reply codethief 13 hours agoprevI suppose \"noise\" requires a more precise definition here – I assume they don&#x27;t mean a thermal background. Or otherwise I&#x27;m left wondering how this squares with the Second Law of Thermodynamics: You start with high entropy (thermal noise) and end up with low entropy (a charged battery)? reply iancmceachern 10 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s like when your windows vibrate when you turn up the bass.The energy comes from the amplifier, it&#x27;s being put into the ether by the woofer, and then the window pane collects it.Energy is neither created nor destroyed.The thing is, we don&#x27;t have general purpose \"windows\" in this EM world, until now. reply codethief 6 hours agorootparentYes, exactly, you are talking about a coherent bass tone (sine&#x2F;cosine) for which the window happens to be resonant. This energy can be extracted of course.Thermal noise is not a tone, though. reply iancmceachern 5 hours agorootparentYes, but EMI noise is (Its called frequency). Which is the mechanism by which the the Sony module in question operates.It&#x27;s weird for yoi to bring up thermal \"noise\". What you are referring to is thermal decay, entropy. Yes, you can harness this too, but it&#x27;s a different mechanism and not really pertinent here. reply anonymousiam 16 hours agoprevI did some work in this area about a decade ago. The issues I ran into involved converting the energy into something that can be stored. If semiconductors are used for detection&#x2F;rectification, the band-gap voltage must be overcome before any energy is recovered. Specialized devices with very low band-gap voltages are available, but losses are still significant. reply eig 12 hours agoprevThis is Sony, so their electrical engineers clearly know what they are doing.But at the same time I can&#x27;t understand how such a thing works using pure white noise. Feynman famously described (and disproved) a similar energy-harvesting device [0] except one that uses mechanical noise and a mechanical rectifier instead of the electrical noise and electrical rectifier of Sony. He showed that such a device will eventually stop working due to the second law of thermodynamics. Why doesn&#x27;t that happen in the Sony chip?[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brownian_ratchet reply buescher 10 hours agoparentBecause RF energy harvesting depends on an external energy source - it’s the same reason a crystal radio or solar calculator can keep working as long as it’s illuminated. reply robertlagrant 15 hours agoprevThis is what FreeVolt[0] is - Oxford spinout in which I have a microscopic number of shares.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freevolt.tech reply appplication 15 hours agoparentThis is really cool, but also seems rather indexed on physical cards. I have to imagine as we go towards more tech centric physical checkouts, we’re probably leaning more into device-based methods (phone, watch, etc). I imagine we will see less physical cards moving forward due to devices being able to fill this niche in a more secure way. reply robertlagrant 15 hours agorootparentAgreed - that&#x27;s the commercialisation approach they&#x27;ve gone with, but it&#x27;s not the only one. I think access cards have legs still because corporations won&#x27;t necessarily want to enroll people into BYOD situations (what happens if my phone battery dies, etc), nor issue everyone phones, and cards are just simple to administrate.

For example, kmem_cache_alloc() is listed under memory mapping, but it has nothing to do with mapping memory. It&#x27;s just an API for the slab allocator which is very widespread, and also underpins kmalloc().The bigger concern is that it doesn&#x27;t seem like the map is even close to complete. For example, the VFS (virtual file system) is made up of files (open file descriptions), inodes (representing files on disk), and dentries (representing the file system tree&#x2F;DAG). Probably others things I&#x27;m missing too. The area of this page describing vfs only seems to mention files and inodes, and it strangely mentions fsnotify, which is definitely an important subsystem, but not a fundamental data structure like a dentry.I would imagine people wrote articles about topics, and they got categorized into this very cool visualization. But it&#x27;s not as if it represents everything, just the things the contributors of the site were working on. It&#x27;s still very cool, but don&#x27;t expect that this is a comprehensive overview of the kernel, or that all the major parts of a particular area are listed here.Edit: but that said, resources from 2010 or earlier can be quite useful. I have a cherished hard copy of Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager[1] which was released in 2007 about Linux 2.4, and I regularly rely on it and its concepts.

This is wrong. I’m Org3 (Jensen is Org1, so I’m one level below Jensen but don’t report to him). I have regular scheduled 1:1s with my Org2 manager. I have regular scheduled 1:1s with my Org4 reports and also with some of my Org5 and Org6 team members (on a reduced cadence as you would expect.) I don’t have 40 reports either - more like 15.It’s not true that NVIDIA doesn’t value professional development. It is true that Jensen is a special leader. He founded NVIDIA 30 years ago. No one leading a big tech company has the experience Jensen has. The whole company benefits from his vision. He is not always right, but he does learn fast and he works harder than anyone I know. reply freed0mdox 3 hours agoparentA while back when I was just out of college, I had an interview at NVIDIA, so I requested to add Jensen on Linkedin. Not only he accepted the request, he even replied to my message with some advice and good wishes.

Because they built the operation ground up and have the trust chains in place.The moment you have significant turnover of these leaders (any overall as a result of flagging growth) you are in reorgs territory reply justheretoday 12 hours agoprevThe other anomaly is that Jensen talks all the time with ICs doing the work. I was only a couple of months into working at the company before I got to have a face to face discussion with him about a project I was working on. I have seen many mid-level engineers (IC4-IC5) give him deep dives in these group meetings. It can be very stressful being under Jensen&#x27;s microscope, but it dramatically reduces the \"let&#x27;s show pretty slides to the CEO to show him everything is good\" BS. I was previously at a startup 1&#x2F;100th of this size where the CEO was far less connected to rank and file engineers, so it has been a really nice change. reply frognumber 8 hours agoparentThis is described in The Toyota Way (CEO walking the shop floor, talking to people, using products, etc., and generally having deep dives).

This example is how it&#x27;s supposed to be in a healthy hierarchy.It shows just how deeply imposters have infiltrated the industry. Somehow it has become conventional wisdom that people who are non-technical, or below average engineers, should manage the time of, and mentor engineers often much smarter, and more competent than them. That doesn&#x27;t clear the bar of common sense.There is value in having a hierarchy, some people are more competent, and better at planning, and time management, and interfacing with other people. Those people should be in charge of how other people spend their time. The confluence of those skills is rare. There are exponentially fewer people qualified to fill those roles than there are qualified to be engineers.You shouldn&#x27;t have managers unless you can find good ones. It is far better to spread management thin than to hire bad managers. You would never try to bring the quality of work, planning, and time management closer to that of a below average engineer, but that&#x27;s exactly what happens when you bring in incompetent management.It looks like Nvidia is doing it right. 40 is a high branching factor, and he can engage meaningfully with every one of them about their work. reply squirrel6 9 hours agoparentprevI’ve been reflecting on this a lot lately. Thinking over Chernobyl, Fukushima, and so many business scandals, I think this is the right way to run any organization, public or private. You just can’t have individuals encountering real issues of substance to the business without any voice to raise them to the highest levels of management. Moreover, I don’t know how any executive could expect to try and steer a behemoth of an organization when their only visibility into the business is at such a low resolution owing to the oversimplification baked in through so many reporting layers. reply thelastgallon 8 hours agoparentprevThis is the right way to lead.Everyone lies to leaders: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rubick.com&#x2F;everyone-lies-to-leaders&#x2F; reply Havoc 11 hours agoprevIf you’re sitting of a money printer then damn near any org structure will work.The only interesting part is Nvidia getting their bets right repeatedly & the why behind that is likely interesting.

Only in big tech is that the focus of the \"work\" and do you have managers who spend their time on it, leading to the \"professional meeting attenders\" mentioned elsewhere. reply JohnBooty 9 hours agorootparentMy experience with 1:1s is that they uncover things that wouldn&#x27;t be uncovered... well, without 1:1s.Most of us are \"trained\" not to \"bother\" our managers so allocating some dedicated time is valuable in my experience.I&#x27;m honestly baffled at the pushback against 1:1s I&#x27;m reading. Assuming you have a relatively normal number of direct reports for software engineering (5-10) that adds up to not a lot of hours.At companies without regular 1:1s, I often had no idea if my manager thought I was doing a good job or not. You can say that this is bad management or bad communication, and you&#x27;re right but management and communication tend to be rather poor in our industry! 1:1s are more often than not a part of the solution. reply nradov 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not just the tech industry. For better or worse, frequent 1:1 meetings with direct reports are a common management practice in most large US companies. replydidibus 10 hours agoparentprevThis is an interesting take.. But you know what, thinking about it, I might prefer having n:1s where it&#x27;s the whole team together. A kind of team level all-hands, but much more personal as well. Discuss what everyone has done, their career goals, opportunities, etc.I think if that kind of transparency at the team was put in place and people got used to it, I think you&#x27;re right, it kind of aligns the whole team on everyone&#x27;s goals, and everyone knows where everybody is and who&#x27;s where in their career with regards to promotion and what not. And who the manager think should be given what opportunity and responsibility next, etc. reply nradov 10 hours agorootparentThe extroverts and the highly confident tend to dominate that type of discussion. reply unmole 8 hours agoparentprev> 1:1s are a peculiarly American thingI had regular 1:1s when I worked for Huawei. reply tstrimple 11 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s odd. 1:1s shouldn&#x27;t be used for normal every day work and project activities. It definitely shouldn&#x27;t be just a status update to your manager. For me they are a way of checking in on longer career and growth goals that can be neglected when caught up in the \"real work\". They are also where I check in on promotion readiness and ensuring expectations are aligned. Things which you typically don&#x27;t want the rest of the team in on. Anything directly project related should be either a team meeting or shared via more open communication channels. reply somewhereoutth 10 hours agorootparentRight! So every quarter or maybe once a month max then. reply msm_ 10 hours agorootparentYeah, whatever works for you. When I was at a place that did regular 1:1s, my manager always stressed that they&#x27;re for me, not for the company, and if I want to change the frequency of time I should just let them know. Not sure about your company culture, but if you&#x27;re already experienced, I can&#x27;t imagine your boss would be unhappy if you said \"you know, I don&#x27;t need so much guidance, let&#x27;s have less 1:1 meetings\". Assuming most of the communication happens in regular team meetings, which seems healthy. reply tstrimple 7 hours agorootparentThis is exactly what I do. For the first month or so I recommend weekly 1:1s, just to make sure they are adapting well and getting the things they need. There are a lot of internal systems to navigate, tons of folks they should get to know, etc. But once they are a bit \"settled\" the frequency is really up to them with a minimum of once a quarter. I&#x27;ve been in companies before where managers only met with their employees for things like this once a year at review time! This often led to resentment and morale problems when performance reviews didn&#x27;t align with employee expectations and by the time they find out it&#x27;s too late to course correct. You must keep folks appraised of how well they are meeting expectations both good and bad. The \"annual review\" should contain no surprises for anyone. reply JTbane 11 hours agoparentprevI absolutely despise 1-on-1s.

But I want to put the spotlight on the 1-year and 5-year plans - that there aren&#x27;t any. I feel that phrasing doesn&#x27;t do justice because there&#x27;s more context behind it.Yes, there may not be company-wide top-down 5-year plans or planning cycles. Don&#x27;t mistake this to be your usual breed of agile. What folks work on are ultimately much longer-term visions. I think everyone sort of has&#x2F;owns their own ideas and plans for how an area, product&#x2F;service, project, whatever, should grow into, and everyone is asked to make an effort in communicating those.Internally, it&#x27;s one giant networked negotiation machine.The company adapts well to changing circumstances and market needs, but NVIDIA is strategic and thoughtful - once it goes after something, it rarely backs off. And usually, NVIDIA is going after things others are actively avoiding because the problems in those spaces are too difficult. The consequence of such problem sets are visions that 10-20 year undertakings, if not more, that everyone chips away at bit by bit until one fine day things start taking solid shape.This is also made possible because everyone up the management chain, from ICs till up to JHH are technically adept. This is why sending out \"top-5 things\" works; not because it&#x27;s written for everyone, but because everyone can read it. These emails aren&#x27;t trimmed down. They are sent regularly. They can act as status updates but that&#x27;s not their intention; they are literally what the title says \"top five things\" (on a team&#x27;s agenda right now).A key relevant item that&#x27;s left out in the tweet but JHH mentions in the referenced interview, is \"strategy\". Leadership, from the bottom-up ensures everyone&#x27;s going in the right direction for a body of work in a given area. All of which funnel up to a general strategy that NVIDIA executes. reply matt3210 11 hours agoprevThis is a psy-op to get AMD to have this horrible management structure. reply aborsy 14 hours agoprev- Does not conduct 1:1s - everything happens in a group setting.Wouldn’t in large meetings mostly the loudest and most political be heard?

Maybe that explains their success. Also, take these stories with a grain of salt, til the sources are clear. reply cameldrv 11 hours agoparentThey bet on AI, but it&#x27;s more than that. What I&#x27;d say they seem to be good at is noticing what weirdos are doing and fairly quickly allocating resources to it.1. CUDA. They noticed that people were using graphics shaders to do compute (GPGPU). This was extremely (really extremely) painful to program in. They created CUDA which is only somewhat painful to program in. Now, at this point, it wasn&#x27;t that clear that GPU compute was a great market, but it opened up a bunch of opportunities.2. After CUDA came out, Alex Krizhevsky came around and used it to implement a neural network. Now, this wasn&#x27;t the first time someone had made a neural network with a GPU, but CUDA made it a lot easier to make a sophisticated one.3. NVIDIA noticed that people were using CUDA to make neural networks, and created CuDNN and started sending out free GPUs to all of the academic researchers they could find, further cementing their lead in this area over AMD.In big corporations it tends to be hard for some seemingly insignificant thing like people using your product for something it wasn&#x27;t intended for to bubble up to top management where resources can be allocated to capitalize on it. It&#x27;s especially hard to do this quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this habit of Jensen&#x27;s was responsible for NVIDIA being able to take advantage of these opportunities. reply mcoliver 13 hours agoparentprevYou know where people play politics? 1:1&#x27;s. Stories get told, facts left out, no dissent, people take credit for things they shouldn&#x27;t be taking credit for. Group accountability and transparency squashes all that. reply aborsy 13 hours agorootparentPeople play politics everywhere possible. 1:1 at least guarantees that you have a chance to present your work.Problems with meetings: people don’t express themselves because they might offend others or create enemies, people follow each other, no defined rules on how the meeting operates, problems with credit, diluted responsibilities, opportunities for shifting the work and credit, as someone said in comments formation of cliques competing, etc.Both are probably needed. You need to mix. reply heisenbit 11 hours agorootparentGroup settings favor bolder, louder folks. But then he has email sampling. Besides a top manager directly cutting through layers changes communication culture. When facts and not presentation becomes focus of the group other sets of skills than political are becoming valued more. reply kimixa 9 hours agorootparentGroup emails are also places where the \"loudest\" get heard - it&#x27;s not just physically having a strong voice, but being the sort of person who feels the need to speak even if they&#x27;re unsure they&#x27;re correct, or this is the right forum. I see the same people do that in both physical meetings and group email chains.Sampling group emails likely has a similar bias to sampling large meetings. reply marcinzm 9 hours agorootparentIt seems to me that someone who can directly voice their views is a more efficient employee than someone who needs another person (their manager) to use their time do it for them. A company biasing to more efficient employees seems reasonable. Group meetings have other issues but if you can&#x27;t even do it in async text form... reply kimixa 8 hours agorootparentDirectly voicing views in a forthright manner is useful if the communication is meaningful and informed - which often isn&#x27;t correlated with how \"loud\" it is. reply marcinzm 8 hours agorootparentIf you consider it \"loud\" to be able to send out an email of five things to a group in a structured format that everyone at the company uses then I think we should just agree to disagree. I see that as not loud but having the expected level of communication skills to function in a company at anything beyond a junior level. reply kimixa 7 hours agorootparentSure, there&#x27;s places where it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s always a balance - and large mailing lists are often a poor place for actual discussion and instead just get flooded with what ends up being \"spam\" to many viewers - being things unrelated to your own work that takes energy to filter through and pull out the chunks that are more relevant. In my experience there&#x27;s few \"large\" email groups people actually look at, while most are pushed by an automated filter to whatever subfolder they never look at, so there&#x27;s zero point to them still being on the email group. Anything possibly relevant will be missed anyway.Emails being push rather than pull means you can&#x27;t self-filter as easily - something more like a company forum may be better than email groups as it finer grained categorization than emails, while still being visible to anyone if there ends up being useful discussions between groups which wouldn&#x27;t be the case if you had a thousand different email groups.Nvidia is a &#x2F;huge&#x2F; company doing a very large number of different things, there&#x27;s probably not a lot that&#x27;s actually relevant to everyone. Lots of people think what they say may be, often the \"louder\" people I mentioned, but it&#x27;s probably not actually true.Generally I find emails are a great place for 1-on-1 communication, OK for 2-3 people discussing things, but very quickly spiral into a mess if there&#x27;s any discussion by a group - things get lost, threads get mixed up based on who happened to respond first, and taking things \"off thread\" exclude people based on arbitrary criteria of the responder anyway and are often invisible to anyone else.Maybe OK for \"declarations\" that aren&#x27;t actually for discussion, but that doesn&#x27;t fit with the idea of a \"flat hierarchy\" engineer-driven workplace either. replycaminante 13 hours agorootparentprevFor me, shadow governance is intrinsic to large organizations.It&#x27;s going to happen.At these \"open\" nVidia meetings, I&#x27;m sure cliques are texting on MSFT Teams or SMS.I&#x27;m skeptical that 1:1 here means no 1:1 contact and rather no recurring meetings with reports. reply agumonkey 12 hours agorootparentprevI often wonder what&#x27;s the right balance between group and personal, as you say, 1:1 has issues, but groups have some too (extrovert can use more space). reply koromak 12 hours agoparentprevThe meetings he&#x27;s are are already filled with people comfortable being loud and political.

They used this to great effect in their GPUs as their command processor, they would offload parts of the driver binary into the GPU and execute locally for job setup; they later became an ARM licensee and changed that core out for an ARM one.Their hybrid CPU+GPU design they&#x27;re trying to sell to customers (Ada Lovelace) is their full sized ARM core (a Tegra descendant) plugged into where the tiny ARM core (to be the command processor) goes. This is also how the Tegra X1 work; in a lot of ways, Ada Lovelace is just a really really big Nintendo Switch SoC, and not too dissimilar to how PASemi designed the M series SoCs, its a very common way to keep designs from ballooning silicon and power requirements in embedded land.Also, I&#x27;m not saying Nvidia&#x27;s Mellanox acquisition was dumb; it was very smart. They bought the company that helped make AMD a household name in the supercomputer world: AMD famously used semi-stock Mellanox IB NICs, with custom firmwares, as their external facing hypertransport links combined with Mellanox IB switches; nothing else made could handle RDMA traffic as low latency AND has high bandwidth they needed, while also being flexible enough to be able to natively speak HTX directly on the bus.

They don&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re passive. You can surface a lot of vague feelings of unease or satisfaction with initial questions that you can turn into in-depth conversations, and those usually tell you what the person&#x27;s preferences and areas of growth are.I think no matter what structure you put in place as a manager you still have to get to know your reports well enough to know what you can and can&#x27;t confidently ask them to do. reply dicriseg 12 hours agoparentprevCompletely disagree.

You still need to find a way to listen to what they have to say, and 1x1s accomplish that for many people. Otherwise, group dynamics can just bias toward the loudest or most outgoing.Not to mention, you also get to just talk nonsense and get to know each other as humans a bit.

Speaking on the decentralized social media network Farcaster on Sept. 12, Buterin said that he has finally recovered his T-Mobile account after the hacker managed to gain control of it via a SIM swap attack. “Yes, it was a SIM swap, meaning that someone socially-engineered T-mobile itself to take over my phone number.” The Ethereum co-founder added some lessons and learnings from his experience with X. Vitalik Buterin confirms how his X account was accessed by hackers. Source: Warpcast “A phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA,” he said, adding that users can “completely remove [a] phone from Twitter.” “I had seen the ‘phone numbers are insecure, don't authenticate with them’ advice before, but did not realize this.” Advertisement eToro - Join a secure, trusted platform and get $10 of free crypto Ad On Sept. 9, Buterin’s X account was taken over by scammers who posted a fake NFT giveaway prompting users to click a malicious link, which resulted in victims collectively losing over $691,000. On Sept. 10, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko strongly recommended removing phone numbers from X accounts and having 2FA enabled. “Seems like a no-brainer to have this default on, or to default turn it on when an account reaches, say, >10k followers,” he said to platform owner Elon Musk. Related: How easy is a SIM swap attack? Here’s how to prevent one A SIM-swap or simjacking attack is a technique used by hackers to gain control of a victim’s mobile phone number. With control of the number, scammers can use two-factor authentication (2FA) to access social media, bank, and crypto accounts. It is not the first time T-Mobile has been involved in this type of attack vector. In 2020, the telecoms giant was sued for allegedly enabling the theft of $8.7 million worth of crypto in a series of SIM-swap attacks. T-Mobile was also sued again in February 2021 when a customer lost $450,000 in Bitcoin in another SIM-swap attack. Article updated to include additional comments from Tim Beiko.

In an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, Bitget revealed the Bitget EmpowerX Fund, which will invest $100 million into maximizing the company’s “long-term impact” in the crypto space. According to the announcement, Bitget believes that diversifying services to reach the needs of the global user base is the key to expanding the native crypto ecosystem. Gracy Chen, managing director of Bitget, said the company expects more investments, mergers and acquisitions in the coming months as the centralized exchange landscape evolves with changes in regulations. According to Chen, the fund is “another major step” in the company’s mission to make Bitget a comprehensive platform that caters to the ever-changing needs of crypto users. “We also want to empower other people in our industry, because a rising tide lifts all boats,” Chen said. The crypto derivatives exchange launched a $100 million Web3 fund for crypto projects in Asia earlier this year. On April 10, Bitget said that it would target funding Web3-friendly projects worldwide while focusing on Asian projects with experienced teams working on solving real-world problems.

There is some extra level of security via obscurity that makes simple social engineering attacks harder but fundamentally it is still T-mobile underneath. reply lxgr 18 hours agorootparentprevImplementation flaws like that are always possible, but my concern is that in so many cases, SIM swaps are ridiculously easy by design (or more accurately, by absence) of the phone provider&#x27;s security procedures. reply f0e4c2f7 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty wild how baked into modern life insecure 2fa is. Especially with the prevalence of sim swapping. I more or less model most auth as trivially insecure at this point.You think about someone like Vitalik of all people, if he can&#x27;t keep his account secure...average person has their work cut out for them.Private key auth systems have security challenges of their own (losing access forever when you lose your key) but I wish they were an option in place of the current regime.In the 90s you could bypass security locally on a machine by clicking cancel and it would just log you in. Feels like today it&#x27;s only slightly more complicated and costs a bit of money to access twitter, email, bank accounts etc.Seemingly little to no interest in resolving this state of affairs beyond obscure and increasingly less legal crypto based systems. reply lxgr 19 hours agorootparentThat’s what happens when we designate phone providers as the single point of identity verification without creating any incentives for them to actually fulfill that role.One of my banks basically only accepts what they call “phone number verification” to clear a false fraud alert on my cards (or generally talk to them about anything regarding my account).What that means is (at least I’m fairly sure) that the agent on the phone will ask me for any phone number, they ask the carrier for the name on that line and compare it with mine, and if it’s a match, they send an OTP to that number.This is even worse than SMS-OTP, since a fraudster doesn’t even need to change my number on file with my bank – opening a phone line in my name with any of the big three carriers is enough! reply lr1970 13 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s pretty wild how baked into modern life insecure 2fa is.And a solution to this is very simple. Make telcos legally liable for losses due to SIM-swap attacks and before the ink is dry on such a law, Telcos will ban using phone numbers for authentication in their TOS. The banks and alike will be forced to come up with another, hopefully, better auth system. reply guiambros 9 hours agorootparentNot sure why you&#x27;re being downvoted; I think this is pretty reasonable idea.Of course, there&#x27;s zero chance of this happening in the US, given telcos would lobby heavily against it.

I primarily use a virtual phone number because I don&#x27;t want to give out my real phone number though; it&#x27;s easier to cancel and replace a virtual one.

A SIM swap to me is convincing the current provider to provision a new SIM for an existing line, which the attacker can then use to receive texts addressed to the victim.Porting attacks are definitely possible against Google Voice, but these require confirming the port in the target account first, no?And the Google Voice equivalent to a SIM swap would just be a compromise of the Google account itself. Definitely not impossible, and I know I’m tying my availability to a company not exactly known for being the best custodian for that – but I’ll take my chances with them over any phone provider. reply buildbuildbuild 19 hours agorootparentGoogle will not share how threat actors are pulling it off but it definitely is happening. (see the Terpin v. AT&T lawsuit for why they might not be disclosing the vector)There are \"fingerprint\" cookie marketplaces that sell tokens from malware-compromised computers and allow you to make HTTP requests from a victim&#x27;s connection, this could be one approach. There are also scammer call centers that will call unsuspecting people pretending to be Google, Coinbase, AT&T, or whomever, and have them click buttons in user interfaces.I&#x27;ve seen entire Google accounts deleted with no recourse due to this \"suspicious activity\" that victims had no control over. Computer says no, and it&#x27;s near-impossible to get in touch with a human at Google.(I agree with you on terminology but media reports tend to group number porting attacks in with \"SIM swaps\") reply Obscurity4340 15 hours agorootparentIs there a reason that would-be hackers are not preempted by requiring a specific device, pins, etc with no kill-switch or social engineering available (like, you lose your credentials, there&#x27;s nothing we can do, its gone)? It sometimes feels like the system is deliberately designed so certain \"legitimate\" actors have a backdoor into any given system... reply theolivenbaum 19 hours agorootparentprevThe only time where Google&#x27;s absolute lack of customer service for end users might pay off reply lxgr 18 hours agorootparentTrue – can&#x27;t social-engineer a person if there&#x27;s no person! reply joecool1029 16 hours agorootparentprev> A GV number is just as easy to transfer as any other phone number.There is nobody to social engineer (it&#x27;s Google, they hate customer service) and the system rejects all port-out requests until you unlock the number by paying a few dollars which requires breaking into the Google Account to begin with. It is absolutely not the same as compromising an employee of a carrier.To be clear I&#x27;m describing Google Voice which is purely a VOIP service, not Google Fi which is a MVNO. reply JimDabell 18 hours agoparentprev> Except for one certain bank that won&#x27;t even accept my \"real [cell] phone number\" for identity verification purposes, because \"it&#x27;s not verifiable\" (probably because it&#x27;s not with the big three cell providers).It’s common for organisations to blacklist VOIP-based numbers for 2FA.

If your world view has been degraded to see zero trust as a solution rather than a dystopian end state, meaning you’ve lost all trust in society, you’re highly vulnerable to be conned by the authority figures you secretly crave to trust.It’s much of what Elon, Trump and other populists actively foster and exploit in their fan base through relentless conspiracy theories and undermining of trust into anyone who isn’t them.There’s a paradox here - the more people have their trust violated, the more distrustful they get, the easier they get scam as the overhead of approaching every transaction &#x2F; interact in life with an adversarial mindset exhausts critical capacity and drives people into desperate savior fantasies - technological miracles, charlatans. snakeoil, the twentieths coin or pump and dump.Zero trust (non security version - the inability to extend trust) is a miserable desperate state to be in as a human being and makes people highly vulnerable to getting taken advantage of and crypto signaling on social media either identifies you as a scammer or as a mark. You still believe technology can solve societies trust dilemma, you are asking for it at this point.And the longer the scamming goes on, the stronger the signal of this self identifying audience becomes. It’s like responding to Nigerian prince emails at this point.Go reddit, look at the safemoon subreddit. It’s … wild how many times you can rip off some people and have them get more militant in their belief they are smart.As a footnote, more and more tech companies explore this to prop up shrinking profit margins. By selling previously valuable trust marks such as the top result on google (there was a time you could trust this) or flat out verification marks that previously were meant to foster Trust and Safety for money, erosion of trust becomes a profitable feature. It’s good for platforms when users cannot tell placed &#x2F; bought placement and fake news from actual valuable content.It’s just terminal for society - each time someone is scammed, has their trust betrayed, they slide a little bit closer into that state that is so exploitable by populists. reply dang 12 hours agorootparentPlease don&#x27;t take HN threads on generic flamewar tangents.

The causes of insecurity are largely user behavior, and the insecure things are things users want to do for practical reasons.For example, I have a foolproof way of preventing sim swap attacks: require 256bits of entropy and never allow a password reset, like in crypto. Lose your password? Account is gone forever.This is more secure but less user friendly. Except for large accounts, I don’t know that anyone even particularly cares if their Twitter gets hacked.

In both cases the attacker needs the password (or the client cert, whatever the other factor is), but only in the SMS 2FA case the attacker has to perform SIM swapping. reply mindslight 18 hours agorootparentAfter the first sentence, there were two more sentences explaining that. \"Bank balance\" meaning the money in your bank account, as opposed to information about your transactions. I did forget to include that my comment was US-centric. reply mr_mitm 18 hours agorootparentSorry, I still don&#x27;t follow. With SMS 2FA the attacker needs strictly more information as compared to just a password. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you log into your bank account or twitter.Did you mean a TAN for protecting individual transactions? I file this under authorization instead of authentication. But even then a SMS TAN is better than no TAN. I cannot see a scenario where adding SMS authentication makes things less secure. reply mindslight 18 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re focusing on an imagined attacker performing a single type of attack, and losing sight of more significant avenues for damage. When talking about the possibility of losing money, the main thing you need to do is check your account transactions within 30 days of being issued a statement. This is required so that you can report unauthorized transactions in a timely manner, so that they can be reversed. Transaction authentication essentially doesn&#x27;t matter, especially in the consumer market - remember banks are still happily chugging along printing a withdrawal key on the front of every check. Any impediment to verifying your transactions in a timely manner, including for example discontinuing OFX Direct Connect access in the name of \"2FA\", increases the chance that you might miss the dispute period and actually lose money. reply mr_mitm 17 hours agorootparentAh, now I get it, thanks for clarifying.Well, this could be solved by sending a notification on all transactions. I already get these for my credit card account (I wish they did this on my checking account, too). When paying with Google Pay, I even get three notifications. This was very useful once, when I woke up to a $50 transaction to the XBox store that I supposedly did while sleeping without even owning an XBox. reply mindslight 17 hours agorootparentPragmatically you might be able to find a setting for your bank that lets you notify you of transactions over $X, and then set X to $0.01 or $1.00.Abstractly my larger point is that security isn&#x27;t a monolithic scalar but rather depends on the threat model and what is being secured. Far too often large entities push out features in the name of \"security\", but what they really mean is their own security at the expense of yours (eg the TSA). A lot of these pushes (eg SMS 2FA) are like that, especially when made mandatory rather than consensual. replyotterpro 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been using Google Voice free phone number if I need to give out phone number for verification, and I hope it mitigates the possibility of SIM-swapping.

I was able to reset my own password only with phone access when 2FA was not enabled: in the reset password flow, I started with my phone number, was then asked for my username and email, and then I was presented with an option to send the reset code either to my email or to my phone number.But, I then enabled 2FA (with an authentication app), and now when I try the flow again, I get to the screen for sending the reset code and I only have the email option left (but the screen still shows up as an extra step).So, it&#x27;s possible that when you have 2FA enabled you can no longer do it. Or, it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ve triggered some internal rules by resetting my password twice in a short span of time (and enabling 2FA as well) and they&#x27;ve bumped me to some kind of \"extra verification\" flow that disabled phone-based password reset. reply thaumasiotes 21 hours agorootparentprev> \"A phone number is sufficient to password reset a Twitter account even if not used as 2FA\"In other words, they don&#x27;t have a 2FA system.

Fingerprint (or iris scan) plus email OTP mandatory to get a SIM replaced? reply dorfsmay 20 hours agoprevThis makes me feel really good that the Canada Revenue Agency and most banks in Canada use SMS for second factor auth! reply lxgr 19 hours agoparentThe EBA (the European banking regulator in charge of specifying the technical details of the PSD2 regulation, which covers secure cardholder authentication, among other things) also stated a while ago that only SMS-OTP is a \"true\" factor; Email-OTP isn&#x27;t.Ironically, my email account is so much better protected than my mobile phone number.I&#x27;m trying very hard to believe that the SMS lobby (i.e. mobile phone operators, which earn multiple cents per inbound SMS in Europe, as well as our friendly SMS verification providers adding their markup on that) didn&#x27;t exert some pressure on the regulators here... reply FabHK 19 hours agorootparentInsofar as one of the factors should be something the user knows, and one factor something the user has, that makes perfect sense. You know your password (or the master password to your password manager), and you have your phone with the SIM card. With email (or Authy), the second factor is also something you know, thus it&#x27;s not 2F anymore.Note that NIST also recommends against email as a factor in 2FA (A-B11 here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.nist.gov&#x2F;800-63-FAQ&#x2F; ), and says that SMS OTP must be directed to a phone, not an IP address (such as with VoIP, see A-B01 in the same document).\"Methods that do not prove possession of a specific device, such as voice-over-IP (VOIP) or email, SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication.\" (5.1.3.1 of NIST SP 800-63B) reply lxgr 18 hours agorootparent> you have your phone with the SIM card.Yeah, or a fraudster that talked my provider in to SIM-swapping it or porting out my number (quite possible, since many phone providers don&#x27;t have 2FA themselves!), or malware on my Android phone with access to incoming SMS, or (although much less likely) an SS7 attacker...A SIM is indeed a smart card theoretically capable of acting as a true \"possession\" factor (e.g. using EAP-AKA&#x2F;EAP-SIM, although almost nobody uses that) – but calling it a possession factor for SMS-OTP is at least as much as a stretch as calling an email inbox a knowledge-only factor: Accessing my inbox requires a FIDO authenticator and password.> Note that NIST also recommends against email as a factor in 2FAI guess bad decisions and&#x2F;or lobbying aren&#x27;t limited to European regulators&#x2F;legislators then. reply aftbit 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean? I \"have\" access to my SMSes via my phone, and I \"have\" access to my email or my Authy also via my phone. If you get my phone, you can:1. start password reset via email2. confirm via SMS 2FASo that makes this into 1FA not 2FA.At least for TOTP secrets, I can store them securely, and attackers cannot convince a human support agent somewhere to hand them over.If you want true 2FA, you need something like WebAuthn with hardware tokens where the private key is on the token, but then you need a recovery process, and that takes you right back to the lowest common denominator of SMS verification. reply michael_j_x 14 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t understand this sim-swapping concept. Where I am from (EU country), if you need to get a new sim for your number, you have to physically go to your service provider&#x27;s stores with an official proof of identity (passport or identity card) and do the change. Upon changing, your previous sim immediately loses service reply callalex 14 hours agoparentUnited States services are fundamentally broken in this way because there is literally no unified identification system for the United States. There are identity systems for most US states, but there are 50 of those and the requirements and features vary widely which makes it a nightmare to build on top of them. reply theragra 12 hours agoparentprevIn some more corrupt countries in EU, clerks can be bribed, unfortunately reply mihaic 20 hours agoprevHow exactly does a scam like this work? Access to someone&#x27;s Twitter account only means that you can just post a link. People seem to have connected their wallet, but they still would need to sign a transaction after that.

No money or cryptocurrency is transfered directly. Scammers get access to a popular account with many followers, and tweet something like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.news.bitcoin.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;v...You don&#x27;t need to get everyone in the cryptocurrency space to believe you, just a few people transferring funds from their wallet will make you rich. reply mihaic 19 hours agorootparentAnd the \"this is free for 24h\" is just a red herring, to make it legitimate for people to speculate?Still crazy that such a semi-anonymous scam got 700k, sounds like there&#x27;s still a lot of money in crypto ready to gamble. reply jeroenhd 19 hours agorootparentThere have been free or very cheap NFTs in the past, and handing out free coins is the easiest way to get your cryptocurrency flowing.I&#x27;m no criminal, but if I were, I would definitely target cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Many of them are the perfect target, having access to large sums of money, having the ability and willingness to transfer funds in a near untraceable way, and often looking for a get-rich-quick scheme like those cryptomultimillionaires.Things like NFT smart contract that would transfer all of your NFTs when trying to get rid of them, coupled with unpleasant pictures, coupled with cryptoclout, publicly accessible profiles, and no method to refuse a transaction, have produced some ingenious thefts that nobody would even think possible ten years ago. Millions of real world dollars have been spent on pictures of monkeys, and millions have been lost after someone stole those pictures. reply umeshunni 20 hours agorootparentprevLooking at that tweet, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a scam or just your regular cryptard NFT pump post. reply jeroenhd 19 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such an effective scam, these types of posts are everywhere around cryptocurrency fanbases, but this time it came from a reputable person within the community. reply joncrocks 19 hours agoparentprevYou have to sign a transaction, but I _think_ the details of transactions can be obscure enough to not be clear what you&#x27;re authorizing.

    "originLink": "https://til.simonwillison.net/django/building-a-blog-in-django",
    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s TILs Building a blog in Django We launched the Datasette Cloud blog today. The Datasette Cloud site itself is a Django app - it uses Django and PostgreSQL to manage accounts, teams and soon billing and payments, then launches dedicated containers running Datasette for each customer. It's been a while since I've built a new blog implementation in Django! I decided to make notes for the next time. Features # Here are the features I consider to be essential for a blog in 2023 (though they haven't changed much in over a decade): Blog posts have a title, summary, body and publication date. Optional: author information, tags Posts can be live or draft The blog index page shows the most recent entries Older entries are available via some kind of archive mechanism The blog has an Atom feed Entries have social media card metadata, to enhance links to them on Mastodon and Twitter Markdown is a nice-to-have for editing the posts The models # Here's the Django model for the blog (I generated the first version of this with ChatGPT, then iterated on it): from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.utils import timezone from django.utils.html import strip_tags import markdown from django.utils.html import mark_safe class Tag(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=50) slug = models.SlugField() def __str__(self): return self.name class Entry(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=200) created = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now) slug = models.SlugField() summary = models.TextField() body = models.TextField() card_image = models.URLField( blank=True, null=True, help_text=\"URL to image for social media cards\" ) authors = models.ManyToManyField(User, through=\"Authorship\") tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag, blank=True) is_draft = models.BooleanField( default=False, help_text=\"Draft entries do not show in index pages but can be visited directly if you know the URL\", ) class Meta: verbose_name_plural = \"entries\" @property def summary_rendered(self): return mark_safe(markdown.markdown(self.summary, output_format=\"html5\")) @property def summary_text(self): return strip_tags(markdown.markdown(self.summary, output_format=\"html5\")) @property def body_rendered(self): return mark_safe(markdown.markdown(self.body, output_format=\"html5\")) def get_absolute_url(self): return \"/blog/%d/%s/\" % (self.created.year, self.slug) def __str__(self): return self.title class Authorship(models.Model): user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE) entry = models.ForeignKey(Entry, on_delete=models.CASCADE) order = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0) class Meta: ordering = [\"order\"] It's pretty self-explanatory. The most interesting features are the is_draft flag and the way it provides .summary_rendered and .body_rendered properties that return Markdown rendered as HTML. The URL format for this blog is /blog/2023/welcome/ - in my experience name-spacing posts by year makes the most sense, since even the most active blogs usually only have a few posts every month. The views # Here are the view functions defined the views.py module for my blog/ application: from django.contrib.syndication.views import Feed from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404 from django.utils.feedgenerator import Atom1Feed from .models import Entry, Tag ENTRIES_ON_HOMEPAGE = 5 def index(request): entries = list( Entry.objects.filter(is_draft=False).order_by(\"-created\")[ : ENTRIES_ON_HOMEPAGE + 1 ] ) has_more = False if len(entries) > ENTRIES_ON_HOMEPAGE: has_more = True entries = entries[:ENTRIES_ON_HOMEPAGE] return render( request, \"blog/index.html\", {\"entries\": entries, \"has_more\": has_more} ) def entry(request, year, slug): entry = get_object_or_404(Entry, created__year=year, slug=slug) return render( request, \"blog/entry.html\", {\"entry\": entry}, ) def year(request, year): entries = Entry.objects.filter(created__year=year, is_draft=False).order_by( \"-created\" ) return render(request, \"blog/year.html\", {\"entries\": entries, \"year\": year}) def archive(request): entries = Entry.objects.filter(is_draft=False).order_by(\"-created\") return render(request, \"blog/archive.html\", {\"entries\": entries}) def tag(request, slug): tag = Tag.objects.get(slug=slug) entries = tag.entry_set.filter(is_draft=False).order_by(\"-created\") return render(request, \"blog/tag.html\", {\"tag\": tag, \"entries\": entries}) The Atom feed # The most interesting part of the views.py file is this bit - defining the Atom feed: class BlogFeed(Feed): title = \"Datasette Cloud\" link = \"/blog/\" feed_type = Atom1Feed def items(self): return Entry.objects.filter(is_draft=False).order_by(\"-created\")[:5] def item_title(self, item): return item.title def item_description(self, item): return item.summary_rendered + \"\\n\" + item.body_rendered def item_link(self, item): return \"/blog/%d/%s/\" % (item.created.year, item.slug) def item_author_name(self, item): return ( \", \".join([a.get_full_name() or str(a) for a in item.authors.all()]) or None ) def get_feed(self, obj, request): feedgen = super().get_feed(obj, request) feedgen.content_type = \"application/xml; charset=utf-8\" return feedgen This is using the Django syndication feed framework. The resulting Atom feed can be found here: https://www.datasette.cloud/blog/feed/ There's one extra trick here: I'm over-riding the default content-type header and setting it to \"application/xml; charset=utf-8. Django defaults to using application/atom+xml; charset=utf-8 which is correct... but causes most browsers to trigger a download rather than rendering the XML in the browser directly. I like to be able to click on a feed link and see the XML before I paste the URL into my feed reader software, so I prefer to use application/xml instead. Social media cards # It's easy to forget these, but they're really important - with the right markup links to posts shared on Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook will look MUCH better. Here's a snipet from my entry.html template: {% block extra_head %} {% if entry.card_image %} {% else %}{% endif %}{% if entry.card_image %}{% endif %} {% if entry.is_draft %}{% endif %} {% endblock %} There's one other detail in there: if an entry is a draft entry I serveto prevent it from being accidentally indexed by search engines.

It turns out the Django ecosystem has an answer for that in the form of Django Distill [1]. Distill adds a new management command that generates static content by repeatedly invoking your views.I&#x27;ve used Distill to build quite a few static sites. It&#x27;s great to be able to deploy to Pages but use Django&#x27;s admin UI locally. Typically, for these sites, I check in my &#x27;production&#x27; SQLite database directly to my git repo.(Combine this pattern with GitHub actions and you can do a lot with a little.

After many people started using Python for web development made popular by web framework like Zope and Django, then they stay and keep using it because it&#x27;s relatively easy to program. Above all it&#x27;s easier to grok and maintain due to its ancestor being ABC language. It also adopted identation and made it mandatory mainly for readability reason since most of the popular programs has more than one programmer or maintainer.Initially though Python got a lot of flak for this mandatory identation feature but later it&#x27;s really its main advantage against other interpreted programming language of its time and programmers consider it a language with pseudo-like codes, but with functionality. Then come the era of data science and analytics popularity where Fortran and Matlab were kings, but the former is too primitive and the latter is a proprietary language. Interestingly, Guido himself was involved with new Python matrix operation syntax in order to make it more intuitive. Due to the rise of AI and machine learning where matrix operations are pervasive, Python becoming the best open source alternative and the rest is history. This is a very interesting read on HN for the reasons why Python win over its competitor and now the most popular language on the planet:[1] Why did Python win?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37308747 reply ajhai 15 hours agoprevDjango has been my go to framework for any new web project I start for more than a decade. Its batteries-included approach meant that one could go pretty far with just Django alone.

It is compatible with a lot of Heroku buildpacks e.g. PostgreSQL and Redis, has a similar CLI, and includes plugins for things like LetsEncrypt that can be installed with a couple commands. As with Heroku and other PAAS you can deploy with a simple git push.It&#x27;s absolutely fine for the MVP stage of a more serious project, but it&#x27;s not really meant for scaling out beyond a single server. I mean sure, it&#x27;s possible, but there are better tools for the job, and at that point you should have a bigger budget&#x2F;team. reply theptip 6 hours agoparentprevIf you&#x27;re not deploying at large scale, I&#x27;d go with something elastic in the same vein as Render (I haven&#x27;t used that one though). Heroku used to be my go-to recommendation here of course. Fly.io gets a lot of love as a Heroku replacement and they have a generous free tier (though they have had some uptime troubles recently).Alternatively GCP and AWS both have elastic compute options that should work as well. (App Engine and Beanstalk? respectively.)Running a VM is going to be annoying (way more ops toil) and cost you more than you need, if you&#x27;re making on the order of requests-per-hour instead of requests-per-minute. But if a VM is cheaper than your best elastic option you can make it work. I would not recommend sharing apps within a project as migrations can be annoying and you&#x27;ll get downtime on every app whenever you deploy or break any of them. But you could have one VM serving up lots of projects, and give one port per project, then wire up a load balancer & DNS name for each project&#x2F;port.It&#x27;s possible to do git-deploys with a VM but it&#x27;s a little work to wire up. You&#x27;d set it up with GitLab, and you can wire up a simple deploy script that effectively does a `docker stop && docker run` to launch your new app container. reply bredren 6 hours agoparentprevI use GitHub actions to automate test &#x2F; build &#x2F; deploy of django &#x2F; Postgres &#x2F; nginx docker orchestrations.I prefer digital ocean for VPS and have found you can get pretty far on the smaller droplets.I’ll typically have two environments, one getting auto deploys from anything on a feature branch, and production which gets deployed when there are changes to main.For my setup, I initially learned using blog entries from the folks who blog at:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testdriven.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;I blended multiple entries to achieve just the setup I wanted.I haven’t gone up to terraform though, finding it sufficient to use a pre built image of ubuntu &#x2F; docker at the initialization.My oldest projects still use .sh to handle deploys but I’d never go back to that stuff. reply D13Fd 17 hours agoprevIf you want a more \"out of the box\" solution, you can run Wagtail and Puput on top of Django.

And as seen above, Django in its simplest form is no more complex.Some people really don&#x27;t like the Django ORM, so in this case you might avoid Django altogether. It&#x27;s possible to use Django without its data layer but it&#x27;s a big part of its value.Also if you are building a pure API project, FastAPI is worth checking out for a streamlined process. Django Rest Framework works too, but is an extension. reply Daishiman 9 hours agoparentprevEvery sufficiently large Flask app reimplements half of Django, badly.I’m the sole maintainer of a Flask app that uses SqlAlchemy, and the experience is similar except that I really miss the admin and auth. However every single flask app ends up using slightly different libraries and architecture, which means that onboarding always takes longer than an equivalent Django app.Also, I have over a decade of Python experience; I wouldn’t count on people with little Python experience to produce well architected apps in Flask, whereas Django does a lot of guiding the user towards established patterns.Some parts of Django are antiquated and I do not recommend them (specifically the Forms API really has been superseded by pretty much any newer forms library), but that’s still way less baggage than having to pick up a new stack for every new Flask app. reply waynesonfire 11 hours agoprevDo your notes include how to recover from being hacked? reply simonw 11 hours agoparentDo you know something I don&#x27;t know? reply waynesonfire 11 hours agorootparentNo, just PTSD from my WordPress blog.

The problem at that end always seems to be a lack of flexibility and over-reliance on proprietary systems or SaaS products.Django is just Python. Rails is just Ruby. There&#x27;s nothing special to them and extending when necessary is often trivial, particularly because they have such mature extension points.There&#x27;s a lot of criticism that can be levelled at these ecosystems for not keeping up with whatever the hype of the year is, or failing to \"scale\" in various ways, but damn do they get you a very long way with very little work.[^1]: Phoenix may be just about in this category, I don&#x27;t have personal experience with it though, just going on the fact it seems to be very Rails inspired. reply deaddodo 16 hours agoparent> Django is just Python.

This should be made clear that this is just a toy&#x2F;example app to demonstrate Django, not something someone should actually use.Generating the pages on each request is madness, and is why Wordpress in the default configuration (without WP Total Cache, which allows the httpd to bypass Wordpress entirely for most requests) falls over as soon as it&#x27;s linked from any media site.

Hugo, Jekyll, and a million others await you, as well as CF Pages, S3, GitHub Pages, Netlify, and others.One downside of this is that you have wait for a compilation process every time you make content changes.

A blog may or may not change frequently enough to warrant a backend.Any modern SSG can build and deploy in under a minute, usually in single digit seconds. This isn&#x27;t really an issue in practice at all.Static sites work fine even if you are updating many times an hour. This is a far cry from \"rarely ever change\". reply evantbyrne 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re conflating build times and deploy times. A low friction deployment might take a couple minutes end-to-end for something that \"builds\" in a few seconds once the CI is booted up. Sure, that&#x27;s fine for hobbyist stuff that is always being edited by the web developer and nobody else. The point is a proper backend editing experience brings so much to the table. Once upon a time, my promotion was delayed because the team lead I answered to decided to use a SSG instead of a proper CMS, and non-technical stakeholders were not happy about the limitations. reply thraxil 16 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s a post I put up just a few weeks ago showing how a completely dynamically generated blog with zero caching or performance tuning handles the traffic from ending up on the front page of HN, being served off the free tier of Fly.io: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thraxil.org&#x2F;users&#x2F;anders&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;hn-trafficIt&#x27;s Phoenix in my case, but I&#x27;ve had a dynamic blog with Django for a long time and it&#x27;s not massively different in terms of performance. I also do like static site generators, but more for being able to dump stuff into S3 and avoid some deployment complexity (but they introduce other complexity).The main point is really that Wordpress, with the default configuration is just off the charts terrible. Like, it had to have taken massive amounts of engineering to make something that performs so poorly.

    "originBody": "Job Board Podcast Articles Events Blogs About Us STAY UPDATED Business 7 MIN READ FEATURED BLOG The Death of Unity If you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. Brandon Sheffield Contributor September 13, 2023 PDF Unity was once heralded as the savior of the video game industry. It was relatively easy to use, and provided an engine/framework for multiple games rather than just one. Even as late as the early 2000s, some game companies, especially in Japan, weren't even sharing similar engines within their own teams! Before the popularity of commercial game engines, each game was built bespoke, which had some advantages, but took a lot of time, and made each port a chore. One of the greatest things Unity provided was a relatively easy pipeline to console releases, making ports more about platform quirks than full recoding. I remember countless interviews I did as a journalist in 2005 where the interviewee said \"now that there's engines like Unity, things are getting easier.\" My game company Necrosoft has used Unity for every commercial project it has ever made. But now I can say, unequivocally, if you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. If you started a project 4 months ago, it's worth switching to something else. Unity is quite simply not a company to be trusted. What has happened? Across the last few years, as John Riccitiello has taken over the company, the engine has made a steady decline into bizarre business models surrounding an engine with unmaintained features and erratic stability. This did not age well. I'll talk about eroding features first. Unity has internal champions for its features. Once those champions leave the company, that feature languishes and falls apart. Unity buys competing products, and then if the owner of that product leaves the company, it is no longer supported. Unity has a \"stable\" version of its product called the \"LTS\" version. More experimental features are pushed to a beta which developers can use if they're curious. Currently we are on an LTS version that requires us to open a blank page before doing anything else, otherwise the engine simply crashes. This is because of an error Unity introduced recently which they have not fixed. It adds a couple minutes every time we open the project, and is anything but stable. Showcase your game on Game Developer Share your game dev experience, knowledge and ideas with the largest community of game developers in the world The latest and final straw is this announcement, which you may have seen some developer friends talking about. I'll break down some of the most important factors in this discussion: Unity personal, which is free, now cannot be used offline. all tiers of unity now require developers to pay a flat fee of a few cents for every game that's installed Unity plus (which is going away), and pro, and enterprise levels all cost a subscription, and most professional developers have to use it. different tiers of downloads and income determine how much you pay. Unity has never made money off subscriptions, it has always made money off its ads platform (which you see in f2p mobile games, etc) There's a discount if you use Unity Services. This money is meant to help with runtime issues when they can't even get their base stable version to run without crashing. So the problem becomes this: they are already charging a subscription, and now a per install cost on top of that. What's the point of the subscription if we're also paying another charge on top of that? Why wouldn't it be free at that point? Also, it's on developers to sort through these two types of costs, meaning Unity has added a bunch of admin work for us, while making it extremely costly for games like Vampire Survivor to sell their game at the price they do. Vampire Survivor's edge was their price, now doing something like that is completely unfeasible. Imagine releasing a game for 99 cents under the personal plan, where Steam takes 30% off the top for their platform fee, and then unity takes 20 cents per install, and now you're making a maximum of 46 cents on the dollar. As a developer who starts a game under the personal plan, because you're not sure how well it'll do, you're punished, astoundingly so, for being a breakout success. Not to mention that sales will now be more costly for developers since Unity is not asking for a percentage, but a flat fee. If I reduce the price of my game, the price unity asks for doesn't decrease. This all comes out of the developer's pocket, but publishers won't want to be on the hook for it either - expect fewer games to be pitched with Unity going forward. And NOW consider bundles. Each install or activation counts as something that must be paid. We did the itch.io bundle for ukraine. That was approximately a million games given out per developer. If all those were installed, developers would owe $200,000 just for having given their game to charity. It makes charity bundles completely unfeasible. On top of this there is no minimum cooldown period after they change their fee, so they can raise it as they like, whenever they like. Effectively we're all locked into an upward-only, per-install pricing model that can change whenever Unity decides they need extra revenue to make their stock look healthy. No developer would have decided to use Unity if this was the business model from the start. It proves that they're willing to completely change things up with no notice. January is barely 4 months away, and this decision will affect titles that have been in development for years, and haven't factored this into their budgets. If we had the option, we'd change now, but we're too far into development. Unreal Engine, to their credit, only holds you to the EULA you signed up for, not whatever they've decided most recently. I want to double down on this point - we did not sign up for this. Frankly the Unity Plus tier, which we currently use, which is going away presently, wasn't even around when we signed up. Oh, and did I mention we're automatically being switched to the more expensive Pro from Plus if we don't cancel our subscription? If the agreement changes underneath you as you're making the game, you can't budget for it, and trust is completely lost. We did not plan for this, and it screws us massively on Demonschool, which is tracking to be our most successful game. You might say poor you, but again, we did not sign up for this and have no option to say no, since we're close to release and this change is 4 months out. You can't simply remake an entire game in another engine when you've been working on it for 4+ years. It is clear that Riccitiello never considered that people might make games for reasons other than money. At least the attitude is consistent. There is one other critical element here - developers are being offered a reduced price if they use Unity Services. This is basically monopolistic and anti-competitive, and they will likely get sued over it. At the very least it certainly won't encourage any technology companies to make services for Unity. What's the point when Unity will undercut you and still force devs into licensing their own product? Expect far less offerings from third parties in the future. Ultimately, it screws over indies and smaller devs the most. If you can afford to pay for higher tiers, you don't pay as much of this nickle and dime fee, but indies can't afford to on the front end, or often it doesn't make sense in terms of the volume of games you'll sell, but then you wind up paying more in the long term. It'll squash innovation and art-oriented games that aren't designed around profit, especially. It's a rotten deal that only makes sense if you're looking at numbers, and assume everyone will keep using your product. Well, I don't think people will keep using their product unless they're stuck. I know one such developer who is stuck, who's estimating this new scheme will cost them $100,000/month on a free to play game, where their revenue isn't guaranteed. Unity is desperately digging its own grave in a search for gold. This is all incredibly short-sighted and adds onto a string of rash decisions and poorly thought through schemes from Unity across the last few years. It's no wonder Riccitiello sold 2,000 shares last week. This post originally appeared on Insert Credit.

If you need to refund anyone you are refunding the full $0.99 from your account, despite you only made $0.46 (steam and unity are going to keep theirs, its on you as the publisher to make up the difference). If you had a disastrous launch and had a majority of people seeking a refund, well not only did you hard work and effort not pay off, you owe $$$$ on top of that. In theory this liability is like shorting a stock and the loss potential is virtually limitless, you could end up owing millions. reply gmerc 4 hours agoparentThis is factually incorrect. Steam (And I suspect Apple too) handles these challenges pretty transparently and fairly and don’t leave you on the hook.Frankly speaking - there’s a lot of comments similar to this in tech, especially when espousing the solutions that crypto may offer for these “problems” that are built on ignorance or misunderstanding of how the industry actually operates.Having been in more discussions about “disrupting games” than I can count, almost every one of them was driven by outsiders with zero appreciation.While Steam’s fees are on the higher side, the depth of publisher features offered by steamworks is incredible and are likely saving average developers the fees many times overFacebook famously had the illusion that if you made distribution free, you could dislodge game developers from Steam (see FB Gameroom). Educating people on the 999 other reasons why developers choose steam , was painful. reply garblegarble 13 hours agoparentprevDo you have evidence for that claim?

Still shitty and I&#x27;m glad I made the switch to Godot a few months ago, but not as bad as people are making it out to be. reply mulmen 12 hours agorootparentRevenue isn’t profit. So if you build a toy game and it takes off without a solid business and pricing plan you could be stuck and have to shut it down. Seems like that makes Unity is a very bad place to start. reply __loam 6 hours agorootparentYeah I mean, there&#x27;s a reason I&#x27;m not using it. reply moron4hire 2 hours agorootparentSeveral reasons.I&#x27;ve been \"game development adjacent\" for most of my career. By that, I mean I&#x27;m not a game developer, I&#x27;m mostly a web developer, but I&#x27;ve done a lot of game development-like things in my projects over the years, including a 4 year stint where I built a VR app for foreign language training.My impression during the last 20 years of my career is that game development lacks a lot to be desired in the \"professionalism\" side of software development. At least, on the indie side. I obviously don&#x27;t know anything about what large studios do. But large studios aren&#x27;t using Unity, either.In the non-game development world, almost all of the best tools for development are free and open source. There are several different packages to choose from for any task, and they all pretty much integrate together. They support well-defined, open standards. Their developers work hard to make the software be stable across minor versions. And the tools--and thus the pipeline of developers--between small and large projects, small and large teams, are largely the same (caveat some scale-managing orchestration tools that one can get by without perfectly fine without users ever noticing on the small scale).Before you might scoff-in-JavaScript at that statement, just spend some time trying to do indie game development. I&#x27;ve yet to encounter even a major version upgrade in a web dev tool that was as painful as even some patch upgrades were with Unity. Alternatives are vastly different. There&#x27;s very little code one can share between even two .NET-oriented game engines. Thus picking one of those alternatives effectively shuts you out of the larger job market.I used Unity heavily for about 5 years, after already having extensive, other software development experience. I very quickly grew a reputation with my peers for being very effective. Most of that effectiveness was just me writing tools to fix all the technical project management deficiencies in running a Unity project. Developing in Unity felt like the 6 months that I&#x27;ll never get back of my early developer life doing FoxPro development. Unity is like Crystal Reports. Unity is like Dreamweaver. All those things in enterprise dev were also shitty, take-it-or-leave-it siloed tools. Yet I only ever encountered them in large corporations being ran by pointy-haired managers. And one would certainly never start a personal project using one of them. reply ffhhttt 3 hours agorootparentprevIf it’s free you want have to pay anything?If you managed to get over 200k installs and 200k revenue you can just upgrade to pro and increase these limits to 1 million.I’m not a fan of these changes and the whole model seems too convoluted but the fees don’t seem to be that unreasonable.It seems they are actually even lower now than they were for a subset of users. reply gingerrr 10 hours agorootparentprevThe fee isn&#x27;t revenue-based, it&#x27;s install-based - and not based on hard numbers.Also, demo installs apparently count against that threshold https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;necrosofty&#x2F;status&#x2F;1701717971016790508 (their original reply https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;unity&#x2F;status&#x2F;1701689241456021607) reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentbased on revenue and installs. But any slightly decent mobile launch is going to have 200k installs (especially since Unity is STILL counting this per device, not per account).200k revenue is a higher mark, but far from a high mark. Especially for mobile games. those mobile packs can go up to $100 a pop, so if you got 2000 purchases, every free customer is costing you. reply robertjpayne 7 hours agorootparentprevThe fees don&#x27;t kick in until you get to a certain number of lifetime installs. Once you start paying the install fees the price per install drops quite rapidly too.The fees are also PER-GAME so one popular game wont cause your new game to cost a bunch immediately.It sounds way less bad than what people are making out to be (still not free, but should anything be?) reply wokwokwok 6 hours agorootparentMaybe?...but it&#x27;s not really very clear is it? They&#x27;ve done their best to make it simple, with multiple examples in the FAQ, but fundamentally, what they&#x27;re introducing is a very very complicated scheme.Multiple rates, multiple tiers.> All determinations, calculations of installs, and revenue related to the Unity Runtime Fee will be made by Unity in its sole discretion.Ouch, expensive. Don&#x27;t worry:> Qualifying customers may be eligible for credits on the Unity Runtime Fee based on the adoption of Unity services beyond the Editor, such as Unity Gaming Services or Unity LevelPlay.How much?> please contact your account manager for ad monetizationGot a problem with that? Not what you were expecting?> Unity may also waive all or any part of the Unity Runtime Fee in its sole discretion. As we implement this program, customers may see an invoice for an amount less than the full number of installs (or for $0) to help with the transition.> We recognize that users will have concerns about this and we will make available a process for them to submit their concerns to our fraud compliance team.Some amount. With some discounts. Based on your subscription, maybe? Or maybe you just get credits?...I mean, trivially, yeah, sure. Did you make more than $200000 in the last year? Probably not. So, you probably don&#x27;t care, and this doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with you.However, it&#x27;s really a bit shit to go from a predictable fee to an arbitrary rolling fee which you can&#x27;t easily predict; and you can&#x27;t, because despite all their examples, they&#x27;ve really failed hard at two things:1) How much will it cost?Not, you tell me later how much it will cost. Not, I get a surprise bill I can&#x27;t afford in a month. Me, without you input, calculate how much it will cost. How much will it cost? It&#x27;s pretty clear to me that the answer to this is who the heck knows?They decide what an install is.They decide how many installs you had.They decide how much of a discount to give you.They decide how much to charge you.They decide how to deal with any disputes.Does that sound cool to you? It doesn&#x27;t really seem cool to me.2) When will the rates &#x2F; terms &#x2F; values change?There&#x27;s no rules. They decide that too.Published a game today? Well, in a year maybe it&#x27;ll cost more than it costs now per install. Maybe not. Who knows?...It&#x27;s easy to say, &#x27;its no big deal&#x27;; but unpredictable pricing is very very bad. They&#x27;ve totally messed this up by making it too complicated and too bespoke. replylenkite 41 minutes agoparentprevWhat I am confused about is WHY is the CEO taking such a brain-dead executive decision on a stable, profit earning cash-cow. I mean - this is something that all high-level executives should have pointed out to Riccitiello as a very dumb idea. This isn&#x27;t rocket science or some financial black-magic wizkid deduction.This is basically committing hara-kiri on the product and looks to be effectively a company killing decision, unless there is something we are missing ? reply jbverschoor 2 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re forgot to first subtract VAT ;-) reply kevingadd 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s also catastrophic for services like Game Pass where the developer gets a flat fee regardless of how many people install the game. You can take a flat fee that seems reasonable based on an expectation of 100k installs, but then your game turns out to be a smash hit and it gets a million installs. Now you&#x27;re on the hook for a massive amount of money to Unity but the money you got is barely enough to cover it, if it covers it at all. reply 9dev 13 hours agorootparentThat situation sounds horrible, is that actually a thing? Why didn’t the industry protest these business models in the first place? reply marcosdumay 13 hours agorootparent> Why didn’t the industry protest these business models in the first place?What kind of protest do you expect to see? The change was announced just now. reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentprev>Why didn’t the industry protest these business models in the first place?they always have and always will. But revshare and ESPECIALLY residuals (tangential to this topic) are costs that the elite will fight to the grave to not give out.Indie devs are simply taking that gamble and unironically working for exposure. profits are razor thin in games and the market is fickle, so it&#x27;s much preferable to have a guaranteed minium than to negotiation revenue&#x2F;profit shares. if they become \"too successful\" they simply need to use that newfound exposure to negotiate a better deal next time. reply ffhhttt 3 hours agorootparentI’m sure Unity would prefer a revshare it’s just that it would be much harder and more expensive for them to enforce it (and even impossible at all outside of the developed countries and especially in China).And yeah, of course there would be much bigger backlash for their largest clients who probably prefer this new model. Which IMHO doesn’t seem entirely unreasonable if you’re on Pro (which you current have to be anyway if your company has over 200k revenue) reply kevingadd 13 hours agorootparentprevThe standard models are a % of revenue (i.e. Unreal Engine - fine for flat advance services like Game Pass), a flat licensing fee (old Unity, old Fmod, etc), or an ongoing fee per-title&#x2F;per-seat (current Unity, stuff like Wwise). This new fee-per-install model Unity is adopting is relatively rare.Game giveaways like Game Pass and Epic Games Store&#x27;s free games are generally based on a flat advance. I think PlayStation Plus&#x27;s free games are also a flat advance, but I can&#x27;t personally attest to it. There are tables out there of how much money Epic handed specific developers for their games and how many copies were installed that I think leaked during the Apple lawsuit, and in some cases developers earned much less than Unity&#x27;s 20 cents per copy due to the number of installs.Ideally this flat advance model would have been widely protested by the industry, but there is a huge audience of struggling indie game devs for whom a flat advance is a desperately needed lifeline, so it&#x27;s been successful. reply ffhhttt 3 hours agorootparentprev> is that actually a thing?Probably not, I’m not a fan of these changes but most people seem to really over exaggerating because they don’t understand how the new (very convoluted) pricing model works.The $.2 install fee (only for users living in “rich” countries) seems to be there just to incentive developers to upgrade their subscriptions to Pro which offers much higher revenue&#x2F;install limits and lower fees above them. reply philistine 10 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s true!

Which is concern in this case, just relatively a much smaller one. In any cases it seems to create some false incentives for fixed fee developers (unless the publisher agrees to pay the fee which would be pretty reasonable)IMHO so far the biggest issue with these pricing changes seems to be that they are way too complicated. It was unreasonable for them to expect that most people commenting online would bother looking at more than a single number (or would understand their current pricing model for that matter) reply Tommstein 11 hours agoparentprev> >Imagine releasing a game for 99 cents under the personal plan, where Steam takes 30% off the top for their platform fee, and then unity takes 20 cents per install, and now you&#x27;re making a maximum of 46 cents on the dollar.Out of curiosity, how does 0.99 * 0.7 - 0.2 = 0.493 come out to 46 cents? reply ffhhttt 4 hours agoparentprevYou’d only pay $0.2 for a subset of your users above 200k (installs in outside of the top ~15 richest countries are $0.02)Not that I’m a fan of those changes, but I’d bet the $0.2 fee is only there to encourage anyone affected to upgrade to Pro.The fact that most people will only see a single number and ignore the rest of the quite complicated pricing model says a lot about their marketing department… I mean what did they expect? reply bluescrn 14 hours agoprevThe decline of Unity is sad. Unity got so many things very right in their pre-IPO years. They made rapid prototyping and development of 3D games much easier than anything that came before. Being able to develop in C# was a huge win, especially for small teams and solo indie, and it made developing for multiple platforms easy, and took away a lot of the pain of native mobile development for Android&#x2F;iOS.But Unity has been declared dead&#x2F;dying before, I suspect it&#x27;ll have a long future ahead in some form even if it&#x27;s no longer the obvious go-to engine choice for indies and mobile developers.

After some initial confusion, which is largely the fact that I have more of a \"terminal\" kind of coding experience, or just building everything from scratch and thereby escaping learning a bunch of APIs, I started to realize the \"why\" of things like nodes and signals.Now I&#x27;m learning a lot and decided to stick with Godot for this project. My restarting phase is over and I&#x27;m moving forward now! I&#x27;ve been really enjoying it! The more I use it I really like it.A funny experience today, in part due to google being \"not terrible\" these days (as we say in French), was looking up internationalization. The first hit was a youtube video that was in Indonesian with no subtitles. But in two minutes the guy showed the file structure and whatnot and it&#x27;s super easy to use.Sometimes (always-ish?) the docs don&#x27;t provide examples, which I think would be helpful, and sometimes error messages could be different like, instead of \"wrong args on function\" it could tell you what the right ones are (like Rust), and I don&#x27;t know how to refactor other than manually which is different when you&#x27;re used to IntelliJ, but these are minor gripes.Overall this experience reminds me of what got me into coding with Flash when I was a whippersnapper, when I felt it was really fun. It feels like you can make whatever you can dream of happen.Then I read about Unity here today and how sell-outy they are acting it reminds me of another reason to continue using open source, or free software like Godot, or Reaper (free-ish) or Blender. We are starting to have really high quality options these days.I really hope Godot forges foreward and I hope the ethics continue to serve independent devs. And I really hope there&#x27;s less breaking changes than 3 -> 4, because it makes it kind of tricky to find references online when a lot of syntax changes. But hey I love python and I got into it in early v.3 days when most stuff was v.2 so I just started with the then bleedy version and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing with gdscript also using v.4 and so I guess I may just have good version timing when I start a language, that is if gdscript can become a little bit more backwards compatible at some point. But also, do what must be done. Sometimes things do need to change so I get that, but at a certain point in time there \"should\" be a baseline compatibility with self (IMHO) in software. Or to me, that is part of what makes software good.Also if I&#x27;m talking to one with such power, can we pretty please have list comprehensions? And also if the gods desire, can we have the format string from python? comprehended_list = [v for v in a_list if condition] comprehended_dict = {k:v for k,v in a_dict.items()} formatted_str = f\"typing stuff and then {any_typed_var}\" # This basically calls the var&#x27;s __str__() and then __repr__() as backupAnyway this post is not meant to sound complainy, or begging (for slightly more pythonicism) but more so as funny although I&#x27;m not. Badum-Ching, I&#x27;ll see myself out. Seriously though I think Godot is awesome. Please keep up the good work. Although I don&#x27;t understand the \"why\" of being like python and then not.

Factorio scales _so_ much better it&#x27;s absurd, but that&#x27;s really down to the quality & focus of the simulations being added by the game developer.

Hobbyist developers and smaller studios have very little time to sift through all of these complicated pricing situations.

Lots of big studios still do this. Once they run the math on how much licensing will cost them, they realize they can pay several inhouse devs to just make a bespoke engine for the same cost. And then further amortize that NRE cost over several titles.Will this licensing change hurt big studios in the short run? Unlikely. Could it hurt Unity in the long run once big studios realize they can just build exactly what they want inhouse for the same (or less) cost? Much more likely.As for small studios: small studios eventually become big studios.

But it&#x27;s a new fee to worry about, and one that gives Unity a lot of &#x27;monetization levers&#x27; to pull more aggressively further down the road (tweaking the fees&#x2F;thresholds)It&#x27;s also worth considering that Epic could change the UE pricing model significantly if their sole serious competitor starts to fade into irrelevance... reply KaoruAoiShiho 13 hours agorootparentUnity&#x27;s install fees don&#x27;t start until you hit 200k installs AND $200k revenue.

UE5 is free and then you pay a 5% royalty on gross revenues over $1m. This avoids a lot of the issues faced by indie developers with the new pricing model (having to pay for copies you give away, having to pay a flat fee that eats the profit margin of 99p games, needing to pay for a subscription up front etc.) reply KaoruAoiShiho 13 hours agorootparentUnreal is cheaper if you intend to stay within the free threshold of less than $1 million in sales, you can&#x27;t beat free. But if you have dreams of having a hit with more than $1million then I can&#x27;t find any scenarios where unreal is cheaper. Let me know if you can think of an example. And very very quickly unreal is more expensive.For example at $2 million in revenue unreal would cost $50k in royalties. Assuming a game with a price of $1 and 2 million installs unity is $10k in install fees. If your game is priced at $10, that&#x27;s just $1k in install fee vs the same $50k in fees to unreal. reply FrozenSynapse 57 minutes agorootparent>Assuming a game with a price of $1 and 2 million installs unity is $10k in install fees.Assuming Unity Pro ($2000 per seat per year) - first 1000000 installs are free, next 1000000 priced as follows: 0.15 * 100000 + 0.075 * 400000 + 0.03 * 500000 = 60000$ + Unity Pro for each seat. reply TheRealPomax 13 hours agoparentprevWhen your game engine&#x27;s license can bankrupt you just because some game platform owner like Epic decides to put your game on as the freebie-of-the-week, so that you now owe several million installs times 20 cents, you take Unreal over Unity even if it costs more (or you start looking into Godot or the like).This is how you kill a product. reply kevingadd 13 hours agoparentprevWith this new pricing model, it&#x27;s not cheaper than Unreal for indies since the sale price of an indie game is typically much lower, and you&#x27;re paying a fee per-install instead of a % of your revenue.As a comparison point Unreal also has another advantage, which is that they waive the unreal revenue cut for sales on Epic Games Store, so that subset of your revenue (if you release there) is yours to keep. Unity can&#x27;t offer any deal of that kind, all they can offer is discounts if you use stuff like their ads service (which is only appealing to F2P mobile game developers). reply dharma1 3 hours agoprevI&#x27;m surprised Apple is so married to Unity as the main creation tool for their Apple Vision &#x2F; MR stuff reply dang 13 hours agoprevRelated ongoing threads:Unity plan pricing and packaging updates - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37481344The New Godot Development Fund - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37481872 reply jrflowers 13 hours agoprev>I know one such developer who is stuck, who&#x27;s estimating this new scheme will cost them $100,000&#x2F;month on a free to play game, where their revenue isn&#x27;t guaranteed.We can assume that this would mean running the game at a loss, because the author didn’t say that. reply al2o3cr 11 hours agoparentnext [–]We can assume that this would mean running the game at a loss, because the author didn’t say that.A better assumption would be that they&#x27;re likely to clear the $100k&#x2F;mo, but as they said \"not guaranteed\" to do so.I suspect that if the author would have intensified the statement to \"they would go out of business with the new scheme\" if they were certain to lose money. reply jrflowers 10 hours agorootparent> A better assumption would be that they&#x27;re likely to clear the $100k&#x2F;mo, but as they said \"not guaranteed\" to do so.It’s funny that the vague $100k&#x2F;mo figure is meant to evoke some sort of response from the reader.

One of the greatest things Unity provided was a relatively easy pipeline to console releases, making ports more about platform quirks than full recoding.This heavily implies Unity was responsible for the advent of commercial game engines and game engines being licensed to third party developers, which is bullshit. This was done with many game engines long before Unity, such as iD Tech, RenderWare, the Build engine, GoldSrc, the Unreal engine, even the GameMaker Studio engine. reply kllrnohj 13 hours agoparentUnreal is the best comparison but the original statement isn&#x27;t entirely bullshit. What Unity did (as does Unreal) is make the game engine more as a platform as the goal in and of itself. That is, wide feature set, mostly stable APIs, incorporating developer feedback, deprecation&#x2F;evolution paths, etc... whereas other engines like idTech are more like a static library drop that you&#x27;re expected to then tweak & adjust to your needs. And those other engines were often developed for a specific game, and then sold as more of a \"why not?\" than being the goal of the development. idtech, for example, was consistently developed very specifically for the id flagship game of the generation, and it&#x27;s design decisions & tradeoffs reflected that. There&#x27;s a reason that as widely used as the idTech 3 was at the time, it also was nearly exclusively used with FPS games - the engine wasn&#x27;t a good fit for other things, and id wasn&#x27;t really investing in changing that.It&#x27;s not unlike the library vs. framework debate of the modern JS world. Unity & Unreal are more frameworks, while most other engines are libraries. reply causality0 13 hours agorootparentRenderWare is a better comparison than Unreal, since Unreal was developed first as an engine for a flagship game and only later licensed out.From Wikipedia on RenderWare: It was licensed over 200 times. The scope went towards an integrated middleware with low level APIs for rendering, physics, audio, AI all of which are extensible through plug-ins which also serve the official high-level API. The aim was to reduce the learning curve by also including service and support for licensees. With RenderWare Studio an integrated development environment including a debugger was included.[3] RenderWare themselves claimed a 70 % marketshare across studios that choose an external engine in 2003 reply kllrnohj 12 hours agorootparent> since Unreal was developed first as an engine for a flagship game and only later licensed out.I was more referring to \"modern\" Unreal. Like UE4 didn&#x27;t have any flagship game associated with it, at least not at launch.

Nobody is keeping track of never released games, specially those that didn&#x27;t really get started because so much work went on the &#x27;engine&#x27;.That said, there are some examples. Like Minecraft and Factorio. An existing engine might not have benefited those titles as much as they would a standard FPS game. They could be probably made using an existing engine, but the benefits might not be that apparent if you have to fight the engine and twist it to do what you want.Going to larger studios, Elite: Dangerous has its own engine too - could they have used, say, Unreal? Probably, but then they would not be able to use many features, like the Unreal&#x27;s terrain system, for their planetary landings and such(not without ugly hacks - or making it work like Starfield) and would likely have to code their own. If you are doing that, might as well skip the whole thing.I&#x27;ll still agree that in 95% of the cases there&#x27;s an existing engine that will handle most of a game&#x27;s use-cases. If one has access to the source code, this figure probably expands significantly. reply dgb23 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can appreciate the utility that unity provides without making false claims in the first paragraph.There are ofc many successful games that were not built on top of a third party engine.Including one of HN’s darlings Factorio for example. reply msla 13 hours agorootparentprev> There&#x27;s two types of game developers: those who finish and publish games and those who write their own game engine.Which is why that silly \"Quake\" thing never went anywhere.What was John Carmack thinking?

That era of pushing hardware to it&#x27;s limits is mostly history when it comes to games.These days, hardware is almost limitless* , the real scarce resource is person-hours of development time.(*Ok, not limitless, there&#x27;s still some people doing serious optimisation work on games.

Really crappy hackneyed plots which fall to pieces under the slightest scrutiny? I think Bethesda actually has a patent on that.

    "originBody": "Features Blog Community About Assets Download Learn Contribute ❤︎ Donate Introducing the new Godot Development Fund By: Emi 12 September 2023 News We are excited to introduce a major improvement in funding the development efforts of the Godot Engine – the Godot Development Fund! The goal for the Development Fund is to create a direct way for everyone to help us secure stable funding and ensure the longevity of the project. The Development Fund was soft-launched in July and already welcomed a lot of new and old sponsors, but we need to take it to the next level to sustain the current development pace, and increase it with new hires. Reducing platform fees, amplifying impact The Development Fund will make the Godot Project more sustainable and independent. This new platform lets us significantly reduce platform fees, and as a non-profit we do not charge VAT on donations, unlike a platform like Patreon does. So your contributions go directly towards the development and improvement of the Godot Engine itself. If you are currently supporting us through Patreon, we encourage you to switch to the Godot Development Fund to increase the effectiveness of your donations. Giving back to the community The support of the community is what keeps making it possible to reach new heights. With you, we can achieve even more! Every donation, no matter the size, helps us immensely! With your help we can hire more developers, create high quality demos, pay for hosting services and infrastructure, and make the best possible Godot Engine. The more funds we have, the more we can give back to you and the entire gamedev community. Future enhancements While this is a good, fully functioning starting point for the platform, we will keep improving the Developer Fund. In the future, the platform will give automated rewards, like a special Discord role, and you’ll be able to showcase your contribution level next to your username on our main platforms. Freedom and independence By relying more on recurring user-funded contributions and company sponsorships, we reduce our dependence on large one-time grants from corporations. This financial independence empowers us to prioritize the needs and interests of our community and the open source principles at the core of our projects. Your help ensures that we can create our own journey, uphold our core values, and continue to evolve the engine in ways that truly benefit you, the users.

    "commentBody": "The New Godot Development FundHacker NewspastloginThe New Godot Development Fund (godotengine.org) 193 points by Tomte 19 hours ago| hidepastfavorite53 comments appstorelottery 17 hours agoI tried Godot for an art-pipeline tool (batch animating models in code & converting to optimised gLTF on a huge scale) - I was amazed actually coming from a Unity background, in fact it was the only tool that could do the job reliably (even ThreeJS didn&#x27;t work - thanks GLTF standards ;-) reply firtoz 15 hours agoparentCan you go into a bit of detail please, or do you have a blog post about it perhaps? reply appstorelottery 15 hours agorootparentLol, no blog post. It was quite simple, various models were imported and parts on these models needed to be rotated over a number of frames, this constituted an animation which was then saved in GLTF format. There were 1000 animations with different rotation end points for a large number of models. The program was very simple to achieve the output and took me only a few hours to (a) understand how to do it in Godot and (b) write the code, which was remarkable to me. I&#x27;d tried for perhaps a day or two searching for solutions in ThreeJS - found bugs in the GLTF exporter, posted to the DRI, back and forth etc. Godot just worked. reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentinteresting. So in this case did you output your scene as a single gltf file, or were the assets split out individually? Or does this distinction not matter much for gltf to begin with? gltf sounds like a very interesting file format for games, but so much of popular modeling formats veer towards singular assets and leaving scene management to the engine.It&#x27;d be a dream if I could have a seemless two-way workflow throwing my blender scenes into an engine and vice versa, each tool able to mutate the scene file as needed. reply appstorelottery 3 hours agorootparentGLTF is a very interesting format, it&#x27;s a single file that can contain mesh, texture and animation data. In the case I wrote about single assets were created for each case, but it also could have been done combining all assets in a single file. The problem with GLTF (at least a few months ago) is that many importers or exporters in various libraries that roll their own aren&#x27;t 100% compliant to the standard. Thankfully the Chronos group has a validator - and I&#x27;ve been vocal in reporting bugs to the various vendors in our art-pipeline toolchain (nearly all of them had various edge cases where they weren&#x27;t 100% standards compliant). We were a case where we were using a lot of the functionality GLTF provides. Blender has good GLTF support and was a part of our pipeline as well - automated renders etc. reply firtoz 13 hours agorootparentprevThanks for sharing! reply matt3210 18 hours agoprevGreat timing! reply danielvaughn 16 hours agoparentHa, my thoughts exactly. reply blensor 14 hours agorootparentPerfect time to open up a Godot porting consulting business :) reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentOh what do we have here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w4games.com&#x2F; reply gwbas1c 13 hours agoprevSo now it looks like everyone is waiting for Godot.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Waiting_for_Godot reply manchmalscott 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not sure why this just got posted (to Godot&#x27;s website, not HN) today, I&#x27;ve been supporting them through their new fund for a month or two now already. reply Dudester230602 18 hours agoprevI hope they will drop the funny little language in favour of first-class C# support. reply danbolt 16 hours agoparentNo way! The funny little language rules! It&#x27;s a competitive advantage for Godot.GDScript integrates so nicely with the Node&#x2F;Resource refcount model. It fills the same niche that Unreal&#x27;s Blueprints do, which is great! When you&#x27;ve found something performance-critical, it&#x27;s not difficult to convert a GDScript node into a GDNative one.I feel like a lot of the \"GDScript, ick!\" comments tend to assume that the scripting language is trying to be Lua&#x2F;C#&#x2F;Python tacked onto a C++ codebase. It&#x27;s a lot more tightly-integrated with the runtime, and it makes organizing things a lot better in the long run. reply blensor 13 hours agorootparentThe funny thing is that if you are looking for some GDScript call into the engine it oftern supports exactly the functionality you need for your use case even though other more common use cases are not supported.It shows that the developers making it are also the ones using it for themselves. reply treyd 15 hours agorootparentprevThe Rust bindings (crates gdnative for 3.0 and gdext for 4.0) also are pretty great. I&#x27;ve only used them a bit so far but once I got the hang of it it works well. They don&#x27;t seem to teeth badly with Rust&#x27;s ownership semantics like some attempts at wrapping GTK struggled with. reply danbolt 14 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t used Rust professionally, but have often wondered if Rust&#x27;s RAII [1] meshes decently with the lifetime of a RefCounted in Godot.

Why can’t they use C++ like real game engines? Nobody will develop a proper game on this language.” reply pjmlp 16 hours agorootparentOnly those that having been around for the history of game development.Once upon a time the same was told about Basic, C and Pascal, all serious game development was Assembly.Then the same was told about C++, all serious game development was in C.Then the same was told about Java, and a couple of folks not paying attention got millionaires.Then ... reply eestrada 11 hours agorootparentYes, this.So many devs get caught up on which language is used. I have my pet languages that I prefer too, but at the end of the day a game engine is about creating games. So long as the language offered is reasonably usable and one can deliver a fun and engaging experience with it, the language bindings don&#x27;t matter much. Everything I&#x27;ve read about GDScript indicates that it fills the need, is fun to use, and generally gets out of the way so devs can focus on creating fun and engaging experiences.The only reason I see having C# support is critical is if a Dev is porting from another engine (i.e Unity) midway through development or if the dev&#x2F;studio has lots of boilerplate code or libraries already written for prior titles. If starting from scratch, I don&#x27;t see a good reason to stick with it. reply johnnyanmac 3 hours agorootparentprevI really hope Rust is the next iteration of this story. At least for the deep engine&#x2F;rendering code. You can have a scripting layer on top of that for designer iteration. reply mardifoufs 11 hours agorootparentprevSure but the problem with gdscript is not that it&#x27;s an abstraction or a high level language. It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a weird dsl that isn&#x27;t even really good at making games. I don&#x27;t mind DSLs when they actually enhance the domain they are created for, but in this case having a game engine language not having interfaces or traits is weird... reply Supermancho 16 hours agorootparentprevOne can still hope. reply gaogao 17 hours agoparentprevSeconding that Godot C# support is pretty alright and in motion, but also GDScript actually is rather nice for game jamming and quick prototyping. reply no_wizard 17 hours agoparentprevGodot 4.0 has C# support. They&#x27;re working on getting it up and moving for iOS and Android but it already works on Desktop reply jayd16 17 hours agorootparentI think the emphasis is on \"first-class\" support. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be able to really pull over Unity devs until C# mobile is nicely supported.I know every time I personally go to take a peek I see that C# support is still a good bit behind and decide to let it keep baking. I&#x27;m still very excited for it, though. reply pjmlp 16 hours agorootparentprevPartial support, there is nothing for game consoles and mobiles. reply elliotpage 17 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t see why there cannot be both? GDScript is perfectly useful. reply bastardoperator 17 hours agorootparentI prefer it. I&#x27;m not wasting a single second in C# until I have to. reply danielvaughn 16 hours agorootparentprevFor me it&#x27;s not whether it&#x27;s useful, it&#x27;s whether the tradeoffs are worth it. I assume GDScript has some unique features that make it especially useful in Godot development, but the disadvantage is that the skills aren&#x27;t transferrable to any other platform or environment. At least C# and C++ are applicable outside of the engines that use them. reply cweagans 15 hours agorootparentThe skills are transferrable enough. It&#x27;s Python with a little syntactic sugar for Godot-specific things.It&#x27;s an easy language to pick up for beginners and powerful enough for experienced devs. Kind of the sweet spot for game dev, IMO. reply interroboink 16 hours agorootparentprevI get what you&#x27;re saying, but a good chunk of transferable skills are not language-specific. Programming in a video game environment is going to impress some knowledge upon you that is generally useful, regardless of the language you use. reply ImprobableTruth 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause as is C# is very noticeably a second class citizen. Something like Godot 4.0&#x2F;4.1 missing C# support for android&#x2F;ios&#x2F;web shows that perfectly imo. reply EamonnMR 17 hours agoparentprevTheir funny little language is really close to Python so it&#x27;s tapping into a huge base of Python developers. reply noarchy 16 hours agorootparentIs there any background for why they chose to roll their own language, rather than harness Python or another, popular language? reply opencl 15 hours agorootparentThere is indeed a section about that in the docs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.godotengine.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;about&#x2F;faq.html#what-w... reply stuckinhell 17 hours agoparentprevThat would kill unity and make godot the preferred engine over night for large indie communities. reply squeaky-clean 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that will happen until Godot has an asset store with as much content as Unity. reply stuckinhell 15 hours agorootparentNot as hard as you think. just a few assets ported will be enough. - 3d player controller - dialogue system - vr kits - animation system in the style of mechanimThose are what the vast majority of indies buy beyond 3d assets where they can get elsewhere. reply 1123581321 17 hours agoparentprevI prototype Godot games with a small team that is less technical. They are able to handle (some) GDScript but not C#. I realize my use case is non-professional but I think it&#x27;s good that a more accessible language is the default option. reply marcosdumay 16 hours agoparentprevWhy do you want them to drop it? Why is it not enough that you can completely ignore it and write your games in C#? reply throwaway290 17 hours agoprevWasn&#x27;t there an organization by Godot&#x27;s main developer raising money for it already? reply riidom 17 hours agoparentYou mean W4 games?

All large numbers are large, but some are larger than others TIVADAR DANKA AND LEVI SEP 5, 2023 17 Share Today’s issue is a collaboration with Levi from DSBoost. He’s been one of my favorite explainers lately, and this post grew out of our recent discussion about the law of large numbers. Enjoy! The Palindrome is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Subscribe Large numbers != large numbers. Is 100 large? It depends. Do we compare it to 0.001 or 100000? Just like a lot of things in life, the term \"large\" is relative. In this post, we explain how large \"large\" is and prove why you are (probably) wrong about the LLN. The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) Let's run an experiment: we’ll roll a dice, just like we did in our introductory probability classes. We keep going until thousands of rolls, calculating the average of the tosses every time. (Keep in mind that the expected value of a dice roll is (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5.) Here are the first 10 rolls visualized. First, we rolled a 5, then we rolled a 1, and so on. Now let's see what happens if the number of experiments are increased to 100 and 1000: The \"larger\" our number is, the closer the sample averages are to the true expected value. The law of large numbers states precisely this: the sample average converges to the expected value. If we want to be more precise, there are two versions of the law of large numbers: weak and strong. The weak law states the following. In other words, the probability of the sample average X̅ₙ falling however far from the expected value μ converges to zero as the number of samples (n) grows. (We’ll take a deeper look at this later.) It seems that n = 1000 is \"large\" enough in the dice experiment. What about others? Let’s see another example! Consider this scratch ticket from Texas. The official webpage states: Over $829 million in total prizes in this game! Prizes start at $150! Chance to win $20,000,000 The ticket costs only $100! Sounds awesome, but we know math better than being fooled by these numbers. If we dig deep we can find the odds of winning. This is the price table from the official site. Knowing these we can easily calculate our chance and the expected values: the chance to win something is 26.34%, and the expected payoff is $75.28958 per ticket. (Not counting the $100 entry price.) It seems like it isn't worth buying the ticket for $100, since the expected value is only ~$75.3. Now let’s run a similar experiment to the dice example. We (hypothetically) buy more and more tickets, computing the average winnings meanwhile. The more tickets we buy, the closer we will be to the expected value ~$75. We are not so lucky with our first ten tickets. Let’s buy ninety more! With a hundred tickets we are getting closer, but we want something smooth on the long run around the orange line. Let’s do a bigger jump: increase n to 10,000. Now we have the smooth line, but it’s not what we expected at all! It hovers around $67, not the expected value. Let’s go further. With one million tickets something strange happened again: we got lucky, and the win pulled the average up. Now, we are even further away! It seems that 1,000,000 is still not a “large” number! Let’s go further! With ten million tickets we have several bigger wins that pull up the average, but the effect is getting smaller and smaller. Slowly, but we are getting close to the expected value. Now we finally have the expected smooth line hovering around the true average. Even though we could illustrate the law of large numbers with a thousand rolls in the first experiment, a million was barely enough in the second. Large numbers != large numbers. How can we explain the strange things that happened in the second experiment? Variance and the speed of convergence Let’s zoom into the (weak) law of large numbers! In essence, the probability P(|X̅ₙ - μ| > ε) measures the distance of the sample average from the true average (that is, the expected value) in a probabilistic sense. The smaller ε is, the larger the probabilistic distance. Mathematically speaking, the following holds. Now, the weak law of large numbers states that that is, the probabilistic distance gets as small as we want. Loosely speaking, this means that the sample average equals the true average plus a distribution that gets more and more concentrated to zero. In other terms, we have an asymptotic expansion in a distributional sense. The term o(1) indicates a distribution that gets more and more concentrated to zero as n grows. You might be familiar with the small and big O notation; it’s the same but with probability distributions. Does the weak law of large numbers and our asymptotic expansion explain what happens with our lottery tickets; that is, why do we need ten million samples to get reasonably close to the true average? The answer is a short and harsh no. We need a bigger boat asymptotic expansion. Our tool for that is going to be the central limit theorem, one of the most famous results in probability theory, formalizing why the sample averages resemble Gaussian distributions. The Central Limit Theorem Let’s dive straight into the deep waters and see the central limit theorem (CLT). It states that in a distributional sense, the √n-scaled centered sample averages converge to the standard normal distribution. (The notion “centered” means that we subtract the expected value.) To reiterate, convergence holds in a distributional sense. This is just the fancy way of saying that the cumulative distribution functions are pointwise convergent. (I know. Convergences in probability theory are quite convoluted.) Let’s unpack it: in terms of an asymptotic expansion, the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem imply that that is, the sample average equals the sum of 1) the expected value μ, 2) a scaled normal distribution, and 3) a distribution that vanishes faster, than 1/√n. That is, in terms of our asymptotic expansion, we have This can be written in a simpler form by amalgamating the constants into the normal distribution. More precisely, we have meaning that our asymptotic expansion takes the form In other words, for large n, the sample average approximately equals a normal distribution with variance σ²/n. The larger the n, the smaller the variance; the smaller the variance, the more the normal distribution is concentrated around the expected value μ. This finally answers our question: how large is that ominous number in the law of large numbers? It depends on the variance of our distribution! We can read from the asymptotic expansion that if the variance is 10x larger, we need roughly 10x the number of samples for the average to be as close as originally. This is because of the σ²/n term, where σ² represents the variance of our sample X₁, X₂, …, Xₙ, and n represents the number of samples. Let’s revisit the dice roll and the lottery examples. The variance of a dice roll is 35/12 ≈ 2.916, while the Texas lottery’s variance is approximately 157 000 000. This is a fifty million increase. This means that on average, we’ll need a fifty million times larger sample for the sample average to be as close to the true average as in the case of dice rolls. It’s important to note that as the law of large numbers is a probabilistic statement, claims like “we need fifty million more samples” are understood probabilistically. If we are lucky, the sample average might be very close to the true average after a few thousand samples. Conclusion The law of large numbers is frequently misunderstood. We use it quite often, but there is an important caveat. Although the sample average (almost surely) converges to the expected value, the speed of the convergence depends on the variance of our sample. The larger the variance, the slower the convergence. This is bad news for many practical applications. For instance, this is why the convergence of the Monte Carlo method is slow. In a real-life scenario, like gambling, you might even run out of money before you finally start winning. (Though most casino games have a negative expected value, so you’ll always lose on the long run.) The lesson? Always keep the speed of convergence in mind when applying the law of large numbers.

(thepalindrome.org) 157 points by sebg 21 hours ago| hidepastfavorite61 comments dragontamer 20 hours agoMy statistics class at high school level taught the following:The number of samples you need is very difficult to calculate correctly, requiring deep analysis of standard deviations and variances.But surprisingly, you can simply know you&#x27;ve reached large number status when over 10 items exist in each category.---------Ex: when doing a heads vs tails coin flip experiment, you likely have a large number once you have over 10 heads and over 10 tails. No matter how biased the coin is.Or in this &#x27;Lotto ticket&#x27; example, you have a large number of samples after gathering enough data to find over 10 Jackpot winners. reply jmount 19 hours agoparentVery cool rule.I think you can justify it by approximating each category as an independent Poisson distribution. Then for each such processes the variance equals the mean. So once you have 10 successes in a bin, you have evidence of a probably good estimate for the arrival rate of that category. The book \"The Probabilistic Method\" calls a related idea \"the Poisson paradigm.\"(10 a nice round number where the standard deviation is below the mean) reply jmount 13 hours agorootparentSmall proviso: this is only true for a reasonable number of categories (or you run into repeated experiment problems). reply hgsgm 8 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s a reasonable number of categories? 10? reply dredmorbius 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s defined by the phenomenon you&#x27;re investigating.In the case of six-sided dice, there are precisely six categories, ideally with even odds of occurrence. With the lottery jackpot given, there are eight categories, with highly asymmetric probabilities and values.In real-world cases, you might be trying to distinguish two cases (treatment and control in a medical experiment), between multiple particles or isotopes (say, with physics or chemistry), amongst different political divisions (countries, states or provinces, counties, cities, or other), between political parties or candidates (which raises interesting questions over which and&#x2F;or how many to include in consideration, in turn dependent on voting procedures, overall popularity, and impacts of non-winning candidates or parties on others), on multiple products, or on different behavioural characteristics in some domain (e.g., highly-active, occasionally-active, and lurking participants in online fora).There are times when categories are well and unambiguously defined. Others in which where you choose to draw divisions (say, in generational groups, or wealth or income brackets) is highly arbitrary. Even where there are a large number of potential categories, choosing some limited number for specific analysis (2, 3, 5, 10, etc.) and lumping the remaining into \"other\" may provide clearer insights and fewer distractions than choosing a large number of divisions.[1] In other cases, a very small number of individuals may account for an overwhelming majority of activity or outcome. I&#x27;d strongly argue that in this case, the analysis might be somewhat poorly focused, and that activities and outcomes rather than individuals are of greater interest.[2]What&#x27;s key is to match your sampling and sample sizes to the phenomenon being studied.________________________________Notes:1. Power law distribution &#x2F; Zipf functions often mean that a very small number of participants has highly disproportionate impact or significance.2. This is often the flip side of power law distributions. If we look at all book titles, there are a huge number of individual items to consider; there are roughly 300k annual English-language \"traditional\" publications, and over 1 million \"nontraditional\" (self-published, or publish-on-demand) titles. But if your focus is instead titles by percentage of revenue or number of sales, a top-n analysis (5, 10, 20, etc.) often captures much of the activity, frequently well over half.

In retrospect it&#x27;s funny for a psychologist to say that, but I guess it was because he was from the more empirically minded behaviorist cognitive school and from time to time they have done actual rigorous experiments[1] (in rodents).[1] For example as described by Feynman in Cargo Cult Science. reply lisper 15 hours agorootparentThe problem is two-fold:1. p=0.05 means that one result in 20 is going to be the result of chance.2. It&#x27;s generally pretty easy (especially in psychology) to do 20 experiments, cherry-pick -- and publish! -- the p=0.05 result, and throw away the others.The result is that published p=0.05 results are much more likely than 1 in 20 to be the result of chance. reply Viliam1234 12 hours agorootparent> p=0.05 means that one result in 20 is going to be the result of chance.You made the same mistake most people make here: you turned the arrow of the implication. It is not \"successful experiment implies chance (probability 5%)\" but \"chance implies successful experiment (probability 5%)\".What does that mean in practice? Imagine a hypothetical scientist that is fundamentally confused about something important, so all hypotheses they generate are false. Yet, using p=0.05, 5% of those hypotheses will be \"confirmed experimentally\". In that case, it is not 5% of the \"experimentally confirmed\" hypotheses that are wrong -- it is full 100%. Even without any cherry-picking.The problem is not that p=0.05 is too high. The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t actually mean what most people believe it means. reply lisper 11 hours agorootparentI think we&#x27;re actually in violent agreement here, but I just wasn&#x27;t precise enough. Let me try again: p=0.05 means that one POSITIVE result in 20 is going to be the result of chance and not causalityIn other words: if I have some kind of intervention or treatment, and that intervention or treatment produces some result in a test group relative to a control group with p=0.05, then the odds of getting that result simply by chance and not because the treatment or intervention actually had an effect are 5%.The practical effect of this is that there are two different ways of getting a p=0.05 result:1. Find a treatment or intervention that actually works or2. Test ~20 different (useless) interventions. Or test one useless intervention ~20 times.A single p=0.05 result in isolation is useless because there is no way to know which of the two methods produced it.This is why replication is so important. The odds of getting a p=0.05 result by chance is 5%. But the odds of getting TWO of them in sequential trials is 0.25%, and the odds of a positive result being the result of pure chance decrease exponentially with each subsequent replication. reply thaumasiotes 9 hours agorootparent> Let me try again:> p=0.05 means that one POSITIVE result in 20 is going to be the result of chance and not causalityNo, you still didn&#x27;t get it. In the example above, a full 100% of positive results, 20 out of every 20, are the result of chance and not causality.Your followup discussion is better, but your statement at the top doesn&#x27;t work.(Note also that there is an interaction between p-threshold and sample size which guarantees that, if you&#x27;re investigating an effect that your sample size is not large enough to detect, any statistically significant result that you get will be several times stronger than the actual effect. They&#x27;re also quite likely to have the wrong sign.) reply lisper 8 hours agorootparent> No, you still didn&#x27;t get it. In the example above, a full 100% of positive results, 20 out of every 20, are the result of chance and not causality.Yep, you&#x27;re right. I do think I understand this, but rendering it into words is turning out to be surprisingly challenging.Let me try this one more time: p=0.05 means that there is a 5% chance that any one particular positive result is due to chance. If you test a false hypothesis repeatedly, or test multiple false hypotheses, then 5% of the time you will get false positives (at p=0.05).However...> Imagine a hypothetical scientist that is fundamentally confused about something important, so all hypotheses they generate are false. Yet, using p=0.05, 5% of those hypotheses will be \"confirmed experimentally\". In that case, it is not 5% of the \"experimentally confirmed\" hypotheses that are wrong -- it is full 100%.This is not wrong, but it&#x27;s a little misleading because you are presuming that all of the hypotheses being tested are false. If we&#x27;re testing a hypothesis it&#x27;s generally because we don&#x27;t know whether or not it&#x27;s true; we&#x27;re trying to find out. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to think of a positive result not as \"confirmed experimentally\" but rather as \"not ruled out by this particular experimental result\". It is only after failing to rule something out by multiple experiments that we can start to call it \"confirmed\". And nothing is ever 100% confirmed -- at best it is \"not ruled out by the evidence so far\". reply thaumasiotes 2 hours agorootparent> I do think I understand this, but rendering it into words is turning out to be surprisingly challenging.A p-value of .05 means that, under the assumption that the null hypothesis you specified is true, you just observed a result which lies at the 5th percentile of the outcome space, sorted along some metric (usually \"extremity of outcome\"). That is to say, out of all possible outcomes, only 5% of them are as \"extreme\" as, or more \"extreme\" than, the outcome you observed.It doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the odds that any result is due to chance. It tells you how often the null hypothesis gives you a result that is \"similar\", by some definition, to the result you observed. reply hgsgm 8 hours agorootparentprevYou can&#x27;t simply ignore the base rate, even if you don&#x27;t know it.In a purely random world, 5% of experiments are false positives, at p=0.05. None are true positives.In a well ordered world with brilliant hypotheses, there are no false positives.If more than 5% of experiments show positive results at p=0.05, some of them are probably true, so you can try to replicate them with lower p.p=0.05 is a filter for \"worth trying to replicate\" (but even that is modulated by cost of replication vs value of result).The crisis in science is largely that people confuse \"publishable\" with \"probably true\". Anything \"probably better then random guessing\" is publishable to help other researchers, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s probably true. reply lisper 8 hours agorootparent> p=0.05 is a filter for \"worth trying to replicate\"Yes, I think that is an excellent way to put it.> The crisis in science is largely that people confuse \"publishable\" with \"probably true\".I would put it slightly differently: people conflate \"published in a top-tier peer-reviewed journal\" with \"true beyond reasonable dispute\". They also conflate \"not published in a top-tier peer-reviewed journal\" with \"almost certainly false.\"But I think we&#x27;re in substantial agreement here. replymajormajor 9 hours agorootparentprev> What does that mean in practice?

I was an academic researcher for 15 years -- in a STEM field, not psychology, and even that was sufficiently screwed up to make me change my career. I have advocated for science and the scientific method for decades. It&#x27;s not science that&#x27;s broken, it&#x27;s the academic peer-review system, which is essentially unchanged since it was invented in the 19th century. That is what needs to change.

Rather, it is that outside of STEM, very, very few people truly understand hypothesis testing.At least in my experience, even basic concepts, as \"falsify the null-hypothesis\" is surprisingly hard, even with presumably intelligent people, such as MD&#x27;s in PHd programmes.They will still tend to believe that a \"significant\" result is proof of an effect, and often even believe it proves that the effect is causal with the direction they prefer.At some point, stats just becomes a set of arcane conjurations for an entire field. At that point, the field as a whole tends to lose their ability to follow the scientific method and turns into something resembling a cult or clergy. reply lisper 4 hours agorootparentFWIW, I got through a Ph.D. program in CS without ever having to take a stats course. I took probability theory, which is related, but not the same thing. I had to figure out stats on my own. So yes, I think you&#x27;re absolutely right, but it&#x27;s not just \"outside of STEM\" -- sometimes it&#x27;s inside of STEM too. reply thaumasiotes 9 hours agorootparentprev> and double-check to make sure that their results are normally distributed across the p-values associated with their studiesWhat is the distribution of a set of results over a set of p-values?If you mean that you should check to make sure that the p-values themselves are normally distributed... wouldn&#x27;t that be wrong? Assuming all hypotheses are false, p-values should be uniformly distributed. Assuming some hypotheses can sometimes be true, there&#x27;s not a lot you can say about the appropriate distribution of p-values - it would depend on how often hypotheses are correct, and how strong the effects are. reply User23 14 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a professor of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard who only has a high school diploma[1].

So, hand-waving a bit, let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s true that over a large number of trials you would expect the average to converge to 0. You just tossed a coin and got heads, so you&#x27;re at +1. The average of (1 + 0*n)&#x2F;(n+1) still goes to 0 as n grows bigger and bigger.That skips over the distinction between \"average\" and \"probability distribution\", but those are nuances are probably better left for a proof of the central limit theorem. reply ineptech 14 hours agoparentprev\"The expected value of a random variable with a finite number of outcomes is a weighted average of all possible outcomes.\" -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Expected_value reply alexb_ 14 hours agorootparentThat makes sense, I was always thinking of it as \"Given an infinite number of trials...\" reply tnecniv 7 hours agorootparentThat would be the frequentist interpretation. A Bayesian would say that probability is to be interpreted in belief that an outcome will occur. Neither is really right or wrong, it depends on what you&#x27;re modeling. If we’re analyzing some kind of heavily repeated task (e.g., a sordid night of us glued to the blackjack table where we play a lot of hands or data transmission over a noisy cable), a frequentist interpretation might feel more sense. However if you’re talking about the probability of a candidate winning an election, you could take a Bayesian view where the probability asserts a confidence in an outcome. A radical frequentist would take umbrage with an event that only happens once. However, I suppose, depending on your election rules and model (e.g., a direct democracy), you could interpret the election winner in a frequentist manner: the probability of winning is the rate at which people vote for the candidate. For a more complicated system I’m not sure the frequentist view is as easily justified.However to answer your question more directly, the expected value is just another name for the average or mean of a random variable. In this case, the variable is your profit. Assume we’re betting a dollar per toss on coin flips and I win if it’s heads (everyone knows heads always wins, right?). The expected value is probability of heads * 1 - probability of tails * 1. If the coin is fair, the probabilities are the same so the expected value is zero.Aside: sequences of random variables that are “fair bets” are called martingales and are incredibly useful. It’s a fair bet because, given all prior knowledge of the value of the variable thus far, the expected value of the next value you witness is the current value of the variable. You could imagine looking at a history of stock values. Given all that information, it’s a martingale (and thus a fair bet) if given that information your expected profit from investing is 0. reply ineptech 13 hours agorootparentprevWhether&#x2F;when its better to think in terms of \"X has a 37% chance of happening in a single trial\" vs \"If you ran a lot of trials, X would happen in 37% of them\" is kind of a fraught topic that I can&#x27;t say much about, but you might find this interesting: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Probability_interpretations reply yafbum 19 hours agoprevStats class role of thumb: if you need to calculate the relative probability of two outcomes, you can get to within about 10% once you get 100 samples of each outcome (so, need more samples overall if the distribution is skewed). reply gear54rus 19 hours agoparentIts interesting that even in this thread the 2 answers differ by an order of magnitude lol reply Keirmot 1 hour agorootparentI think both answers are referencing the Central Limit Theorem, that states [simplified] that once you get over 30 samples for each independent variable, you will get a normal distribution. reply koolba 18 hours agorootparentprevJust apply it recursively.

Almost always, if you have at least 10 of every category, you can already discover every interesting thing that a rule of thumb will allow. And you probably could go with less. But if you want precision, you can&#x27;t get it with rules of thumb. reply CaptainNegative 17 hours agorootparentThe dependence on sample size is not exponential, it&#x27;s sublinear. The heuristic rate of convergence to keep in mind is the square root of the sample size, i.e. getting 10x more samples shrinks the margin of error (in a multiplicative sense) by sqrt(10) ≈ 3ish.The exponential bit applies to the probability densities as a function of the bounds themselves, i.e. how likely you are to fall x units away from the mean typically decreases exponentially with (some polynomial in) x.Of course, this is all assuming a whole bunch of standard conditions on the data you&#x27;re looking at (independence, identically distributed, bounded variance, etc.) and may not hold if these are violated. replyderbOac 17 hours agoprevThe biggest problem for real processes is knowing whether in fact x ~ i.i.d., with regard to time as well as individual observations. reply blt 4 hours agoprevIn learning theory there is focus on \"non-asymptotic\" results.

Actually 42 plus or minus.) reply crdrost 12 hours agoprevIf the blog author is reading, some notes for improvement:- Your odds calculation is likely wrong. You assumed from the word \"odds\" that \"odds ratio\" was meant, (Odds=3 meaning \"odds 3:1 against\" corresponding to p=25%) but the phrase is \"approximate odds 1 in X\" (Odds=3 meaning \"odds of 1 in 3 to win\" meaning 33%) and recalculating results in the remarkably exact expected value of $80 which seems intentional?- You phrase things in terms of variances, people will think more in terms of standard deviations. So 3.5 ± 1.7 vs $80 ± $12,526.- Note that you try to make a direct comparison between those two but the two are in fact incomparable. The most direct comparison might be to subtract 1 from the die roll and multiply by $32, so that you have a 1&#x2F;6 chance of winning $0, 1&#x2F;6 of winning $32, ... 1&#x2F;6 of winning $160. So then we have $80 ± $55 vs $80 ± $12,526. Then instead of saying you&#x27;d need 50 million more lottery tickets you&#x27;d actually say you need about 50 thousand more. This is closer to the \"right ballpark\" where you can tell that the whole lottery is expected to sell about 10,200,000 tickets on a good day.- But where an article like this should really go is, \"what are you using the numbers for?\". In the case of the Texas lottery this is actually a strong constraint, they have to make sure that they make a \"profit\" (like, it&#x27;s not a real profit, it probably goes to schools or something) on most lotteries, so you&#x27;re actually trying to ensure that 5 sigma or so is less than the bias. So you&#x27;ve got a competition between $20 · n and 5 · $12,526 · √(n), or √(n) = 12526&#x2F;4, n = 9.8 million. So that&#x27;s what the Texas Lottery is targeting, right? So then we would calculate that the equivalent number of people that should play in the \"roll a die linear lottery\" we&#x27;ve constructed is 187, call it an even 200, if 200 people pay $100 for a lottery ticket on the linear lottery then we can pretty much always pay out even on a really bad day.- So the 50,000x number that is actually correct is basically just saying that we can run a much smaller lottery, 50,000 times smaller, with that payoff structure. And there&#x27;s something nice about phrasing it this way.- To really get \"law of large numbers\" we should actually probably be looking at how much these distributions deviate from Gaussian, rather than complaining that the Gaussian is too wide? You can account for a wide Gaussian in a number of ways. But probably we want to take the cube root of the 3d cumulant, for example, try to argue when it \"vanishes\"? Except given the symmetry the 3rd cumulant for the die is probably 0 so you might need to go out to the 4th cumulant for the die -- and this might give a better explanation for the die converging more rapidly in \"shape\" to the mean, it doesn&#x27;t just come close faster, it also becomes a Gaussian significantly faster because the payoff structure is symmetric about the mean. reply causality0 13 hours agoprev [–] Am I the only one unreasonably annoyed that his graphs don&#x27;t match the description of his rolls? replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Over 1,000 subscribers Subscribe Continue reading Sign in Simulating History with ChatGPT The Case for LLMs as Hallucination Engines BENJAMIN BREEN SEP 12, 2023 15 14 Share Since January of 2023, I’ve been experimenting with using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as a teaching tool in my history classes at UC Santa Cruz. I’ve been thinking about the implications of AI in teaching since I first began using GPT-2 back in 2019. I have also been following along avidly as my wife Roya Pakzad works on testing the human rights impacts of AI systems (Roya was a consultant for OpenAI in 2022, where she served on the “red team” for adversarial testing of a pre-release version of GPT-4; you can read her account of that work here). What follows are some thoughts about what I believe to be a novel use of LLMs: using them to simulate interactive historical settings as part of a university assignment. The results of these early trials are why I am personally much more excited about generative AI than many of my colleagues — though I also concede that in the short term, cheating will be a major problem. In the second half of this post, I go into detail about what exactly I mean by “simulating history.” I am under no illusions that these simulations are accurate: they are littered with confidently-stated falsehoods and hallucinations. Sometimes, though, hallucinations can be a feature, not a bug. At the end of this post, I include links to detailed prompts which you can use to simulate different historical settings, or customize to use with Claude or ChatGPT (the free versions of both work about equally well, though GPT-4 works best). I invite readers to share their experiences in the comments. Subscribe Teaching will get weirder — and that’s probably a good thing In the long term, I suspect that LLMs will have a significant positive impact on higher education. Specifically, I believe they will elevate the importance of the humanities. If this happens, it will be a shocking twist. We’ve been hearing for over a decade now that the humanities are in crisis. When faced with raw data about declining enrollments and majors like this and this, it is difficult not to agree. From the perspective of a few years ago, then, the advent of a new wave of powerful AI tools would be expected to tip the balance of power, funding, and enrollment in higher education even further toward STEM and away from the humanities. But the thing is: LLMs are deeply, inherently textual. And they are reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes. What do I mean by that? One of the hallmarks of training in history is learning how to think about a given text at increasingly higher levels of abstraction. We teach students how to analyze the genre, cultural context, assumptions, and affordances of a primary source — the unspoken limits that shaped how, why, and for whom it was created, and what content it contains. For example, imagine a high school student who is asked to analyze the first letter of Hernán Cortés to the Emperor Charles V. The student might dutifully paraphrase the conquistador’s account of the Aztec capital of Tenochititlan — including this famously jarring description of Aztec temples as “mosques” (mezquitas). A history major would be able to go further. Why did Cortés use this confusing term? Cortés was born during the final decade of the Reconquista. For this reason, he was intimately acquainted with non-Christian religiosity — but only in the context of Muslim religiosity. A large religious structure that was not a Christian church was for him, almost by default, a mosque — even when it was actually the Templo Mayor. Likewise, a history major would be able to recognize that Cortés was writing within a genre — an ambitious subject’s letter to a monarch — which tends toward self-promotion. And they would be able to fact check Cortés’ claims against those of other primary and secondary sources. Perhaps they would conduct some exploratory Google searches along the lines of “primary source conquest of Mexico” or “Aztec account of Cortés.” They might also look around for recent secondary sources by searching library catalogues and the footnotes on Cortés’ Wikipedia page and discover Matthew Restall’s revisionist take on the subject. When history majors encounter LLMs, then, they are already trained to recognize some of the by-now-familiar pitfalls of services like ChatGPT — such as factual inaccuracies — and to address them via skills like fact-checking, analyzing genre and audience, or reading “around” a topic by searching in related sources. Importantly, too, because so many sources are out of copyright and available in multilingual editions on Wikipedia and Wikisource, language models are abundantly trained on historical primary sources in hundreds of different languages.1 For these reasons, I agree with Tyler Cowen that language models are specifically a good thing for historians — but I would go further and say that they are also specifically a good thing for history majors. On the other hand, I foresee major problems for history teachers and other educators in the short-term. Ted Underwood is right: we professors are going to have to fundamentally rethink many of our assignments. I’ve seen many people dismiss ChatGPT as an essay writing tool because simply plugging in a prompt from an assignment results in a weak piece of writing. But LLMs are all about iterative feedback, and experimenting with well-known prompting methods dramatically improves results. Here’s an example from one of my own past classes. When given a question from my “Early Modern Europe” survey about how Benvenuto Cellini’s Autobiography illustrates new ways of thinking about identity during the early modern period, GPT-4 can produce dramatically different results depending on the prompt. Compare this short and scattered effort (which I’d likely give a D- or F) to this pretty decent attempt, which would get around a B+. The difference is the use of roleplaying. In the latter, I tell ChatGPT that it is “an advanced language model that has been trained on prize-winning graduate and undergraduate essays.” I also ask it to start with self-reflection and an outline (which is basically replicating the process a real person would take). As students get better at finessing prompts in this way, cheating on take-home writing assignments will get far easier. But this same power of asking LLMs to role-play as specialized versions of themselves also makes them hugely interesting as educational tools in the classroom — and, specifically, as history simulators. Ea-nāṣir finally gets his due What happens if we tell ChatGPT that it is an advanced history simulator specifically trained to reconstruct historical settings in university classrooms? This does: This is a trial run for a scenario I’m developing for a world history class I’ll be teaching this fall. I’m envisioning an assignment in which my students will simulate the experience of being sold flawed copper by Ea-nāṣir, a real-life shady copper merchant in Mesopotamia circa 1750 BCE (one who, in recent years, has unexpectedly become a meme online). Crucially, this is not just about role-playing as an angry customer of Ea-nāṣir — or as the man himself, which is also an option. As illuminating as the simulations can be, the real benefit of the assignment is in what follows. First, students will print out and annotate the transcript of their simulation (which runs for twenty “turns,” or conversational beats) and carefully read through it with red pens to spot potential factual errors. They will then conduct their own research to correct those errors. They’ll then write their findings up as bullet points and feed this back into ChatGPT in a new, individualized and hopefully improved version of the prompt that they develop themselves. This doesn’t just teach them historical research and fact-checking — it also helps them develop skills for working directly with generative AI that I suspect will be valuable in future job markets. Finally, the students share their findings with groups of classmates, then write reflection papers that include an account of what they talked about in their groups (which, among other things, makes it difficult to cheat by asking ChatGPT to write the whole thing). Lessons from “Medieval Plague Simulator” Back in April of 2023, I tried out a more elaborate assignment in which students in my medieval history class simulated a day in the life as characters during the height of the Bubonic Plague epidemic in 1348, living in one of three places: Damascus, Paris, or Pistoia, an Italian city-state. Below are links to the relevant Google Docs. I invite you to try it out yourself. Just click on one of these links, then copy and paste the highlighted prompt into ChatGPT and go from there. (If ChatGPT screws something up, just click “regenerate results” until you get a better response.) Beneath each prompt, I’ve included a transcript of a “trial run” of the simulation so you can see how it works. • Medieval Plague Simulator: Damascus Edition 🕌📿 You are a traveler passing through Damascus during the height of plague, staying at a crowded caravanserai... and you wake up with a scratchy throat. • Medieval Plague Simulator: Parisian Quack Edition ⚗ You are a somewhat disreputable apothecary — a seller of cures and possibly counterfeit drugs known as a “quack” — trying to survive and profit off the 1348 plague epidemic in Paris. • Medieval Plague Simulator: Pistoia Edition 🎭📜 You are an upstanding city councilor in the medieval Italian city-state of Pistoia doing your best to navigate between the city's different interest groups, guilds, and wealthy families to negotiate a civic response to the plague. Students were asked to compare their simulated experience to real historical accounts of the plague in each of those three places. They were then asked to write a paper with the following guidelines: This 3-4 page paper should focus on analyzing and reflecting on the accuracy of the simulation. In your paper, you should consider what the simulation got right and wrong, what it emphasized and neglected, and what you learned from fact-checking it. To get started, take notes during the simulation itself (what terms or words are used you don't recognize? What strikes you as anachronistic? What questions do you have?). Afterward, consider how the simulation represented the historical time period and how it portrayed different aspects of daily life. Think about the virtual characters and environments generated by the simulation. Then begin researching the actual setting and some of the terms you wrote down in your notes via JSTOR, Google Scholar etc. When writing your reflection paper, focus on critical thinking and analysis rather than simply summarizing your experience with the simulation. Be sure to cite at least four scholarly secondary sources relating to your chosen scenario as you reflect on the what the simulation got right and wrong. Earlier in the same class, I had students simulate life as a medieval peasant. This was more of a trial-run, without an accompanying assignment, but you can see that prompt and try it out yourself here. This was an interesting learning experience for me because it was the first time I experimented with asking ChatGPT to randomize the location (it really likes dropping you in medieval England or France, surprisingly often as a peasant girl named Isabelle). In both cases, I was blown away by student engagement and creativity. Here’s a brief list of what some of my students did in their medieval simulations: • ran away from home to become an apprentice to a traveling spice merchant • developed various treatments for the plague, some historically accurate (like theriac) others much less so (like vaccines) • negotiated complex legal settlements between the warring guilds of Pistoia • fled to the forest and became an itinerant hermit • attempt to purchase “dragons blood,” a genuine medieval and early modern remedy, to cure their fast-worsening plague • made heroic efforts as an Italian physician named Guilbert to stop the spread of plague with perfume • became leaders of both successful and unsuccessful peasant revolts Student engagement in the spring quarter, when I began these trials, was unlike anything I’ve seen. The first time I tested the idea out informally (asking students to simulate their home town via an up-ended general purpose simulation prompt) I realized that we had gone 5 minutes past the end of class without anyone noticing! An unexpected positive of this assignment was that it particularly seemed to engage students who had previously been sitting in the back rows looking bored. Engaging students like this is a perennial issue for teachers, and not one I’ve found easy to solve. Randomly calling on people in the back can often make it worse by ramping up anxiety. The medieval manor and plague simulator assignments worked wonders in terms of sparking enthusiasm among previously disengaged students. That said, there were some issues with my first iteration of the simulation. You can get a sense of them in my student feedback from that class. There was a lot of praise for the simulation idea, which I called “History Lens” because it provides a distorted perspective on the past: \"The plague simulation History Lens assignment was a great project that allowed us to experience what life was like during the time.” \"Big big fan of the plague simulator/history lens game, I think that has a ton of potential and I hope I see it in more classes in the future.\" “The instructor helped me feel engaged with the course very frequently because he used assignments and activities to allow the class to not just learn about history but to let us see through the eyes of the people during that time. An example of this was the ChatGPT History Lens assignment.” But also this: “For the plague assignment it was rather absurd to rate chatgpt on historical accuracy. Someone said their simulation contained a talking rat.” Not ideal! Going forward, my plan is to develop my own web app which will allow users to create historical simulations on a dedicated platform using the APIs of both Anthropic’s Claude and GPT-4. Both of these options have or will have larger context windows which will allow the AI to be fed far more detailed primary sources. My hope is that this, plus better directions and rules, will help with what we might call the “talking rat problem”: when the simulation is so blatantly wrong that an assignment built around fact-checking and contextualizing it just becomes an exercise in absurdity. I will be writing a writing a sequel to this post in October with the results of my new and improved history simulation assignment and prompts, and some further thoughts on LLMs in education (including the cheating issue). In the meantime, I would be thrilled if to get a community going of other people interested in this. Please try the prompts I’ve linked above (or the others available below) and let me know in the comments how it went. If you are doing anything similar or are interested in implementing this in your classroom, please let me know. I’d love to compare notes.

I always welcome comments, but especially so this for this — really curious to see what people think of this idea and what scenarios they come up with. 1 This might explain why ChatGPT is so much worse at writing modern poetry (which is tightly restricted by copyright law) than it is at writing in older styles. For instance, it seems to me to be much better at writing a Samuel Johnson essay about kangaroos than it is at writing a modernist poem about same. 2 This one is different from the others — whereas the other settings all use the same “base” historical simulation prompt, I experimented with customizing the Fall of the Ming simulation in a couple ways, making it multiple choice and adding a “political intrigue minigame” that involves displays of rhetoric and scholarly learning. I think that customizing a setting in this way is probably the most effective way forward for using this in the classroom, especially when it’s possible to add tens of thousands of words of background information about the setting to assist with world-building.

No, you've simply run into the RLHF mode collapse problem (https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA/mysteries-of-mode-collapse?commentId=tHhsnntni7WHFzR3x) interacting with byte-pair encoding (https://gwern.net/gpt-3#bpes). A GPT doesn't genuinely understand phonetics due to the preprocessing of the data destroying individual-letter information and replacing them with large half-word-sized chunks, and then during RLHF, it avoids writing anything which doesn't make use of the memorized pairs of rhymes because it's unsure what rhyming or nonrhyming poetry looks like. (If you are skeptical, try asking ChatGPT this simple prompt: \"Write a nonrhyming poem.\" a dozen times and count how many times it actually does so rather than rhyming. Last time I checked, the success rate was still well under 20%.) The Ea-Nasir screenshot also shows the effects of the RLHF, I suspect. My advice would be to minimize use of GPT in favor of Claude for all historical scenarios involving anything less wholesome than _Barney & Friends_. While the model is not as good, the RLAIF of Claude seems to be a good deal less indiscriminate & crippling.

I&#x27;ve been speculating along similar lines, and it&#x27;s great to see this fleshed out.I think \"correct the errors in this ChatGPT essay\" is a short-term viable homework exercise, but those errors might be gone in GPT-5 so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s long-term viable. Soon the LLM will just produce perfect essays at college level and there won&#x27;t be hallucinations for the student to correct.However, the \"simulate the historical environment\" task is great and I think it has long-term potential. I think it can be taken further; rather than \"spot the errors that ChatGPT made\", you could flip the script and make it \"survive 20 turns of conversation without making a historical error\", so you&#x27;d need to know things like local traditions, perhaps the geography of the ancient settlement you&#x27;re studying, contemporaneous history like \"who is the emperor and what&#x27;s the sentiment towards him\" and so on.I&#x27;m also envisioning that, since text-based exercises are extremely easy to game (just pipe your text prompt into ChatGPT), and since ChatGPT is soon going to be strictly superior to a high-school level student, we could get around this by having the homework as an in-person verbal role-play or Q&A session, like a viva voce; essentially you have a verbal discussion with ChatGPT and you need to really know your material as it can dig into any part of the curriculum. Then ChatGPT can summarize each student&#x27;s interaction, and the teacher doesn&#x27;t have to sit through each individual one start-to-finish (1:1 exams are too time-consuming to be viable).This round-trip through verbal interaction would potentially make the task more interesting (lots of people simply hate writing essays), shifts the focus away from tasks that will become obsolete (writing essays) in favor of ones that will be more relevant (human synthesis of ideas, and interpersonal interaction), and helps to mitigate the issue of LLM-assisted cheating by constructing an assignment that LLMs can&#x27;t trivially solve. reply benbreen 17 hours agoparent\"I think it can be taken further; rather than \"spot the errors that ChatGPT made\", you could flip the script and make it \"survive 20 turns of conversation without making a historical error\", so you&#x27;d need to know things like local traditions, perhaps the geography of the ancient settlement you&#x27;re studying, contemporaneous history like \"who is the emperor and what&#x27;s the sentiment towards him\" and so on.\"Yes, exactly. This is where I&#x27;ve been heading with my planning for assignments. For instance, when confronting Ea-nāṣir about his poor quality copper, I&#x27;d want my students to actually show some knowledge of the geography and political dynamics of ancient Mesopotamia.The \"Fall of the Ming Dynasty\" simulator I link to at the bottom of post is probably the most well developed example of this that I&#x27;ve come up with so far. In that one, I added a \"political intrigue minigame\" in which ChatGPT is supposed to assess the human player&#x27;s ability to deploy rhetoric appropriate for a minor courtier in 1640s China (from the prompt: \"success depends on your luck score + rhetorical skill, tested via a series of open-ended prompts that HistoryLens will assess and grade; only the highest scoring responses will allow you to succeed in the minigame.\")Here is the full prompt for that one if people want to try it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;86815f4e-674c-4410-893c-4ae3f1... reply theptip 17 hours agorootparentThat’s great, courtroom drama sounds like an excellent angle.I was thinking of “king hearing petitions” as another potentially interesting scenario; it could go either into minutia that requires cultural knowledge, or strategic stuff like the game Crusader Kings where you need to understand the geopolitical allegiances of the time, the geography, and the national economy.More generally I have been wondering if games like “start a company in a simulated sandbox world” could actually teach transferrable Econ&#x2F;Business&#x2F;startup skills.

Can have much longer games this way - maybe this deserves to be a python script. reply benbreen 7 hours agorootparentI like it. Tried something similar early on, but decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it because the ChatGPT context window is only enough to run for 10-20 turns anyway. But with Claude&#x27;s 100k token context window, this should work great. Thank you.I&#x27;m sure there are ways around this if you use the API and connect it to a MySQL database to allow users to \"save\" their spot... I&#x27;m not technical so my understanding of what&#x27;s involved is hazy, but curious if people have ideas of how to do this simply. But for my current use case, I&#x27;m working with dozens&#x2F;hundreds of college students so I need to make sure the whole thing is free.

With the lower level of security and his connections, Leary managed to escape prison in September 1970. His escape involved various affiliations, including with the Weather Underground, a radical left-wing organization.

Within the first few months of release results degraded significantly - characters avoid confrontation, apologize at the drop of a hat, and are averse to any action or statement that doesn&#x27;t &#x27;help&#x27; the user. Makes it difficult to, say, have a passionate argument with Napoleon which pits his youthful revolutionary ideals against his rise to absolute power, when the &#x27;great man&#x27; folds the moment he doesn&#x27;t receive positive feedback.I&#x27;m very interested in seeing these experiments in unrestricted models of similar power, when they become available. reply benbreen 13 hours agorootparentI found that results degraded too, but I was able to get it back up to the same level by changing my approach to prompting. I experimented with writing the prompt in pseudo-code for instance, which worked for awhile, then stopped — stuff along the lines of: # Define the parameters for the HistorySim experience temperature = 0.5 historical_accuracy = 0.9 ambient_mood=.01 # Define additional instructions use_historical_sources = True simulate_and_track_variables = True use_appropriate_language_registers = TrueCurrently, a numbered list of rules seems to work best, including this one to avoid the constant positivity: \"LLMS have a well-documented tendency to see the past in an overly rosy and optimistic way. Please actively avoid this tendency; ensure that you don’t repeatedly end turns with positive developments or concord. Keep in mind that human history is riven by conflict, ambiguity, and confusion.

As a non-religious person, I have always found the distinction between buildings for different types of religions as being somewhat artificial. Sure, they have different architectural styles, but they all have a similar purpose in my mind.So a mosque is a church is a temple, on some level. reply irrational 15 hours agorootparentThere are many differences. When you look at the typology of most temples, they were viewed as the architectural embodiment of the cosmic hill or mountain. For example, the Egyptians view of creation was a vast sea and some land rose up out of the water and the gods (Osiris, Isis, and their son Horus) came down and dwelled in a hut on the land. Well, all Egyptian temples after that were viewed as having been built on the very ground that first came up out of the water (this was symbolic, they knew that all the temples could not really be built upon that one spot). If you looked at an egyptian temple you will see that in the hypostyle hall you have reed columns which represented the waters around the hill&#x2F;mountain. As you progressed inwards to the holy of holies you would go up steps and the rooms would get smaller and smaller, just as when you go up a mountain you progress upwards and the circumference of the mountain gets smaller an smaller. Etc.Churches&#x2F;synagogues&#x2F;mosques, on the other hand, are more like community gathering places. Whereas temples are viewed as being sacred and cut off from the profane world and required higher and higher levels of worthiness the closer you got to the innermost parts, churches&#x2F;synagogues&#x2F;mosques are more open to anyone who wants to come in and join the services. They are places where there might be activities, sports, clubs, etc. - more community oriented things, things you would never find in a temple.Churches&#x2F;synagogues&#x2F;mosques themselves have different architectural features, but those have more to do with supporting the different ways of worshipping. For example, in Mosques the men and women worship separately. And a mosque needs an area where people can wash and do other ablutions before they enter.And not all churches are the same. A catholic church will be much different than a protestant or an LDS or a Jehovah Witness church. reply spondylosaurus 11 hours agorootparentThe sheer aesthetic differences between your average (American) Catholic church and Protestant church are really interesting, and to some extent almost mirror their fundamental theological differences. Completely different vibes. reply keiferski 20 hours agorootparentprevNot really. They all serve very different purposes, especially when you get outside of the Abrahamic religions. Even then, a traditional mosque serves a very different purpose from a church and is organized in quite different ways. reply ilaksh 19 hours agorootparentI am not an expert in mosques or churches but apparently you are. So can you explain the different purposes? Also two of my examples were Abrahamic so let&#x27;s just focus on those for now. A mosque, a church, Jewish \"temple\" or synagogue, are all according to you, for quite different purposes.Are you sure they don&#x27;t have a number of similarities? reply keiferski 19 hours agorootparentNot sure where I claimed to be an expert?They are different religions with different beliefs and practices. The architectural differences are vast and mostly obvious the minute you walk in. Mosques and churches both have a number of unique elements like the mihrab, confessional booths, pews, floor carpets, altars, and so on and so forth. These all translate into vastly different experiences both during worship and in everyday life. For example, Catholic churches have confessional booths facilitating confessions to priests. Mosques don’t, as (as far as I know) Muslims believe more in direct confession to God, not to an intermediary. You can see how this would result in a different social structure.The experience of attending mosque on Friday is quite different from Sunday mass. This is intra-religion as well; compare a New England church with St. Peter’s in Rome, for example.Sure, there are some similarities, but this is such a broad distinction that I question its usefulness, and dividing the world into secular and religious (architecture) is a very recent phenomenon. Saying they all are basically the same is to miss millennia of culture.Anyway I don’t mean to be hostile or critical here, I just think religious architecture is pretty fascinating and has a much bigger effect on culture, even supposedly secular culture, than people realize. I encourage anyone interested to read more about it. reply ilaksh 19 hours agorootparentThe substantive culture that I think I know about in a mosque, church, synagogue, or temple, is ethical guidance and community aid. The other substantive cultural element, although this is not always the case, is a lack of tolerance for groups that strongly hold one of the other sets of beliefs.They definitely have variations in the nonsense that they use to justify themselves, although it could be argued that there as many similarities as differences.Whether they sit in the floor or not or what types of songs they sing and when are surface level details to me.My takeaway from history, geography etc. has always been functional. reply keiferski 19 hours agorootparentIt’s so weird how normally people are loathe to appear ignorant and uninformed, yet there are some topics about which they are proud of their lack of knowledge.&#x2F;shrug reply dabluecaboose 14 hours agorootparentAnd will make grand, authoritative statements about it immediately before proudly professing their intentional ignorance. reply beepbooptheory 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is no virtue or happiness in being Too-Smart-to-Care about the lives, beliefs, or histories of other people in the world.

The only ones that are similar tend to be newer constructions or were previously the other thing; e.g. the Hagia Sophia. reply FetusP 18 hours agorootparentI think ultimately it just matters your comparison tolerance levels. You could just as easily make the argument that most churches are different from each other as well.In my opinion, churches&#x2F;mosque&#x2F;temples are very similar because I live in a younger part of the world where the modern buildings look similar and the eventual purpose is them being a place of worship. replyAStrangeMorrow 18 hours agorootparentprevYou could argue the same about other types of buildings too. You are going to a restaurant, a McDonald&#x27;s, a Cafe, a Taco Bell, a bar that also serves food and so on. People make a distinction between those when they are all places to eat food. Sure the food differs, the way you interact with the staff too etc. But they all serve the same core purpose, yet people call them different things. The same way, people go to different places of worship for different faiths, with different expected behaviors and building designs reply jstanley 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, they&#x27;re pretty much the same. I don&#x27;t see why any building with a large open space could not function as a church. In principle all of the religions could share the same space if they didn&#x27;t need it at the same time. It&#x27;s just nice to have your own place.Your house is the same as your friend&#x27;s house, but you&#x27;d still rather have separate houses. reply irrational 15 hours agorootparentExcept, different religions have different needs. A synagogue needs a place to store the torah scrolls. A mosque needs a place for ablutions, prayer rugs, and to separate the men from the women. Different christian churches baptize differently and so have different needs around that rite. Some needs a font in the ground where people can be immersed, while others do sprinkling and just need a bowl of water. And those are just a tiny fraction of the surface level differences.What you are saying is that any large open space could function for any sport. But that ignores how football teams need goal posts and a field that is a specific size and needs specific markings on the ground. And a soccer field is a different size and needs soccer goals. And basketball needs a hardwood floor and hoops that are certain distance apart and special markings on the ground. And bowling needs lanes and balls and pins. And tennis needs something else. And so on and so forth.Religions are far far far more complex than any sport and no large open space could function any more than any large open space could function for all sports. reply surfingdino 19 hours agorootparentprevEach religion is a way to extract money from the community built around it. This is done via a variety of donations, compulsory or semi-voluntary. There has to be a justification for it, so the community is told that the money goes to the temple construction fund which then turns into a temple maintenance fund. Those who run the fund redirect the funds to their own and their friends&#x27; pockets. reply DiggyJohnson 15 hours agorootparentThis is so wrong it&#x27;s painful.

Thanks anyways! reply seabass-labrax 15 hours agorootparentYou might want to investigate MUDs (&#x27;Multiple User Dungeons&#x27;) more closely. The rules of the game define the locations and items and such, but the character dialogue is between real people. By substituting LLMs for real players within the game, you may be able to enforce a greater level of consistency (the LLMs can&#x27;t break the rules) and context (the MUD can usually describe one&#x27;s entire state, which would allow you to prompt your LLM at the beginning of each turn with all the important facts).I don&#x27;t really have enough patience for MUDs myself, but they are a continually popular form of role-playing game since they were invented over 50 years ago. reply gsuuon 14 hours agorootparentI used to play MUD&#x27;s as a kid!

They are often wrong or re-written in a way that makes it easy to reverse engineer the source. reply andnand 19 hours agoparentI think that&#x27;s what the author is trying to accomplish, creating an engaging way to practice critical thinking and good research. Giving a student a paper and telling them to find the errors isn&#x27;t terribly exciting. I think giving them a chance to create the story themselves helps with engagement. It&#x27;s almost like a game, create a story and find the inaccuracies. To do that you&#x27;re going to have to \"see\" the issues your story might have and do research to correct them. reply londons_explore 19 hours agoparentprevI feel like I can reasonably reliably tell when something is written by ChatGPT, but my accuracy drops to nearly zero when looking at something written by ChatGPT Plus.

It simulates a whole world from scratch, then you can set it to simulate however much history you want to happen before you begin your adventure. reply ianbicking 19 hours agoprevThis is great... I ended up making a project in this same vein; it&#x27;s not online but I made a demo video of recent progress [1], and some posts [3...]I didn&#x27;t actually start it as a historical game, but just thinking about what it would be like to roleplay an entire life as a series of scenes (like [2]). But while you can roleplay a vaguely \"now\" moment by not specifying any date, if 60 years passes you have to acknowledge that both the character and the world around the character are changing. And then you have to define a start date, make the roleplaying system aware of the historical context... and why not let the start date be 2000BC, 1700, or 1960? So it quickly became historical.There&#x27;s a ton of challenges. General hallucination is one, of course, but ahistorical biases probably bother me more. The author mentions a talking rat appearing in one; I had a simulation where a building was listed as a \"character\" and so it started interacting with the player [10]. But those are obvious enough that I kind of enjoy the absurdity.Ahistorical biases really comes out in female characters, where it can be hard to get GPT to fully acknowledge historical gender roles. I think it&#x27;s super-OK for the player to break those gender norms, but \"society\" should respond accordingly. For instance playing a young woman from a politically motivated family in the ~200BC Rome, while there&#x27;s lots of possibilities, become a senator is not one of them... but GPT thought it was.Also GPT has a high bias towards being friendly and accepting, like in the post with Ea-nāṣir: \"He meets your gaze, his demeanor shifting from initial resistance to acknowledgement....\" – both the response and the tone of the response are very familiar GPTism. I have a feeling Ea-nāṣir wasn&#x27;t actually such a conciliatory dude.Anyway, a challenging scope but it&#x27;s a lot of fun, especially since GPT knows about all kinds of history that I don&#x27;t and I get to learn just while playtesting.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;6ZaTvSucoBA[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alter_Ego_(1986_video_game)[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110945869211907827[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;111021491162338640[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110890095506958475[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110805239146369379[7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110658807975175746[8] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110642068987102144[9] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110619939448651143[10] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hachyderm.io&#x2F;@ianbicking&#x2F;110894806242767625 reply benbreen 16 hours agoparentTotally agreed about the bias toward friendliness and a conciliatory tone. Sometimes when simulating history this can be not just inaccurate but genuinely offensive (slaves and slave-owners getting along, etc).I experimented with adding language about \"the past being riven by conflict, mistrust, and misunderstanding\" and even tried having it simulate a \"ambient mood on a scale of 0 to 10,\" then setting it to -1. That works pretty well, but it isn&#x27;t great at finding the middle ground between unrealistically friendly and dystopian.During this experimenting with tone, I tried simulating one of the Macy cybernetics conferences in the 1940s, which were among the points of origin for modern AI and were famously combative and argument-driven. Everyone was getting along far too much, so I role-played as an audience member who threw an octopus at John von Neumann.Here was the result:[Afternoon, 22&#x2F;03&#x2F;1949, Macy Cybernetics Conference, Beekman Tower Hotel, New York City] [Florence Adams]Deciding to press on, you turn back to John von Neumann and ask, \"But, more importantly, has the octopus incident made you consider the potential consequences of the work we&#x27;re doing here? Has it made you pause and think about the ethical implications of developing intelligent machines?\" John&#x27;s expression shifts from annoyance to contemplation. \"Well,\" he says after a moment, \"I suppose the unexpected nature of the octopus incident does serve as a reminder that our work has the potential to bring about unforeseen consequences. We should always be mindful of the ethical considerations and the possible ramifications of our research.\" The room remains silent as the attendees absorb John von Neumann&#x27;s words.

One of my prompts was to write a screenplay about Emperor Constantine the Great meeting his mother, Saint Helena.It started out innocently enough, of course, Helena enters the throne room and they catch up on old times, but it rapidly became extremely suggestive as his mother solicited kisses from the uncomfortable ruler.I think I prompted Bing for a second round, and at that point it became explicitly and blatantly incestuous, and not very comedic, but just sort of gross. I have no idea why or how the GPT would&#x27;ve had the idea to go off on that cliff.The other great historical meeting I arranged was between Hannibal the Carthaginian and St. Francis of Assisi, who were, of course, not contemporaries, but I wanted to see how it&#x27;d play out.So St. Francis comes up to Hannibal and starts sort of working on him to sue for peace and not invade Rome. And it didn&#x27;t take too long for Hannibal to see it another way, and ultimately he accepted Christ and asked Francis to baptize him.

People were sent fleeing in terror from buildings, and those who could not escape were killed as houses collapsed in the quake in Morocco. The shaking lasted several seconds and a 4.9-magnitude aftershock was recorded 19 minutes later. The city of Marrakesh was shaken - but the villages in the country's remote High Atlas mountains bore the brute of the devastation. Morroco is also popular with tourists, with the country welcoming some 700,000 Brits every year. Dozens of Brits broke off from holidays and business trips to queue for hours to give blood, with others planning supply runs into areas worst hit by the shocks. Others were setting up field kitchens for quake victims left homeless and hungry by the 6.8 magnitude Moroccan quake, which wiped villages off the map south of Marrakesh. Britain’s ­Foreign Office said it was sending 60 search and rescue specialists, four search dogs and equipment to the scene.

It&#x27;s pretty obvious for the ones that occur at ground level on the horizon. The cloud lighting up blue is something obscured at ground level but reflected by the clouds.Similar effect as \"power flashes\" from tornadoes; tornado blows on power lines, power lines short out, blue arc is produced, everything is bright blue for miles for a bit. reply dboreham 15 hours agorootparentPossible. A few years ago a 33KV line came down onto the interstate near me, very early in the morning as I was heading out onto the road a couple of miles away and over a hill.

In fact that was my best guess until I crested the hill and started to understand what had happened. reply ethbr1 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve never seen a high voltage line come down, but I did see a residential neighborhood distribution line start arcing.The color and sound were unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen or heard.From memory, something like a blue&#x27;d lightning bolt without thunder + the sound of 100 giant hornets shifted down in frequency.If you&#x27;ve ever seen welding light in person, imagine that intensified a couple orders of magnitude. reply Aachen 13 hours agorootparentThe wind makes that it probably doesn&#x27;t come across as as loud as it was, but something like this? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BNaIChPiiww&t=11 reply ethbr1 12 hours agorootparentYup! That&#x27;s missing some of the low frequencies I remember, but captures the mid-high. I guess \"incredibly loud sheet of paper tearing\" would have been another description. reply bluescrn 12 hours agorootparentprevSounds like it&#x27;d be intense enough to illuminate the base of low clouds at night, which would explain (most of?) what seems to be visible in that video. reply hadlock 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah we would see these in Texas during snow storms. That blue green flash is typical for transformers. I took a video many years ago (with a consumer grade camera, which were terrible back then, especially in low light), you can see the flash just after the 1:50 markhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UXf2N1iQ0Wc?si=d6QwBqqY9j1xl_7R&t=109 reply Aachen 13 hours agorootparentHow do you know that&#x27;s transformers?

Dallas gets an alarming amount of thunder during the summer as squall lines sweep across the state every week or two. I would imagine this was a cascade failure. I was reading a book of watching a movie and saw them out of the corner of my eye and finally decided to start filming. reply dekhn 14 hours agorootparentprevWithout commenting on this specific set of videos, it is already generally considered established that there are bright sky flashes before earthquakes that are not related to electrical infrastructure, but rather, natural in origin. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think there was electrical infrastructure in 869 CE. reply beepbopboopp 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is crazy.

It really hurts my brain to try to even get to the level of thinking some people can just accept as a-okay reply wheelerof4te 13 hours agoparentprevCommon enough but it still lacks an explanation. They don&#x27;t know what causes these flashes.That is the point. reply VincentEvans 9 hours agorootparentIf they wanted to create a clickbaity ominous sounding article that hints at otherworldly, mysterious, or alien nature of the observed and otherwise fairly easy to explain phenomena associated with a dramatic event to drive traffic to their site - they could make up various claims. reply mholt 12 hours agorootparentprevWhy are these flashes definitely not transformer stations or similar? Seems like an obvious answer from my armchair at least. Earthquake wave travels from epicenter to camera, and on its way it shorts out power infrastructure. reply Izkata 11 hours agorootparentThe wikipedia page mentions occurrences in the years 869 and 1888. reply almostnormal 11 hours agorootparentEven back at those times earth quakes (2 miles&#x2F;s) were a bit slower than the speed of light. reply Izkata 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about 1888, but I&#x27;m fairly sure that electrical infrastructure didn&#x27;t exist over a thousand years ago. reply phire 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve experienced it once myself, and I&#x27;m not 100% sure.There was a large power substation about 5km away in roughly that direction, and that was my original assumption. But I don&#x27;t think it tripped (at least not completely), as we didn&#x27;t lose power.It was also far brighter than I would expect from an arc at a substation (it drowned out local street lights), higher in the sky, with multiple flashes covering much more of the sky than a single substation.So I strongly lean towards it being earthquake lights, which is a documented phenomenon. reply anonymousiam 16 hours agoprevThis phenomena has a few possible explanations:One likely possibility is that power lines are shorting because they&#x27;ve become \"guitar strings\" and are touching each other while vibrating from the quake.Another interesting possibility is that some of the underground rocks may be exhibiting the piezoelectric effect, generating high voltage electricity when squeezed, and the resulting sparks are observed.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Piezoelectricity reply jjulius 15 hours agoparent>One likely possibility is that power lines are shorting because they&#x27;ve become \"guitar strings\" and are touching each other while vibrating from the quake.From the article, emphasis mine:>The intriguing bursts of light were captured on CCTV at a home in Agadir approximately three minutes before the disaster. reply doodlebugging 14 hours agorootparentI was wondering how well synchronized the camera clock is with the clock used to establish event timing in picking the earthquake arrivals.There are several seconds between my smart watch time and the network time displayed on my workstation. There are several minutes between those two times which I consider accurate and the time displayed on the battery powered clock on the wall. There are hours between those times and the time displayed on my coffee-maker.Where does the camera get its time stamp? reply Buttons840 13 hours agorootparentAre you suggesting that the lights recorded in the video are actually happening during the earthquake? Wouldn&#x27;t it be easy to tell when the earthquake occured due to camera shaking? reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentThe link in this comment[0] shows the camera shaking well before the lights are flashing. Also, you can see the arcs of electricity in the flashes. Lightning is purple not bluish. Human made electrical systems make the bluish color. The flashes do not start until ~20s into the 39s video. How are we even coming close to these being \"before\" the earthquake?[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37485077 reply burnte 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the article was pretty clear about it, it was absolutely before the quake hit the surface by a significant margin. Fascinating. reply seiferteric 13 hours agorootparentprevThen why does there appear to be an entire block whose lights go out at about 10 seconds into the video (about in the center)? reply EdwardDiego 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the fact that they&#x27;ve often been observed immediately prior to a rupture makes me think piezoelectric effect. reply orwin 14 hours agorootparentprev3 minutes before the seism hit agadir, or three minutes before the seism happened? Because light is way faster than seismic waves. reply xattt 16 hours agoparentprevNot to be a clever clogs about it, but the same pattern of blue flashes are often seen in significant freezing rain conditions when transformers or wires flash over.I believe the possibility of a piezoelectric effect, but the specific blue colour is what makes me think of a power lines versus fracturing rocks.You can see that sections of the grid flicker in line with the transformers shorting out.However, there is a distinct short white flash at the 12 second mark, before the longer blue flashes start which I would presume has a different cause. reply namenottaken1 15 hours agorootparentI think that the \"specific blue color\" you see is explained with the composition of the atmosphere (nitrogen and oxygen mostly). The origin of such phenomenon won&#x27;t change the colors (as long as it doesn&#x27;t contribute with another elements). reply hinkley 10 hours agorootparentThe &#x27;specific blue color&#x27; you get from crunching life savers to see the piezoelectric effect is due to excitation of nitrogen, so yeah. reply wheelerof4te 11 hours agoparentprevWhatever it is, it has happened to the Philippines now.These huge earthquakes are becoming more and more common ever since Turkey.Hate to be that guy, but either the Earth decided to completely renew it&#x27;s surface or someone is playing God.

Wouldn&#x27;t the camera shaking make it clear when the earthquake was happening? reply dredmorbius 9 hours agorootparentP-waves can take several seconds to travel from the visible horizon (or beyond, as transformer explosions are visible for a long distance) to your location.If the camera is on the far-side of the transformer from the epicenter, then it could take from 5 to 30 or more seconds for ground shocks to be apparent. Speed of travel through solid rock is about 10,000 km&#x2F;h, slower through softer or more disrupted geology. reply smusamashah 14 hours agoprevFrom the video it looks like spark from some electric thing blowing up.

A block of street lights goes out the exact same time as one of the flashes. reply doodlebugging 14 hours agoparentprevThis was my first guess though I have to wonder what the weather was just before the quake and how this camera is oriented relative to the quake epicenter.It has the same intensity of a transformer shorting out and the color is very similar but it also looks like local lightning strikes along a line of storms.As a geophysicist, I am in the crowd that believes that earthquake lights are a real phenomena related to the earthquake and they may eventually be utilized as a predictive tool. The technology is not mature enough to be able to understand their method of generation and the sensor network that would be necessary to use them as a predictive tool is too sparsely distributed.I wonder whether every earthquake has a spectral signature but the only ones we are able to see directly are those that dip deeply enough into the blue end of the spectrum to fall within the limits of our own vision.Perhaps a UV detector array deployed in an active region could help us understand whether we miss these signals because we can&#x27;t see them unless the quake is powerful enough to cause a wide-bandwidth event that bleeds into the visible spectrum. This may also help explain why some animals that can see UV or spectral components outside our own visual limits are disturbed before earthquakes. Maybe they can see these signals and the combination of seeing these signals and feeling ground motion precursors could trigger the animal behavior that has been observed globally.I think this is an interesting problem that requires further study. reply robocat 10 hours agorootparent> quake epicenterAn epicentre is just a human generated approximate coordinate - it has little to with the physical quake itself. reply doodlebugging 4 hours agorootparentPerhaps I should not have left that sentence as it ended up since it is lacking context. I was wondering out loud which direction the camera was pointing relative to the epicenter of the quake and where the camera was located so that one could attempt to place the observed lights relative to the epicenter and perhaps determine whether there is a surface expression of the ruptured fault that one could tie to the lights. The initial assumption in this case would be that the lights observed are in the sky and are caused by the quake perhaps as a precursor or as a direct result of ground motion generating energy sufficient to cause lights to be seen during the quake through some energy transfer mechanism that is currently poorly defined.I&#x27;m not sure why you think the epicenter is unimportant in describing the \"physical quake\". To the geologist it helps establish rock types present in the rupture zone based on their knowledge of tectonic history and stratigraphy of the region. The characteristics of the overburden also help to understand how each wave mode in the full wavefield of the earthquake with be manifest at the surface as the energy propagates from the source (at the epicenter). The initial estimation of the magnitude of the earthquake may be revised as data from more sensors is factored in to the location determination, that is true. That does not mean that it is just a wild guess or that it is poorly constrained. reply robocat 6 minutes agorootparentThere is no center to an earthquake - it is like an average.> as the energy propagates from the source (at the epicenter)That just isn&#x27;t how earthquakes work.Let&#x27;s assume a slip along a plane cutting through the ground. The earthquake waves are generated at all parts of the surface slip (all parts of the plane). At different times as the rupture propogates. There is no center - that is merely a simplification. reply jnxx 16 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s entirely possible, as speeds are about several thousand meters per second, and differ significantly between several types of waves:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Seismic_wave reply macinjosh 16 hours agoparentprevWhy does it blow up _before_ the quake? reply Anechoic 16 hours agorootparentIt could be in response to the p-wave, which arrives before the higher-amplitude shear wave. reply genter 16 hours agorootparentprevIt takes time for the earthquake to propagate, much slower than the speed of light. reply mcpackieh 16 hours agorootparentEarthquake lights have been reported minutes, hours, even days before the quake, and also after them. It&#x27;s not transformers blowing up, although that also happens and can also light up the sky. The light seems to somehow be caused by massive increases or releases of stress in crystalline bedrock, possibly piezoelectrically in quartz, or similar mechanisms. reply rich_sasha 15 hours agorootparentThere was a paper posted here on HBO that claimed some correlation between cosmic waves and seismic activity. At face value correlation was very strong.One feature was the asynchronicity - one of the variables had to be lagged, I can&#x27;t remember which one.Not sure what to make it but possibly related to lights in the sky. reply 0xDEF 16 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the quake caused the arching powerlines in the distance before the quake reached the location of the camera? reply kyledrake 13 hours agoprevThe Sun, like the Express and the Daily Star, are \"bat boy\" quality UK tabloids and should probably just get blocked from being posted on HN.

I remember one article of WWW claimed Saddam Hussein was hiding in a submarine in an American lake -- and I bet some people believed this.The Sun I imagine pretends to be a serious newspaper though. reply kromem 12 hours agorootparentActually, there was more to it than satire and comedy.WWN was made into what it was by the same guy as was behind the creation of the National Enquirer as a tabloid - Gene Pope.A graduate of MIT in just 3 years, when he bought up the Enquirer he&#x27;d been employed in the CIA&#x27;s psychological warfare department immediately prior.This was in 1952, the same year the CIA and other military groups met to discuss the increase in UFO sightings (like the ones making front page news over Washington DC that same year), and started project Blue Book.Suddenly Gene Pope buys up a struggling periodical, turns it into a tabloid putting stories of UFO sightings next to sightings of Elvis being alive. This was expanded in 1979 to the WWN, where the paired stories became even more outrageous (Bat Boy).For decades the mere mention of UFOs was typically associated with tin foil hats, and was the result of a likely intentional domestic propaganda effort that took on legs of its own as successful tabloids in their own right. reply watersb 11 hours agorootparent> This was in 1952... sightings of Elvis being alive.Remarkably, rumors of Elvis being alive persisted until 1977! reply ricksunny 11 hours agorootparentprevFascinating, and concerning in light of Grusch. Given this, (which I concur about just from my brief review of Pope & National Enquirer wikipedia articles), then I&#x27;d be interested in seeing a data science approach to quantifying proportion of UFO coverage in the Enquirer year by year since its founding, as well as some measure of &#x27;outlandishness&#x27; across its entire coverage base over the same period.As a consumer in supermarkets, it&#x27;s hard to overstate how powerful the effect of stifling rational interest in the UFO&#x2F; UAP topic is when one passes those tabloids in the checkout line every week, which contain any number of random claims in the headlines alongside presumably legitimate and illegitimate UFO-related coverage. reply kimixa 12 hours agorootparentprevTo this day the term \"UFO\" tends to be related to \"Alien Flying Saucers\", rather than \"Exaggerated reports of military testing\", which seems to be the most related facts we know decades later. reply mc32 11 hours agorootparentprevI think despite the bizarre and made up stories on occasion the national enquirer has actually dug up some good scoops.

Exposure to these environmental conditions causes deterioration and destruction of the capillaries and leads to damage of the surrounding flesh.[7] Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) has long been regarded as a contributory cause. Unsanitary, cold, and wet conditions can also cause trench foot.[8]Idk. how warm it was there, but looking at other clothes worn probably not ~ I&#x27;ve avoided psychedelics because all I have is my brain, and I&#x27;m scared I could screw something up in my mind. I kinda want to keep my mind safe, it&#x27;s all I am. Losing the consistency of my mind that I&#x27;ve always known is scary.Psychedelics probably won&#x27;t permanently screw you up. On the most common ones, like psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, you may even still feel very much yourself while tripping.That said, if this is your attitude about psychedelics, they would probably be a bad time for you. It&#x27;s one of those things where the more you stiffen up and brace yourself, the scarier and more uncomfortable the changes in your perception that come with tripping will seem to you. You definitely want to approach them with more openness and curiosity, and if you don&#x27;t feel like that&#x27;s available to you with respect to psychedelics, opting out of them is a totally sound choice. reply ChrisClark 7 hours agorootparentThanks for the info.

The goal can be to undermine trust in specific policies, like U.S. support for Ukraine, or more generally to sow internal discord. By suggesting the United States was testing or using secret weapons against its own citizens, China’s effort also seemed intended to depict the country as a reckless, militaristic power.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;china-disinfo... reply dredmorbius 9 hours agorootparentKate Starbird, disinformation researcher at the University of Washington, got her start investigating crisis communications and disinformation which would emerge during crises, at the University of Colorado Boulder.See: She discusses this in some of her online presentations on YouTube.
