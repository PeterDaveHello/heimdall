I\u2019ve quit jobs, taken time off work, been laid off, but this is different from any of those things. This is deliberate.There\u2019s a note of relief. I\u2019ve essentially been working two pretty demanding jobs; one for pay and one for passion and the joy of making a difference.You can absolutely bludgeon your way forward with sheer determination\u2026 for a while. It wears on you. It requires sacrificing other things in a way that\u2019s not really sustainable long term. In all honesty, exhaustion has been mounting for a while now. Work has been slow as a result. I\u2019m looking forward to returning to a somewhat saner life balance with time for things like sleep, exercise, and relationships. This is a long-term project, I need to find a balance where I can last the course.Then there\u2019s the vertigo of possibility. The potential outcomes, good or bad, they are much more extreme than working a job. I have money for two years, some half of it from the NLnet grant and half of it is savings, as well as a trickle of donations from Patreon and other places. Beyond that, nothing is certain.Nothing is guaranteed even with a job, you can still be fired or laid off, but it\u2019s different knowing with full certainty you don\u2019t have a singular clue about what life will look like in 24 months.It\u2019s also exciting. This is such a once in a lifetime opportunity! Marginalia Search is a labor of love, I think it can be shaped into a genuinely useful tool to help navigate and shape the \u201crest\u201d of the web, the parts that are still wild and creative and outside the corporate walled gardens. It\u2019s all very rough around the edges still and there\u2019s a thousand things to improve, but the fact that it\u2019s at all a slight possibility is reason enough to try to realize the vision.It\u2019s come this far in two years with change, and in the process already opened so many new possibilities. The previous two years bought the next two years. It will be interesting to see what happens next.Shit.I started this work just to see how far I could take it. Building an Internet search engine was such a ridiculous thing to attempt, it was such an obvious truth that it couldn\u2019t be done\u2026 Still, I gave it a shot, for no other reason than not being able to quite figure out why this supposedly impossible thing was impossible. Doing the napkin math, it seemed very possible.I don\u2019t know what I expected back then, maybe building an edifice so out of touch with reality I\u2019d turn into the second coming of Terry Davis,\u2026 or losing interest and having the project peter out into nothing? I can say for certain I did not expect to end up doing this.Previous:Killing Community 2023-06-11",

It's certainly a lot lower than many low-/zero-traffic blogs I've frequented though.I've had a look at the README[0] for the Java sourcecode, but it's highly focused on crawls, database & indexing (understandable for search); would be cool to see a front-end focused write-up.[0] https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/ma...replymarginalia_nu 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The blog is just hugo so it's 100% static files over nginx.The search engine is serverside-rendered mustache templates via handlebars[1], via served via spark[2]. It's basically all vanilla Java. I do raw SQL queries instead of ORM, which makes it quite a bit snappier than most Java applications. The sheer size of the database also mandates that basically every query is a primary key lookup. The code is written around that constraint.Although the search engine is a bit on the slow side since it's routed through cloudflare and I think I'm relatively far away from the closest datacenter so it adds like 100ms to the load times.[1] https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java[2] https://sparkjava.com/replysrazzaque 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It's basically all vanilla JavaHave you considered rewriting it in rust? ;)In all seriousness, it's great to see something written in a \"boring\" language like Java, which seems to get a lot of hate in developer circles, hover at the top of HN.Java really can perform amazingly well, especially if you minimise the use of unneeded libraries and frameworks.

I can get up at 5am and work until 11am, and then go hike, play with my dog, get ice cream with my daughters, workout, etc. and then work again from 7pm until midnight or whatever.Having (almost literally) full control over my daily schedule, week-in, week-out, year after year, is invaluable to me.One disclosure: a few times a year I do very hard things where I have very little freedom, but they allow me to have lots of freedom the rest of the year.Not to be a jerk, but I won't be elaborating.

My criteria is \"from a money standpoint, is this the call to action I want my users to engage in?\"I don't know what type of test this is -- can anyone disambiguate testing terminology for me?P.S. Browser based testing is brittle but since I often create websites and because I want to really ensure that I'm not 'lying' to myself in tests, using a browser is often the best (albeit slower) choice. These tests usually run in CI and I get notifications if they break.P.P.S.

Although I have relatively long runway, no small thanks to nlnet for their generous grant.On some level it's all a gamble. Either I try to make this work somehow, or I close up shop and keep working as an office drone, because I really can't keep doing both.My hope is that I'm able to make it work on a wikipedia-like model donation model, maybe supplemented with selling commercial API access (access is free CC-BY-NC-SA). My burn rate is literally my living expenses plus a hundred dollars per month of service costs to I don't have to be spectacularly profitable to sustain flight. ... all that is contingent on making it work quite a lot better than it does now, so I guess I have my work cut out for me.It's also a weird project, since it's had an almost absurdly positive reaction.

It's very hard to find what you want.Im not sure. But it looks like you didn't want to copy google and wanted to make something \"authentic\", same reason why often modern design is unusable.Every competitor of Google just gave up trying finding a better sexier way. DuckDuckGo, bing etc. Pure copies. A list view, with a good contrasting header is the best way to scan and find the results you want.If you want to keep it, at least provide a list / grid switcher so users can pick themselves.Good luck! Happy you get to pursue your passion.replymarginalia_nu 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah I'm not a huge fan of how the magic the gathering layout has turned out. Been experimenting with something more list-like, e.g. https://twitter.com/MarginaliaNu/status/1644058334440443916I don't like the basic old school google style list though. It makes very poor use of the screen space. This is primarily a service for desktop users finding desktop content, but I still want something that's accessible to other screen sizes. Really hard to find a good design that works well.reply0x0203 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As far as layout is concerned, if you don't mind me brainstorming some ideas, I'll share some thoughts.When a search term yields many results, it's left to the user to the user to search the results for the site that will yield the \"best\" match for what they're after. It seems like people assume that the better the search engine is, the better it is at predicting what the user is really after by putting it at the top of the listing. But this can be rather difficult when the original search terms are pretty generic and the user is required to scroll and check many results. If there were a way help the user sort the results based on relevant criteria, maybe that would make that search easier. And personally, I like things that give users a little more say in how they get fed information. Allow sort by popularity, frequency of search terms in page, number of pages in site's domain, date of last page edit (no idea if this is possible to get), etc...Maybe have multiple columns of search results. One column that lists results that match all words in the query, another for only one or two words. Or maybe columns that list results that include the user's query plus likely related topics. Or a set of search refinement tools that can further help the user sort based on any number of criteria, or filter results by specific related terms.Slightly related, I really like your encyclopedia site. In addition to being incredibly nice to use all on its own, perhaps it (from the 'See Also', 'Further Reading', 'Related articles', etc... sections) could be mined for suggesting additional search terms/info a user could add to their search or filter their results by. For example if I search for Tcl and get a bunch of results, some tools that suggested filtering (or a search instead option?) the results to those that included Tk, expect, and TclX might help me get to what I'm after quicker.No idea if any of that is practical or would even actually be that useful in practice.reply0x0203 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]For whatever it's worth, I personally like the screenshots of the pages that shows up when you browse random; I think it really helps in recognizing a site you may have been to before. If there were a way to incorporate that into all search results, along with a more information dense listing, I for one would find that quite useful. Kind of a 'I can't remember what it was called, but I'd recognize it if I saw it' sort of thing.I also really appreciate the desire to use available screen space. It irks me to no end when a site forces a narrow column of info/content and wide empty borders wasting half or more of my screen. Wikipedia recently started doing this and I can't say they're better for it in my opinion.replyMrVandemar 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Just echoing this. I was looking for a site the other day, and I thought I'd use marginalia since it throws up interesting stuff in general, and the site I was looking for had a distinctive look that I knew I would recognise again ... and was disappointed the \"magazine stand\" view was only for the random sites.I do like that feature.replywouldbecouldbe 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I like the list view on desktop, I would maybe make the title slightly larger to have a stronger contrast with the description.They are not my colors, but the contrast is clear!Mobile I think the cards are to high.

It's meant to only show obscure sites but I'm unsure of the actual criteria.replySolvency 12 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Given that this is written on Java and running on a single server with fixed hardware....Is there and what is the \"peak\" amount of optimization feasible in Java for this search engine before one would need to turn to C/Rust/etc to get any more performance out of this on the given hardware?replylolinder 12 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Presumably there is a peak, but Java can be really, really fast.I recently rewrote a heavy algorithm from Java to Rust, thinking that I'd get faster performance pretty much automatically. It turned out to be significantly slower than my optimized Java algorithm, and I didn't have the experience to tune the Rust version, so I ended up sticking to Java for now.I'm sure someone who knows how could have tuned the Rust version to get better performance, but native code is not my specialty and the Java version was doing fine.A warmed up JVM is a lot faster than most people think, especially for a long-running app like a search engine.replymarginalia_nu 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Java's main limitation is probably in access to lower level I/O APIs, as well as vectorization support that is somewhat lackluster. There's almost definitely performance left on the table.It's relying quite heavily on memory mapped I/O and doing some clever things to work around language limitations in how much you can memory map at a time. This permits surprisingly good but not optimal performance.A bigger drawback is that this type of low level programming in Java is a serious pain in the ass.replydoctor_eval 7 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> I gave it a shot, for no other reason than not being able to quite figure out why this supposedly impossible thing was impossible.

So, \"rollover\" is kind of a strange word, and because you don't have any results with these three words, I see nothing.I'd prefer to instead see results for \"urbit key,\" given the circumstances. I imagine the algorithms to do this well are complicated though.Another query that had no results: \"multi-band compression maselec\"A query that has surprisingly few results: \"qmmf-4.\" It shows a single forum post from a forum that has probably hundreds of posts matching this query. Why just one?replybornfreddy 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Wow, thank you for the write-up! For me this is an endorsement of Marginalia, it seems to work exactly like it should...

C'est la vie.replypcthrowaway 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Interesting. I searched for \"what is jit oauth\" and got no results.I did end up getting results with \"jit oauth\" (quotes not in search), but not great ones.To be fair, google didn't give me great results for either of those queries eitheredit: What I was looking for was related to JWTs, not necessarily oauth, and the actual claim in spec is \"JTI\" (but I believe a service whose traffic I was inspecting used \"jit\" instead)reply082349872349872 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Back when people-facing computer stuff worked more like computer-facing computer stuff, queries were simple: keywords to match. If you get too many results, add more keywords; if you get too few, remove* keywords (or change existing keywords to be more specific/more general respectively).If you're not searching for literal occurrences of \"what\" and \"is\", why should they even be in a query?* this is an instance of an adjunction, which is an important concept in informatics, but I understand that to actually admit the fact would probably be the kiss of death for anything claiming to be a \"user\" interface.Lagniappe: marginalia, upon being queried with \"precision\" and \"recall\", came up inter alia with http://comonad.com/reader/2009/remodeling-precision/ , which I count as a win for it.replyjimbokun 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Does Marginalia Search have selling points over other search engines?

He could even have an IPO after banning 3rd party apps, while admitting that the official apps is a disgrace and vowing to redo it from scratch (or better yet, just buying one of the competitors).What he can't do is eat his cake and still have it. Nothing is worse for a company than going into an IPO surrounded by a scandal. Especially if you are a social media and your users are striking.

The disclosures that followed rocked the nation.Give this article572Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the press, surrenders at the U.S. Courthouse in Boston on June 28, 1971, accompanied by his wife, Patricia.Credit...Donal F. Holway/The New York TimesBy Robert D. McFaddenJune 16, 2023Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst who after experiencing a sobbing antiwar epiphany on a bathroom floor made the momentous decision in 1971 to disclose a secret history of American lies and deceit in Vietnam, what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers, died on Friday at his home in Kensington, Calif., in the Bay Area. He was 92.The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife and children said in a statement.In March, Mr. Ellsberg, in an email message to \u201cDear friends and supporters,\u201d announced that he had recently been told he had inoperable pancreatic cancer and said that his doctors had given him an estimate of three to six months to live.The disclosure of the Pentagon Papers \u2014 7,000 government pages of damning revelations about deceptions by successive presidents who exceeded their authority, bypassed Congress and misled the American people \u2014 plunged a nation that was already wounded and divided by the war deeper into angry controversy.It led to illegal countermeasures by the White House to discredit Mr. Ellsberg, halt leaks of government information and attack perceived political enemies, forming a constellation of crimes known as the Watergate scandal that led to the disgrace and resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.And it set up a First Amendment confrontation between the Nixon administration and The New York Times, whose publication of the papers was denounced by the government as an act of espionage that jeopardized national security. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the freedom of the press.ImageMr. Ellsberg in 1971, after the release of the Pentagon Papers.Credit...Associated PressMr. Ellsberg was charged with espionage, conspiracy and other crimes and tried in federal court in Los Angeles. But on the eve of jury deliberations, the judge threw out the case, citing government misconduct, including illegal wiretapping, a break-in at the office of Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s former psychiatrist and an offer by President Nixon to appoint the judge himself as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201cThe demystification and de-sanctification of the president has begun,\u201d Mr. Ellsberg said after being released. \u201cIt\u2019s like the defrocking of the Wizard of Oz.\u201dThe story of Daniel Ellsberg in many ways mirrored the American experience in Vietnam, which began in the 1950s as a struggle to contain communism in Indochina and ended in 1975 with humiliating defeat in a corrosive war that killed more than 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians.He was a brilliant young man from Michigan who had known tragedy at 15, when his mother and sister were killed in a car crash after his father fell asleep at the wheel, and who had rallied to march through prep school, Harvard and the University of Cambridge in England with high honors and lofty, disciplined ambitions.He joined the Marines in 1954, swept through officer candidate school and extended his enlistment to ship out with his battalion to the Middle East for the Suez crisis in 1956. He saw no action, but he mustered out as a first lieutenant with firm ideas about military solutions to international problems.He earned a doctorate at Harvard, joined the RAND Corporation and began studying game theory as applied to crisis situations and nuclear warfare. In the 1960s, he conferred on Washington\u2019s responses to the Cuban missile crisis and North Vietnamese attacks on American ships in the Gulf of Tonkin.By 1964, Mr. Ellsberg was an adviser to Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. As American involvement in Vietnam deepened, he went to Saigon in 1965 to evaluate civilian pacification programs. He joined Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale, the counterinsurgency expert, and for 18 months accompanied combat patrols into the jungles and villages.A Grim RealizationWhat he saw began his transformation. It went beyond the failure to win the hearts and minds of the South Vietnamese. It was a mounting toll of civilian deaths, tortured prisoners and burned villages, a litany of brutality entered in military field reports as \u201cclear and hold operations.\u201d\u201cI saw it was all very hard on those people,\u201d he told the syndicated columnist Mary McGrory. \u201cBut I told myself that living under communism would be harder, and World War III, which I thought we were preventing, would be worse.\u201dTo Mr. McNamara, Mr. Ellsberg forecast a dismal prospect of continued death and destruction, ending perhaps in an American withdrawal and victory for North Vietnam. His reports went nowhere. But Mr. McNamara summoned him in 1967, with 35 others, to compile a history of the Vietnam conflict.Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s contribution to the study was relatively modest. But he was deeply disturbed by its sweeping conclusions: that successive presidents had widened the war while concealing the facts from Congress and the American people. Mr. Ellsberg returned to RAND in 1968, but he began quietly acting on his changing views, composing war policy statements for Senator Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential race and attending antiwar conferences.ImageMr. Ellsberg in Vietnam, where he joined Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale, the counterinsurgency expert, on combat patrols into the jungles and villages.Credit...Daniel and Patricia EllsbergIn August 1969, he went to a War Resisters League meeting at Haverford College in Pennsylvania and heard a speaker, Randy Kehler, proudly announce that he was soon going to join his friends in prison for refusing the draft.Profoundly moved, Mr. Ellsberg had reached his breaking point, as he was quoted saying in \u201cThe Right Words at the Right Time\u201d (2002), by the actress Marlo Thomas. \u201cI left the auditorium and found a deserted men\u2019s room,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat on the floor and cried for over an hour, just sobbing. The only time in my life I\u2019ve reacted to something like that.\u201dMr. Ellsberg began to oppose the war openly. He wrote letters to newspapers, joined antiwar protests, composed articles and testified at the trials of draft resisters. He also resigned from RAND, under pressure.With Anthony J. Russo Jr., a RAND colleague he had met in Vietnam, Mr. Ellsberg, who had a top-secret security clearance, photocopied the 47-volume Pentagon study. Still believing he could work within the system, Mr. Ellsberg in 1970 gave partial copies to Senator J. William Fulbright, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and others in Congress. All cautiously refused to act.Frustrated, disillusioned and aware that he might be committing a crime and could be sent to prison, Mr. Ellsberg approached Neil Sheehan, a veteran New York Times correspondent he had met in Vietnam, with the documents. The transfer was a delicate matter. In an account that was withheld at his request until after his death in 2021, Mr. Sheehan told a Times colleague, Janny Scott, a dramatic story of how he had obtained the 7,000-page scoop of a lifetime.Mr. Ellsberg, he said, first agreed to turn over the papers if The Times would publish them and do its best to protect the identity of its source. But when Mr. Sheehan arrived at an apartment in Cambridge, Mass., where the papers were stashed, Mr. Ellsberg changed the terms, saying Mr. Sheehan could study the papers and take notes, but not photocopy them. He gave Mr. Sheehan a key to the apartment and left town.Mr. Sheehan, believing the papers were \u201cthe property of the people\u201d and had been paid for with \u201cthe blood of their sons,\u201d as he said, broke the deal, had copies made and took a set to New York, where teams of Times reporters and editors worked in a hotel suite around the clock for weeks to prepare the trove of national secrets for publication. Mr. Ellsberg did not learn of Mr. Sheehan\u2019s duplicity until June 13, 1971, when The Times published the first of nine installments of excerpts and analytical articles on the Pentagon Papers. The reaction was swift.Attorney General John N. Mitchell, citing espionage and conspiracy statutes, warned The Times that it had jeopardized national security and said the newspaper faced ruinous legal action. Editors, lawyers and The Times\u2019s publisher, Arthur O. Sulzberger, conferred, and publication resumed. After the third installment, however, the Justice Department obtained an injunction, halting publication.Mr. Ellsberg, meantime, leaked the papers to other publications, including The Washington Post. The government sued. The Times and The Post carried their cases to the Supreme Court, which lifted the injunction on June 30, allowing publication to resume. The case reinforced a constitutional doctrine that the press, absent a national emergency, should not be subject to prepublication censorship.Damaging DisclosuresThe Pentagon Papers revealed not only that successive presidents had widened the war, but also that they had been aware that it was not likely to be won. The documents also disclosed rife cynicism among high officials toward the public and disregard for the enormous casualties of the war. Mr. Ellsberg called the conflict \u201can American war almost from the beginning.\u201dThe White House soon began to pursue Mr. Ellsberg, who had gone into hiding. Under President Nixon\u2019s domestic affairs adviser, John D. Ehrlichman, a unit called the \u201cplumbers\u201d was formed to plug leaks and carry out covert operations, including burglaries at the office of Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist (no damaging files were found), and in 1972 at the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. The arrest of the burglars there began an unraveling that led to Mr. Nixon\u2019s resignation in 1974.Mr. Ellsberg, who surrendered, and Mr. Russo, his colleague, were charged with espionage, conspiracy and other crimes carrying a total of 115 years in prison. After a procedural mistrial in 1972, they were tried in 1973 before Judge William M. Byrne Jr. in federal court in Los Angeles. Before the case went to the jury, however, the judge dismissed all the charges on the grounds of government misconduct.ImageAnthony J. Russo Jr., left, and Mr. Ellsberg outside the federal court in Los Angeles in 1973 after Judge William M. Byrne Jr. dismissed all the charges against them. Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s wife, Patricia, was at right.Credit...Associated PressJudge Byrne said that G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, who engineered the Watergate burglary, had broken into the office of Lewis J. Fielding, Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s former psychiatrist, in a failed attempt to find damaging evidence against him; that the F.B.I. had illegally wiretapped Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s conversations; and that during the trial Mr. Ehrlichman had offered the judge the directorship of the F.B.I.While Mr. Nixon resigned and Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Ehrlichman and other Watergate figures went to prison, Mr. Ellsberg continued to be active in the antiwar movement, speaking at rallies and campuses across the nation. He also advocated disarmament and spoke against nuclear weapons, and he was arrested in 1976 with others in a demonstration outside the Pentagon.After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Ellsberg denounced President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Afghanistan in a hunt for Osama bin Laden, who was blamed for the attacks, and to suppress a fanatical Taliban regime that sheltered terrorists. He was also scathingly critical of the United States-led war in Iraq, which in nearly nine years of conflict claimed thousands of American lives and by some estimates cost $2 trillion.Mr. Ellsberg was the author of many articles in newspapers and magazines, and of several books, including \u201cPapers on the War\u201d (1972) and \u201cSecrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers\u201d (2002). \u201cSecrets\u201d won several awards and was praised by reviewers, including Tran Van Dinh in The Christian Century, who called it \u201cthe moving story of an enlightened citizen who dared to speak truth to power and had faith in the protection afforded him by the Bill of Rights.\u201dIn 2021, at a time of renewed tensions between the United States and China over Taiwan, Mr. Ellsberg made headlines by highlighting a long-classified government study that he had secretly copied. The report indicated that the Pentagon drew up plans for a nuclear strike on China in 1958 when Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces began shelling islands controlled by Taipei in the Straits of Taiwan. The crisis ebbed when China broke off the attacks, leaving the islands in control of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s nationalist Republic of China.Hailed for \u2018Moral Courage\u2019Mr. Ellsberg\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear Planner\u201d (2017), which drew on his time in the 1950s and \u201960s with the RAND Corporation and the Pentagon, described an era of terrifying nuclear proliferation and hair-trigger controls, and sounded an impassioned warning that the perils of a nuclear holocaust still existed. Graham Allison, in a review for The Times, praised \u201cEllsberg\u2019s effort to make vivid the genuine madness of the \u2018doomsday machine,\u2019 and the foolishness of betting our survival on mutually assured destruction.\u201dMr. Ellsberg was awarded Sweden\u2019s 2018 Olof Palme Prize for \u201cprofound humanism and exceptional moral courage.\u201dDaniel Ellsberg was born in Chicago on April 7, 1931, to Harry and Adele (Charsky) Ellsberg. His father, a structural engineer, moved the family in 1937 to Detroit, where Daniel grew up. His mother hoped he would become a concert pianist and required him to practice many hours a day, despite his clear lack of enthusiasm. His mother and sister were killed in a car wreck on a Fourth of July outing in 1946.ImageMr. Ellsberg in 2006. He once said of his epiphany in 1969: \u201cThere was at this time no question in my mind that my government was involved in an unjust war that was going to continue and get larger.\u201dCredit...Jonas Ekstromer/European Pressphoto AgencyOn a scholarship, he attended Cranbrook, a prep school in suburban Detroit, and graduated first in his class. At Harvard, again attending on a scholarship, he edited a literary magazine, was on the editorial board of the campus newspaper The Crimson and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics, with high honors, in 1952. He then received a fellowship to study advanced economics at King's College, Cambridge, and he returned to Harvard in 1953 for a master\u2019s degree in economics.In 1951, he married Carol Cummings, the daughter of a retired Marine Corps brigadier general. The couple had two children, Robert and Mary Carroll Ellsberg, before divorcing in the mid-1960s. In 1970, he married Patricia Marx, a toy company heiress and longtime antiwar activist. They had a son, Michael.He is survived by his wife, his children, five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.After his Marine Corps service, he joined the RAND Corporation in 1958 to study war games, and in 1962 he received his doctorate in economics from Harvard. By 1969, he had begun to confront the Vietnam War\u2019s moral issues.

Then Gravel went on a filibuster to prevent funding of the Vietnam war, and he chose to read the Pentagon papers aloud in the filibuster. By doing so, he ensured that they would legally be accessible to the public, because they were now part of the congressional record.replyanigbrowl 9 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]This sort of political courage is sorely lacking nowadays.

It was called \"The Doomsday Doctrine\", it was about the policy of mutually assured distruction. I remember he talked about the difference between \"their bomb is in the air, so we're launching\" and \"their bomb has exploded, we're launching\". Politicians vacillate between the two, when history shows us that they are very, very different. Airplanes and bombers encourage the latter, while missile silos encourage the former. This makes missile silos a severe liability, as they encourage first-steike launches.I remember talking to him briefly after the talk. It impressed me how decisive, opinionated, and well-thought-out he was, at his age.He liked my T-shirt, which said \"Statistics means never having to say you're certain.\"I'm glad I got a chance to meet such an important and positive figure in US history.replyisx726552 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]If anyone has not read Ellsberg\u2019s 2017 book \u201cThe Doomsday Machine\u201d, I highly recommend it. It covers his work and knowledge regarding potential nuclear war within US policy which was the main reason he wanted to become a whistleblower. Within the book he discuses numerous problems with US command and control procedures for launching nuclear attacks and even calls the movie \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d a \u201cdocumentary\u201d (tongue in cheek) because of its satirical yet accurate highlighting of these issues.

Hid them in a black plastic bag on the edge of the town dump, then a freak storm washed that whole section of the dump down a hill.

But, can I point out it is the same Daniel Ellsberg as in \"The Ellsberg paradox\" [0]?I have an urn with 30 red balls and 30 green balls. You can pick a color, and you get 10$ if you guessed the next ball I pull out of the urn correctly. Alternatively, I have another urn with an unknown amount of red and green balls in them. You could also choose to use this urn with a color of your choice, if you want?Which of these 4 options do you pick?It turns out that people overwhelmingly prefer the first urn. They have an aversion to epistemic uncertainty, even though from utility theory, all 4 options are equivalent. Even weirder, if we would have played this game repeatedly, the second urn is clearly preferable. Then why do we have this intuition?The experiment from his paper is slightly different and (in my opinion) harder to understand, but the sketch above illustrates the same paradox between what utility theory tells us is the best decision, and what we intuitively decide.Do note that he was working at the RAND corporation at the time, where they were running probabilistic simulations of the cold war, the so called Cold War games. (People were literally throwing dice all day to run the simulations of the various nuclear war scenarios). His paradox was a critique to that method, as we don't actually know the probabilities involved in these nuclear scenarios, in the same way as we don't know the amount of red and green balls in one of the urns.Therefore, we might want to discredit decisions based on scenarios where we don't have good estimates of the probabilities of the outcomes, in favour of scenarios where we do know them.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradoxreplyHermitian909 6 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Like many \"thought experiment paradoxes\" I think this makes perfect sense if you get out of the habit of thinking too abstractly.The mathematical assumption is that for the urn with the unknown number of red and green balls all distributions are equally likely and so P(red) = 0.5. But why should I assume they're all equally likely other than that it is part of the problem construction?The reason I prefer the known distribution is because this is a contrived game and my experience with contrived games has conditioned me to expect a \"trick\" such that I am somehow disadvantaged to lose in a way that is not clear to me. Perhaps whoever set up the game knows my favorite color is green. In probabilistic terms I have a Bayesian prior influencing my choice.In order to answer this paradox \"correctly\" I need to rely on my experience contrived problems like this to recognize I'm expected to abstract the problem and pretend that my prior does not exist. I find if you resist the urge to abstract in this way a stunningly large proportion of philosophical paradoxes cease to be paradoxes.replycubefox 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This explanation (suspected deception/trickery) is mentioned in the Wikipedia article, after the \"info-gap\" explanation:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox#Possible_expl...However, it does seem plausible to me that people would prefer the first urn even if they didn't suspect any trickery.replyfuryofantares 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The first option makes sense to me. Both choices have the same expected value; I understand that, but I also feel it's more likely I have misunderstood something about the second option. I'm crystal clear on the first.Literally any tiebreaker for \"which of these options with all the same value\" seems fine, I do have to make a decision after all. And I think I'd be slightly skeptical that the experimenter is trying to trick me in some way with the second option in the unlikely case that I've misunderstood it.replycubefox 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]But presumably people would pick the first urn even if it had a bit worse expected utility than the second. Say, the green ball wins, and you can choose between either drawing from an urn with 29 green and 31 red balls, or drawing from an urn with an unknown number of red and green balls. The Wikipedia article says that people have active ambiguity aversion, not just that they use ambiguity as a tie breaker.reply6gvONxR4sf7o 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I agree this seems to be the reason. The second urn has a more uncertain return in the same way that I'm uncertain about the 98th digit of pi.

However, the Ellsberg paradox only says we prefer known distributions to unknown ones, and under repetition the distributions of both urns would be known. So it doesn't say people would prefer betting on the first urn in the repetition case.reply317070 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It is the case if the balls are being put back. As you play more games, you would figure out the proportion of red and green balls in the second urn.

Then the Ellsberg paradox does no longer apply.reply317070 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, but why do we intuitively avoid epistemic uncertainty, even though it is something which can only _give_ us an edge here?To make clear: playing this game with an urn which has an equal amount of red and green balls, is the worst case scenario when you get to pick the colour that wins. The second urn can only be the same or better, whether or not you can figure out any information about the balls in it.replycubefox 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It can only give us an edge in the repetition case.

You can just guess that the next ball will be the color that was most common among previous drawings.With the 30/30 red/green urn, on the other hand, you don't really have a much greater edge than 50%, at least in the early phases. In the later phases, perhaps you could count balls to get an edge, unless the balls are put back in the urn after being drawn.replymichaelt 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]When the game is repeated, does the second urn always have the same distribution of balls?replydjbusby 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Can you add any more?

Daniel Ellsberg certainly deserves a historical memorial for what he exposed to the public about the idiocies of the Vietnam War, but it was just the tip of the iceberg. For example, experimental biological warfare was a feature of the US attack on North Korea, and that program was originated in 1942 (*Merck Report) and expanded via information from Shiro Ishii (captured war criminal who turned over records of Unit 731, the Japanese biological warfare unit active in China, to US spies and hence to Fort Detrick.) The US biological warfare program was actively connected to the CIA's MK-ULTRA brainwashing/torture program which operated domestically during the 1960s, involving use of LSD and similar drugs to manipulate people (likely involved in the Charles Manson debacle). Biological warfare and chemical warfare testing exploded during the 1960s under JFK and Johnson, and was only (publicly) shut down by Nixon after the disastrous 5,000 sheep kill outside Dugway Utah via a VX gas oopsie.They were all insane back then, and they still are trying to hide a lot of what they got up to back then from public scrutiny. Of course it didn't end there, the 9/18 and 10/8 anthrax attacks walked out of US government programs aimed at replicating the Soviet biowarfare programs of the 1970s/1980s, and out of those attacks came Project Bioshield... I think that gave Anthony Fauci's career a boost, and led to financing of gain of function research in North Carolina and Wuhan, China, and of course chimeric virus recombination was a long-standing dream of the biological warfare establishment, though the methods they were trying to use to accomplish that in the 1980s were pretty sloppy compared to today's CRISPR approaches.Everything is connected, at some level. Keep leaking their dirty secrets, I'm going to go toast Ellsberg now.replykepler1 8 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Here's a philosophical (?) topic I would love to hear opinions on the occasion of remembering Ellsberg's contributions.Some would say that the transparency of revealing the Pentagon papers caused us as a people for the first time (debatable of course) to not fundamentally trust that the government usually does the right thing.(In the general public perception sense. There were and always would be groups discontent or not trusting the state was acting in their interests on specific issues. But this was a large scale violation of people's beliefs, some might say.)But for the first time (again, debatable), the government was shown to be covering up the national disgrace of the very important and big topic of Vietnam for face saving, and sacrificing lives in the process. And that this was just people at the top muddling through really important topics.And this was important for a people to know, and understand that they could check government like this.So... however --I wonder, is there something such as too much transparency for a country's people, in the face of the reality of who your international competitors are, in a modern information age?When governments can control information, they are much more able to sweep certain things under the rug, unify a people with partial information, and embark on war, other issues that dismiss or hide the many layers of truth or actions. And every issue is always complicated by who it helps and hurts. In a huge democracy, there will always be someone hurt by some decision.When you have competitor countries who are not committed to such whistleblowing, sharing of information, freedom of press, and their people are able to be unified towards some goals while smaller issues are swept under the rug. Is our country by comparison paralyzed from doing great things, because any great thing will have endless \"complainers\" once all the details are known because of our freedom of information and above mistrust of government?Basically, is there conceivably a bad or unintended consequence of so much freedom of the press to check government? Has too much democracy been a hinderance (or will it be when some important issue presents itself) to the progress of a democracy?replypphysch 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]In a democratic system, the point of whistleblowing and journalism is not to expose secrets that could put lives at risk, but to hold powerful people accountable for their actions.The latter people spend a lot of resources conflating the two. They manufacture the illusion that they are necessarily operating for the public interest, and therefore the only reason why their secret operations are secret is to keep people safe. By extension, guys like Assange are clearly criminals for violating that secrecy.In reality, in the cases of Ellsberg, Manning, Snowden (et al.), we learned that our governments were not operating in the public interest. The Vietnam and Iraq invasions were insane and wasteful, enriching the pockets and hegemonic fantasies of a tiny elite at the cost of real American lives (and countless other lives).replyavgcorrection 8 hours ago [flagged] | parent | prev | next [\u2013]No.replyDaniFong 8 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]black linereplyChrisArchitect 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Leaving in \",Who Leaked the Pentagon Papers,\" from the title would have been helpful for those that don't knowreplydang 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]True, but there are advantages to leaving a little work for the reader.https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor...replypx43 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If you don't know who Daniel Ellsberg is, you probably don't know what the Pentagon Papers are either.replyKarellen 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm not familiar with that many details of USA political history, I didn't really know who Daniel Ellsberg is (the name sounds somewhat familiar, but I might be getting them confused with someone else?), and I didn't know what the Pentagon Papers are.But \"the Pentagon Papers\" sound important (kind of like the Panama Papers or the Paradise Papers, and may even be the trope namer?) and \"who leaked the Pentagon Papers\" sounds like an interesting story that I might want to learn more about.\"Someone who is famous in some way but you've never heard of has died\" is a much weaker pull.

Foreign exchange trading focuses on one number, while equities are weakly connected and fixed income is deeply connected.\n- The book \"Pricing Money\" provides a beginner's guide to understanding money markets, government bonds, futures, swaps, options, and foreign exchange.\n- The online edition of the book is now available for free with a request for a review or comment on social media.\n- Money markets are used to offset the payment system, allowing banks to lend and borrow money from each other at different interest rates and maturities.\n- Government bonds are issued by governments to borrow money from the financial markets, with fixed coupon payments and a final principal payment at maturity.\n- Yield is the effective interest rate of a bond, and it is inversely related to the bond's price. Longer-dated bonds have higher price sensitivity to changes in yield.\n- Repo is a form of collateralized borrowing used in the bond market, reducing credit risk and lowering the interest rate.\n- The yield curve represents the relationship between the yields of different bond maturities and is influenced by expectations of future interest rates.\n- Strips are created by separating a bond's cashflows into separate tradable securities, allowing investors to customize their cashflow streams.\n- Futures contracts provide a standardized way to trade assets in the future, with a central counterparty mitigating credit risk. They are traded on various underlying assets, including commodities, government bonds, and indices.\n- Understanding these concepts is important for anyone interested in the financial markets and managing risk.a key player in the foreign exchange market. CLS provides settlement services for foreign exchange transactions, reducing settlement risk and increasing efficiency.\n\nForex traders focus on currency pairs, such as EUR/USD or GBP/JPY. The exchange rate between two currencies is determined by a variety of factors, including interest rates, economic indicators, and geopolitical events.\n\nCentral banks play a crucial role in the foreign exchange market by implementing monetary policy and intervening in the market to stabilize their currency's value.\n\nCurrency options are a popular tool in the foreign exchange market, allowing traders to hedge against currency risk or speculate on future exchange rate movements. Options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a currency at a predetermined price within a specific time frame.\n\nForeign exchange trading is highly liquid and operates on a 24-hour basis, with trading sessions in major financial centers around the world. The global forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market, with average daily trading volume in the trillions of dollars.\n\nFluctuations in exchange rates can have a significant impact on import/export businesses, multinational corporations, and global investors. It is important for market participants to closely monitor and analyze economic data, news events, and market trends to make informed trading decisions.- The FX market is an important part of the financial market, allowing importers, exporters, and investors to trade in different currencies.\n- Shearstatt Bank collapse in 1974 led to the development of the CLS system, which reduced settlement risk in the FX market.\n- The FX market is fast-moving, with large daily turnover and electronic trading becoming increasingly popular.\n- Forward contracts are commonly used in the FX market to trade currencies for non-standard settlement dates.\n- Foreign exchange markets also involve the trading of options, including exotic options with barriers or knockouts.\n- Governments, corporations, pension funds, insurers, banks, and private investors are all important players in the FX market.\n- Proprietary traders, market makers, salespeople, researchers, brokers, and investment bankers play distinct roles in the financial industry.\n- Understanding price action in fixed-income markets is important and can be driven by factors such as interest rates, economic data, and supply and demand dynamics.\n- Market crashes present both risks and opportunities for traders and investors, and trading strategies can be influenced by economic factors and market sentiment.- The post discusses the concept of credit risk in swaps and how it can be reduced through credit improvement strategies such as collateralization, break clauses, recouponing, and SwapClear.\n- It explains the concept of basis swaps and how they allow for the exchange of floating-rate deposits in different currencies.\n- The post also discusses the process of bringing a new bond to the market, including the role of the syndicate desk and the different types of bonds and selling restrictions.\n- It explains the concept of duration and how it measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in yield.\n- The post also introduces DV01, which measures the dollar value of a 0.01% move in yield, and how it relates to duration.\n- Examples of yield curve trades, such as flattening and barbell strategies, are discussed.\n- The concept of carry, or the profit or loss resulting from the passage of time, is explained.\n- The post also touches on bond futures and their role in the interest-rate markets.- Bond futures are complicated derivatives listed on exchanges, and they are important instruments in financial markets.\n- Bond futures are different from other futures contracts in that they are based on a basket of US Treasuries rather than a single security.\n- The deliverable bonds in a bond future must meet certain criteria, such as maturity between 6.5 and 10 years.\n- Conversion factors are used to determine the invoice price at delivery, taking into account the different coupon rates of the deliverable bonds.\n- The short (seller) in a bond future chooses which bond to deliver based on which one is cheapest to deliver (CTD).\n- The CTD can vary depending on the price of the bond future, with shorter deliverable bonds being favored when prices are above par and longer deliverable bonds being favored when prices are below par.\n- The price of the delivery option, known as the basis net of carry (BNOC), is actively traded and can affect the price of the bond future.\n- The risk of both longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) can change over the course of delivery, causing adjustments to their positions.\n- Various market conventions exist, such as Act/360 and Act/365, for calculating the proportion of a year and accrued interest on bonds.\n- Rough calculations can be made to estimate yields and prices based on known data, such as the duration of a bond or the yield differentials between different bonds.\n- Bond futures are complex instruments that require understanding of market conventions and calculations to effectively trade and manage risk.",

We would handle this request and any retaliation attempts here in this modmail chain immediately.Our goal is to work with the existing mod team to find a path forward and make sure your subreddit is made available for the community which makes its home here. If you are not able or willing to reopen and maintain the community, please let us know.On Thursday, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The Verge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have problems with protests.\u201d According to NBC News, Huffman \u201cplans to pursue changes\u201d that would let regular users vote moderators out more easily. Though the protest, which included more than 8,000 subreddits at peak, was initially planned to last for only two days, many subreddits vowed to stay dark indefinitely, including popular communities like r/music, r/videos, and r/nba, which remained dark even during the NBA championship game. More than 4,000 subreddits remain closed.RelatedReddit \u2018was never designed to support third-party apps,\u201d says CEOReddit CEO Steve Huffman isn\u2019t backing down: our full interviewReddit protest updates: all the news about the API changes infuriating RedditorsMods were already worried. Reddit said in a fact sheet on Thursday that it is \u201cnot shutting down discussions or unilaterally reopening communities,\u201d but the admin account u/ModCodeofConduct said the company can remove mods that violate Reddit\u2019s Mod Code of Conduct and replace them.\u201cIf a moderator team unanimously decides to stop moderating, we will invite new, active moderators to keep these spaces open and accessible to users,\u201d u/ModCodeofConduct wrote. And on Thursday evening, spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt confirmed that moderators of subreddits going dark to protest the upcoming API price changes can be in violation of the code of conduct.In a pinned message on r/funny, the biggest subreddit to go private before recently reopening, a moderator implored Reddit \u201cto listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users\u201d and asked it to \u201cnot tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers.\u201d r/Apple also recently reopened after being closed out of fears that it would be forcibly reopened. \u201cWe want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up \u2014 or have it opened for us,\u201d a moderator wrote. Another r/Apple mod is resigning in protest of Reddit\u2019s actions.\u201cWe have not threatened anyone,\u201d Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we operate. Pressuring people is not our goal. We\u2019re communicating expectations and how things work. Redditors want to reddit and mods want to mod. We want mods who want to mod to be able to do so.\u201dThe messages seen by The Verge were sent to moderators of some major subreddits, including r/funny and r/aww, which are two of the most subscribed subreddits on the platform. (As far as we are aware, r/funny is the second-most subscribed, while r/aww is the fifth.) r/funny had been closed in protest but reopened this morning; r/aww is viewable but is in a restricted mode.On Tuesday, an internal memo sent by Huffman seemed to minimize the protest and its potential impact on the company. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise with this one. Among the noisiest we\u2019ve seen,\u201d the note read. \u201cPlease know that our teams are on it, and like all blowups on Reddit, this one will pass as well.\u201dHere is one of the messages seen by The Verge that was sent to moderators:Hi everyoneWe wanted to ensure that you are aware that the API update does not impact moderation bots or sitewide tools to control spam or remove harmful content. You can find more details in this article in our help center. You may have seen posts or received messages from users telling these tools are going away or are somehow impacted, but this is not the case.We are also aware that some members of your mod team have expressed that they want to close your community indefinitely. We are reaching out to find out if this is the consensus reached by the mod team.Subreddits exist for the benefit of the community of users who come to them for support and belonging and in the end, moderators are stewards of these spaces and in a position of trust. Your users rely on your community for information, support, entertainment, and finding connection with others who have similar interests. Ensuring that communities are able to remain stable and actively moderated is incredibly important to the people seeking out these spaces to make and foster connections.If there are mods here who are willing to work towards reopening this community, we are willing to work with you to process a Top Mod Removal request or reorder the mod team to achieve this goal if mods higher up the list are hindering reopening.

    "content": "MOBILEELECTRONICSBATTERYEUROPEAN UNIONEuropean Union votes to bring back replaceable phone batteriesSleek slabs could soon be a thing of the pastBy Shawn Knight Today 11:15 AM 22 commentsTechSpot is celebrating its 25th anniversary. TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust.Why it matters: What's old is new again, at least in the European Union. The European Parliament recently voted in favor of new legislation that would overhaul the entire battery life cycle, from design to end-of-life, which includes important caveats for smartphone users.Among the many changes, the new rules would require batteries in consumer devices like smartphones to be easily removable and replaceable. That's far from the case today with most phones, but that wasn't always the case.In the earlier days of mobile phones (think Nokia 5190, Nokia 3310, Motorola Razr V3, Palm Treo 700p), swapping out the battery took mere seconds. Charging technology wasn't all that fast, and it wasn't uncommon to carry around a spare battery pack to switch out when your primary battery got low.Most batteries were standalone modular units that could be traded out by releasing a latch and sliding it out, kind of like the battery on cordless power tools today. For phones with \"internal\" batteries, you'd simply pop off the rear cover of the device, lift the battery out, put a fresh one in, and button it back up.Manufacturers eventually moved away from easily swappable batteries in favor of \"sealed\" handsets sporting sleeker designs. Many consumers were vocal about the change but over time, most accepted it as the new norm and moved on. The EU's new rules could force manufacturers to open up the history books for ideas on how to move forward.This is not the first time the EU has prompted a rethink. Last year, the EU set a deadline of December 28, 2024, for phones and other small electronic devices to include a USB-C port for charging. That's a problem for Apple considering the iPhone uses a proprietary Lightning port. Apple has already confirmed that it'll comply with the mandate, meaning we could see this year's batch of new iPhones ship with USB-C (or next year's iPhones, at the latest) \u2013 at least, in the EU.Image credit: David Ballew, Tyler Lastovich22 comments15K likes and sharesTech Jobs: Find the next step in your careerRelated StoriesScientists cook up a rechargeable battery that's safe to eatThe EU could ban Huawei from its 5G networksModder adds (more like glues) 30,000mAh battery to a Samsung phoneThe EU tells social media companies that AI-generated content should be labeledFeatured on TechSpotAlmost everyone wins in the business of selling used smartphonesNokia: you can replace this phone's screen in 20 minutesMOST READ52 commentsIntel announces biggest processor rebranding in 15 years ahead of Meteor Lake launch8 commentsHow to Download Videos From YouTube, TikTok and Instagram21 commentsThe Biden administration to car companies: ignore the right-to-repair law, it's a safety risk36 commentsWindows is reportedly force-installing graphics drivers, ignoring user settings",

    "content": "DevOps started as a well-intentioned set of practices and culture.Over the years, it has devolved into an unholy beast of division and tunnel vision. Why did we stop dreaming bigger? What happened to tearing down silos, increasing engineering velocity, and adding value? Remember? The things DevOps was supposed to do?But the reality is, outside of FAANG and the most well-funded companies, your team is probably doing one of the following:1. You\u2019ve got a DevOps team.Congrats, that\u2019s not DevOps. I\u2019d wager most of what they are doing is using Terraform and YAML to do menial tasks for the engineering team.Need a database? File a ticket with DevOps.Need an IAM role? File a ticket with DevOps.Before long, your massive team of engineers has fully saturated your understaffed \u201cDevOps\u201d team\u2019s backlog.This approach does not scale.2. You\u2019re doing DevOps, but it feels like shit.DevOps, the free-for-all where each engineer does the necessary ops to do their job.Best practices? We\u2019ll invent them along the way!Secure? I\u2019m too busy increasing conversion rates!Naming conventions? Nah. NAH. nah-prod. PROD-NAH. PRODUCTION-NAHCost management? Deleting unused cloud resources? Nope, we\u2019ve got AWS credits to burn! \ud83d\udd25The problem is most engineers don\u2019t want to do operations work.They want to build the product. They want to add tangible value. But organizations will force this upon them, and engineers will either work with what they\u2019ve already got, guess their way through some new cloud service, or the DevOps tasks will slowly become the responsibility of a few individuals that become the \u201cDevOps\u201d team.The worst part of this scenario is that deadlines rule, and product stakeholders don\u2019t see ops.When was the last time you saw a product manager high-five the ops person and say, \u2018fast fucking autoscaler!\u2019?Slowly your team feels the malleable nature of DevOps stagnate into rigid infrastructure as teams stop making the hard operations decisions and just bend their software around what they have.In the end, all infrastructure eventually becomes a platform - how easy is yours to change?Operations is a Commodity; Let\u2019s Act Like ItI\u2019ve been on the operations side of engineering for a long time. I\u2019ve been developing in Ruby since Rails 1.0. Before that, I wrote some of the trashiest PHP the world has seen. I had the opportunity to migrate from a data center to AWS EC2 when it was launched in 2006. As I\u2019ve become more experienced in operations, I was \u201cpigeonholed\u201d into the \u201cDevOps\u201d role.To date, I\u2019ve deployed over 200 production-grade Kubernetes clusters across a handful of companies.Want to know a secret?I\u2019ve copied and pasted the same damn Terraform modules for every single one. My job felt like a scam, but companies pay me for my expertise in Kubernetes, not for writing Terraform. I had built a copy-paste-driven, single-user platform-as-a-service and no one cared so long as nothing was broken.You\u2019ve made it this far, so I\u2019m just going to say it:The companies building \u201cDevOps\u201d teams are going in the right direction, but they need to be moving away from infrastructure configuration management and towards platform engineering and enabling developer self-service.The knowledge silos are good. The silos are a feature, not a bug.Expertise is a good thing.DevOps is bullshit.How \u201cOps\u201d Breaks the LoopContinuous advancement through teamwork, efficiency in communication, elevated morale, leaving the door open to suggestions for betterment\u2026 sign me up, right?This model worked when the cloud was simple. It made sense, even. Back when we had a few virtual machines, maybe an S3 bucket and a couple of queues, this loop was achievable. What threw a wrench in everything was the growing complexity of our systems, the operational burden of those systems, and compliance. For many organizations, operations teams inevitably become DevOps gatekeepers at every phase of the loop.PlanningPlanning today requires knowledge and trade-offs of cloud services. As the cloud has gotten more complex, teams are left with a few options: work with what they\u2019ve got or sync with ops to see what their backlog looks like.Organizations that have invested in platform engineering have either a golden path already identified or enable teams to research and develop new golden paths rapidly. This flexibility is key to a great platform. We aren\u2019t building \u201cgolden roads\u201d, they are paths. Golden paths should provide direction and guardrails but be adaptable when the business needs change.CodingCoding is becoming more and more of a hodge-podge of cloud APIs. This is a good thing! We should want to write and run less code.Do you know what\u2019s worse than waiting through an ops backlog during the planning phase? Missing your deadline and working late because you\u2019re waiting for someone on the ops team to update IAM policies and create KMS keys because you didn\u2019t realize the SNS Topics were in a different region than your SQS Queues.A great internal developer platform has conventions in place to handle the small tedious bits of the cloud, like IAM and KMS, that take the most amount of time to address. They focus on an engineer\u2019s intentions, not making engineers worry over implementation details.Build, test, release, and deployAh yes, CI/CD. The fuzzy boundary between development and production. These phases are so fraught with bullshit that they\u2019ve become meme-worthy:But it\u2019s not an \u201cops problem\u201d, it\u2019s an entire organization problem. I\u2019m convinced that the CI/CD phase is the root of where frustration and division grow between operations and engineering teams.Take this fairly common example:In production, we are running in containers, but developing in the container is too slow, so the team leans towards asdf and a README full of stuff to copy, paste, and pray. During a sprint, an engineer adds convert (ImageMagick) to the mix to support manipulating images and forgets to update the Dockerfile, and then production goes down.This is where trust between developers and operations begins to erode.Internal developer platforms should allow an engineer to run their application where they want, how they want. Lambda and Docker, sure. K8s + Buildpacks, sure. VMs and a tarball, sure.Unfortunately, many of the platforms today force developers to run on Kubernetes. A great developer platform meets engineers where they are. It should be flexible in architecture but opinionated in self-service.Operate and MonitorThe final stages of this \u201cperfect\u201d loop model are arguably where Ops should be. That\u2019d be great, except now we\u2019ve got SREs to cover that. Huh.If the \u201cDevOps\u201d team ships a Postgres RDS instance it will run fine forever, that is until an application starts using it. All of a sudden a cascade of N+1s hit, the CPU spikes, and queries grind to a halt. Who is woken up? And why does this always happen at 2 AM? In this scenario, there is nothing for operations personnel to do, yet here they are.Do you still think DevOps is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do?The expertise that operations and SRE teams have is critical to developing secure, scalable systems, but the old idea of \u201cDevOps\u201d and the hurdles our industry has turned it into is holding us back.It\u2019s Time to Bury DevOpsI\u2019ve spent a good portion of the last two years talking to teams about their cloud infrastructure and DevOps processes/culture. I\u2019ve heard the above rant in some form from team after team. What\u2019s more concerning about the state of DevOps today are some of the other things I\u2019ve heard\u2026Show of hands\u2014how many people in your organization think CI/CD is DevOps?Show of hands\u2014how many people in your organization think they don\u2019t need DevOps because they run serverless?Show of hands\u2014how many of you think the above two interpretations are a problem?To most, the term \u201cDevOps\u201d has completely lost its meaning.If you\u2019re really really doing DevOps, do you think reinventing all of that commodity is really worth your engineering team\u2019s time? Is that a good investment for the business?\u201cYou build it, you run it.\u201d Pffffft. More like: You build it, but it takes longer than your sprint estimate, and you cut corners on the ops bit that doesn\u2019t fit your \u201cdefinition of done.\u201dKnowledge silos and expertise are two sides of the same coin. From full stack engineering to DevOps practitioner, our industry loves to pretend everyone can do everything. We\u2019re an industry of hobbyists. We love to tinker. I don\u2019t know if we are fooling ourselves or if the industry has been exploiting our hobby-driven nature, but it\u2019s time for DevOps to get thrown out of an airlock.The growing zeitgeist is that \u201cplatform engineering is the future.\u201d And given that I co-founded a product in the space, I sure hope so! Unfortunately, organizations can\u2019t get there by expecting the \u201cDevOps\u201d team to do it. I\u2019m sorry, but copy/pasting some Terraform modules between your git repos is a terrible \u201cplatform.\u201d Your engineers don\u2019t want to deal with it, and inevitably your ops team will be on the hook for supporting it. Hell, even HashiCorp is jumping on the \u201cno code\u201d provisioning train for their \u201cplease contact sales\u201d plan. Huh, seems like all these companies with enterprise bucks are struggling too.So how does the average organization get to the promised land of Platform Engineering?Simple, just hire some more frontend and backend engineers to develop a great internal PaaS with all the golden paths your operations team is architecting while you are trying to build your actual product that runs on top of it.Obviously easier said than done.To get there, many organizations will need a reality check.For every operations person without software development skills, there are FORTY engineers without cloud operations skills. If you are going to build an internal platform, you\u2019ll need experts with overlapping experience in both fields working together.You are also going to need a shitload of time and budget. This isn\u2019t a hackathon project. It isn\u2019t the pet project of the new CTO with a wild hair up their ass to plant their flag on the business. You can give it a cute \u201cskunkworks\u201d name to show everyone you have access to Wikipedia too, but building an internal platform is a startup within your primary business. Building an internal development platform is like changing the tires and engine of a car while it is hurtling toward a cliff.Stay agile.Migrate an auxiliary service to it quickly.Get feedback from your engineering customers.Yeah. ENGINEERING CUSTOMERS. They aren\u2019t your team anymore. They are your business\u2019s second set of customers, but if these customers aren\u2019t buying it, you end up with morale problems, engineers pining for \u201cthe old way,\u201d a boatload of debt, and a bunch of wasted time and effort.Chin up! You or the new CTO\u2019s next team can get it done.What\u2019s in a Great Internal Developer Platform?If you are planning to build a platform, there are five core components that are required, but in our experience, there are a few more attributes that make for a great platform.Extendable with open-source tooling. Teams and workloads are different and will have different golden paths. If an IDP has one opinionated way to run your workload, it is no better than a PaaS. An abstraction over Kubernetes is not enough. IDPs must work for all workload types, whether containerized, serverless, or virtualized.Anti-Lock-In, you should be able to walk away from a bad build-or-buy decision without risking production or having an arduous migration process.Security, compliance, and guardrails must be built in. Without them, you are not enabling self-service, you are enabling disservice. The fastest way to derail self-service is a CISO worrying about a breach. A simple web form or YAML abstraction over an AWS or GCP API is not enough. Expertise in practices and security must be included.Powerful building blocks to increase engineering velocity. We have an industry-wide shortage of expertise in the cloud space, a great IDP should have safe, dependable building blocks for designing cloud services quickly.Enable experimentation through flexibility and extensibility. If you have to reach for another tool or platform to see how your app would work in a serverless container or with a different Pub/Sub system, you are going to receive pushback from your stakeholders in your IDP. IDPs must enable experimentation so the right decisions can be made for our applications.Ephemeral environments for applications and infrastructure must be supported. Our applications are becoming so heavily dependent on cloud services. If you can\u2019t provision dependencies like buckets, queues, or databases, when you open a pull request, then are you really getting a close approximation to production?Configurable alerting and monitoring for provisioned infrastructure and applications with good defaults. If engineers can deploy their own resources, they must be monitored without requiring an extra tool to configure. Otherwise, the likelihood that those resources have alerts configured will decrease significantly.Platform engineering is possible, and it is the future. Our systems are getting more complicated and higher scale earlier as more and more parts of the world get online. We\u2019re creating great new engineers daily out of boot camps, but we aren\u2019t excelling in operational maturity as an industry. We have a lot of data to protect. We are stewards of personal information. Customers assume we have a fiduciary responsibility, but we mostly act like hobbyists. We need to make sure \u201cplatform engineering\u201d is the next bullshit buzzword.devops idp developer platforms cloud infrastructure platform engineering See alsoChangelog - First Deployment Onboarding FlowKubeflow guide: Part 1Changelog - App First Design 2023-04-06Changelog - Metrics and Connections RecommendationsThe CIDR problem, and how we fixed it",
