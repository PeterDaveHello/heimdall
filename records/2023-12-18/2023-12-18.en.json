    "originBody": "The Final Speech from The Great Dictator I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost… The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish… Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite! Final speech from The Great Dictator Copyright © Roy Export S.A.S. All rights reserved The Great Dictator was Chaplin’s first film with dialogue. Chaplin plays both a little Jewish barber, living in the ghetto, and Hynkel, the dictator ruler of Tomainia. In his autobiography Chaplin quotes himself as having said: “One doesn’t have to be a Jew to be anti Nazi. All one has to be is a normal decent human being.” Chaplin and Hitler were born within a week of one another. “There was something uncanny in the resemblance between the Little Tramp and Adolf Hitler, representing opposite poles of humanity, ” writes Chaplin biographer David Robinson, reproducing an unsigned article from The Spectator dated 21st April 1939: “Providence was in an ironical mood when, fifty years ago this week, it was ordained that Charles Chaplin and Adolf Hitler should make their entry into the world within four days of each other….Each in his own way has expressed the ideas, sentiments, aspirations of the millions of struggling citizens ground between the upper and the lower millstone of society. (…) Each has mirrored the same reality – the predicament of the “little man” in modern society. Each is a distorting mirror, the one for good, the other for untold evil.” Chaplin spent many months drafting and re-writing the speech for the end of the film, a call for peace from the barber who has been mistaken for Hynkel. Many people criticized the speech, and thought it was superfluous to the film. Others found it uplifting. Regrettably Chaplin’s words are as relevant today as they were in 1940.

You know it?!\" -- it was a good moment, we spent the next few days trying to remember the whole speech. reply TaylorAlexander 8 hours agoparentThis speech reminds me of the anarchist Errico Malatesta. Some of his comrades tried to call him the “Lenin of Italy” and he said he never wants to be the ruler of others, and that no matter how good his heart is if he were put in that position he would be corrupted by power just as everyone else would be. This video covers it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;KYI-Bra-hP0 reply qingcharles 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s true though, it would be hard to go from an anarchist to a ruler just because people think you would be good in that position. Humans find it very hard not to be corrupted by power. reply TaylorAlexander 3 hours agorootparent> Humans find it very hard not to be corrupted by power.I will say yes, and also anarchists would argue that corruption of power is basically a simple function of the system. A ruler living in the capital will be unable to make appropriate decisions for rural farmers or urban factory workers. That those people should decide for themselves how best to operate, and they should do so by vote or elected and re-callable delegates. As a ruler is isolated from the functions of the people, they will be unable to see what decisions are appropriate, and they will lean in to what is in front of them. reply piloto_ciego 1 hour agorootparentThere’s an excellent capital, capitol, Das Kapital, capital pun in here somewhere. reply hannofcart 15 hours agoparentprevWhile this was a pithy comment, I&#x27;d totally upvote and read an article on how someone who frequents HN found themselves in the scenario you mentioned. reply qingcharles 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a long story which I hope soon to be able to document.One thing I learned was never, ever, ever to judge people on first impressions. I think I thought \"Oh no\" when they put that kid in my cell, but he was an utterly fantastic cellmate. His case was fascinating; he had stolen approximately $60,000 over several months as a night cashier at Target by managing to pick the lock on the safes next to the register using a pen during hours of boredom. He burned through every penny flying around the country staying at nice hotels every weekend to fuel his burgeoning MMA career. He was finally called to the office by a manager at Target and two detectives were there. He didn&#x27;t get a chance to deny anything as a roll of $3,000 cash fell out of his pants leg as he was stood right in front of them. reply yawpitch 14 hours agorootparentI like this kid, though I’m a not surprised there wasn’t enough room in his pants leg, what with the brass gonging around in there. reply causality0 7 hours agorootparentprevHN has more variety when it comes to posters than you think. There&#x27;s one guy here who spent time in prison for eco-terrorism. reply askonomm 4 hours agorootparentI spent 3 months in prison for getting drunk, stealing a row boat, and escaping from the police on said boat. My cellmates called me a low budget pirate.That was 10 years ago now. I&#x27;ve met tons of people like me who are otherwise in fields you&#x27;d associate with intellect. Some of us just have a knack for testing the limits of society. reply j-a-a-p 1 hour agorootparentAt probably a similar level of intoxication we found a boat and used it to enter a military compound in the city center of a small town called Delft. Me and my companion who were in the military at the time thought that would be a good idea.The boat however was leaking quite a bit and sunk right after we arrived. We managed to get into the building, which had a museum, and found a nice spot to sleep. It was not a difficult choice, either that, a forced exfiltration or a nightly swim.The next morning the person who opened the building did not even try to contain 2 x 2m young men. reply marcus_holmes 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy is your username for everything not \"low_budget_pirate\"?Great story :) reply nandhinianand 4 hours agorootparentprevUghhh.. I hate that word, especially when it refers to the protest acts like spaghetti on art, or slow march on a road delaying traffic etc... I think partly because it smells like a society that has started worshipping \"traffic\" or \"business as usual\" instead of doing that by deliberate choice. reply blululu 2 hours agorootparentMaybe this is splitting hairs but those just seem like classic non-violent protests instead of terrorism. Ecoterrorism is something like spiking trees so that loggers will get blasted with chainsaw shrapnel when they try to cut through a 1000 year old tree. Terrorism is of course a loose term but it generally requires some element of violent coercion. Throwing soup at a painting is obnoxious but children will not have nightmares over it. reply johnmaguire 14 hours agoparentprevMy partner is very partial to this version: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ouzKl0oD6sU :) reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentSo am I.

It signifies that several millions of sleeping people are trying to destroy several millions of other sleeping people.They would not do this, of course, if they were to wake up.Everything that takes place is owing to this sleep.\"---In Search of the Miraculous - Ouspensky reply kukkeliskuu 10 hours agorootparentWow, I immediately recognized the text.

Are there even any examples of movies that have failed to release because of &#x27;internet rage mobs&#x27; reply cogman10 11 hours agorootparentprevI sincerely think you need to step out of your political circle, whatever it may be, and try to understand the \"mob\" you think would cancel this movie. Whoever you are consuming this take from is lying to you about the motivations of their opponents. You MIGHT find some isolated instance where someone objects to this movie. However, they&#x27;ll be in an extreme minority.When you take a bit of time to understand when and why someone wants to cancel something, it&#x27;s generally not the story you&#x27;ve consumed from sensationalist media. More often than not, it&#x27;s a company self censoring and not some mob demanding cancellation.You may still disagree with the \"mob\", however, at least you&#x27;d not have such a cartoonishly wrong take on the motivations of those you disagree with. reply zozbot234 10 hours agorootparent> You MIGHT find some isolated instance where someone objects to this movie. However, they&#x27;ll be in an extreme minority.Really? Take a look at the reception of recent movies that are arguably comparable - The Dictator (Larry Charles, 2012), The Interview, Jojo Rabbit. All of which, to a greater or lesser extent, have been overshadowed by controversy about their portrayal of these topics, often including claims that the movie is either promoting hateful attitudes or \"trivializing\" and implicitly minimizing past atrocities by the vey act of portraying them via satire and ridicule. The contrast with how The Great Dictator was received historically could hardly be any clearer! reply cogman10 10 hours agorootparentI honestly don&#x27;t remember any controversy from those films, certainly not a cancellation.Even doing some google searches for controversy surrounding those films reveals like 1 or 2 op eds talking about \"should we really be laughing at this?\". Nothing terribly extreme.The only place I found any sort of mention of controversy was The Interview. But, by and large it looks like it was just a bad film that rogan decided it was reviewed poorly because of controversy (and not that it was unfunny). I&#x27;ve not seen the film though so can&#x27;t really comment.Can you point to some online mob around these films? Like a reddit witch hunt or otherwise? reply J_Shelby_J 12 hours agorootparentprevTaika Waititas most loved movie is literally him playing hitler. reply Loughla 12 hours agorootparentprevDude.

I think he wrote the whole film around this speech. Also there&#x27;s this wonderful scene where he(Hynkel) dances with a globe in it:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-jj-PaqFrBc reply vpribish 15 hours agoprev\"Don&#x27;t let your mind speak louder than your heart\" - I think many have this so very wrong. Is support for fascism is a sensible, logical, well-thought-out policy? No, it&#x27;s a heart-felt, emotional appeal to scared, proud, paranoid, crude, brutal people (who seem to be about half of our neighbors). surely the mindful decision is empathetic, constructive, and wise - not just base. reply keepamovin 5 hours agoparent> surely the mindful decision is empathetic, constructive, and wise - not just base.As your heart is, if you listen to it.Listening to your heart is different to compulsive thoughts or reactions; getting swept up in a mass hysteria of the times; or a spasm that can tear through a crowd.These types of revolutions, or crowd motions, are more often based on intense intellectual ideas and expressions of subconscious motivations rather than the present intelligence of your actual heart.So I think the original comment has it very right: if people actually tuned into their heart and listened to that they’d find their way much more surely in the world. I encourage you to try it!! :)The untrained mind in its raw state, for most people is not the cool, rational, dispassionate instrument of your imagining, (though you may have been blessed with such a faculty, most are not! Including I). Most peoples minds are chaotic places and can usually be swept up in these movements. But even if yours is the cool instrument you speak of, I encourage you to develop your heart sense and listen to its intelligence—it’s vital and a different perspective.I think most peoples’ hearts are innately sensible, than their minds are in fact. The heart also seems to require less training to make it so—you simply need to listen to it well. reply keybored 21 minutes agoparentprev> No, it&#x27;s a heart-felt, emotional appeal to scared, proud, paranoid, crude, brutal people (who seem to be about half of our neighbors)Is “about half” an empirical, dispassionate observation? No, it’s a heart-felt, emotional...I’m pretty sure that Jesus had something to say about seeing the [fascism] in everyone else but yourself. reply lewhoo 15 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so simple. Support for fascism can seem sensible and logical if you let yourself think that between you and greatness stands a minority whose sole purpose is to prevent you from becoming great. You could argue it&#x27;s not emotion but a calculation coming from struggle and an easy explanation for that struggle. Not every wrong assumption comes from emotion and we have the whole history of science to prove that. reply raxxorraxor 17 minutes agorootparentOne of the main motivators of people looking for strong leadership is fear and mostly a purely emotional need. Mostly fear of being taken advantage of. But yes, it also doesn&#x27;t have to be irrational, it just was for the most prominent instance of fascism.Using your mind and getting some distance and perspective would be quite beneficial here. The heart can follow the mind or the other way around. There isn&#x27;t a clear cut and there cannot be a general answer which direction is the better one.What probably is true in almost any case is that if you have an image of an enemy to put all the blame on, he probably just looks at you from the mirror. reply Aunche 14 hours agorootparentprev> Not every wrong assumption comes from emotionI&#x27;m not sure what you mean by that. Every assumption right or wrong comes from emotion. The problem tends to come when people let their emotions are left completely unchecked. \"Bankers are taking advantage of me. My banker is an X minority. Therefore, we need to exterminate X minority\" indeed has a nonzero degree of logic, but it&#x27;s not the sort of reasoning 99% of people would come up with in a vacuum.A counterpoint is that sometimes an irrational degree of emotion may be required to do extraordinary things like soldiers being brainwashed to fight even a defensive war, building a cathedral that fitting of the magnificence of god, or even a lot of cult-like startups. reply lewhoo 12 hours agorootparent> Every assumption right or wrong comes from emotion.I disagree. Wrong assumptions are often just a conclusion of limited or false knowledge. reply johnnyanmac 11 hours agorootparentWell, if you remember how not every one wanted to learn in school and realize those people still \"grew up\", you realize how impractical it can be to make sure everyone has sufficient knowledge. reply wongarsu 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you reduce fascism to \"let&#x27;s genocide everyone else\", of course the ideology doesn&#x27;t make sense. I would say the idea of fascism is more about doing what&#x27;s best for the nation or people, guided by a strong centrally led state, and a belief that imperialism and war can be appropriate tools to further this goal. It&#x27;s adjacent to ultranationalism (though it doesn&#x27;t have to be about the nation).For example to name the most well-known example, Hitler&#x27;s goals were:- unite the German people under one country- more lebensraum (space to live) for said German people- get rid of undesirables who hold the Germans back (Jews, disabled people, Gypsies, homosexuals, etc)If you start from the axioms that the German people are the best and should be elevated and all other people don&#x27;t deserve compassion, it&#x27;s not hard to arrive at those goals by pure reason. Of course those are bad axioms from our point of view, but you can&#x27;t reason yourself away from your axioms. reply felipeerias 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s very easy to get to fascism from Darwinism: the best are destined to prosper and rule, everybody else is doomed to servitude and eventual extinction, and that&#x27;s how progress is made.In fact, all sorts of eugenic and racist ideas were popular in the West until the Nazis took them to their obvious conclusion. reply arrosenberg 12 hours agorootparentprevThat seems to be perfectly consistent - it&#x27;s pure hubris and ego to believe that you are great or that a group of people would care enough about you to dedicate themselves so. That&#x27;s not for you to judge, but for the rest of us. Pure emotion, no logic. reply lewhoo 12 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of exceptions to recall here. People who thought of themselves as great but were diminished by others for being fools are easy to find in history of science in particular. I&#x27;d say if you invoke hubris or ego then you yourself are reacting emotionally - then who is right and who is wrong would probably only rely on the outcome of my endeavors (successful or not). reply arrosenberg 12 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;d say if you invoke hubris or ego then you yourself are reacting emotionally - then who is right and who is wrong would probably only rely on the outcome of my endeavors (successful or not).Ah yes - \"I am rubber, you are glue\". Given that this is a hypothetical, and I have no stake in the outcome, I think it is reasonable to conclude I am not being emotional about this.> People who thought of themselves as great but were diminished by others for being fools are easy to find in history of science in particular.And how many claimed to be great that are not in the history books? reply lewhoo 12 hours agorootparent> Given that this is a hypothetical, and I have no stake in the outcome, I think it is reasonable to conclude I am not being emotional about this.And why would you assume that ? If you hand no stake then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s far less likely to go for descriptions like hubris or ego. I have no stake in chess and I wouldn&#x27;t call Kasparov anything like that but people more invested in chess certainly do because it&#x27;s closer to heart for them.> And how many claimed to be great that are not in the history books?We don&#x27;t know, because they&#x27;re not in the books. But seriously, how exactly does this matter if you are just searching for logical support ? reply arrosenberg 12 hours agorootparentMy point, which you seem to have missed, is that N people can claim to be great \"if only X wasn&#x27;t in my way\". In reality, an infinitesimally small number of people will be judged as great by history, and half of those will be largely by accident, many will not realize it, and some will only achieve it post-mortem.Therefore, logically, if someone claims to be great, they are mostly likely riding high on hubris and ego. It&#x27;s statistically the most likely outcome for anyone claiming greatness. reply lewhoo 11 hours agorootparentBecause that wasn&#x27;t your point. You claimed it&#x27;s hubris and ego because greatness is in the eye of the third-party beholder. Now you argue it is necessary that greatness must be unlikely, which is of course true but changes nothing. History of science, maybe history of progress is the history of (at that moment) unlikeliness prevailing. replyNoughmad 14 hours agorootparentprev\"X can seem sensible and logical if you ignore sense and logic and believe your emotions instead\".Yes, that&#x27;s true for everything, and it is exactly what believing your emotions over facts means. reply lewhoo 14 hours agorootparentBut that&#x27;s just ad absurdum considering we don&#x27;t have straight answers when it comes to socio-political issues. reply ryanklee 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s absolutely straightforward to uphold Democratic principles over Fascistic enterprises. People who get this wrong are simply wrong, and it&#x27;s likely emotional and psychological forces that got them there, not rational, historiographic, or empirical ones.The current headwinds are a result of ill-equiped individuals being manipulated by other ill-equiped individuals. reply lewhoo 13 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s absolutely straightforward to uphold Democratic principles over Fascistic enterprises.That may be, but it also seems perfectly logical to claim democracy is broken because a voice of an educated person carries same weight than that of a high school dropout. All you need to do is extend this logic a bit. I think it is because of our emotions, empathy or maybe something else that we see that this \"flaw\" in democracy isn&#x27;t really a flaw.> ill-equiped individuals being manipulated by other ill-equiped individualsExcept fascism wasn&#x27;t only a manipulation. Had fascism succeeded it would&#x27;ve made the participating states extremely rich, powerful and influential throughout the next (maybe) hundreds of years. reply vpribish 11 hours agorootparentI appreciate your contribution to the conversation, but have to disagree : \"Had fascism succeeded\" is kinda of an impossibility. it&#x27;s bad at doing things and internally eats itself as soon as it gets power. Fascism is not justas if it was a choice of haircut, it&#x27;s cancer reply lewhoo 11 hours agorootparent> \"Had fascism succeeded\" is kinda of an impossibility.Depends. If you assume succeeded indefinitely then this is a trap because such a thing is impossible (can only be deemed indefinitely successful at its end at which point it cant). Fascism could&#x27;ve been the new feudal era with the masters and slaves clearly defined but yes, I don&#x27;t think it could&#x27;ve lasted forever if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying. reply willsoon 7 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s true. Fascism is something to die for... Not something to live for. reply throwaway171223 12 hours agorootparentprev> to claim democracy is broken because a voice of an educated person carries same weight than that of a high school dropoutIs not logical.> fascism wasn&#x27;t only a manipulationNo successful ideology is only a manipulation.> Had fascism succeededI doubt anyone really knows why, but the historical fact is that it didn&#x27;t. reply johnnyanmac 11 hours agorootparent>Is not logical.How so?>No successful ideology is only a manipulation.Depends on how you define success. We can say \"fascism didn&#x27;t succeed\" but it certainly didn&#x27;t blow over as a trend. Not back then, and not now. reply throwaway171223 11 hours agorootparentAs a common meeting ground between Hobbes and Rousseau (and probably Locke, which I confess I have not read), anyone can hold and fire a gun. Considering the original context in whence Greek democracy flourished, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a fair extrapolation to modern times. reply johnnyanmac 11 hours agorootparent> Considering the original context in whence Greek democracy flourished, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a fair extrapolation to modern times.I don&#x27;t think so. Even \"democracy\" in the lens of 18th is century America is rife with various prejudice that shouldn&#x27;t existing in a pure democracy. I wouldn&#x27;t extrapolate anything accurately from millenia ago if it degregates in a matter of a few centuries.It&#x27;s very easy to protest \"equal vote for each person\" when the ruling body gets to define \"person\" (or more accurately, \"citizen\") in their own emotion way replybawolff 11 hours agorootparentprevThis strikes me as begging the question.It is always straightforward to uphold what you already believe in.Like isnt it the famous line of the communists that communism is a historical neccesisty? I think all ideologies have something similar. reply throwaway171223 13 hours agorootparentprevWe do though,We&#x27;ve had them since the first time a group of farming monkeys decided to post day&#x2F;night guards on the granary.Those posts have been filled around the clock ever since.To my knowledge the first ones to formalize this were Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau but, in all cases, very little has changed since.To me, that&#x27;s as straight an answer as you&#x27;re ever going to get reply mordae 13 hours agorootparentSince then a single farmer feeds thousands of people. We are producing more and with much less effort than we did before we have started farming and had to post the guards.Yet the guards remain and insist that they are still needed. reply throwaway171223 13 hours agorootparentBy my understanding, the definition of granary has changed since. replythe_af 14 hours agorootparentprevYou are effectively describing an appeal to emotions, not reason. reply lossolo 13 hours agorootparentEvery ideology appeals to emotions—liberalism, democracy, fascism, communism, etc. This is why we seldom see academic professors, who deliver lectures on TV, winning elections based solely on their lectures.Ideologies aim to harness people&#x27;s emotions to gain support. Democracy, fascism, and communism all possess underlying logic. By analyzing these ideologies dispassionately, without moral judgments, one can discern the logic in each of them.When encountering opposition, there are numerous ways to resolve conflict and achieve one&#x27;s goals. These include discussion, compromise, and litigation, but also extend to extreme measures like murder and genocide.

Fascist speakers excelled at driving their audience into a frenzy.Democracy is not consistently about this, and there&#x27;s also rational debate about it. Rational debate wasn&#x27;t the focus of fascism, and in fact it was actively shunned -- fascism was about sacrifice, blood and belief, not reason.Someone else linked to the reflections on the language of the Third Reich, and how it was meant to drive emotions and irrational thinking.Fascism cannot coexist with reason.

Monarchy for example is great as long as your monarch is a sensible, smart, and empathetic person - but terrible when the ones after them aren’t.I really can’t come up with a better alternative to democracy (aka majority rule) even if I think many of the problems in contemporary western society stem from that majority rule.Of course there are many more devils in the details and democracies can vary widely across the spectrum.To me a socialist (as in social, as in having the interest of „the people“ as guiding principle) democracy seems to be the best system humans have been able to come up with so far - the best as in resulting in a good outcome for the biggest portion of people. The Nordic states seem to have gotten it right in most aspects, even if there are many problems even there.I wonder if there are any other good propositions or systems of governance that have been tried and proven that I have been missing (Spain&#x27;s anarchist or Mexican syndicalism comes to mind, but I know too little about them to pass any judgement - plus they have been very localised systems afaict) reply KittenInABox 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the initial assumption comes from emotion. Humans are not dual creatures with frontend and backends that must communicate through an API between their emotions and thoughts. Emotions and thoughts are actually phenomenon in simultaneous occurrence-- your thoughts can trigger emotions (planning what to do after being laid off can trigger anxiety) and your emotions can trigger thoughts (you&#x27;re anxious, so you consider putting planning off and binge a show&#x2F;movie).Fear of the \"other\" is clearly an emotion, but all the justifications, reasons, and overall narratives about the \"other\" are thoughts. reply alternative_a 14 hours agoparentprevTwo faculties are listed and the phrase implies the good working order of both.This then leads to the conclusion that the meaning is “reason alone can not determine all decisions”.Now a mind in good working order may be confronted with a matter that his or her heart of good working order is objecting to.

The campaign scrapped an event scheduled in Austin for Friday after the incident.President Donald Trump tweeted a video of the incident on Saturday night with the comment, “I LOVE TEXAS,” and briefly mentioned it during a campaign rally in Michigan on Sunday.Tariq Thowfeek, Texas communications director for the Biden campaign, said the Trump fans “decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm’s way” rather to engage in a conversation about the candidates’ different visions.Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said Sunday she hadn’t seen the whole video and couldn’t comment on the part where one of the cars appears to almost crash into the bus.“Certainly we don’t want harm and we shouldn’t be hurting other people. The president would not endorse that,” McDaniel said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”The White House and Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Donald Trump Jr, the president’s son, appeared in a video on Twitter last week encouraging supporters of the president to show up for one of Harris’s events in Texas.“It’d be great if you guys would all get together, head down to McAllen and give Kamala Harris a nice Trump Train welcome,” Trump Jr said. reply spacebacon 14 hours agorootparentprevI can relate to this point of view.

When Churchill and FDR saw a pre-release private screening of the film, they liked it. (Incidentally, Chamberlain had vowed to ban it in England for fear of angering the actual dictator.) FDR even invited Chaplin to read this very speech on his inauguration in 1941.Ironically, this is the film that made Americans turn against him. Later that year, he was subpoenaed by a congressional committee investigating pro-war propaganda (this was a few months before the US entered the war.)In the following years, Chaplin was extremely vilified by the Americans mainly for his pro-Soviet and communist views (or rather, for his refusal to be anti-Communist). This led to politically-motivated prosecutions, and culminated in him being exiled from the US when the president Harry Truman(!) canceled his re-entry permit while away on family vacation. (Chaplin was never an American citizen, despite living in the country for over 40 years.)There’s a recent good book review summarizing this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;charlie-chapli... reply MichaelMoser123 7 hours agoparent>Indeed, around the time the film was made, the two men shared political views on a lot of thingsRoosevelt did object to Jewish emigration in the nineteen thirties.

Specially with the state of peer review in the social sciences my feeling is many things that are said to be scientific fact today will be proven wrong later, including whole fields.Easier to trust more fundamental aspects of math and physics, but even in those fields, on the bleeding edge many things can change.The current zeitgeist is that science is as holy as religion used to be, and because there&#x27;s so many anti-science people gaining a voice on the internet, it&#x27;s sometimes easy to forget that we&#x27;re not perfect at science and we also make wrong turns while we trudge our way through the scientific method. reply ruszki 16 hours agorootparentPseudoscience like eugenics is just feelings packaged as science. reply vasco 16 hours agorootparentWell yes, and that is obvious today, at the time they were reputable fields, just look it up.And if you read that in history, what does that tell you about the present and the possibility of it being the case with some fields today?My point is obviously not to defend those fields, but to say that pseudoscience maskerading as science isn&#x27;t a thing that can only happen in the past.It&#x27;s a bit strange to learn about the fact that it happened before yet not accept the possibility that some of the things we call science today, aren&#x27;t. reply ruszki 15 hours agorootparentWhat does reputability do with science? After 1915, it’s pseudoscience, regardless of who says it. reply concordDance 56 minutes agorootparentprevThis depends a lot on what you means by \"eugenics\". Some people use the word to be a normative word (a statement about what should be) others positive word (a statement about what IS or could be). E.g. \"We can use CRISPR and genetic screening to make people resistant to HIV\" vs \"we should do so\".The former is a question of fact (\"is this possible?\") though often with a bunch of unspoken subquestions (\"can we do this change without causing incidental genetic changes or damaging the egg?\") and in the realm of science while the latter is a question of policy and feelings (how much do we want HIV resistance? What is the price we&#x27;re willing to pay&#x2F;risk we&#x27;re willing to take? Does deliberately altering humanity open a can of worms best left unopened?).Conflation between normative and positive meanings are quite common across a wide variety of domains and can cause substantial confusion as two people can think they&#x27;re talking about the same thing but actually aren&#x27;t.Even in the \"should\" case there&#x27;s a bunch of confusion as to what sort of things should count as \"eugenics\", with some people wanting the term to apply only to coercive measures and others wanting the term to apply to any deliberate changes to a population&#x27;s gene pool (and theres the grey area in the middle where financial incentives happen).Note: A lot of politically fraught words will have a number of similar but different meanings as various interest groups fight over them. From \"war\" and \"violence\" to \"culture\" and \"science\" to \"person\" and \"rights\". reply TeMPOraL 16 hours agorootparentprev> used as a scientific basis to justify many attrocitiesThat&#x27;s the operating phrase though. Throughout history, atrocities were justified using whatever was seen as the higher authority at the moment - the will of a deity, the words of a prophet, the decree of a king, appeal to destiny or legacy, and yes, science too. Especially in the early XX century, when science was kicking into gear, and delivering miracles left and right for everyone to see - it was easy tool to abuse to justify whatever the leaders wanted or needed to.Doesn&#x27;t mean the science itself is at fault here.I didn&#x27;t read up much on phrenology so I won&#x27;t comment on it, but RE eugenics, I see it as a mix of good and bad ideas that sprouted in an environment full of aforementioned hatred and otherwise devoid of moral and ethical boundaries[0]. I feel it&#x27;s more of a historical coincidence of fledging science and then-contemporary zeitgeist, rather than an innate feature of science. The resulting effect is that even the word itself - eugenics - casts a long shadow on research in fields like genetics, medicine and economics. There are whole subsections of those fields you can&#x27;t discuss in polite company, &#x27;lest someone rounds your thinking off to \"eugenics\" and therefore paint you as \"nazi\". This is a bad outcome.> Easier to trust more fundamental aspects of math and physics, but even in those fields, on the bleeding edge many things can change.That&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s this thing though. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, so it might be just a benefit of hindsight, but there&#x27;s a notably different feeling when you reason from current state of knowledge in a correct way, vs. when you abuse it to justify whatever self-serving or atrocious idea you want. The atrocities committed under the label \"eugenics\" feel very much like the latter. But again, this may be just hindsight, and we may all be vulnerable to a new flavor of that mistake today.--[0] - Notably, some of which were developed only after those events.

Emotions on drugs are always a wonderful example, and people who keep going back to that guy who always has cocaine, which is of course, meant literally and figuratively.Chaplin always reminds me of myself and those days when I wonder how it is, that people prefer the comfort of some culture or crowd vs. becoming an individual and unique being.

I believe what Chaplin hoped to achieve was to give some outliers a way to integrate themselves into the crowd, to carve out a little space that would be as protected as all the spaces where obedience and conformity reign. \"We think too much and feel too little\" is an inspiration to the people who have ideas and the ability to make us feel, to become aware of our emotions whenever we seek out exactly that. It&#x27;s a stimulation for people of all kinds, especially the stranger kind, to go out there and do magic and art right there on the street, in the circus, on stage, on TV and of course this wonderful little prism we call the internet and any other expansion of the spaces that become accessible with time and effort of those who like to think a lot and get enough opportunities to calm their minds to avoid inflammation.Holy shit, for a minute my writing felt like that of Maria Popova. reply csdvrx 14 hours agorootparent> Chaplin always reminds me of myself and those days when I wonder how it is, that people prefer the comfort of some culture or crowd vs. becoming an individual and unique being.

    "originBody": "“Mind reading” may be about to become a reality – and in the most literal sense possible, as a new breakthrough from researchers at the University of Technology Sydney’s GrapheneX-UTS Human-centric Artificial Intelligence Centre sees thoughts transformed into words on a screen. “This research represents a pioneering effort in translating raw EEG waves directly into language, marking a significant breakthrough in the field,” said Ching-Ten Lin, Distinguished Professor at the UTS School of Computer Science and Director of the GrapheneX-UTS HAI Centre. Advertisement “It is the first to incorporate discrete encoding techniques in the brain-to-text translation process, introducing an innovative approach to neural decoding,” Lin, who led the research, explained. “The integration with large language models is also opening new frontiers in neuroscience and AI.” In a study that has been selected as a spotlight paper at the NeurIPS conference, an annual meeting of researchers in artificial intelligence and machine learning, participants silently read passages of text while an AI model called DeWave – using only their brainwaves as input – projected those words onto a screen. While it’s not the first technology to be able to translate brain signals into language, it’s the only one so far to require neither brain implants nor access to a full-on MRI machine. It also has an edge on predecessors that require additional input such as eye-tracking software, the researchers say, as the new technology can be used with or without such extras. Instead, users need only to wear a cap that records their brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) – much more practical and convenient than an eye-tracker (not to mention an MRI machine). That meant the signal was a bit noisier than information gained from implants, the researchers admitted – though even then, the tech performed pretty well in trials. Accuracy measurements using the BLEU algorithm – a way to evaluate the similarity of an original text to a machine-translated output by giving it a score between 0 and 1 – put the new tech at about 0.4. Advertisement That, admittedly, isn’t as good as some of the other options that depend on these more invasive methods. “The model is more adept at matching verbs than nouns,” explained Yiqun Duan, first author on the paper accompanying the research – and “when it comes to nouns, we saw a tendency towards synonymous pairs rather than precise translations, such as ‘the man’ instead of ‘the author’.” “We think [these errors are] because when the brain processes these words, semantically similar words might produce similar brain wave patterns,” Duan said. But the researchers believe they can improve this accuracy up to 0.9 – a level comparable with traditional language translation programs. They already have an advantage, they suspect, due to carrying out their tests on 29 participants – it may not sound like a lot, but it’s an order of magnitude higher than many other decoding tech trials. “Despite the challenges, our model yields meaningful results,” Duan said, “aligning keywords and forming similar sentence structures.” Advertisement The results were shown at the NeurIPS conference and a preprint can be found on ArXiV. It has yet to be peer reviewed.",

BCI research to a big extent focuses on helping paralyzed individuals regain communication.Unfortunately, EEG doesn’t provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to support good communication speeds outside of the lab with Faraday cages and days&#x2F;weeks of de-noising including removing eye-movement artifacts in the recordings. This is a physical limit due to attenuation of brain’s electrical fields outside of the skull, which is hard to overcome. For example, all commercial “mind-reading” toys are actually working based off head and eye muscle signals.Implanted electrodes provide better signal but are many iterations away from becoming viable commercially. Signal degrades over months as the brain builds scar tissue around electrodes and the brain surgery is obviously pretty dangerous. Iteration cycles are very slow because of the need for government approval for testing in humans (for a good reason).If I wanted to help a paralyzed friend, who could only move his&#x2F;her eyes, I would definitely focus on the eye-tracking tech. It hands-down beat all BCIs I’ve heard of. reply daniel_iversen 11 hours agoparentWhat’s your thoughts of Elon’s NeuraLink?

And it gets worse from there. The bugs list on the repo has a closed and locked bug report from someone claiming that their code is using teacher forcing!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;duanyiqun&#x2F;DeWave&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1In a normal recurrent neural network, the model predicts token-at-a-time. It predicts a token, and that token is appended to the total prediction so far which is then fed back into the model to generate the next token. In other words, the network generates all the predictions itself based off its own previous outputs and the other inputs (brainwaves in this case), meaning that a bad prediction can send the entire thing off track.In teacher forcing that isn&#x27;t the case. All the tokens up to the point where it&#x27;s predicting are taken from the correct inputs. That means the model is never exposed to its own previous errors. But of course in a real system you don&#x27;t have access to the correct inputs, so this is not feasible to do in reality.The other repo says:\"We have written a corrected version to use model.generate to evaluate the model, the result is not so good\"but they don&#x27;t give examples.This problem completely invalidates the paper&#x27;s results. It is awful that they have effectively hidden and locked the thread in which the issue was reported. It&#x27;s also kind of nonsensical that people doing such advanced ML work are claiming they accidentally didn&#x27;t know the difference between model.forward() and model.generate(). I mean I&#x27;m not an ML researcher and might have mangled the description of teacher forcing, but even I know these aren&#x27;t the same thing at all. reply iamleppert 10 hours agorootparentYou’d be shocked how common this is in academia.

I.e. try to get an equilibrium between the \"bottom-up processing\" of what the TTS model believes the person \"is thinking\", and the \"top-down processing\" of what the grammar model believes the average person \"would say next\" given all the conversation so far. (Just like a real neocortex!)Come to think, you could even train the LLM with a corpus of the person&#x27;s own transcribed conversations, if you&#x27;ve got it. Then it&#x27;d be serving almost exactly the function of predicting \"what that person in particular would say at this point.\"Maybe you could even find some additional EEG-pad locations that could let you read out the electrical consequences of AMPAR vs NMDAR agonism within the brain; determine from that how much the person is currently relying on their own internal top-down speech model vs using their own internal bottom-up processing to form a weird novel statement they&#x27;ve never thought before; and use this info to weight the level of influence the TTS model has vs the LLM on the output. reply seydor 16 hours agoparentprev> I’m still not sure how I feel about it.Sir, let us read that for you reply api 7 hours agoparentprevJust be sure to only ever use open source or paid commercial grade tech.

That is, the increasing restrictions on the autonomy of individuals and invasion of privacy with the increasing convenience of life and a more efficient civilization.Ted Kaczynski pretty much predicted the current state of affairs all the way back at 1970s. [1]Thankfully the world is not infinite so humankind cannot continue this situation for too long. The first Earth Overshoot Day was 31 December 1971, it was August 2 this year.[4] The effects of the nearing population collapse can be easily seen today in the increasing worldwide inflation, interest rates and hostility as the era of abundance comes to an end and resources get scarcer and scarcer. It&#x27;s important to note that the technological prowess of humanity was only due to having access to basically unlimited energy for decades, not due to some perceived human ingenuity, which can save humankind from extinction-level threats. In fact, humans are pretty incapable of understanding world-scale events and processes and acting accordingly[5], which is another primary reason to not have left the simple non-technological world which the still non-evolved primate-like human brain could intuitively understand.1: Refer to the manifesto \"Industrial Revolution and Its Consequences\".2: Organization-dependent technology: Technology which requires organized effort, as opposed to small scale technology which a single person can produce himself with correct knowledge.3: By Kaczynski, in the book Anti-Tech Revolution. Freely available online.4: Biological overshoot occurs when demands placed on an ecosystem by a species exceeds the carrying capacity. Earth Overshoot Day is the day when humanity&#x27;s demand on nature exceeds Earth&#x27;s biocapacity.

The first movies in which the iconic mouse appeared – most famously, Steamboat Willie­[1] – were made in 1928 and works from that year go into the public domain in the United States on New Year’s Day 2024.[2] The public domain has had some famous recent arrivals, but this is the most anticipated entry yet. Why? It is not simply that Mickey is a famous copyrighted character. So are Sherlock Holmes and Winnie the Pooh, and while they entered the public domain with some fanfare, it paled in comparison to this event. I’d like to offer a tentative answer. The reason that this event gathers so much attention is that it is the story of a 95-year-old love triangle, a tangled drama that rivals any Disney movie for twists and turns. The protagonists are Mickey, Disney and the Public Domain, and their relationship positively exemplifies the social media weasel-words “it’s complicated.” On the one hand, Disney pushed for the law that extended the copyright term to 95 years, which became referred to derisively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act.” This extension has been criticized by scholars as being economically regressive and having a devastating effect on our ability to digitize, archive, and gain access to our cultural heritage. It locked up not just famous works, but a vast swath of our culture, including material that is commercially unavailable. Even though calling it the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” may overstate Disney’s actual role in the legislative process – the measure passed because of a much broader lobbying effort – Disney was certainly a prominent supporter, and the Mouse was sometimes a figurehead. On the other hand, Disney itself is a talented and successful practitioner of building upon the public domain. In fact, the public domain is Disney’s bread and butter. Frozen was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen. The Lion King draws from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Biblical stories, and possibly an epic poem about the founder of the Mali Empire.[3] Fantasia showcases public domain classical music, and “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” segment comes from a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, and Pinocchio came from stories by Lewis Carroll, The Brothers Grimm, Victor Hugo, Charles Perrault, Hans Christian Anderson, and Carlo Collodi. The public domain includes not only works over which copyright has expired or never existed, but also uncopyrightable aspects of contemporary works—such as ideas, stock elements, and unoriginal material. The Mickey character itself is based on such public domain fodder. His personality and antics drew from silent film stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks. Walt Disney told The American Magazine: “I think we were rather indebted to Charlie Chaplin …We wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin…a little fellow trying to do the best he could.”[4] Ub Iwerks, who animated most of Steamboat Willie, wrote that Douglas Fairbanks “was the super-hero of his day, always winning, gallant and swashbuckling. Mickey’s action was in that vein…I thought of him in that respect, and I had him do naturally the sort of thing Doug Fairbanks would do.” Titles are also not copyrightable, and the name “Steamboat Willie” was a nod to the title of Buster Keaton’s film from earlier the same year, Steamboat Bill, Jr.[5] Hence the triangle. Disney is both an emblem of term extension and its erosion of the public domain, and one of the strongest use-cases in favor of the maintenance of a rich public domain. Mickey is the symbol of both tendencies. Ironies abound. It may not be exactly the same as an oil company relying on solar power to run its rigs, but it is definitely in the same “massive irony” zip code. All of this makes the year when copyright finally expires over Mickey Mouse highly symbolic. The love triangle between Mickey, Disney, and the public domain is about to evolve, and perhaps even resolve, in real time. But what does public domain status actually mean for the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey?[6] There is a vast amount of misinformation about these issues online. In what follows, I will try to offer a straightforward explainer. What can and can’t you do with the Mickey Mouse character as of January 1, 2024? How will Disney be affected? Does Disney still hold copyrights over later versions of Mickey? Does trademark law play a role? Keep reading for details. What can I do with Mickey Mouse as of January 1, 2024? What about more recent versions of Mickey? What about Disney’s trademark over Mickey? The Public Domain: A Wellspring of Creativity What can I do with Mickey Mouse as of January 1, 2024? The answer, ironically, is distinctly mouse-shaped! Here is a diagram. As explained by Karyn A. Temple, former United States Register of Copyrights, the public domain “is part of copyright’s lifecycle, the next stage of life for that creative work. The public domain is an inherent and integral part of the copyright system…It provides authors the inspiration and raw material to create something new.” Steamboat Willie and the characters it depicts – which include both Mickey and Minnie Mouse – will be in the public domain. As indicated in the green circle, this means that anyone can share, adapt, or remix that material. You can start your creative engines too—full steam ahead! You could take a page out of the Winnie-the-Pooh: the Deforested Edition playbook and create “Steamboat Willie: the Climate Change Edition,” in which Mickey’s boat is grounded in a dry riverbed. You could create a feminist remake with Minnie Mouse as the central figure. You could reimagine Mickey and Minnie dedicating themselves to animal welfare. (The animals in Steamboat Willie are contorted rather uncomfortably into musical instruments. PETA would not approve.) You can do all of this and more, so long as you steer clear of the subsisting rights indicated by the orange circles, namely: Use the original versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse from 1928, without copyrightable elements of later iterations (though not every later iteration will be copyrightable, as I explain below) and Do not confuse consumers into thinking that your creation is produced or sponsored by Disney as a matter of trademark law. One way to help ensure that your audience is not confused is to make the actual source of the work – you or your company – clear on the title screen or cover, along with a prominent disclaimer indicating that your work was not produced, endorsed, licensed, or approved by Disney. So, is January 1, 2024 doomsday for Disney? No. Disney still retains copyright over newer iterations of Mickey such as the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” Mickey from Fantasia (1940) as well as trademarks over Mickey as a brand identifier. People will still go to its theme parks, pay to see its movies, buy its merchandise. Its brand identity will remain intact. In sum, yes, you can use Mickey in new creative works. There are some more complex peripheral legal issues, but here is your guide through them. (back to contents) What about more recent versions of Mickey? Copyright expiration allows you to use the original Mickey and Minnie Mouse in new creative works, even though those characters also appear in more recent works that are still under copyright. With newer iterations of those characters, Disney only owns original, creative expression that qualifies for copyright, not mere ideas, unoriginal or stock character features, or “merely trivial” variations to the original characters. In 2024 Mickey Mouse joins a host of other familiar public domain characters—Winnie the Pooh, Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster, Robin Hood, Snow White, Cinderella, and Alice in Wonderland. You can use Mickey and Minnie 1.0, as they appeared in Steamboat Willie and Plane Crazy, even though these characters also appear in later, still-copyrighted works. Under copyright law, Disney only owns the newly added material in subsequent works, not underlying material from 1928—that content remains freely available.[7] “It is a bedrock principle of copyright that once work enters the public domain it cannot be appropriated as private (intellectual) property, and even the most creative of legal theories cannot trump this tenet.” –Klinger v. Conan Doyle Estate (N.D. Ill. 2013) aff’d (7th Cir. 2014) This point was illustrated by the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd.’s unsuccessful attempts to artificially extend the expired copyright over the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, covered on last year’s Public Domain Day site. A court confirmed that all of the story elements in public domain works are “free for public use”: “Where an author has used the same character in a series of works, some of which are in the public domain, the public is free to copy story elements from the public domain works.” Mickey’s appearance has changed over time, going from a vaguely rat-like to a more neotenous appearance. He eyes varied over time and began as large white ovals with pupils in Plane Crazy and smaller black dots in Steamboat Willie – both of those versions of Mickey are public domain in 2024. In 1929 he quickly donned gloves (apparently so that his hands were more visible against his body) and later he was colorized.”. The overall appearance of Fantasia Mickey and other later Mickeys is still under copyright. That said, not every feature of Mickey’s later iterations is individually copyrightable. Copyright only extends to “original, creative expression.” Mere ideas are not eligible, nor are unoriginal features or stock elements. When copyright is claimed over additions to preexisting content – such as changes to the 1928 Mickey character – those changes have to be more than a “merely trivial” or “miniscule” variation on what came before.[8] It is not enough for the new material just to be different; it has to meet copyright’s threshold requirements for protectability. Therefore, while the safest approach may be to stick to Mickey circa 1928 in new creations, copyright law also lets you use later material that does not qualify for copyright. Your mouse can speak intelligibly in a high voice even though Mickey 1.0 does not do so; giving a talking mouse a squeaky voice is not copyrightable. Generic character traits such as being adorable and having less jaunty dance moves are fair game. What’s more, anything you “independently create” – or come up with yourself – is legal. Choosing your own color scheme is fine; you do not have to stick to black and white. Can Disney claim copyright over the color red – standing alone – for Mickey’s shorts? On the one hand, when talking about copyright’s “originality” requirement, the Supreme Court said that “the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some creative spark, ‘no matter how crude, humble or obvious’ it might be.” But the law is also clear that adding something to a prior work must be more than a “merely trivial” variation. To us, the argument seems stronger that choosing a single, bright, primary color for an article of clothing does not meet the copyrightability threshold. That said, you may be more comfortable selecting your own color scheme. (back to contents) What about Disney’s trademark over Mickey? The plot thickens when you add Disney’s trademark rights to the picture. Many sources claim that even though Mickey is copyright-free in 2024, you still cannot use the character because it is trademarked by Disney. But this is not what the law actually says. Trademark law only prohibits the use of a trademarked character if doing so “is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive” consumers about the source or sponsorship of the new product.[9] Trademark law does not prevent you from using the 1928 Mickey character unless consumers will be misled into thinking your work is produced or sponsored by Disney. First, some background. Copyrights and trademarks are different. Copyrights cover creative works and prevent people from copying and adapting them without permission, with the goal of providing economic incentives to create and distribute cultural material. The US Constitution requires that these rights expire after a “limited time,” so that the public and future creators can have unfettered access to creative works. Trademarks cover words, logos, images, and other signifiers that serve as brands identifying the source of a product. The goal is to minimize consumer confusion in the marketplace. Nike can prevent other producers of athletic apparel from putting “Nike” or a swoosh on their merchandise so that when purchasers see those indicators, they know they are getting a Nike product. But it does not own the word “Nike” outright; there are lots of uses of “Nike” that do not violate trademark, whether referring to the Greek goddess of victory or to the brand in a non-confusing way. Unlike copyrights, trademarks do not automatically expire. They can last as long as a mark is still being “used in commerce.” If Amazon goes on using the “Amazon” brand for 500 years, the trademark stays alive. While trademarks can outlast copyrights, however, the rights themselves are more circumscribed. For most marks, trademark law only prevents the use of a mark on similar products when it is likely to create consumer confusion about the product’s origin or sponsorship.[10] Non-confusing uses are not prohibited, and there are a variety of legal safeguards for uses of trademarks in connection with expressive works such as films, books, and songs. Sometimes copyrights and trademarks overlap.[11] A character such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh might be covered both by copyright law (as a creative work) and trademark law (as a logo if, when people see the character on a backpack or pajamas, they think it must be official Disney merchandise). While the copyright is active, Disney can keep people from making unauthorized uses of Mickey in new works (unless those uses qualify for “fair use” protection, as with a parody). While the trademark is in effect, Disney can keep people from slapping Mickey on luggage or apparel. “We have been careful to caution against misuse or overextension of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by . . . copyright.” Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox (Supreme Court 2003) But what happens when the copyright expires and the trademark is ongoing? In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court made clear that trademarks cannot be used to make an end run around copyright law because this would “create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public’s federal right to copy and to use expired copyrights.”[12] In other words, trademark rights cannot be used to block the freedoms that the expiration of copyright allows, such as using a public domain character in a new creative work. Along the same lines, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained that when a work enters the public domain “[w]e all own it now” and trademark law “cannot be used to circumvent copyright law. If material covered by copyright law has passed into the public domain, it cannot then be protected by the Lanham Act [the federal trademark statute] without rendering the Copyright Act a nullity.”[13] Those who tell you otherwise are mistaken. This brings us to Mickey Mouse. The Steamboat Willie copyright expires in 2024. But Disney still retains trademark rights to use images of Mickey as well as the words “Mickey Mouse” in connection with a variety of products. Here are some of its federally registered Mickey images for merchandise such as clothing, backpacks, watches, linens, toys, blankets, lunch boxes, and water bottles. Disney has also started using this logo before some of its films. If you make your own Mickey cartoon, can Disney use trademark law to interfere? Trademark law is all about preventing consumer confusion – and not about getting in the way of creativity – so it depends on whether people are likely to be misled about the source of your cartoon. As long as no one thinks it is a Disney joint, there should not be a trademark problem. When might consumers think you are offering a Disney-sponsored product? Here it is important to distinguish between different uses of the Mickey character. Certainly, there might be a risk of confusion if you use Mickey as a brand identifier on the kind of merchandise Disney sells. Trademark law does protect Disney against that risk. Consumers may also be confused if Mickey is used in an artistic work in a way that suggests it is a Disney production, for example by appearing as a logo at the beginning of an animation. Contrast these uses with putting the Mickey character in a new cartoon or book. The latter is not the kind of use that misleads as to the source of a product. It is exactly what copyright expiration is intended to allow.[14] Were trademark law to prevent this, then trademark rights would be leveraged to obtain the effective equivalent of a perpetual copyright—precisely what the Supreme Court said we cannot do. As mentioned earlier, one way to dispel potential confusion is to make it clear that you – and not Disney – are responsible for the new work, and to add a disclaimer making it clear that your work is not produced or sponsored by Disney. Moving beyond the Mickey character, what about Disney’s trademark over the “Mickey Mouse” name? Here too putting the words “Mickey Mouse” on toys or onesies is different from using “Mickey Mouse” to describe the content of a new creative work. With the latter, a disclaimer is also helpful. One court explained: “When a public domain work is copied, along with its title, there is little likelihood of confusion when even the most minimal steps are taken to distinguish the publisher of the original from that of the copy. The public is receiving just what it believes it is receiving—the work with which the title has become associated. The public is not only unharmed, it is unconfused.”[15] With artistic uses of trademarked material, the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of expression also comes into play. Trademark law has a number of speech-protecting limitations that safeguard expressive uses. This is why when Mattel sues people for using “Barbie” in the titles of songs and photographs, they lose in court. Mattel also lost when it objected to the use of the doll’s trademarked appearance in a series of photographs criticizing its role in our culture.[16] One defense allows “nominative use” of a trademark as a point of reference – for example, using “Mickey Mouse” accurately to refer to the public domain character in your work. Another comes from a case called Rogers v. Grimaldi, which privileged the use of trademarks in titles of expressive works as long as the term has some artistic relevance to the new work and does not explicitly mislead as to the source of the work.[17] The policy underlying this rule is that trademark law should only apply to artistic works when the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression. While a disclaimer is not required to benefit from these limitations, it can nevertheless be useful to make abundantly clear that you are not providing an official Disney production. Finally, there is a small subset of extremely “famous” marks – essentially, superbrands – that receive extra “anti-dilution” protection against unauthorized uses that impair the distinctiveness or harm the reputation of the famous mark, even when there is no consumer confusion. While the mouse-ears silhouette or current iteration of the Mickey logo might fall into this category of famous marks, the Mickey character from Steamboat Willie does not.[18] (Just because a brand is “famous” for trademark purposes does not mean that all of its trademarks are considered famous; “Nike” is famous but many of its product names are not.) And even if Mickey 1.0 does eventually qualify, anti-dilution protection is subject to important First-Amendment exceptions that allow for the kinds of expressive uses discussed earlier.[19] Bottom line: trademark law has a number of rules designed to safeguard expressive uses and prevent trademark law from overriding copyright law. Nonetheless, people sometimes still try to use trademark law to interfere with legal reuses of public domain material, leading to unnecessary litigation and chilling effects. Zorro Productions, Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. did this with the Zorro works and the Tarzan and John Carter works. Zorro lost in court—because the Zorro story was in the public domain, a new “Queen of Swords” TV series about Zorro’s sword-wielding daughter could proceed.[20] Burroughs was able to extract a joint licensing deal from the publisher of new “Lord of the Jungle” and “Warlord of Mars” comic books; even the threat of lawsuits can chill creative reuse. Going forward, will Disney’s legal actions reflect the relevant law, enforcing only the rights it still owns, or will it try to stop what copyright expiration allows? (back to contents) The Public Domain: A Wellspring of Creativity Think of all of the works spawned by public domain stories and characters, whether it is Shakespeare’s plays, Jane Austen’s novels, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, or Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Shakespeare alone has inspired hundreds of new creations. 10 Things I Hate About You and Kiss Me Kate come from The Taming of the Shrew, West Side Story from Romeo and Juliet, Forbidden Planet from The Tempest. Shakespeare himself drew on his public domain predecessors. As a federal judge observed, if the underlying works were copyrighted, “Measure for Measure would infringe Promos and Cassandra, Ragtime would infringe Michael Kohlhaas, and Romeo and Juliet itself would have infringed Arthur Brooke’s The Tragicall Historye of Romeo and Juliet . . . which in turn would have infringed several earlier Romeo and Juliets, all of which probably would have infringed Ovid’s story of Pyramus and Thisbe.” Disney and Mickey are part of this rich tradition, and in the end, Disney can continue to enjoy a plentiful intellectual property portfolio while also enriching the public domain. As mentioned earlier, Disney’s wonderful works exemplify just how valuable the public domain is. It has borrowed prolifically and brilliantly from the public domain, Disney-fying older works to make its beloved films: The Three Muskateers came from Alexandre Dumas, A Christmas Carol from Charles Dickens, Beauty and the Beast from Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve, Around the World in 80 Days from Jules Verne, Alice in Wonderland from Lewis Carroll, Snow White from The Brothers Grimm, The Hunchback of Notre Dame from Victor Hugo, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella from Charles Perrault, The Little Mermaid from Hans Christian Anderson, Pinocchio from Carlo Collodi, Huck Finn from Mark Twain, Robin Hood from English folklore, and Aladdin from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. Let us hope that Disney remembers its own debt to the public domain as Mickey Mouse enters the realm from which it has drawn so heavily! (back to contents) [1] Steamboat Willie was a technological marvel – one of the first cartoons featuring fully synchronized sound. After seeing the 1927 film The Jazz Singer (the first feature-length film with synchronized dialogue, highlighted on last year’s Public Domain Day page) Walt Disney realized that sound films were “here to stay.” See Dave Smith, Chief Archivist Emeritus, The Walt Disney Company, Steamboat Willie. With animator Ub Iwerks, he created Steamboat Willie. Disney himself performed the (mostly unintelligible) dialogue. The cartoon was a hit with audiences and lauded by critics for its ingenuity. It was initially set to enter the public domain in 1984, after a 56-year term. An expansion in 1978 pushed the date forward to 2004. Then in 1998 it was delayed until 2024 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (this is what some people call the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”). There is even a possibility that Steamboat Willie might technically have gone into the public domain on release because of defects in its original copyright notice, cite, but in 2024 we know for sure that it is free of copyright. [2] Mickey’s first appearances were actually in earlier cartoons from 1928, Plane Crazy and The Gallopin’ Gaucho. Both were silent films and neither attracted a distributor. It was Steamboat Willie – which had synchronized sound – that put Mickey on the map. The silent version of Plane Crazy is also entering the public domain 2024, with the sound version going into the public domain in 2025. We could not find a 1928 registration or timely renewal for The Gallopin’ Gaucho, but the copyright notice on the sound version says 1929, putting it in the public domain in 2025. [3] Many have observed that “The Lion King” tracks an epic poem about Sundiata Keitam – whose name means “Lion Prince” – the founder of the Mali Empire. See Kellie Carter Jackson, The true story behind “The Lion King.” This article also tells the story of the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” which originated with South African Zulu singer Solomon Ntsele Linda; it is the subject of the Netflix documentary “ReMastered: The Lion’s Share.” [4] As described by Alva Johnston, Mickey and Chaplin “have the same blend of hero and coward, nit-wit and genius, mug and gentleman.” Walt Disney also studied other great silent film actors whose films we have celebrated on this site, including Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Laurel and Hardy. [5] Steamboat Bill, Jr. went into the public domain decades ago because its copyright was not renewed. The earlier Mickey cartoon from 1928, The Gallopin’ Gaucho, drew on the silent film The Gaucho, with Mickey echoing some of the titular character’s actions. [6] We actually had a dress rehearsal on these questions in 2022 with Winnie-the-Pooh – who was then another newly public domain Disney character that reappeared in later, copyrighted works and was also covered by trademark rights – went into the public domain. You can read that analysis here. [7] To quote the Copyright Office primer on derivative works: “[I]t is not possible to extend the length of protection for a copyrighted work by creating a derivative work…the copyright in the derivative work will not extend to the public domain material, and the use of the public domain material in a derivative work will not prevent anyone else from using the same public domain work for another derivative work.” [8] See the Copyright Office Compendium. Regarding generic character traits, courts have held that being “nice,” having a “cocky attitude,” and being “young, attractive, and sarcastic” are not independently copyrightable See Shame on You Prods. v. Banks (C.D. Cal. 2015, aff’d 9th Cir. 2017); Campbell v. Walt Disney Co. (N.D. Cal. 2010); Gable v. Nat’l Broad. Co. (C.D. Cal. 2010). [9] 15 U.S.C. §§1114, 1125(a). [10] A small subset of superbrands with “famous” marks gets extra protection against “dilution” that impairs the distinctiveness or harms the reputation of the famous mark, but this is subject to exceptions for expressive uses. [11] For more detailed legal analyses of this phenomenon, see Elizabeth L. Rosenblatt, The Adventure of the Shrinking Public Domain and Irene Calboli, Overlapping Trademark and Copyright Protection: A Call for Concern and Action. You can also read related stories by Sansu the Cat in Medium and Timothy B. Lee in Ars Technica. [12] Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox, 539 U.S. 23 (2003) dealt with an attempt to make an attribution-like claim under the federal trademark statute over public domain works, but the larger policy underlying the decision is that trademark law cannot be used to circumvent copyright expiration. Dastar had repackaged parts of a public domain documentary, removing the original credits and presenting it as a Dastar production. Twentieth Century Fox owned the copyrights to the documentary before they expired and claimed that Dastar violated trademark law by passing off Fox’s work as its own and failing to attribute it to Fox. The Supreme Court rejected this claim. [13] Comedy III v. New Line, 200 F.3d 593 (9th Cir. 2000). [14] The McCarthy trademark treatise explains: “The expiration of copyright on a copyrighted work, such as a motion picture containing a cartoon character, should place limits on the scope of trademark rights in the character. Under the view that upon expiration of copyright the public should have free use of the work, copyright policy requires that anyone should be able to reproduce, display and perform the out-of-copyright motion picture so long as there is no confusion as to the source, sponsorship or affiliation of the seller of the reproduced film,” and “a court should not permit trademark in an image to serve the same function as did the lapsed copyright to exclude others from reproducing and distributing the out-of-copyright work, such as a film . . . a balancing of the rights of trademark and of the 'public domain' status of out-of-copyright works is needed. A similar balancing is made when constitutional free speech policies are balanced against the prevention of consumer confusion.” J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition, § 6.30. [15] Maljack Prods. v. Goodtimes Home Video Corp., 81 F.3d 881 (9th Cir. 1996), quoting Leslie A. Kurtz, Protection for Titles of Literary Works in the Public Domain, 37 Rutgers L.Rev. 53, 77 (1984). See also Walt Disney Productions v. Souvaine Selective Pictures, Inc. (2d Cir. 1951) (Disney could not prevent another film producer from using the title “Alice in Wonderland” because “the book ‘Alice in Wonderland’ is no longer subject to copyright and is as much in the public domain as are Shakespeare’s plays. Anyone has a legal right to make a picture based on Louis Carroll’s book and entitled ‘Alice in Wonderland.’”) [16] Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Productions, 353 F.3d 792 (9th Cir. 2003); Mattel case: Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002) [17] In a 2023 case the Supreme Court let the Rogers test stand for these kinds of uses. Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC, 143 S. Ct. 1578 (2023) [18] In order to claim copyright in newer versions of Mickey Mouse, Disney needs to argue that they are different from Mickey 1.0. Having said that, it cannot then argue that Mickey 1.0 is effectively the same as the more famous Mickey and therefore enjoys the same status. [19] 15 U.S.C. §1125(c)(3). [20] See Sony v. Fireworks, 137 F.Supp.2d 1177 (C.D. Cal. 2001) (the case also included unsuccessful copyright claims).

In the mid 2000s, Pixar was beginning to represent Disney animation, and as a result Disney Animation Studios started to take a backseat in the eyes of the public (and the eyes of Disney management). Having some successful pictures (Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, etc.) meant owning the brand and indicating to audiences the source - and hopefully encouraging them to buy tickets to _non-pixar_ Disney films.Call me naive, but I don&#x27;t think there was anything calculated about it more than attaching a mascot to the studio - like the Luxo Jr Lamp on Pixar films. reply finnjohnsen2 1 hour agorootparentI like this.

For example, after the Lego brick patents expired, Lego sued Mega Bloks (in Canada) claiming a trademark over the design of the brick. They lost the case, because the Supreme Court (of Canada) ruled you can’t double‐dip on IP protection by turning a functional (i.e., patentable) design into a trademark.Disney putting Steamboat Willie in their logo is unlikely to actually allow Disney to effectively extend restrictions on the cartoon—but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a calculated move to deter people from reproducing Steamboat Willie after its liberation simply by the implicit threat of expensive litigation from a very large team of lawyers. reply JoshTriplett 7 hours agorootparent> They lost the case, because the Supreme Court (of Canada) ruled you can’t double‐dip on IP protection by turning a functional (i.e., patentable) design into a trademark.There&#x27;s case history on that in the US as well. reply ronsor 6 hours agorootparentIIRC, non-Nintendo-licensed Gameboy games were allowed to reproduce Nintendo&#x27;s trademarked logo because it was necessary for the game to run.Trademarks are restricted to brand identification only; attempting to use them for anything else will result in trouble and wasted money. reply bentley 6 hours agorootparentNintendo did attempt that trick, although the case you’re thinking of is Sega v.

Accolade, but the lockout system on the Genesis worked on the same legal theory (e.g. induced trademark infringement equals Doctorowian[0] interpretations of \"intellectual property\"[1]). For the Game Boy, the problem was that Taiwan[2] didn&#x27;t have a copyright treaty with Japan, but they did have a trademark treaty, so if you induced pirates to commit a trademark violation you could get them with something. Same idea, but the jurisdiction is different, so all the existing case law about not turning trademark into mutant perpetual copyright wouldn&#x27;t apply here.[0] \"Intellectual property is any law that allows you to dictate the conduct of your competitors.\" - Cory Doctorow, paraphrased[1] Yes, it&#x27;s a shitty made-up term to make you confuse four different kinds of law, no I don&#x27;t care.

Decreasing the length of new copyright terms could be done the same way, without any need for an amendment.Reducing the length of existing copyright terms might be considered an ex post facto law. Those are explicitly prohibited by the Constitution.The Constitution states that copyrights must be limited in length. Retroactively extending the duration of existing copyrights (as opposed to new copyrights) should be unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court said in Eldred v.

Correcting them would require an amendment. reply ronsor 6 hours agorootparent> Reducing the length of existing copyright terms might be considered an ex post facto law.It&#x27;s arguable that \"about a century\" was not what the drafters of the Constitution had in mind when writing \"a limited time\", but convincing the Supreme Court of that would be harder than an actual amendment.But isn&#x27;t the ex post facto prohibition mainly related to consequences of past actions rather than general public policy? No one is going to jail because copyright terms were reduced to 15 years from 95.I think such a reduction would definitely be constitutional if it were phrased as \"all new copyright terms will be XYZ, and existing ones will expire XYZ from the effective date of this act,\" but I&#x27;m not totally convinced that&#x27;s necessary. reply mod50ack 4 hours agorootparentprev> Reducing the length of existing copyright terms might be considered an ex post facto law. Those are explicitly prohibited by the Constitution.No, that is definitely not an ex post facto law. That&#x27;s not even close to what the ex post facto law clause covers (dealing with punishments for actions that were kosher at the time they took place).There is an argument that shortening copyrights is prohibited by the takings clause. But I think there is a very good argument that shortening them isn&#x27;t prohibited by the takings clause (for the same public-private interest balance reason that led to the first amendment arguments in Eldred v.

Applications are not required to recognize public domain content and make it unrestricted when copyright expires. Having it remain under ownership forever doesn&#x27;t make anything easier. And, in fact, copyrights having a single, simple owner is just... not the case. So to whatever extent there is a need to keep track of owners, copyright expiration only makes things easier (because if a work is in the public domain, you can no longer screw it up). reply tzs 8 hours agoparentprevThere have only been two copyright extensions that affected the copyright on Mickey Mouse, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find any significant Disney involvement with the first one.The first one was when the Copyright Act of 1909 was replaced with the Copyright Act of 1976. Between 1909 and 1976 there had been a lot of changes in technology, such as the rise of radio, TV, movies, and computers, and it was widely agreed that the 1909 Act was not up to handling it. Also international distribution was more common, and most thought the US needed its copyright law to be more compatible with the rest of the world. The 1976 Act started that harmonization (although it left a lot of it for the Berne Implementation Act of 1988).The second was the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998. That one Disney was a significant force in its creation and passing. reply kevinmchugh 6 hours agorootparentThe 1976 act was also useful in settling the idea of a \"work for hire\".

Most recordings are copyrighted, but that’s because recording technology only became hugely prevalent during existing copyright terms.Looking at it another way, an uncreative recording of a classical performance will be copyrighted for a period of time, but after it expires, a recording of the recording won’t add any further copyright.

    "originBody": "Qatar Airways Bans YouTuber For Negative Review Ben Schlappig 20 hours ago 179 179 Share Tweet Qatar Airways has reportedly banned a YouTuber after he posted a negative review of a flight, and also fired the crew. The carrier’s approach here simply defies logic… In this post: Qatar Airways bans Josh Cahill over unfavorable review My take on this Qatar Airways situation Bottom line Qatar Airways bans Josh Cahill over unfavorable review Josh Cahill is a popular YouTuber who reviews flights, and on Saturday he published a roughly 20-minute video about how he was “banned and bribed” by Qatar Airways. This followed an August 2023 video review he published, entitled “the shocking decline of Qatar Airways,” about an economy class flight that he took from Colombo to Doha. Let me try to summarize what happened as briefly but accurately as possible, according to Josh: Days after he published the video review, Qatar Airways reached out to ask him to hop on a call, which he agreed to, and that included the company’s VP of corporate communications Once on the call, the Qatar Airways representatives immediately said that whatever is talked about is off the record, which Josh didn’t agree to; he was then asked what his motive was for such a negative review They said the video reflects negatively on the airline, and they offered Josh a free flight if he’s willing to delete the video, which he rejected They then asked Josh to delete the negative comments on the video from Qatar Airways employees complaining about poor working conditions at the airline, which he also refused to do A week later, he received an email informing him that an upcoming booking on Qatar Airways had been canceled, and that the airline can no longer permit additional bookings from him The email references articles 8 & 12 of the contract of carriage, which require permission in order to film on an aircraft, though that was never otherwise enforced for him or any other YouTubers publishing positive reviews A short time later, Josh received an email from one of the flight attendants who was working his flight, acknowledging that “I know I gave you permission to film the interaction, but I must ask you to remove me from the video,” because “I was pressured to write a statement that I didn’t give you permission to be filmed,” and “if I don’t write it, I will most likely be dismissed” Since Josh wasn’t willing to voluntarily take down the video, Qatar Airways took all of these statements from crew and sent them to YouTube, demanding that the video be removed for privacy reasons For those with an IP address in Qatar, Josh’s initial flight review has apparently been blocked, so that you can no longer watch it While Josh can’t personally vouch for this, he claims that many sources have told him that the entire crew was terminated after the airline wasn’t able to remove the video You can watch the video for yourself below… Play My take on this Qatar Airways situation It’s kind of unbelievable how much an airline can get in its own way. I mean, my gosh, how much more poorly could Qatar Airways have handled this? The unprofessionalism and short-sightedness here is astounding. The best thing Qatar Airways could have done is to either issue an apology for the poor experience or to just ignore the video. Frankly, the video wasn’t even that negative, though Josh does tend to have rather dramatic video titles. All Qatar Airways has done with its response is to draw way more attention to what happened, which seems to be the opposite of what the goal was. I mean, when he rejected the free flight and said he wasn’t willing to speak off the record, didn’t they get a sense that he would make a video about it? And did they think they would look good in it? And let’s not even talk about the concept of forcing an employee to email Josh to literally admit that they were being told to lie in order to save their jobs. Some people should be fired here for incompetence, but it shouldn’t be the crew of the flight… I understand in a country like Qatar, it’s easy enough to control the narrative of things, and force people to do what you’d like, if you have enough money or power. However, that approach doesn’t work when you’re trying to run a global airline. And while it’s absolutely within the carrier’s rights to ban passengers for whatever reason, it’s not a great look if you’re trying to make the airline or country have wide appeal. Now, I think there’s one very important point to acknowledge, and it kind of sheds some light on how this all played out. This happened while Akbar Al Baker was still CEO of Qatar Airways, as he suddenly resigned several weeks ago. He was known for creating a culture of fear, and where so many decisions were driven by what “the chief” wanted, rather than actually using logic. So it’s easy enough to figure out exactly how this happened. Al Baker was somehow made aware of this video, and told his minions to have the video removed. Then everyone did everything they could to get that result, rather than pointing out to him that this might not be a good idea. But there’s some good news. Qatar Airways’ new CEO, Badr Mohammed Al Meer, has shared some refreshing new priorities for the airline, including stating that creating “a culture of trust and empowerment will be the building blocks of our shared success.” So far there’s actually some substance to this, as he has ended the controversial employee curfew that existed for years within weeks of starting his job. Hopefully this is the first of many changes. I think it would be really smart of him to undo this and apologize for the way that Qatar Airways handled this. Qatar Airways took a short-sighted approach here Bottom line Qatar Airways has banned a popular YouTuber after he posted a negative review of a flight back in August. The airline first tried to get him to remove the video by offering him a free flight, then had the crew email him to revoke permission to appear in the video, and then approached YouTube directly. This happened under the Al Baker “regime,” so here’s to hoping under Qatar Airways’ new CEO, things change a bit… What do you make of this Qatar Airways and Josh Cahill situation?

Josh often pushes the boundaries endlessly and needlessly. Qatar Airways service may have dropped a bit (in the air I still find them stellar, on the ground far less so), but it's still a leading airline of the world. Having said that, it was pretty tacky of Qatar Airways to ask him to take down the video in exchange for a free ticket. That is precariously close to bribery.

I had to call my travel agent to set the record straight in the system, after which I was able to get the airline to capitulate.Placing “no show” in the record to try and blame us was definitely not good customer service.Sure my gripe may be with the government, but what difference does it make? They are one and the same given that both entities will point fingers at each other. I tried calling Qatar airways first - they were the ones who suggested calling the health authorities.As I’ve posted on this site in the past, I am very meticulous when preparing documentation for foreign trips. So I spent hours researching the policies and procedures and had dozens of pages of documentation on me as a contingency plan. I would expect that an airline would do the same if you were in a similar situation after the significant research you’ve done! I would not just give up and say it’s your fault. That’s not an acceptable outcome in my opinion, especially after you’ve taken pains to do the right thing.I didn’t expect any compensation but I did expect them to make good on the contract of carriage to get us home by rebooking us on the same itinerary just without the day long stopover. reply woutr_be 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had a weird experience with Qatar customer service as well. Basically during covid you could get a full refund if you cancelled or rescheduled your flight.

All I had to do was pay that flight with the issued voucher.However they failed to even send me the voucher within 24 hours, so when I called back, I was told the flight would be an extra US$3,000.I tried to explain the issue, that they never send me the voucher, and due to that I would be on the hook for extra costs? The support agent was totally uncooperative, and just kept asking \"what would you like to do\". Turned into a bit of a shouting match.In the end I had my flight cancelled, and a voucher was issued straight away.I still don&#x27;t understand why they couldn&#x27;t just look at their own logs, realize they actually didn&#x27;t send the voucher, and just book me on the original flight. Or why the first support agent couldn&#x27;t just use my voucher to pay for the flight.This was also a business class flight, so I can&#x27;t imagine how economy passengers are treated. reply bdhess 5 hours agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t your gripe with the Qatari government then rather than the airline?It’s an absolute dictatorship.

    "originBody": "AMD’s CDNA 3 Compute Architecture December 17, 2023 clamchowder, Cheese 1 Comment AMD has a long history of vying for GPU compute market share. Ever since Nvidia got first dibs with their Tesla architecture, AMD has been playing catch up. Terascale 3 moved from VLIW5 to VLIW4 to improve execution unit utilization in compute workloads. GCN replaced Terascale and emphasized consistent performance for both GPGPU and graphics applications. Then, AMD diverged their GPU architecture development into separate CDNA and RDNA lines specialized for compute and graphics respectively. CDNA 2 finally brought AMD notable success. MI250X and MI210 GPUs won several supercomputer contracts including ORNL’s Frontier, which holds first place on November 2023’s TOP500 list. But while CDNA2 delivered solid and cost efficient FP64 compute, H100 had better AI performance and offered a larger unified GPU. CDNA 3 looks to close those gaps by bringing forward everything AMD has to offer. The company’s experience in advanced packaging technology is on full show, with MI300X getting a sophisticated chiplet setup. Together with Infinity Fabric components, advanced packaging lets MI300X scale to compete with Nvidia’s largest GPUs. On the memory side, Infinity Cache from the RDNA line gets pulled into the CDNA world to mitigate bandwidth issues. But that doesn’t mean MI300X is light on memory bandwidth. It still gets a massive HBM setup, giving it the best of both worlds. Finally, CDNA 3’s compute architecture gets significant generational improvements to boost throughput and utilization. GPU Layout AMD has a tradition of using chiplets to cheaply scale core counts in their Ryzen and Epyc CPUs. MI300X uses a similar strategy at a high level, with compute split off onto Accelerator Complex Dies, or XCDs. XCDs are analogous to CDNA 2 or RDNA 3’s Graphics Compute Dies (GCDs) or Ryzen’s Core Complex Dies (CCDs). AMD likely changed the naming because CDNA products lack the dedicated graphics hardware present in the RDNA line. Each XCD contains a set of cores and a shared cache. Specifically, every XCD physically has 40 CDNA 3 Compute Units, with 38 of these being enabled per XCD on the MI300X. A 4 MB L2 cache sits on the XCD as well, and serves all of the die’s CUs. MI300X has eight XCDs, giving it 304 total Compute Units. That’s a large increase over the MI250X’s 220 CUs. Even better, MI300X can expose all of those CUs as a single GPU. On MI250X, a programmer would have to manually split up work across the two GPUs because each has a separate pool of memory. Nvidia’s H100 consists of 132 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and also presents them to programmers as a big unified GPU. H100 takes a conventional approach by implementing all of that compute on a large monolithic die. Even with everything on the same die, H100 is too large to give all of its SMs equal access to cache. So, H100 splits the L2 into two instances. A single SM can use all 50 MB of L2, but access to more than 25 MB will incur a performance penalty. Still, Nvidia’s strategy makes more efficient use of cache capacity than MI300X’s. A MI300X XCD doesn’t use L2 capacity on other XCDs for caching, just as CCDs on Epyc/Ryzen don’t allocate into each other’s L3 caches. Intel’s Ponte Vecchio (PVC) compute GPUs make for a very interesting comparison. PVC places its basic compute building blocks in dies called Compute Tiles, which are roughly analogous to CDNA 3’s XCDs. Similarly, PVC’s Base Tile serves a similar function to CDNA 3’s IO dies. Both contain a large last level cache and HBM memory controllers. Like MI300X, a Ponte Vecchio card can be exposed as a single GPU with a unified memory pool. However, there are important differences. Ponte Vecchio’s Compute Tiles are smaller with only eight Xe Cores, compared to 38 Compute Units on a CDNA 3 XCD. Instead of using a Compute Tile wide cache, Intel uses larger L1 caches to reduce cross-die traffic demands. Using a two-stack Ponte Vecchio part as a unified GPU presents challenges too. The EMIB bridge between the two stacks only offers 230 GB/s of bandwidth, which isn’t enough to fully utilize HBM bandwidth if accesses are striped across all memory controllers. To address this, Intel has APIs that can let programs work with the GPU in a NUMA configuration. In terms of physical construction, PVC and CDNA 3’s designs have different challenges. CDNA 3’s ability to present a unified memory pool with HBM requires high bandwidth between the IO dies. PVC gets by with a relatively low bandwidth EMIB link. But PVC’s design gets complicated because it uses four die types with different process nodes and foundries. AMD only uses two die types in MI300X, and both nodes (6 nm and 5 nm) are from TSMC. Tackling the Bandwidth Problem Compute has been outpacing memory for decades. Like CPUs, GPUs have countered this with increasingly sophisticated caching strategies. CDNA 2 used a conventional two-level cache hierarchy with a 8 MB L2, relying on HBM2e to keep the execution units fed. But even with HBM2e, MI250X was more bandwidth starved than Nvidia’s H100. If AMD simply added more compute, bandwidth starvation could be come a serious issue. So, AMD took a leaf out of RDNA(2)’s book and added an “Infinity Cache”. Much like the consumer RDNA GPUs, MI300’s Infinity Cache is what the technical documentation calls Memory Attached Last Level (MALL), which is a fancy way to say that the last level cache level is a memory side cache. Compared to L1 and L2 caches that are closer to the Compute Units, the Infinity Cache is attached to the memory controllers. All memory traffic passes through the Infinity Cache regardless of what block it’s coming from. That includes IO traffic, so communications between peer GPUs can benefit from Infinity Cache bandwidth. Because the Infinity Cache always has the most up to date view of DRAM contents, It doesn’t have to handle snoops or other cache maintenance operations. From AMD’s presentation on their RDNA architecture. L2 slices may be associated with memory controllers, but the L2 is not a memory side cache because many agents can write to DRAM without going through L2 But because a memory side cache is farther away from compute, it generally suffers from higher latency. Therefore, AMD has multi-megabyte L2 caches on both CDNA 3 and RDNA 2 to insulate compute from the lower performance of a memory side cache. Like RDNA 2, CDNA 3’s Infinity Cache is 16-way set associative. However, CDNA 3’s implementation is more optimized for bandwidth than capacity. It’s composed of 128 slices, each with 2 MB of capacity and 64 bytes per cycle of read bandwidth. All of the slices together can deliver 8192 bytes per cycle, which is good for 17.2 TB/s at 2.1 GHz. For comparison, RDNA 2’s 128 MB Infinity Cache can provide 1024 bytes per cycle across all slices, giving it 2.5 TB/s of theoretical bandwidth at 2.5 GHz. Die shots suggest each Infinity Cache slice has 4 MB of capacity and provides 32B/cycle. RDNA 2 therefore uses bigger slices, fewer of them and has less bandwidth from each slice. MI300X’s focus on bandwidth means workloads with lower compute density can still enjoy decent performance if they can get enough Infinity Cache hits. That should make CDNA 3’s execution units easier to feed even though the main memory bandwidth to compute ratio hasn’t changed much and remains behind Nvidia’s. MI250X figures are for a single GCD If we construct a roofline model for MI300X using Infinity Cache’s theoretical bandwidth, we can achieve full FP64 throughput with 4.75 FLOPs per byte loaded. It’s a massive improvement over DRAM, which would require 14.6 to 15 FLOPs per byte loaded. Possible Challenges with Cross-Die Bandwidth MI300X’s Infinity Fabric spans four IO dies, each of which connects to two HBM stacks and associated cache partitions. However, the bandwidth of the die to die connections may limit achieving full Infinity Cache bandwidth when MI300X operates as a single logical GPU with a unified memory pool. If memory accesses are striped evenly across the memory controllers (and thus cache partitions), as is typical for most GPU designs, the available die-to-die bandwidth may prevent applications from reaching theoretical Infinity Cache bandwidth. First, let’s focus on a single IO die partition. It has 2.7 TB/s of ingress bandwidth along two edges adjacent to other IO dies. Its two XCDs can get 4.2 TB/s of Infinity cache bandwidth. If L2 miss requests are evenly striped across the dies, 3/4 of that bandwidth, or 3.15 TB/s, must come from peer dies. Since 3.15 TB/s is greater than 2.7 TB/s, cross-die bandwidth will limit achievable cache bandwidth. We can add the die in the opposite corner without any differences because all of its required die-to-die bandwidth goes in the opposite direction. MI300X has bidirectional die-to-die links. If all dies demand maximum Infinity Cache bandwidth in a unified configuration, things get more complex. Extra cross-die bandwidth is consumed because transfers between dies in opposite corners require two hops, and that’ll cut into ingress bandwidth available for each die. While MI300X was engineered to act like one big GPU, splitting MI300X into multiple NUMA domains could give higher combined Infinity Cache bandwidth. It’s possible that AMD will have an API that will transparently split up programs among the different IO dies. Additionally, the likelihood of bandwidth issues would be minimized by high L2 hit rates, which would help avoid those bottlenecks. And in cases where the Infinity Cache hit rate are low, the MI300X’s die-to-die links are sufficiently robust and offer ample bandwidth to smoothly handle HBM traffic. Cross-XCD Coherency Even though the Infinity Cache doesn’t have to worry about coherency, the L2 caches do. Ordinary GPU memory accesses follow a relaxed coherency model, but programmers can use atomics to enforce ordering between threads. Memory accesses on AMD GPUs can also be marked with a GLC bit (Global Level Coherent). Those mechanisms still have to work if AMD wants to expose MI300X as a single big GPU, rather than a multi-GPU configuration as MI250X had done. Snippet of RDNA 2 code from Folding at Home, showing use of global memory atomics On prior AMD GPUs, atomics and coherent accesses were handled at L2. Loads with the GLC bit set would bypass L1 caches, and thus get the most up-to-date copy of data from L2. That doesn’t work with MI300X because the most up-to-date copy of a cacheline could be on another XCD’s L2 cache. AMD could make coherent accesses bypass L2, but that would lower performance. That may have worked for a gaming GPU where coherent accesses aren’t too important. But AMD wants MI300X to perform well with compute workloads, and needs MI300A (the APU variant) to efficiently share data between the CPU and GPU. That’s where Infinity Fabric comes in. CM = Coherent Master. CS = Coherent Slave Like Infinity Fabric on Ryzen, CDNA 3 has Coherent Masters (CMs) where the XCDs connect to the IO dies. Coherent Slaves (CS) sit at each memory controller alongside Infinity Cache (IC) slices. We can infer how these work via Ryzen documentation, which shows Coherent Slaves have a probe filter and hardware for handling atomic transactions. MI300X likely has a similar CS implementation. From AMD’s Zen PPR, showing error reporting available at the Coherent Slave (CS). If a coherent write shows up at the CS, it has to ensure any thread doing a coherent read will observe that write regardless of where that thread is running on the GPU. That means any XCD with the line cached will have to reload it from Infinity Cache to get the most up to date data. Naively, the CS would have to probe L2 caches across all XCDs because any of them could have the corresponding data cached. The probe filter helps avoid this by tracking which XCDs actually have the line cached, thus avoiding unnecessary probe traffic. CDNA 3’s whitepaper says the snoop filter (another name for a probe filter) is large enough to cover multiple XCD L2 caches. I certainly believe them because MI300X has 32 MB of L2 across all eight XCDs. Even consumer Ryzen parts can have more CCD-private cache for the probe filter to cover. Thanks to CPU-like Infinity Fabric components like CS and CM, a XCD can have a private write-back L2 cache capable of handling intra-die coherent accesses without going across the IO die fabric. AMD could have gone for a naive solution where coherent operations and atomics go straight to the Infinity Cache, bypassing L2. Such a solution would save engineering effort and create a simpler design at the cost of lower performance for coherent operations. Evidently, AMD thought optimizing atomics and coherent accesses was important enough to go the extra mile. To ensure coherence of local memory writes of CUs in different agents a buffer_wbl2 sc1 is required. It will writeback dirty L2 cache lines. To ensure coherence of local memory reads of CUs in different agents a buffer_inv sc0 sc1 is required. It will invalidate non-local L2 cache lines if configured to have multiple L2 caches. LLVM Documentation for the GFX942 Target However, CDNA 3 within the XCD still works a lot like prior GPUs. Evidently normal memory writes will not automatically invalidate written lines from peer caches as in CPUs. Instead, code must explicitly tell the L2 to write back dirty lines and have peer L2 caches invalidate non-local L2 lines. L2 Cache Closer to the Compute Units, each MI300X XCD packs a 4 MB L2 cache. The L2 is a more traditional GPU cache, and is built from 16 slices. Each 256 KB slice can provide 128 bytes per cycle of bandwidth. At 2.1 GHz, that’s good for 4.3 TB/s. As the last level of cache on the same die as the Compute Units, the L2 plays an important role in acting as a backstop for L1 misses. Compared to H100 and MI250X, MI300X has a higher L2 bandwidth to compute ratio. Because each XCD comes with a L2, L2 bandwidth naturally scales as a CDNA 3 product comes with more XCDs. In other words, MI300X’s L2 arrangement avoids the problem of getting a single cache hooked up to a lot of Compute Units and maintain a ton of bandwidth. PVC’s L2 is a clear contrast. As Intel adds more Compute Tiles, the Base Tile’s shared L2 gets increasing bandwidth demands. From a cache design standpoint, PVC’s configuration is simpler because the L2 acts as a single point of coherency and a backstop for L1 misses. But it can’t offer as much bandwidth as MI300X’s L2. MI300X also likely enjoys better L2 latency, making it easier for applications to utilize cache bandwidth. L1 Cache CDNA 3’s focus on high cache bandwidth continues to the L1. In a move that matches RDNA, CDNA 3 sees its L1 throughput increased from 64 to 128 bytes per cycle. CDNA 2 increased per-CU vector throughput to 4096 bits per cycle compared to 2048 in GCN, so CDNA 3’s doubled L1 throughput helps maintain the same compute to L1 bandwidth ratio as GCN. Besides higher bandwidth, CDNA 3 increases L1 capacity from 16 to 32 KB. It’s a move that again mirrors developments in the RDNA line, where RDNA 3 received a similar size boost for its first level cache. Higher hitrates from the larger cache would lower average memory access latency, improving execution unit utilization. Transferring data from L2 and beyond costs power, so higher hitrate can help power efficiency too. While CDNA 3 improves first level caching, Ponte Vecchio is still the champion in that category. Each Xe Core in PVC can deliver 512 bytes per cycle, giving Intel a very high L1 bandwidth to compute ratio. The L1 is large as well at 512 KB. Memory bound kernels that fit in L1 will do very well on Intel’s architecture. However, Ponte Vecchio lacks a mid-level cache at the Compute Tile level, and could face a harsh performance cliff as data spills out of L1. Scheduling and Execution Units A complex chiplet setup and modified cache hierarchy let AMD present MI300X as a single GPU, thus addressing one of MI250X’s biggest weaknesses. But AMD didn’t settle with that. They also made iterative improvements to the core Compute Unit architecture, addressing CDNA 2’s difficulties with utilizing its FP32 units. From the CDNA 3 whitepaper When CDNA 2 shifted to handling FP64 natively, AMD provided double rate FP32 via packed execution. The compiler would have to pack two FP32 values into adjacent registers and perform the same instruction on both. Often, the compiler struggled to pull this off unless programmers explicitly used vectors. CDNA 3 gets around this with a more flexible dual issue mechanism. Most likely, this is an extension of GCN’s multi-issue capability rather than RDNA 3’s VOPD/wave64 method. Each cycle, the CU scheduler selects one of the four SIMDs and checks whether any of its threads are ready to execute. If multiple threads are ready, GCN could select up to five of them to send to execution units. Of course a GCN SIMD only has a single 16-wide vector ALU, so GCN would have to select threads with different instruction types ready to multi-issue. For example, a scalar ALU instruction can issue alongside a vector ALU one. An alternative approach would be to take advantage of wave64’s wider width and let a thread complete two vector instructions over four cycles. However, doing so would break GCN’s model of handling VALU instructions in multiples of 4 clock cycles. CDNA 3 is still more closely related to GCN than RDNA is, and reusing GCN’s multi-issue strategy is a sensible move. AMD also could have used RDNA 3’s VOPD mechanism, where a special instruction format can contain two operations. While that method could increase per-thread performance, relying on the compiler to find dual issue pairs could be hit or miss. From an old AMD presentation Instead of relying on the compiler, CDNA 3’s dual issue approach likely pushes responsibility to the programmer to expose more thread level parallelism via larger dispatch sizes. If a SIMD has more threads in flight, it’ll have a better chance of finding two threads with FP32 instructions ready to execute. At minimum, a SIMD will need two threads active to achieve full FP32 throughput. In practice CDNA 3 will need much higher occupancy to achieve good FP32 utilization. GPUs use in-order execution so individual threads will often be blocked by memory or execution latency. Keeping one set of execution units fed can be difficult even at full occupancy. Therefore, AMD has dramatically increased the number of threads each CDNA 3 SIMD can track from 8 to 24. If a programmer can take advantage of this, CDNA 3 will be better positioned to multi-issue. But this can be difficult. AMD did not mention an increase in vector register file capacity, which often limits how many threads a SIMD can have in flight. The vector register file can hold state for more threads if each thread uses fewer registers, so CDNA 3’s multi-issue capability may work best for simple kernels with few live variables. Register file bandwidth presents another challenge for dual issue. CDNA 2’s packed FP32 execution didn’t require extra reads from the vector register file because it took advantage of wider register file ports needed to deliver 64-bit values. But separate instructions can reference different registers and require more reads from the register file. Adding more register file ports would be expensive, so CDNA 3 “generationally improves the source caching to provide better re-use and bandwidth amplification so that each vector register read can support more downstream vector or matrix operations”1. Most likely, AMD is using a larger register cache to mitigate port conflicts and keep the execution units fed. Matrix Operations Matrix multiplication has become increasingly important as machine learning picks up. Nvidia invested heavily in this area, adding matrix multiplication units (tensor cores) to their Volta and Turing architectures years ago. AMD’s CDNA architecture added matrix multiply support, but contemporary Nvidia architectures invested more heavily in matrix multiplication throughput. This especially applies to lower precision data types like FP16, which are often used in AI.Matrix FP16 FMAs/Clk Rate Relative to Packed FP16 AMD MI100 (CDNA) Compute Unit 512 4x AMD MI250X (CDNA 2) Compute Unit 512 4x AMD MI300X (CDNA 3) Compute Unit 1024 8x Nvidia V100 Streaming Multiprocessor 512 4x4 Nvidia A100 Streaming Multiprocessor 1024 4x Nvidia H100 Streaming Multiprocessor 2048 8x MI300X plays catch up by doubling per-CU matrix throughput compared to prior CDNA generations. On top of that, MI300X’s chiplet design allows a massive number of CUs. But Nvidia’s higher per-SM matrix performance still makes it a force to be reckoned with. Therefore, CDNA 3 continues AMD’s trend of hitting Nvidia hard from the vector FP64 performance side while maintaining strong AI performance in isolation. Instruction Cache Besides handling memory accesses requested by instructions, a Compute Unit has to fetch the instructions themselves from memory. GPUs traditionally had an easier time with instruction delivery because GPU code tends to be simple and not occupy a lot of memory. In the DirectX 9 era, Shader Model 3.0 even imposed limits on code size. As GPUs evolved to take on compute, AMD rolled out their GCN architecture with 32 KB instruction caches. Today, CDNA 2 and RDNA GPUs continue to use 32 KB instruction caches. CDNA 3 increases instruction cache capacity to 64 KB. Associativity doubles too, from 4-way to 8-way. That means higher instruction cache hitrates for CDNA 3 with bigger, more complex kernels. I suspect AMD is targeting CPU code naively ported to GPUs. Complex CPU code can be punishing on GPUs, since they can’t hide instruction cache miss latency with long distance instruction prefetching and accurate branch prediction. Higher instruction cache capacity helps contain larger kernels, while increased associativity helps avoid conflict misses. Like CDNA 2, each CDNA 3 instruction cache instance services two Compute Units. GPU kernels are usually launched with large enough work sizes to fill many Compute Units, so sharing the instruction cache is a good way to efficiently use SRAM storage. I suspect AMD didn’t share the cache across even more Compute Units because a single cache instance may struggle to satisfy instruction bandwidth demands. Final Words CDNA 3’s whitepaper says that “the greatest generational changes in the AMD CDNA 3 architecture lie in the memory hierarchy” and I would have to agree. While AMD improved the Compute Unit’s low precision math capabilities compared to CDNA 2, the real improvement was the addition of the Infinity Cache. MI250X’s primary issue was that it wasn’t really one GPU. It was two GPUs sharing the same package which only has 200 Gigabyte per second per direction between the GCDs. In AMD’s assessment that 200 Gigabyte per second per direction was not enough to have the MI250X show up as one GPU which is why AMD significantly increased the die to die bandwidth. For this image, I am considering North-South as the vertical axis and East-West as the horizontal axis AMD increased the total East-West bandwidth to 2.4TB/sec per direction which is a 12 fold increase from MI250X. And the total North-South bandwidth is an even higher 3.0TB/sec per direction. With these massive bandwidth increases, AMD was able to make the MI300 appear as one large, unified accelerator instead of as 2 separate accelerators like MI250X. 4.0 TB/s of total ingress bandwidth for one die may not seem like enough if both XCD needs all available memory bandwidth. However, both XCDs combined can only access up to 4.2TB/s of bandwidth from the IO die so realistically the 4.0TB/s of ingress bandwidth is a non-issue. What the maximum of 4.0TB/s of ingress bandwidth does mean is that a single IO die can’t take advantage of all 5.3TB/s of memory bandwidth. This is similar to desktop Ryzen 7000 parts where one CCD can’t take full advantage of DDR5 bandwidth due to Infinity Fabric limits. However this is likely to be a non-issue on MI300X because the bandwidth demands will be highest with all dies in play. In that case, each die will consume about 1.3 TB/s of bandwidth and getting 3/4 of that over cross-die links won’t be a problem. But MI300 isn’t just a GPGPU part, it also has an APU part as well, which is in my opinion is the more interesting of the two MI300 products. AMD’s first ever APU, Llano, was released in 2011 which was based on AMD’s K10.5 CPU paired with a Terascale 3 GPU. Fast forward to 2023 and for their first “big iron” APU, the MI300A, AMD paired 6 of their CDNA3 XCDs with 24 Zen 4 cores all while reusing the same base die. This allows for the CPU and the GPU to shared the same memory address space which removes the need to copy data over an external bus to keep the CPU and GPU coherent with each other. We look forward to what AMD could do with future “big iron” APUs as well as their future GPGPU line up. Maybe they’ll have specialized CCDs with wider vector units or maybe they’ll have networking on their base die that can directly connect to the xGMI switches that Broadcom have said to be making. Regardless of what future Instinct products look like, we are excited to both be looking forward to those products as well as testing the MI300 series.

On RDNA3, these execute at the same rate as normal shader&#x2F;vector operations, but on Nvidia RTX cards there are Tensor cores which accelerate them.

That&#x27;s 4 times faster than regular, and almost double what the XTX lists!Ampere and newer also have native sparsity support which means that you can skip over the zeroes &#x27;for free&#x27;, which Nvidia uses to market double the TFlops, which is kind of misleading imo. But the 195 TFlops are even before sparsity is included!I&#x27;m not sure if the 93 TFlops (120 with boost clocks) on AMD are with FP16 or FP32 accumulation, as with FP32 accumulation the 4080 slows down significantly and gets much closer with 97.5 TFlops.Intel Xe-HPG (used in the Arc A cards) also offers very aggressive matrix acceleration via XMX, with 137.6 FP16 TFlops at base clock, vs. 17.2 FP32 TFlops. reply einpoklum 9 hours agorootparentprevThat is interesting, even though I would need to look at non-consumer-GFX cards.

OP&#x27;s main point was that AMD had a years-long policy of not officially supporting any of their consumer-grade GPUs for computing applications, as a result AMD had lost critical opportunities during this time period - even a small market share is better than none. OP mentioned Radeon VII because it was the only exception, and it only happened because there was strong support from some groups within AMD - which didn&#x27;t last long. After RDNA was released, computing support on consumer GPUs was put on pause again until several months ago. There&#x27;s a big difference between \"not optimally designed for computing\" and \"no official support of computing at all\".The outcome is that it created a great barrier of entry for developers and power users with desktop GPUs. You have to figure out everything by yourself, which is not supposed to be particularly difficult as it&#x27;s the norm in the FOSS world. The problem is that, in a community-driven project, you would have received help or at least a hint from your peers or project maintainers who&#x27;s familiar with the system. Not so for AMD. if something doesn&#x27;t work, no AMD developers will provide any help or even hints - and by not providing support, the \"community\" is never really established. The ROCm GitHub Issues page was (is?) basically a post-apocalypse world abandoned by AMD, full of user self-help threads with no input from developers. Almost nothing works and nobody known why. Even if the problem reported is a general one, it would still be ignored or closed if you&#x27;re not running an officially-supported system and GPU.One time, I needed to understand a hardware feature of an AMD GPU, I eventually had to read ROCm and Linux kernel source code before finding an answer.

Sure, the consumer cards are based on a less suitable architecture, so they won&#x27;t be as good, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s not a general purpose GPU architecture anymore.The real problem is that ROCm has made the very weird technical decision of shipping GPU machine code, rather than bytecode. Nvidia has their own bytecode NVPTX, and Intel just uses SPIR-V for oneAPI.This means that ROCm support for a GPU architecture requires shipping binaries of all the libraries (such as rocBLAS, rocDNN, rocsparse, rocFFT) for all architectures.As the cherry on top, on paper one GPU family consists of different architectures! The RX 6700 XT identifies as a different &#x27;architecture&#x27; (gfx1031) than the RX 6800 XT (gfx1030). These are &#x27;close enough&#x27; that you can tell ROCm to use gfx1030 binaries on gfx1031 and it&#x27;ll usually just work, but still.I feel like this is a large part of the reason AMD is so bad about supporting older GPUs in ROCm. It&#x27;d cost a bit of effort, sure, but I feel like the enormous packages you&#x27;d get are a bigger issue. (This is another factor that kills hobbyist ROCm, because anyone with a Pascal+ GPU can do CUDA, but ROCm support is usually limited to newer and higher end cards.) reply slavik81 12 hours agorootparent> As the cherry on top, on paper one GPU family consists of different architectures!

LLVM treats them exactly the same and all tests for the ROCm math libraries will pass when you run gfx1030 code on gfx1031 GPUs using the override.The Debian package for HIP has a patch so that if the user has a gfx1031 GPU and there are no gfx1031 code objects available, it will fall back to using gfx1030 code objects instead. When I proposed that patch upstream, it was rejected in favour of adding a new ISA that explicitly supports all the GPUs in a family. That solution is more complex and is taking longer to implement, but will more thoroughly solve that problem (as the solution Debian is using only works well when there&#x27;s one ISA in the family that is a subset of all the others). reply JonChesterfield 11 hours agorootparentprevThere was a ship-bytecode idea branded HSAIL, associated with opencl finalisers in some way. I&#x27;m not sure what killed that - would speculate that the compiler backend was annoyingly slow to run as a JIT. It&#x27;s somewhat conceptually popular under the spirv branding now.Some of the ROCm libraries are partially written in assembly. Hopefully they all have C reference implementations that can be compiled for the other architectures.My guess is that the AMD strategy of only shipping libraries for some cards + open source means ROCm-ish as built by Linux distros, who are likely to build the libs for all the architectures and not just the special few, can be expected to drive people away from the official releases. reply beebeepka 13 hours agoparentprevI thought trolling wasn&#x27;t welcome on HN reply kaycebasques 12 hours agoprevI wasn&#x27;t familiar with VLIW. Sounds cool!> Very long instruction word (VLIW) refers to instruction set architectures designed to exploit instruction level parallelism (ILP). Whereas conventional central processing units (CPU, processor) mostly allow programs to specify instructions to execute in sequence only, a VLIW processor allows programs to explicitly specify instructions to execute in parallel. This design is intended to allow higher performance without the complexity inherent in some other designs.> The traditional means to improve performance in processors include dividing instructions into substeps so the instructions can be executed partly at the same time (termed pipelining), dispatching individual instructions to be executed independently, in different parts of the processor (superscalar architectures), and even executing instructions in an order different from the program (out-of-order execution).[1] These methods all complicate hardware (larger circuits, higher cost and energy use) because the processor must make all of the decisions internally for these methods to work.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Very_long_instruction_word reply mpweiher 12 hours agoparentThe most prominent example of VLIW processors was the Itanic, er, Itanium.It, er, didn&#x27;t work out well.Hence Itanic.Their premise was that the compiler could figure out dependencies sufficiently statically so that they could put multiple sequential and some divergent execution paths in the same instruction. It turned out the compilers couldn&#x27;t actually do this, so processors figure out dependencies and parallelizable instructions dynamically from a sequential instruction stream.Which is a lot of work, a lot of chip resources and a lot of energy. And only works up to a point, after which you hit diminishing returns. Which is where we appear to be these days. reply kimixa 11 hours agorootparentVLIW is also still heavily used in DSPs and similar. And arguably the dual issue instructions in both AMD&#x27;s and Nvidia&#x27;s latest GPUs is a step back towards that.It feels like a lot of these things are cyclical - the core ideas aren&#x27;t new and phase in and out of favor as other parts of architecture design changes around and increases or decreases benefits accordingly. reply hajile 10 hours agorootparentThis is less cyclical and more common sense changes.AMD used to have 5-wide VLIW. Theoretical performance was massive, but NOTHING could take advantage of 5-wide parallelism consistently. When they switched to VLIW-4, essentially zero performance per CU was lost. GCN went the complete opposite direction and got rid of all the VLIW in exchange for tons of flexibility.It turns out that (as we&#x27;ve known for a very long time) in-order parallelism has diminishing returns. If you look at in-order CPUs for example, two generic execution ports can be used something like 80% of the time. Moving to 3 in-order drops the usage of the third to something like 15-30% and the fourth is single digits of usage.Adding a second port should guarantee lots of use, but only if the second unit is kept flexible. RDNA3 can only use the second port for a handful of operations which means that it can&#x27;t be used anywhere near that 80% metric for most applications. Future versions of RDNA and CDNA with more flexible second ports should start to be able to leverage those extra compute units (if they decide it&#x27;s worth the transistors). reply gpderetta 11 hours agorootparentprevIt is not so much that it is cyclical than VLIW being good for numerical&#x2F;DSP stuff with more predictable memory access and terrible for general computation.

There were some features that were, in theory, supposed to deal with this but using them was where the magic compiler problem came in.For DSPs you can usually predict memory latency so this isn&#x27;t an issue and VLIW works great there even with some amount of branching. reply ip26 8 hours agorootparentprevIt worked fine for graphics chips for a long time.

By accepting higher latencies, they have let themselves parallelize much more widely (or wildly) relative to CPUs - and the high number of parallel pseudo-threads provides a \"latency hiding\" effect.This effect is illustrated for example, in this presentation on optimizing GPU code:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olcf.ornl.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;03-CUDA...(lame) animation on slide 11 and onwards. reply ColonelPhantom 10 hours agoparent [–] GPUs do deal with memory in other ways than parallelism! That&#x27;s why GPUs tend to offer huge register files (up to 256 architectural registers per thread on RDNA1!) and local memories (up to 64KB LDS per workgroup on RDNA1). This means lots of work can be done purely in registers and LDS, and trips to global memory are way rarer compared to CPUs where global memory contain everything except 16 or so architectural registers.Even then, global memory is an issue. And not just because of latency, but also bandwidth! That&#x27;s why RDNA2 and Ada both added a ton of last-level cache, not to better hide latency (although it&#x27;s a welcome addition), but mostly as a &#x27;bandwidth amplifier&#x27;. reply m_mueller 2 hours agorootparentI think register files, shared memory and even texture memory patterns are basically the GPU&#x27;s way of having fully programmable caches, as opposed to cache being a grey box like on CPUs.

It’s the validation that catapults you onto the cover of Forbes. Your seat at the pantheon of famed tech bros like Adam Neumann, Elizabeth Holmes, and Sam Bankman-Fried. VCs can be a curious bunch, however. They have a special secret language — a dialect that’s borderline incomprehensible to the uninitiated. For instance, much like the Inuit people, who have many words for snow, were you aware that venture capitalists have more than 400 words for “no”? Language betrays purpose. In Orwell’s 1984, Newspeak was created to narrow the range of thought and, ultimately, make dissidence impossible. In the same vein, VCspeak has evolved to serve one key tenet: “Never say no to a founder, just in case.” Jacob’s Tech Tavern is a reader-supported publication.

VCs have no incentive to sour their relationship with you. What if you become the next Zuck and remember the deal associate who let you down gently? You’ll never hear the true reason for turning you down this time. For a pre-seed or seed round, this is either: They don’t believe in the management team. They don’t believe in the market opportunity. Today, I’m telling the story of my multitude of VC rejections. I’ll impart my hard-earned knowledge of VCspeak and explain what VCs are saying when, really, they just mean “no”. Finally, I’ll close with my top 10 survival tips for when you’re out fundraising. Fixr — The side hustle from Hell Photo by Florian Olivo on Unsplash My first real startup, Fixr — think Uber for car repairs — was a mess from the start. When I joined up as ‘CTO’, there were endemic power struggles between the existing founders and a chronic case of “if we build one more feature, then the users will flock to us”. Through a Herculean effort of LinkedIn networking, we set up some calls with very junior VCs. None were brave enough to rip off the poisoned shirt we had woven for ourselves: “Talk to us again when you have traction.” In our first-time founder naïveté, we took this to heart. Our startup lived or died on whether we had traction. Screw talking to users. Screw validation. We needed to get our product out of stealth mode and into the open. First, we’d take the market by storm. Then, we’d hoover up those promised VC dollars. For our two-sided marketplace startup, this meant Android and iOS apps for customers, and another pair of apps for mechanics. 6 months later, we released our fully-fledged MVP to a deafening silence from customers, mechanics, and investors. The junior VCs didn’t speak to us again. Carbn — Phase I (Bootstrapping) Photo by Arnaud Mesureur on Unsplash My second startup fared far better. Carbn was an app to help people develop green habits. It was a marked improvement — we were only building the iOS app and barrelled from customer validation to MVP in our first 4 months! From here, we had a few months of bootstrapping left in us and were desperate for our first capital injection. Unfortunately, we heard another classic refrain from the venture capitalists: “We think you’re too early for us, speak to us when you raise your next round.” Admittedly, that was fair when we had zero revenue and low-thousands of users. We weren’t fazed — we approached various angel syndicates, accelerators and exhausted all the goodwill we could muster via our networks. Through the complementary magic of a strong early app store rating and my socially hypercompetent cofounder, we landed a cool £200k in angel funding. Carbn — Phase II (Pre-seed) Photo by Joshua Lanzarini on Unsplash With a business bank account brimming with angel funding, we went on a hiring spree and maintained a consistent 10% week-on-week DAU growth — nothing to sniff at. But was it enough? We were wrestling with a critical strategic issue: Should we remain a B2C consumer habits app or position ourselves in the B2B space as a climate-conscious employee perk? Having dipped our toes into both approaches, we’d hit our pre-seed growth targets and began to reach out to VCs for our next round. We encountered the customary mix of ghosting, half-arsed lukewarm interest and genuine leads. This time, as well as the classic “come to us with more traction” and “talk to us in your next round,” we had some bigger fish biting for a second meeting. We’d been speaking with a partner at a top-tier Silicon Valley VC. He was enthusiastic about Carbn, and asked us to present at their Monday Partner Meeting. Our presentation and subsequent conversation lasted over 2 hours. They told us they saw us becoming the climate B2C play. We felt it went well. February 2022. I was suffering the worst norovirus of my life. I’d been playing Elden Ring for 10 hours straight. I couldn’t tell whether I was dying more in-game or in real life. We got the call from the VC. “We like you, we want to invest, you should start hiring now.” I was in too much pain to feel any satisfaction. Surely this was the VC funding I’d been waiting for my whole life? Through my fever delirium, I saw myself on the cover of Forbes, high-fiving the Fyre Festival guy. My cofounder and I switched gears hard to focus on landing top-tier talent for our nascent engineering, product, and growth departments. In the meantime, we sent draft terms to our VC and… crickets. The markets were spooked by some geopolitical shenanigans, and VCs were suddenly hesitant to dole out cash at 2021 valuations. As our other leads ran cold, we held onto the hope that our deal was still in the bag. Cue months of umming and ahhing from our friend in Silicon Valley. After their white-hot conviction about the B2C opportunity for a climate action app, our VC developed a newfound passion for the comfortable cashflow prospects of a B2B proposition. Which we would have been fine with had the markets not been deteriorating further, and our borderline deal was consequently losing its lustre. It eventually became clear that our seed round wasn’t happening. My cofounder and I agreed to call it a day. The VC Codex Photo by Matteo Vistocco on Unsplash Let’s delve deeper into VCspeak. We’ll analyze the VC rejections I’ve encountered and try to find the true meaning behind the words. 1. Traction When they say: “Talk to us again when you have traction.” They really mean: “If you prove there is a market opportunity and that you can execute as a management team, then we might consider you. But because I don’t believe either of those things will happen, I will not be taking a risk on you”. Passing on Fixr was the correct choice. In retrospect, there was no chance our management team was capable of successfully creating a two-sided marketplace, which is widely regarded as the hardest kind of startup to build. Don’t get me started on the abysmal decision to build 4 native apps on 2 platforms before we had a single transaction. 2. Early Stage When they say: “We think you’re too early for us, speak to us when you raise your next round.” They really mean: “We’re an early-stage fund, but generally speaking, we only invest pre-seed in second-time founders and people with executive-level industry experience in this sector. We like the opportunity but don’t believe your management team is the right one in which to invest.” Again, this is a pretty reasonable stance. While VC is inherently risky, these risks can be mitigated by backing management teams with a proven track record. Naturally, the riskiest pre-seed dollars are allocated accordingly to increase the chances of achieving a 3x ‘venture rate of return’ for a given VC fund. 3. Yes Actually Means No When they say: “We like you, we want to invest, you should start hiring now.” They really mean: “We do really like your vibe as a founding team. We see your potential. We do genuinely want to invest, and want to set you up to move quickly once the deal closes. Please note however that this is neither a term sheet or a wire transfer. Perhaps we want more time to evaluate other options in the space. We lack conviction.” Venture capitalists are a famously fickle bunch. One day, they can be keen as a bean on your lean, mean, consumer business. The next day, Putin invades Ukraine and you’re a borderline B2B prospect that needs to show unit economics. Jacob’s Top 10 Survival Tips Photo by Jeremy Bishop on Unsplash My story is typical of my fellow failed founders — some gaffes in our early ventures as we learn the ropes, a few promising steps as we gain entrepreneurial experience, and a veritable funding brick wall in 2022. Here are some quick and dirty thoughts to keep your head screwed on right as you look for startup funding: If a VC gives a reason for turning you down, don’t necessarily take it at face value. Be self-critical about your management and the market. Your team or the opportunity might just not be right. For your first round, it’s much easier to convince a single angel investor than a roomful of VC partners. When you land a lead angel investor, the rest become easier to find. If you aren’t a big dog in your industry or haven’t had a startup exit before, the bar for pre-seed VC investment is pretty high. In a VC firm, you need an influential internal champion who will fight hard for your startup. Don’t play coy with VCs. Don’t stop talking to them, and don’t let a term sheet get away before the market turns. “Yes” doesn’t always mean “yes”. Your raise isn’t over until a wire transfer hits your account. VC funding is cool and all, but essentially, it is a waste of time if you haven’t validated your market: bootstrapping to get paying customers quickly is the most effective tactic available. In all honesty, you don’t want to take external funding unless you have intensely strong user growth; and being unable to hire becomes your bottleneck. Have you encountered any rejections we could add to our VCspeak phrasebook? Do you have any hard-earned wisdom to append to the survival guide? Let us know in the comments!

Whether or not they actually fund you, they always want you to think that they are going to fund you because that way they hedge their bets in two ways. First, if they learn new information (like if you suddenly start to get traction) they can change their minds without losing face. Second, and more importantly, as long as the answer is actually no you are potential competition for some other company that is actually in their portfolio, so they want you to think that you have a shot with them so you won&#x27;t pursue other opportunities as aggressively.The only thing that actually means \"yes\" in VC land is when the check clears. reply Aurornis 7 hours agoparentTop tier VCs will definitely tell you “no” and they’ll often get there quickly.It’s more often the small funds, the inexperienced family offices, and the junior associates that don’t have authority who string companies along forever. They don’t have as much authority or funds to actually work with, so they have a lot of time to string you along.Lumping all VCs together really doesn’t lead to accurate descriptions of how the industry works. reply FreakLegion 6 hours agorootparentThis is the most accurate comment I&#x27;ve seen here. Sequoia, Benchmark, Kleiner, etc. will all tell you \"no\" and why with minimal turnaround time. The same is true for second-tier players like Craft, smaller shops started by breakaways from the big firms, and scouts. Good VCs are professionals and have no interest in wasting your time or theirs. A \"no\" now never precludes future participation anyway; they don&#x27;t need to string you along for that. reply j-a-a-p 52 minutes agorootparentHmm, my experience with one of the largest investors in NL was a full verbal &#x27;yes&#x27;. The investor was actively involved in the hiring process (that is how I got in). A founder put in his cash (think a small apartment) for a lower single digit percentage of agreed valuation. I signed for something smaller &#x2F; similar but without bringing in cash.In reality the money never arrived, they forked in few times 250k. The other investors who bartered a deal all brought in their share. My takeaway is that even the most reputable investor has absolutely no limit in saying yes and doing no.The motivation for everybody was greed, and that was buzzing around due to the fact a large investor was involved. They know that and they used it. But in the end in this world signed contracts and wire transfers are the only credible thing. reply mbesto 5 hours agorootparentprevWhich actually reinforces the grandparent&#x27;s point. Sequoia, Benchmark, Kleiner, etc. can say an actual \"no\" and you&#x27;ll still go back to them because they&#x27;re...Sequioa, Benchmark, etc. You&#x27;ll go back to them, because its a huge signal to prospective buyers, potential acquirers, partners, etc. that you&#x27;re being funded by a top tier VC.> Good VCs are professionals and have no interest in wasting your time or theirs.\"Good\" VCs has less to do about professionalism and more to do about pedigree. Professionalism and \"good\"&#x2F;\"bad\" VCs are not mutually exclusive things. reply FreakLegion 3 hours agorootparentThe grandparent said \"VC&#x27;s never actually say no\". I did the opposite of reinforce that. Every good VC will give you a version of the following if it&#x27;s a \"no\":1. It&#x27;s a \"no\". (Clear, unambiguous.)2. Here&#x27;s why. (E.g. not believing in the space, issues with customer background or another part of due diligence.)3. We make mistakes all the time and hope you prove us wrong. (I&#x27;ve pitched the partner at Sequoia who invested in FTX. His name&#x27;s Alfred, super nice guy and fully aware that screwing up is part of his job. \"No\" isn&#x27;t a value judgment.)4. Happy to talk again for the next round. (If they&#x27;re a multistage fund, e.g. you won&#x27;t hear this from First Round.)It&#x27;s all very predictable. The one real \"why\" you won&#x27;t typically hear back on is strength of the founding team. They won&#x27;t tell you when they think you&#x27;re the problem. But product, space, GTM, basically anything else they&#x27;re happy to dissect.This is true for all of the firms that people have heard of. Of course there&#x27;s a long tail of bad VCs, too, generally podunk firms few people ever encounter anyway. Avoid TechOperators out of Atlanta, for example. reply hinkley 10 hours agoparentprevIf they run down your clock because you think a check is coming, their other company can hire your former employees. reply maccard 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not going to say this has never happened, but I think it&#x27;s a little naive to think that this is the common path. In my experience, the first option OP presented (hedging bets and wanting to save face) are incredibly common. reply marcell 8 hours agoparentprevDisagree, I’ve heard “no” from dozens of VCs. They sometimes even give a post hoc rationalization. reply _heimdall 7 hours agoparentprevSerious VCs often will say no, and they&#x27;ll say it quickly.Honestly I prefer the approach of being extremely straightforward with expectations. Make your pitch, but also make it clear that you aren&#x27;t interested in playing games and would prefer a clear \"no\" if that&#x27;s the decision. reply personjerry 7 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s what the article says reply jakey_bakey 10 hours agoparentprevSolid summary tbh. It&#x27;s all about incentives really. reply daft_pink 10 hours agoprevMaybe it&#x27;s my business major background and my skepticism of all these tech companies that have no reasonable business model to make $&#x27;s, but unless there is an obvious need for investment like buying a large amount of real estate or machinery, why would you need VC money to build an app after you&#x27;ve already spent several months doing it?It should run on it&#x27;s own and not need investor money. You shouldn&#x27;t be focused on getting VC&#x27;s, you should focus on developing an app that actually turns a profit.It&#x27;s not that difficult. Anyways, I found your story really interesting. Good story :) reply terminous 10 hours agoparentBecause the SV VC business model isn&#x27;t to build a traditional profitable business that beats the competition by providing a superior product&#x2F;service for a competitive price. It is to dominate the competition by subsidizing the real cost to consumers, until you have taken over the market and can raise the price and lower the quality of the product&#x2F;service.Edit: Or the business model is to be acquired by a FAANG who fears they need to get into your area and care more about optics to their bosses&#x2F;shareholders than how financially sustainable your startup is. reply benjaminwootton 1 hour agorootparentA less cynical take is that it allows you to run at a loss for a very long time as you build revenue and market share. This can be right up to the time that you exit. reply oblio 1 hour agorootparent> A less cynical take is that it allows you to run at a loss for a very long time as you build revenue and market shareYou&#x27;re saying the same thing as the grandparent comment and in various places in the world this would be considered dumping&#x2F;subsidizing and illegal.Yet here we are and the enshittification continues. reply marcus_holmes 7 hours agorootparentprevDoes that even work as an investment model? The poster child for this has got to be Uber, and they&#x27;ve shown that this is a lot harder to achieve than it appears.The huge wins have all been IPOs where the business is still growing&#x2F;trying to dominate the market, and not where they&#x27;re in that monetisation phase. At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve seen. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single case yet where the \"dominate and then monopolise\" plan has actually worked? reply lokar 6 hours agorootparentWork for whom? All of the early employees and investors in Uber have done very well. reply disgruntledphd2 1 hour agorootparentprevIt worked for Facebook, but they were a lot more intentional about growth vs revenue. reply ip26 7 hours agorootparentprevUber seems to have created a lot of opex (30k employees, high comp) setting a pretty high bar to reach profitability, and there are many substitute goods (planes, trains, your own car, bicycles, busses, walking). So they may not be positioned to truly corner consumers with prices high enough to reach profitability, even if they monopolize cabs. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 3 hours agorootparentprevFacebook and Youtube might qualify here reply stockboss 4 hours agorootparentprevAmazon? reply sjducb 15 minutes agoparentprevImagine it costs $3&#x2F;month to provide the service to a customer and the customer is paying $3&#x2F;month.You can make a good case that most of your costs are fixed. So that if you have 100x as many customers it’ll cost you $0.03&#x2F;month to provide the same service to the customers, but they still pay $3&#x2F;month.You need VC money to acquire customers and grow. Then your business will become profitable because of the economics of scale that are inherent to software. reply wavemode 10 hours agoparentprevThe goal of most Silicon Valley founders isn&#x27;t profit, but growth. Quickly increase users, quickly increase revenue, quickly increase headcount. Quickly become a large company which can be sold for billions.Or, never reach sustainability and eventually go bankrupt - this outcome is actually still good for the founders since they probably walk away with millions in their pockets (from paying themselves seven-figure salaries). reply eastbound 10 hours agorootparentIt’s growth… until the “plateau” phase of the Schumpeter economic cycle (~60 years), where entrenched actors raise prices and customers lose choice. reply NoPicklez 8 hours agoparentprevIt \"should\" but in many cases it doesn&#x27;tIf you have a great idea for an app or a product and you&#x27;ve started developing it but you need to hire more people to bring that idea to fruition. Rather than spending years of your own time and money to maybe get the idea off the ground, if other people like the idea and want to help contribute via an investment, why not?Surely your business major would have described the idea of seeking an investment or capital via a business plan. The challenge is that these VC vehicles push this idea of providing an investment tenfold and they have their hands across large industries and portfolios. To the point where they can both invest when you grow and when you fail. reply insanitybit 49 minutes agoparentprev> why would you need VC money to build an app after you&#x27;ve already spent several months doing it?As someone who raised VC money for a SaaS, the answer is that operating a SaaS requires employees. I had two choices - attempt to operate it myself and incur a lot of personal costs, or raise money to pay for those operating costs at no personal cost.Contrary to the other posts, the goal was in no way to operate at a loss for a long period of time or to get some sort of exponential growth at all costs or whatever. It was literally \"do I personally want to spend 10s of thousands of dollars and attempt to operate a complex system 24&#x2F;7, or do I want to take literally 0 financial risk and be able to pay other people to help me\". reply Nextgrid 8 hours agoparentprevIt was never about building sustainable businesses or even solving a problem or gap in the market. The only \"problem\" that needs solving is that someone wants to have an all expenses paid \"startup founder\" lifestyle for a few years, and some engineers want to build & tend to a playground where complexity is the core feature.Doing so on your own dime (or a bank loan) is stupid. Doing so on the VC&#x27;s dime is smart because you can not only walk off scot-free when the whole thing inevitably WeWorks into the ground, but can start over again in a different vertical. reply jakey_bakey 10 hours agoparentprevAppreciate it :)But yes, after learning a lot from my various startup scars, I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be seeking VC dollars for an app unless:- I am creaking under success with an impossible cloud bill - I am a late-onset cofounder of an already successful co that needs and app reply ford 10 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s confusing about how having more money might let you hire more people to build more things or build things faster?If something is an obvious winner - why handicap it by limiting investment to what it can make on its own?What if it relies on network effects, or economies of scale? reply RobRivera 10 hours agoparentprev> It&#x27;s not that difficult.Who is going to tell him&#x2F;her? reply meheleventyone 2 hours agoparentprevOne example of profitable software that needs a large amount of capital are F2P mobile games where a large part of the business model is user acquisition for which costs can be substantial. reply _heimdall 7 hours agoparentprevTech companies aren&#x27;t cash flow businesses, though IMO they should be. When debt is cheap tech leans hard into pre-revenue funding. Now that interest rates are more reasonable tech companies have to actually show a profit, and most don&#x27;t know how. reply mensetmanusman 7 hours agoparentprevNext wave of ai companies require major $$$ to train; the game has shifted somewhat. reply teh_infallible 10 hours agoparentprevOne reason to seek funding early would be if you are in a competitive space and want to grow faster than your competitors. reply nradov 10 hours agoparentprevA lot of venture backed companies aren&#x27;t just building an \"app\". Spend some time looking through the portfolios of major VC firms, especially in life sciences and medical devices. reply wg0 3 hours agorootparentYeah maybe handful of them. That too are also mostly lunatic ideas with little grounding in solid serious rigorous academic and scientific research with no feasible functioning product in sight or something financially viable on the horizon. It&#x27;s not that they already have a research outcome that they need to \"productize\" with manufacturing and distribution channels.Things like Neura Link, Carbon capture, fusion and such.Most or close to 98% are just building an \"app\" or an app with a website such as yelp but for dogs, dogs but for cats or other tools that other founders should buy such as sales and leads management etc etc.Mostly - meaningless. reply insanitybit 44 minutes agorootparentYou&#x27;re coming off as very biased. My startup was certainly grounded in research and rigor, I even spoke with academics at universities about the work. In many ways, my project was productizing some state of the art CRDT research by applying it to a domain that is in dire need of solutions - information security.Most founders I met were doing similarly well-founded work. You&#x27;re thinking about a tiny fraction of the VC market - the moonshot startups that make the news. Most people are raising money around very reasonable ideas, of course, since VCs obviously have to minimize risk for some of their investments. reply a1371 9 hours agoprevI played the VC game. We were attending every opportunity to give 10% of our business for $200K. No one would bite. Gradually, it felt it was easier to land customers than VCs. Then there came a moment that I wish for every founder. Our revenues started not only paying the bills, but also fueling growth. It felt as if a veil was lifted from my eyes. Now, it feels like all those pitches were a waste of time. reply abc123abc123 35 minutes agoparentAmen!I tried VC:s and didn&#x27;t work (I pitched Netflix before Netflix and was told laws would crush it). Then I tried bootstrapping and getting customers and the veil was lifted from my eyes! Cannot recommend it enough. Don&#x27;t waste time with VC:s, put that time into getting customers. If you are successful you can always sell the business to someone later on if&#x2F;when you decide to retire or try something new. reply mrangle 6 hours agoparentprevEssentially, the market forced you onto the track that it wanted you to be in. Which, as you found out, is a good thing (and the only possibility).As the best time for VC investment is generally at the inflection point of the exponential growth curve. When revenue can&#x27;t keep up with what it costs to supply the ever faster growing demand. Which, for many companies, will be shortly before an outright acquisition. And usuaully 5-10 years, minimum, after slow customer growth. Assuming a good business but not necessarily a unicorn in terms of market position.But at that point wily founders may instead look to keep their company and seek a loan. reply scrollaway 1 hour agoparentprevIf you hang out on HN long enough, it&#x27;s easy to fool yourself into thinking that you need VCs to fund your startup and there&#x27;s no way your business will survive without it.Very important to remember that when you go into fundraising mode, you are dedicating a bunch of time to doing this, and that the time you will spend doing it is time you will not spend building your product or focusing on your customers.200k is pre-seed level. When I raised a 500k pre-seed for my latest startup, I explicitly avoided VCs (too much effort), went only to angels. Pitching to them taught me what I should focus on, and when I understood the potential of what I was building (and saw the enthusiasm to go with it), I cut the fundraise short at 100k: No more time to waste, I had to build.Also worth mentioning that constraints are good. Having too much cash to build your MVP is like having no deadline. A fire under your ass (in the form of bootstrapping) can force you to be creative and focus on immediate revenue. reply featuregag 9 hours agoparentprevAnd if you make your success public enough in the right circles? Those same VCs will be throwing their panties at you. It’s the game. reply ChuckMcM 10 hours agoprevThey miss my favorite: \"Yes, we&#x27;ll invest we just don&#x27;t want to be &#x27;lead&#x27;.\"That is code for: \"You aren&#x27;t going to find anyone who shares your idea of what your valuation should be so we are safe telling you we&#x27;ll invest if you find a &#x27;lead investor&#x27; because that person doesn&#x27;t exist.\"It gets funny&#x2F;twisted when you do find a lead and go back and now there is some other goal post that is keeping them out of \"this round.\" reply pnw 9 hours agoparentNot necessarily. It could also be code for \"We can&#x27;t write a check big enough to lead your round\". E.g. a seed fund who writes $1m checks isn&#x27;t going to lead a $5m round. The VC would be putting themselves out of a job if they wrote a $5m check when they told their LPs their fund target was $1m checks. reply plorkyeran 3 hours agorootparent\"We&#x27;re in if you have a lead\" is basically the starting point before you ever talk to a VC. Some other VC being willing to invest $5m is itself often considered a strong enough signal to invest some significantly smaller number than that while knowing literally nothing about the company being invested in.

They end up investing in lots of crappy startups and convincing themselves it’s the best thing since sliced bread. A lot of smaller VC is just about networking your way into the bigger deals and syndicates while you raise money from LPs, rather than sourcing new diamonds in the rough. The startup “orbiters” are just there to show that you’re not a nobody, while you go to different events and try to get into in the same deal as the big boys. replythwarted 9 hours agoprevFor our two-sided marketplace startup, this meant Android and iOS apps for customers, and another pair of apps for mechanics. 6 months later, we released our fully-fledged MVP to a deafening silence from customers, mechanics, and investors.It&#x27;s probably really hard to get traction when it&#x27;s not obvious who your customers are, and this description reveals that. Your customers are the entities that are paying you. Is this supposed to be an app for mechanics to find work? Is it supposed to be an app for people with car problems to find someone to fix it? Those looking to get their vehicle serviced aren&#x27;t going to want to pay the finders feed on top of the cost charged by the mechanic, which means those people are not your customers. What are the cases where someone would pay for your app? Are mechanics having trouble finding work? Are the mechanics the customers of Fixr?

Growth and early stage doesn’t invest before traction; that’s the purview of angels and possibly seed investors. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agoprevIf you know marketing, you don&#x27;t need VCs (unless you are in a capital-intensive business like rocket building). The problem is that most people who get funded are technical and do not know marketing and growing organically. However, there are lots of businesses that grow extremely well simply due to the cofounders having previous experience with marketing, often in a professional capacity.My go-to example is Lemlist (and their \"Lempire\" of related products). The founders built their own cold email agency, grew that to millions just through sheer labor, then built software to automate that process and now they&#x27;re at a 200 million dollar valuation from more than 10 to 15 million dollars in annual recurring revenue. They have lots of marketing channels: organic SEO via content marketing, Facebook group with frequent events like interviews with other agency owners and salespeople, YouTube videos that are then recut and repurposed to TikTok&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Facebook videos, partnering with influencers, paid advertising, and of course, cold messaging other salespeople and agencies via LinkedIn and email. Most technical founders do not know or have the patience to do any of this. If they do, though, they could similarly grow to such an ARR in a few short years, as Lemlist started only in 2018. Similar examples include GoHighLevel and ClickFunnels which are almost at or over a 1 billion dollar valuation each, both bootstrapped. The ClickFunnels founder for example sold his software via live demos (both webinars and in person events) where you got X% off but only if you booked right at the end of the demo, which apparently drove quite a high percentage of their initial sales.I&#x27;d highly advise founders to start a marketing agency if only to understand marketing in a real capacity and how to deliver results to paying clients. I have done so via a cold email and paid ads agency for various niches before and I believe it&#x27;s helped me immensely with future products. Best of all, you learn to be truly aligned with your customers and providing them direct value because they are paying you every month. If you make a mistake, you must fix it, you have no backup fund of venture capital previously raised in order to skate BY, especially now that ZIRP (zero-interest-rate phenomenon) is over. reply wg0 3 hours agoprevRegardless of yes or no, VC money is ludicrously expensive.125k is barely one year&#x27;s salary and your 7% of ownership gone forever and that&#x27;s the deal for almost all accelerators.On top of that - the connections, reach, prestige might be meaningless or irrelevant to your particular product and market. reply vaxman 2 hours agoparentI think you like it, like it, to be told, what to do, ain’t that true? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XbLKWm12yx0 reply pnw 9 hours agoprevTo be fair, none of those ideas seem like venture scale ideas to me.

You want all the potential investors on the field at the same time. That&#x27;s how deals close in weeks, not months.If your investment round is taking so many months, something is wrong.

The idea was: don&#x27;t give investors an opportunity to stall, and, by stalling, send an adverse message to all the other investors.(I don&#x27;t know if this works at all anymore, but it gives you an idea of what the issue is here.) reply marcell 45 minutes agorootparentI heard the short deadline advice also, it’s nice idea but has flaws:- most VCs will have at least a few days delay on when they are willing to meet you- intros are required, and often intros come out of other VC meetings. This means you can’t shotgun everything- if a VC wants to meet after your “deadline”, will you actually say no? Who has more power?If you are a hot deal or Michael Seibel himself, the short deadline probably works. For mid level startups it’s not as easy. reply jedberg 8 hours agorootparentprevI know we could have, but we thought it would be dishonest of us to do so since we had no intention of taking the soft commits.

Having their name in the decks increases future investment by vulture capitalists by at least 420%. Once VCs see those names, their typical DD process goes out the window. All they see is the name and gamble millions&#x2F;billions just because of this.Some notable examples of this are “theranos”, “ftx”, “frank”. Shit it even stretches back to the 1990s with infamous con artists like Jordan Belfort or Bernie Madoff.Remember those college frat bros that cheated off you?

Here is the first one, for example:> When they say: “Talk to us again when you have traction.”> They really mean: “If you prove there is a market opportunity and that you can execute as a management team, then we might consider you. But because I don’t believe either of those things will happen, I will not be taking a risk on you”.I mean, the general tone of the article is \"VCs speak an ambiguous language because they&#x27;re doing a dance with founders.\" One hand, sure, of course, that happens in literally every sales negotiation. But \"Talk to us again when you have traction\" seems pretty clear that the VC doesn&#x27;t believe in either your market thesis or team, and they&#x27;re basically saying \"prove us wrong\".

That is a very important mindset to bring to the table if you want to create a successful VC-funded startup. reply jimkoen 9 hours agorootparentI had to look up \"superlinear growth\" because I&#x27;ve never seen that term used under posts with VC related topics.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/microsoft/promptbase",
    "originBody": "promptbase promptbase is an evolving collection of resources, best practices, and example scripts for eliciting the best performance from foundation models like GPT-4. We currently host scripts demonstrating the Medprompt methodology, including examples of how we further extended this collection of prompting techniques (\"Medprompt+\") into non-medical domains: Benchmark GPT-4 Prompt GPT-4 Results Gemini Ultra Results MMLU Medprompt+ 90.10% 90.04% GSM8K Zero-shot 95.3% 94.4% MATH Zero-shot 68.4% 53.2% HumanEval Zero-shot 87.8% 74.4% BIG-Bench-Hard Few-shot + CoT 89.0% 83.6% DROP Zero-shot + CoT 83.7% 82.4% HellaSwag 10-shot 95.3% 87.8% In the near future, promptbase will also offer further case studies and structured interviews around the scientific process we take behind prompt engineering. We'll also offer specialized deep dives into specialized tooling that accentuates the prompt engineering process. Stay tuned! Medprompt and The Power of Prompting \"Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case Study in Medicine\" (H. Nori, Y. T. Lee, S. Zhang, D. Carignan, R. Edgar, N. Fusi, N. King, J. Larson, Y. Li, W. Liu, R. Luo, S. M. McKinney, R. O. Ness, H. Poon, T. Qin, N. Usuyama, C. White, E. Horvitz 2023) In a recent study, we showed how the composition of several prompting strategies into a method that we refer to as Medprompt can efficiently steer generalist models like GPT-4 to achieve top performance, even when compared to models specifically finetuned for medicine. Medprompt composes three distinct strategies together -- including dynamic few-shot selection, self-generated chain of thought, and choice-shuffle ensembling -- to elicit specialist level performance from GPT-4. We briefly describe these strategies here: Dynamic Few Shots: Few-shot learning -- providing several examples of the task and response to a foundation model -- enables models quickly adapt to a specific domain and learn to follow the task format. For simplicity and efficiency, the few-shot examples applied in prompting for a particular task are typically fixed; they are unchanged across test examples. This necessitates that the few-shot examples selected are broadly representative and relevant to a wide distribution of text examples. One approach to meeting these requirements is to have domain experts carefully hand-craft exemplars. Even so, this approach cannot guarantee that the curated, fixed few-shot examples will be appropriately representative of every test example. However, with enough available data, we can select different few-shot examples for different task inputs. We refer to this approach as employing dynamic few-shot examples. The method makes use of a mechanism to identify examples based on their similarity to the case at hand. For Medprompt, we did the following to identify representative few shot examples: Given a test example, we choose k training examples that are semantically similar using a k-NN clustering in the embedding space. Specifically, we first use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to embed candidate exemplars for few-shot learning. Then, for each test question x, we retrieve its nearest k neighbors x1, x2, ..., xk from the training set (according to distance in the embedding space of text-embedding-ada-002). These examples -- the ones most similar in embedding space to the test question -- are ultimately registered in the prompt. Self-Generated Chain of Thought (CoT): Chain-of-thought (CoT) uses natural language statements, such as “Let’s think step by step,” to explicitly encourage the model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps. The approach has been found to significantly improve the ability of foundation models to perform complex reasoning. Most approaches to chain-of-thought center on the use of experts to manually compose few-shot examples with chains of thought for prompting. Rather than rely on human experts, we pursued a mechanism to automate the creation of chain-of-thought examples. We found that we could simply ask GPT-4 to generate chain-of-thought for the training examples, with appropriate guardrails for reducing risk of hallucination via incorrect reasoning chains. Majority Vote Ensembling: Ensembling refers to combining the output of several algorithms together to yield better predictive performance than any individual algorithm. Frontier models like GPT-4 benefit from ensembling of their own outputs. A simple technique is to have a variety of prompts, or a single prompt with varied temperature, and report the most frequent answer amongst the ensemble constituents. For multiple choice questions, we employ a further trick that increases the diversity of the ensemble called choice-shuffling, where we shuffle the relative order of the answer choices before generating each reasoning path. We then select the most consistent answer, i.e., the one that is least sensitive to choice shuffling, which increases the robustness of the answer. The combination of these three techniques led to breakthrough performance in Medprompt for medical challenge questions. Implementation details of these techniques can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbase/tree/main/src/promptbase/mmlu Medprompt+Extending the power of prompting Here we provide some intuitive details on how we extended the medprompt prompting framework to elicit even stronger out-of-domain performance on the MMLU (Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark. MMLU was established as a test of general knowledge and reasoning powers of large language models. The complete MMLU benchmark contains tens of thousands of challenge problems of different forms across 57 areas from basic mathematics to United States history, law, computer science, engineering, medicine, and more. We found that applying Medprompt without modification to the whole MMLU achieved a score of 89.1%. Not bad for a single policy working across a great diversity of problems! But could we push Medprompt to do better? Simply scaling-up MedPrompt can yield further benefits. As a first step, we increased the number of ensembled calls from five to 20. This boosted performance to 89.56%. On working to push further with refinement of Medprompt, we noticed that performance was relatively poor for specific topics of the MMLU. MMLU contains a great diversity of types of questions, depending on the discipline and specific benchmark at hand. How might we push GPT-4 to perform even better on MMLU given the diversity of problems? We focused on extension to a portfolio approach based on the observation that some topical areas tend to ask questions that would require multiple steps of reasoning and perhaps a scratch pad to keep track of multiple parts of a solution. Other areas seek factual answers that follow more directly from questions. Medprompt employs “chain-of-thought” (CoT) reasoning, resonating with multi-step solving. We wondered if the sophisticated Medprompt-classic approach might do less well on very simple questions and if the system might do better if a simpler method were used for the factual queries. Following this argument, we found that we could boost the performance on MMLU by extending MedPrompt with a simple two-method prompt portfolio. We add to the classic Medprompt a set of 10 simple, direct few-shot prompts soliciting an answer directly without Chain of Thought. We then ask GPT-4 for help with deciding on the best strategy for each topic area and question. As a screening call, for each question we first ask GPT-4: # Question {{ question }} # Task Does answering the question above require a scratch-pad? A. Yes B. No If GPT-4 thinks the question does require a scratch-pad, then the contribution of the Chain-of-Thought component of the ensemble is doubled. If it doesn't, we halve that contribution (and let the ensemble instead depend more on the direct few-shot prompts). Dynamically leveraging the appropriate prompting technique in the ensemble led to a further +0.5% performance improvement across the MMLU. We note that Medprompt+ relies on accessing confidence scores (logprobs) from GPT-4. These are not publicly available via the current API but will be enabled for all in the near future.

You can get substantially improved generation results for either LLMs or Diffusion models with proper prompt engineering, even with GPT-4.You can do prompt term weighting with offline LLMs (e.g. compel: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;damian0815&#x2F;compel ) or averaging the embed tokens yourself and passing the embedding matrix to the model, but unlike with image generation where the results of prompt weighting are more obvious, there isn&#x27;t as much of a need for it for LLMs. reply Der_Einzige 16 hours agorootparent [–] Sorry, but compel seems to only work with diffusion models. Note that they have no examples of running this with modern LLMs. It only supports a fraction of the techniques that, for example Automatic1111 supports for \"real\" prompt engineering. Even if I&#x27;m wrong and compel does work with, any transformer model, it still only supports a small fraction of all the \"real\" prompt engineering techniques.I shouldn&#x27;t have to \"average the embed tokens myself\".I know you&#x27;re a big deal in the industry, but you&#x27;re SO WRONG about the idea that \"there isn&#x27;t as much of a need for it for LLMs\". I hate that the NLP community has such huge blindspots for this kind of stuff.

And even then, your example with GPT-2 has the comment \"GPT2 is very tempermental with this technique\" and requires a temperature of 20 to behave which is an accommodation that can never be used in a real application.If you can create test cases and demos where prompt weighting in a LLM results in a distinct observable improvement as it does with diffusion models, that would be a different story.

    "originBody": "NEWS 15 December 2023 Correction 17 December 2023 US nuclear-fusion lab enters new era: achieving ‘ignition’ over and over Researchers at the National Ignition Facility are consistently creating reactions that make more energy than they consume. By Jeff Tollefson Twitter Facebook Email At the US National Ignition Facility, in Livermore, California, 192 lasers (beamlines shown here) run into a target chamber (highlighted in blue) and focus on a capsule containing hydrogen isotopes. Credit: Damien Jemison/NIF/LLNL In December 2022, after more than a decade of effort and frustration, scientists at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) announced that they had set a world record by producing a fusion reaction that released more energy than it consumed — a phenomenon known as ignition. They have now proved that the feat was no accident by replicating it again and again, and the administration of US President Joe Biden is looking to build on this success by establishing a trio of US research centres to help advance the science. Nuclear-fusion breakthrough: this physicist helped to achieve the first-ever energy gain The stadium-sized laser facility, housed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California, has unequivocally achieved its goal of ignition in four out of its last six attempts, creating a reaction that generates pressures and temperatures greater than those that occur inside the Sun. “I’m feeling pretty good,” says Richard Town, a physicist who heads the lab’s inertial-confinement fusion science programme at the LLNL. “I think we should all be proud of the achievement.” The NIF was designed not as a power plant, but as a facility to recreate and study the reactions that occur during thermonuclear detonations after the United States halted underground weapons testing in 1992. The higher fusion yields are already being used to advance nuclear-weapons research, and have also fuelled enthusiasm about fusion as a limitless source of clean energy. US secretary of state John Kerry called for new international partnerships to advance fusion energy at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai last week, and the US Department of Energy (DOE), which oversees the NIF, followed up by announcing the new research hubs, to be led by Lawrence Livermore, the University of Rochester in New York and Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Building the NIF was “a leap of faith” for many, and its success has had a real impact on the fusion community, as well as on public perception, says Saskia Mordijck, a physicist at William & Mary, a university in Willamsburg, Virginia. “In that sense, what is important is that scientists said they could do something, and then they actually did do something.” Hot shots The NIF works by firing 192 laser beams at a frozen pellet of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium that is housed in a diamond capsule suspended inside a gold cylinder. The resulting implosion causes the isotopes to fuse, creating helium and copious quantities of energy. On 5 December 2022, those fusion reactions for the first time generated more energy — roughly 54% more — than the laser beams delivered to the target. The facility set a new record on 30 July when its beams delivered the same amount of energy to the target — 2.05 megajoules — but, this time, the implosion generated 3.88 megajoules of fusion energy, an 89% increase over the input energy. Scientists at the laboratory achieved ignition during two further attempts in October (see ‘A year of progress’). And the laboratory’s calculations suggest that two others in June and September generated slightly more energy than the lasers provided, but not enough to confirm ignition. Source: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory For many scientists, the results confirm that the laboratory is now operating in a new regime: researchers can repeatedly hit a goal they’ve been chasing for more than a decade. Tiny variations in the laser pulses or minor defects in the diamond capsule can still allow energy to escape, making for an imperfect implosion, but the scientists now better understand the main variables at play and how to manipulate them. “Even when we have these issues, we can still get more than a megajoule of fusion energy, which is good,” says Annie Kritcher, the NIF’s lead designer on this series of experiments. New hubs It’s a long way from there to providing fusion energy to the power grid, however, and the NIF, although currently home to the world’s largest laser, is not well-suited for that task. The facility’s laser system is enormously inefficient, and more than 99% of the energy that goes into a single ignition attempt is lost before it can reach the target. Developing more efficient laser systems is one goal of the DOE’s new inertial-fusion-energy research programme. This month, the agency announced US$42 million over four years to establish three new research centres — each involving a mix of national laboratories, university researchers and industry partners — that will work towards this and other advances. Nuclear-fusion lab achieves ‘ignition’: what does it mean? This investment is the first coordinated effort to develop not just the technologies, but also the workforce for a future laser-fusion industry, says Carmen Menoni, a physicist who is heading up the hub at Colorado State University. So far, most government investments in fusion-energy research have gone towards devices known as tokamaks, which use magnetic fields inside a doughnut-shaped ‘torus’ to confine fusion reactions. This is the approach under development at ITER, an international partnership to build the world’s largest fusion facility near Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France. Tokamaks have also been the focus of many fusion investments in the private sector, but dozens of companies are pursuing other approaches, such as laser fusion. The timing for a dedicated laser-fusion programme is right, says Menoni, and the decision to pursue it wouldn’t have happened without the NIF’s recent success. “We now know it will work,” she says. “What will take time is to develop the technology to a level where we can build a power plant.” Back at the NIF, Kritcher’s latest series of experiments features a 7% boost in laser energy, which should, in theory, lead to even larger yields. The first experiment in this series was one of the successful ignitions, on 30 October. Although it didn’t break the record, an input of 2.2 megajoules of laser energy yielded an output of 3.4 megajoules of fusion energy. Kritcher chalks up the fact that it didn’t break the record for energy yield to growing pains with the new laser configuration, which is designed to squeeze more energy into the same gold cylinder. Before moving to a larger cylinder, Kritcher says her team is going to focus on changes to the laser pulse that could produce a more symmetrical implosion. “We’ve got four experiments next year,” she says. “Let’s see.” doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-04045-8 Updates & Corrections Correction 17 December 2023: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the name of William & Mary.

There was, at one time, talk of systems where pellets are injected, zapped with lasers, some fusion and heat results, and this is cycled at some high rate, maybe a few times per second. But that was really political cover for the National Ignition Facility, which is really for studying what happens in an H-bomb without setting one off.There&#x27;s an pulsed fusion startup.[1] This is not laser-triggered fusion with inertial containment; it&#x27;s a combo of magnetic containment and inertial containment, triggered by a huge electrical pulse applied to a plasma.

That requires building a new machine designed for continuous fusion detonations.So it&#x27;s a scientific accomplishment, but not that scientific accomplishment. reply noobermin 14 hours agoparentWhenever anyone brings this up, it&#x27;s important to remind everyone this is the best in the world to this day, so every time people (namely, people invested in MCF or various private companies) shit talk NIF understand they are saying their schemes per the data are even worse than what is apparently a bad result. reply SamBam 14 hours agorootparentI question your assumption that most people who bring this up are people invested in MCF or various private companies.I think for most people, the question isn&#x27;t between this fusion and that fusion, it&#x27;s about fusion and anything else.We haven&#x27;t yet been able to get useable energy out of fusion. It may be wonderful if we could, but at the moment, every dollar spent on fusion is a dollar not spent on building more solar panels and wind turbines.If it really is the case that it will not be possible to power the world without fusion, then that might be money well invested, but it&#x27;s quite possible that we should just be putting everything into existing renewable technologies. reply noobermin 14 hours agorootparent>It may be wonderful if we could, but at the moment, every dollar spent on fusion is a dollar not spent on building more solar panels and wind turbines.You care to back your armchairing with data?

I&#x27;m literally saying we could optionally be spending the money we currently spend on fusion on solar panels instead. This isn&#x27;t a statement that needs data.The question is simply which is going to go further in decarbonizing our energy: $1 spent on solar or $1 spent on fusion research?That&#x27;s an open question, of course, and people don&#x27;t have the answer, since one is based on probabilities of future success.Note, though, that even if fusion is successful, it may still be more expensive than solar, and so then would it actually be successful? We would have saved more tons of CO2 by making more solar panels.

National Institutes of Health for example spends more on basic medical research than all of industry combined. The health industry takes that research and uses it to develop products, which combined R&D are several times that of the budget of NiH. $1 of NiH basic medical research is not the same as $1 R&D by a medical company, and especially not the same as $1 going into production. Spending $1 to produce a pill may save a life. $1 of NiH basic medical research may save a population. reply bandyaboot 12 hours agorootparentprevSo the question is, what is a better energy infrastructure investment—definitely spending a dollar on fusion research, or not spending that dollar on fusion research and instead maybe, in theory, spending it on solar panels. I’ll take the good plan now vs the maybe a better plan later option. reply peyton 13 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m literally saying we could optionally be spending the money we currently spend on fusion on solar panels instead.

Two totally different risk profiles.> We would have saved more tons of CO2 by making more solar panels.If that’s your sole metric it’s probably worth thinking a little broader towards a solution. I don’t think Mohammed bin Salman is going to cap Ghawar Field because we put up a bunch of solar panels over here. He’s going to sell to somebody else.I think it’s better to let the market work towards solutions that compete across all dimensions—density included—and let that drive the energy transition. reply huytersd 9 hours agorootparentprevWe could but it’s a short sighted perspective. It’s like telling someone working on the steam engine to stop spending money because we could buy so many horses instead. reply bostik 13 hours agorootparentprev> at the moment, every dollar spent on fusion is a dollar not spent on building more solar panels and wind turbinesYou are of course technically correct (\"the best way to be correct\"), but let&#x27;s be honest: figuring out the optimal allocation of resources between solar&#x2F;wind&#x2F;geothermal and fusion research is unsolved problem. It&#x27;s probably outright unsolvable.It&#x27;s also not a problem of one or the other. We will need both.Remember that fusion research is not just about fusion. The materials technology advances are almost certainly going to show up elsewhere in various forms. To top it off, the nature of the technology itself requires that a non-trivial fraction of the funds are directed towards fundamental research. We can not know, or even guesstimate where those results end up being used outside of fusion research tracks.I will not be surprised at all if&#x2F;when some research done for advancing fusion will be used to improve solar and wind technologies. reply TheCraiggers 12 hours agorootparentprev> It may be wonderful if we could, but at the moment, every dollar spent on fusion is a dollar not spent on building more solar panels and wind turbines.That&#x27;s not how this works. The money that goes to research is very far removed from the money that goes towards utilities&#x27; capital investments. To say nothing of the politics involved.Regardless, we stand to gain more than just a possible energy source from this research. reply DennisP 13 hours agorootparentprevEvery dollar we put into fusion could also go into all sorts of things that have nothing to do with renewable energy.For government funding, the money could go to small fission reactors, some military project unrelated to energy, or just a reduction in the deficit.For private investment, the sort of investors interested in fusion breakthroughs would probably go for other high-risk, high-reward opportunities rather than switching to a mature industry. reply wolf550e 13 hours agorootparentprevPeople shit talk NIF because it&#x27;s a very expensive machine to calibrate the Fortran code used to test hydrogen bombs without detonating them, in no way meant to advance fusion for power generation, that gets accolades for doing something that will probably not be useful for a useful advance in fusion. reply analog31 12 hours agoparentprevIndeed, in the laser business, during a time period when it seemed like someone was coming up with a new kind of laser every month, the field developed a term, \"wall plug efficiency,\" which meant how much laser power per unit of power drawn from the electrical outlet.

The engineering issue of getting a stream of pellets to shoot is the issue, the \"how do you convert neutrons from DT into electricity\" just betrays severe ignorance. The engineering issue is a bigger jump. reply tsimionescu 13 hours agorootparentThe issue of capturing power out of the exploding pellet is not at all the same as the issue of capturing neutrons out of a MCF reactor, and neither is the same as the problem of capturing the neutrons from a fission power plant.The neutrons from fusion reactos are far more powerful, so they punch much more easily through materials you put in the way. Also, the ICF reactor has many moving parts (the pellet needs to be put in a very precise position for the lasers to shoot), so transferring heat from it is not nearly as easy as a much simpler fission reactor (which is mostly just a hunk of uranium which stays hot, and all the complexity comes out of being able to prevent the uranium from getting too hot). reply DennisP 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s exactly what it would be, for any fusion that&#x27;s not using aneutronic fuel. reply NotYourLawyer 14 hours agoparentprev“Energy drains and inefficiencies” underplays it. The laser they’re using is, what, 10% efficient? So they’re at least an order of magnitude away from net power. Probably two orders. reply DennisP 14 hours agorootparent0.5% efficient, but they&#x27;re old lasers. Equivalent modern ones are over 20% efficient.Also, with their first Q>1 shot they increased the laser power 8% and got 230% more output. They think the nonlinear scaling will continue for a while. If they&#x27;re right, then they&#x27;re not actually that far from overall net power, if you correct for the obsolete laser tech. reply choeger 15 hours agoprevCertainly a cool achievement and something to be proud of. Maybe even a very important step towards real usable fusion power plants.But:> The facility’s laser system is enormously inefficient, and more than 99% of the energy that goes into a single ignition attempt is lost before it can reach the target.So it&#x27;s still two orders of magnitude off hitting break even. And that&#x27;s without a suitable device to actually capture the released energy and it does not account for pellet production. For all we know, it might very well be three orders of magnitude away from a real powerplant.That being said, making more efficient lasers and working on capturing energy might be more fruitful than trying to improve a Tokamak design. So it&#x27;s good to have options. reply DennisP 14 hours agoparentFar more efficient lasers already exist. Their lasers are old. reply SamBam 14 hours agorootparentTwo orders of magnitude more efficient? reply DennisP 14 hours agorootparentFrom 0.5% to over 20%, for equivalent lasers. So they still have work to do, but not as much you&#x27;d think without accounting for the old lasers. reply HarHarVeryFunny 16 hours agoprevHelion&#x27;s design seems way more promising than the NIF one which doesn&#x27;t seem to have any clear path to being a \"continuous\" operation production design.Helion&#x27;s design also works essentially by brief inertial confinement, thereby avoiding the issues of Tomahawk continuous confinement designs. However, in the Helion design rather than having pellets of fuel which would need to be replaced for each shot, it uses injected gaseous fuel (deuterium + He-3) which is heated into two plasma \"donuts\" which are magnetically fired at each other to (together with brief magnetic compression) achieve fusion conditions.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uRaQLZaaHWoHelion have a contract with Microsoft to build a production model for them (to power a datacenter) by 2028.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helionenergy.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;helion-announces-world... reply KyleBerezin 16 hours agoparentLike all fusion reactors in the world currently, NIF was made for research, not as a prototype for a power plant. As it stands, NIF is the only non-bomb fusion device to reach the fusion breakeven point. If we are ignoring the research angle though, and are appraising the potential for commercial power production, Helion&#x27;s design has a similar issue to NIF. Where a tokamak and similar designs create constant power, NIF and Helion&#x27;s design have to generate power from sequential nuclear explosions. However for the purpose of research, NIF is indispensable; We can finally see and measure the behavior of true power positive fusion (without setting off a bomb).edit: breakeven means the reaction put out more power than the fuel took in. It does not mean the plant as a whole puts out more power than it takes, we aren&#x27;t even close to that. reply SkyMarshal 15 hours agorootparentHelion’s design doesn’t require constant power, it’s not based on heating water into steam to turn a turbine. Rather, their reactor is the turbine, the sequential plasma ring collision fusion reactions generate a magnetic field that drives a current in wires coiled around the reactor.It’s rather ingenious and is the first reactor-based power source that generates electricity directly from the reaction itself, rather than from heating water into steam. I hope they’re able to achieve breakeven in their next prototype or two. reply KyleBerezin 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m excited to see what they can do, but its important to remember they are the only fusion device with a marketing department. Pulsed power generation would be a problem for any power plant, and its viability is predicated on its ability to reset rapidly. Helion needs to demonstrate their 12T compression ignition works, then need to demonstrate the reactor can reset quickly, and they need to demonstrate they can generate enough power from the expanding magnetic field.Its an awesome design, its just their marketing material has led people into believing we are on the verge of fusion power, which we are not.

There is no way they are going to do that with a plasma physics textbook and a white paper on plasma compression ignition. I don&#x27;t blame them for building hype, and glossing over the technical risks. It&#x27;s just if you want an informed opinion you have to look past the marketing material.As devils advocate I will make the counterpoint, the idea of generating steam using heat through the walls of a tokamak is perhaps equally unproven. You need to have intense temperatures right next to supercooled magnets.

You have a plutonium core (a sphere the size of a grapefruit) and surround it with high explosives. Not as many as for an actual detonation. You blow them up, create the implosion, and trigger a subcritical fission reaction, or one that is very slightly supercritical. You then take lots of measurements (temperature increase, X and gamma rays, neutrons, etc) and see if they align with your theoretical models. If they do, you have extremely high confidence that the bomb will work as designed.Now, virtually all nukes in the US arsenal have a fusion bomb stage too. The way that works in practice is this: you first detonate the fission component of the bomb, and that produces a huge amount of X-rays. It&#x27;s so huge that the wavefront of the X-rays behaves like a solid hammer. That&#x27;s what produces the compression for the secondary. This design is called the Teller-Ulam design, and it is extremely likely that it was discovered only once (by Ulam and Teller), all other thermonuclear bombs are just the result of successful spying and secret sharing.This X-ray hammer can&#x27;t be very easily tested. That&#x27;s what these guys are doing.Now, you may wonder if Putin&#x27;s guys are doing an equally good job at testing their thermonuclear bombs. We don&#x27;t know, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference: the fission part of the bombs is powerful enough to create utter devastation. The fusion part adds some extra punch, but it doesn&#x27;t change the scale of devastation.

Manipulating the strong nuclear force is not even comparable.My opinion about fusion is that by the time they figure it out (which I think could eventually be done, if we invest a large portion of humanity&#x27;s knowledge and wealth), it won&#x27;t even be worth it. We could have almost-free energy now with fission, and renewables keep getting better. Fusing atoms (and getting more energy back) will be an astonishing feat when we accomplish it, but not offer much benefit over existing power generation. For instance, financially it would take a lifetime to ever recover the costs invested. Even once it&#x27;s figured out, it will still take decades to build the plants, which will be buggy-first-generation models (that still contain dangerous radiation, just more manageable).

Then, you need some way to turn that energy into electricity, for which no realistic design exists in the case of ICF, so you&#x27;ll lose more power. reply noobermin 14 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m generally on team NIF as a laser guy, but my biggest gripe is the calculation for ignition they employ uses the UV light into the hohlraum which ignores the 3-omega frequency tripling as the light (originally IR at 1053nm) enters the main target chamber. That frequency tripling will always rob a lot of energy from the lasers as it does generally for normal laser setups. I feel like loss from other parts of the laser like the amplification and other general losses are understandable because it&#x27;s a laser and that&#x27;s unavoidable, but they absolutely should include the loss from the frequency tripling because that seems like an added on thing (this improves penetration into the walls of the hohlraum), even though that will push them below the ignition threshold again.The loss there is about a factor of 1&#x2F;2 or so, so they&#x27;d have to improve things by that much. reply okdood64 16 hours agoparentprev> achieving the actual energy break even instead of laser energy break even.Can someone elaborate on why laser energy break even was even a big deal?

They ended up developing an entire automated system for fixing these using an approach I can&#x27;t recall.So I guess the losses in terms of reaching break even (which this facility is not specifically aiming for, its main purpose is to ensure our hydrogen bombs still work) are the electricity-to-laser efficiency (IIRC these lasers are pretty old now and less efficient than modern lasers), making optics which can better tolerate the energy, getting the timing right so that the pellet is compressed equally (any imbalances manifest as reduced efficiency) and making better pellets (since of course, this is also an energy intensive process at the moment). reply itishappy 15 hours agorootparentprevYup. Also energy recapture. (I suppose you could argue that&#x27;s included in \"cooling issues.\") reply throwup238 16 hours agorootparentprevThe former is a milestone for the latter. In order to demonstrate that net energy for the process is even possible, they have to show that the ignition can be breakeven. By analogy they have to show that combustion is possible before spending even more money on building a giant gas fired power plant.It&#x27;s a small milestone, but it&#x27;s a very important stepping stone if there&#x27;s going to be any future for it. Getting it to the commercial power plant stage is a much more holistic problem that will probably take 10x more investment which no one wants to spend sight unseen. reply cstoner 16 hours agorootparentprevWhile it&#x27;s true that total net energy is what ultimately matters, the article points out that 99% of the energy that goes towards the lasers is wasted.

Whether they are used as on the grid solutions or instead heat sources for energy intensive processes (think chemical reactions, metal forges, etc ) in the 30&#x27;s is yet to be determined. reply callalex 14 hours agorootparentCan someone expand these acronyms for me please? reply ublaze 14 hours agorootparentICF: Inertial Confinement FusionMCF: Magnetic Confinement FusionCFS is Commonwealth Fusion Systems - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfs.energy&#x2F;Q is the ratio between energy in and out in a fusion system. Q > 1 is the holy grail, which implies we have more energy out of the fusion system than in. CFS is aiming for Q 11 in its prototype reactor.SPARC is the \"Smallest Possible\" ARC I believe. It&#x27;s their prototype reactor that they&#x27;re working on that uses magnetic fields through superconductors to contain Hydrogen as it heats up into plasma and goes through the fusion process.ARC is the 400MW reactor that will be produced (aimed for within a decade) if SPARC succeeds - it&#x27;s the scaled-out version of SPARC.It has an impressive set of people working on it (ex-SpaceX).And yes, ARC is named after the Iron Man reactor. reply KyleBerezin 16 hours agoparentprevIt happened in 2013 lol.

Solar and Wind have strong growth prospects and are very economical, with reason to believe in further price reductions (especially for solar). As we&#x27;ve seen at COP, a lot of countries are planning to strongly build out renewables (a simple tripling, disregarding a lot of factors, leading to 45% share of renewables by 2030) and only a few are planning a much slower expansion of nuclear.Storage shows a lot of promise and very successful initial deployments for short duration storage and I see no reason to be more (or even as) optimistic about future development of nuclear & fusion reactors than chemical energy storage.> It&#x27;s almost as if all the people working on these projects and funding them aren&#x27;t complete morons, and the world quite so reductive, like half of hacker news seems to smugly dismiss EVERY time any fusion article is posted.Or there&#x27;s a reason why this is mostly funded by governments as a foundational work, presumably with hopes that fusion will be largely viable in the long term. If governments funding this work were hopeful that fusion would be economically viable within 15 years, you&#x27;d expect very large funding increases (especially from the private sector) and a reduction in investment for transforming the electricity grid away from big central power producers to more geographically diverse renewable supply. reply thaumasiotes 16 hours agorootparentprev> Much of the world doesn&#x27;t have their own fossil fuels they can rely onFor some reason this thought reminded me of the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.Iron failed to displace bronze during the Bronze Age for two reasons:1. It is technologically difficult to make.2. It is mostly an inferior material.(Steel is a lot better than bronze, but that wasn&#x27;t an option.)But the Bronze Age ended in a near-total collapse of the social order across most of Eurasia. International trade routes dried up. And iron was readily available everywhere in the world, whereas bronze was not even available to regions that mined their own copper, because they didn&#x27;t have any tin.Interestingly enough, having your own local supplies of food and energy protects you from suddenly starving and freezing if a war should break out, but it makes everyone else a lot less safe from you, because now you&#x27;re insulated from the consequences of war. reply Der_Einzige 16 hours agorootparentprevI still don&#x27;t get why thorium reactors basically don&#x27;t exist despite on paper being superior for energy generation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thorium-based_nuclear_powerhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molten_salt_reactor reply Nifty3929 15 hours agoprev [–] I find it frustrating the the US Govt spends > $800B&#x2F;yr on our \"defense\" while we run out of basic supplies like ammunition and all of our tanks and ships are falling apart.Meanwhile, that same Govt spendswhile we run out of basic supplies like ammunitionBecause they&#x27;re actively being used in a war in Ukraine at a prodigious rate?

Arlette Bashizi for The New York Times How Africans Are Changing French — One Joke, Rap and Book at a Time More than 60 percent of French speakers now live in Africa. Despite growing resentment at France, Africans are contributing to the evolution and spread of the French language. Share full article 92 By Elian Peltier Photographs by Arlette Bashizi and Hannah Reyes Morales Reporting from Abidjan, Ivory Coast; Dakar, Senegal; and Paris Dec. 12, 2023 French, by most estimates the world’s fifth most spoken language, is changing — perhaps not in the gilded hallways of the institution in Paris that publishes its official dictionary, but on a rooftop in Abidjan, the largest city in Ivory Coast. There one afternoon, a 19-year-old rapper who goes by the stage name “Marla” rehearsed her upcoming show, surrounded by friends and empty soda bottles. Her words were mostly French, but the Ivorian slang and English words that she mixed in made a new language. To speak only French, “c’est zogo” — “it’s uncool,” said Marla, whose real name is Mariam Dosso, combining a French word with Ivorian slang. But playing with words and languages, she said, is “choco,” an abbreviation for chocolate meaning “sweet” or “stylish.” A growing number of words and expressions from Africa are now infusing the French language, spurred by booming populations of young people in West and Central Africa. More than 60 percent of those who speak French daily now live in Africa, and 80 percent of children studying in French are in Africa. There are as many French speakers in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, as in Paris. Through social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, they are literally spreading the word, reshaping the French language from African countries, like Ivory Coast, that were once colonized by France. “We’ve tried to rap in pure French, but nobody was listening to us,” said Jean Patrick Niambé, known as Dofy, a 24-year-old Ivorian hip-hop artist listening to Marla on the rooftop. “So we create words from our own realities, and then they spread.” Walking down the streets of Paris or its suburbs, you can hear people use the word “enjailler” to mean “having fun.” But the word originally came from Abidjan to describe how adrenaline-seeking young Ivorians in the 1980s jumped on and off buses racing through the streets.

Arlette Bashizi for The New York Times The youth population in Africa is surging while the rest of the world grays. Demographers predict that by 2060, up to 85 percent of French speakers will live on the African continent. That’s nearly the inverse of the 1960s, when 90 percent of French speakers lived in European and other Western countries. “French flourishes every day in Africa,” said Souleymane Bachir Diagne, a renowned Senegalese professor of philosophy and French at Columbia University. “This creolized French finds its way in the books we read, the sketches we watch on television, the songs we listen to.” Speaking French in Africa African countries where French is spoken by more than 10 percent of the population.

Source: Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie By The New York Times Nearly half of the countries in Africa were at one time French colonies or protectorates, and most of them use French as their official language. But France has faced growing resentment in recent years in many of these countries for both its colonial legacy and continuing influence. Some countries have evicted French ambassadors and troops, while others target the French language itself. Some West African novelists write in local languages as an act of artistic resistance. The ruling junta in Mali has stripped French of its official status, and a similar move is underway in Burkina Faso. Image Youth on Yoff Beach in Dakar, Senegal, once a French colony.

Hannah Reyes Morales for The New York Times The backlash has not gone unnoticed in France, where the evolution of French provokes debate, if not angst, among some intellectuals. President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a 2019 speech: “France must take pride in being essentially one country among others that learns, speaks, writes in French.” The language laboratory In the sprawling Adjamé market in Abidjan, there are thousands of small stalls selling electronics, clothes, counterfeit medicine and food. The market is a perfect laboratory in which to study Nouchi, a slang once crafted by petty criminals, but which has taken over the country in under four decades. Some former members of Abidjan’s gangs, who helped invent Nouchi, now work as guards patrolling the market’s alleys, where “jassa men” — young hustlers — sell goods to make ends meet. It is here that new expressions are born and die every day. Germain-Arsène Kadi, a professor of literature at the Alassane Ouattara University in Ivory Coast, walked deep into the market one morning carrying with him the Nouchi dictionary he wrote.

Credit... Arlette Bashizi for The New York Times At a maquis, a street restaurant with plastic tables and chairs, the owner gathered a few jassa men in their corner, or “soï,” to throw out their favorite words while they drank Vody, a mix of vodka and energy drink. “They’re going to hit you,” the owner said in French, which alarmed me until they explained that the French verb for “hit,” frapper, had the opposite meaning there: Those jassa men would treat us well — which they did, throwing out dozens of words and expressions unknown to me in a few minutes. Mr. Kadi frantically scribbled down new words on a notepad, saying repeatedly, “One more for the dictionary.” It’s nearly impossible to know which word crafted on the streets of Abidjan might spread, travel or even survive. “Go,” meaning “girlfriend” in Ivory Coast, was entered into the well-known French dictionary Le Robert this year. In Abidjan this year, people began to call a boyfriend “mon pain” — French for “my bread.” Improvisations soon proliferated: “pain choco” is a cute boyfriend. A sugary bread, a sweet one. A bread just out of the oven is a hot partner.

Arlette Bashizi for The New York Times At a church in Abidjan earlier this year, the congregation burst out laughing, several worshipers told me, when the priest preached that people should share their bread with their brethren. The expression has spread like a meme on social media, reaching neighboring Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands of miles away. It hasn’t reached France yet. But Ivorians like to joke about which expressions French people will pick up, often years, if not decades, later. “If French becomes more mixed, then visions of the world it carries will change,” said Josué Guébo, an Ivorian poet and philosopher. “And if Africa influences French from a linguistic point of view, it will likely influence it from an ideological one.” Painful past, uncertain future Le Magnific — the stage name for Jacques Silvère Bah — is one of Ivory Coast’s most famous standup comedians, renowned for his plays on words and imitations of West African accents. But as a young boy learning French in school, he was forbidden to speak Wobé, his own language, he said. His French was initially so poor, he was reduced to communicating with gestures on the playground. “We had to learn fast, and in a painful way,” said the 45-year-old Mr. Silvère one afternoon, before he took the stage at a standup comedy festival in Abidjan. Across French-speaking West and Central African countries, French is seldom used at home and is rarely the first language, instead restricted to school, work, business or administration. According to a survey released last year by the French Organization of the Francophonie, the primary organization for promoting French language and culture, 77 percent of respondents in Africa described French as the “language of the colonizer.” About 57 percent said it was an imposed language. Sometimes the methods of imposing it were brutal, scholars say. At school in many French colonies, children speaking in their mother tongue were beaten or forced to wear an object around their necks known as a “symbol” — often a smelly object or an animal bone. Still, many African countries adopted French as their official language when they gained independence, in part to cement their national identities. Some even kept the “symbol” in place at school.

Credit... Arlette Bashizi for The New York Times At the festival, Le Magnific and other standup comedians threw jibes in French and ridiculed one another’s accents, drawing laughter from the audience. It mattered little if a few words were lost in translation. “What makes our humor Pan-African is the French language,” said the festival’s organizer, Mohamed Mustapha, known across West Africa by his stage name, Mamane. A standup comedian from Niger, Mamane has a daily comedy program listened to by millions around the world on Radio France Internationale. “It’s about survival, if we want to resist against Nollywood,” he said, referring to Nigeria’s film industry, “and English-produced content.” Today, more than a third of Ivorians speak French, according to the International Organization of the Francophonie. In Tunisia and the Democratic Republic of Congo — the world’s largest French-speaking country — it is more than half. But in many Francophone countries, governments struggle to hire enough French-speaking teachers. “African children are still learning in French in extremely difficult conditions,” said Francine Quéméner, a program specialist in charge of language policies at the International Organization of the Francophonie. “They must learn to count, write, read in a language they don’t fully grasp, with teachers who themselves don’t always feel secure speaking French.” Still, Ms. Quéméner said French had long escaped France’s control. “French is an African language and belongs to Africans,” she said. “The decentralization of the French language is a reality.” France notices At the Hip Hop Académie, a youth program founded by the rapper Grödash in a Paris suburb, teens and children scribbled lyrics on notepads, following instructions to mix French and foreign languages. Coumba Soumaré Camara, aged 9, tried out a few words from the mother tongues of her Mauritanian and Senegalese parents. She ended her couplet with “t’es magna” — you’re mean — combining French syntax and an expression from Mauritania. Hip-hop, now dominating the French music industry, is injecting new words, phrases and concepts from Africa into France’s suburbs and cities.

Hannah Reyes Morales for The New York Times Image Dancing at the Hip Hop Académie. Credit... Hannah Reyes Morales for The New York Times One of the world’s most famous French-speaking pop singers is Aya Nakamura, originally from Mali. Many of the most streamed hip-hop artists are of Moroccan, Algerian, Congolese or Ivorian origins. “Countless artists have democratized French music with African slang,” said Elvis Adidiema, a Congolese music executive with Sony Music Entertainment. “The French public, from all backgrounds, has become accustomed to those sounds.” But some in France are slow to embrace change. Members of the French Academy, the 17th-century institution that publishes an official dictionary of the French language, have been working on the same edition for the past 40 years. On a recent evening Dany Laferrière, a Haitian-Canadian novelist and the only Black member of the academy, walked the gilded corridors of the Academy’s building, on the left bank of the Seine River. He and his fellow academicians were reviewing whether to add to the dictionary the word “yeah,” which appeared in French in the 1960s. Mr. Laferrière acknowledged that the Academy might need to modernize by incorporating entire dictionaries from Belgian, Senegalese, or Ivorian French. “French is about to make a big leap, and she’s wondering how it’s going to go,” Mr. Laferrière said of the French language. “But she’s excited about where she’s headed.” He paused, stared at the Seine through the window, and corrected himself. “They, not she. They are now multiple versions of French that speak for themselves. And that is the greatest proof of its vitality.” Image Dany Laferrière, a Haitian-Canadian writer and the only Black member of the French Academy, in the academy’s halls in Paris.

The speed of native French speakers meant comprehension was hard but manageable, and they seemed (almost intentionally at times), unable to make anything but what I would consider \"travel French\" work. I was fairly discouraged. I then met an Italian ski instructor who worked in France, and I could understand him quite well, and talked with him at a level (job, hobbies, family, reasons for travel) that I never achieved with a native speaker.It was one of the most memorable moments of the trip and really gave me a feeling that we&#x27;re all \"citizens of the world\" and not quite so divided by culture and lines on a map. reply marcus_holmes 4 hours agorootparentprevIn Germany they were happy to see me trying, but almost universally couldn&#x27;t understand any of my garbled sentences.

Because I mis-conjugated a lot, it came across as garbled nonsense.I&#x27;ve travelled a bit, and learning to speak Global English is definitely a skill. My German wife is more understandable to the average SE Asian than I am, despite me being a native speaker. She uses less $5 words, and simpler sentence construction than I do.

While non-native speakers obviously recognize that something is a swear word, without immersion it’s often hard to gauge how it will be perceived by native speakers, simply because you don’t meet many, or any, to get reactions from.I’m a non native speaker and it wasn’t until University when I met actual Americans that I realized my swearing could be ear-curling from time to time — I simply hadn’t noticed the reaction I got before in my life.A simple example is the Swedish word “skit” and the English “shit”. In Swedish it’s actually pretty benign, for different reasons it’s not at all at the top of our swearing hierarchy: if you’d use “shit” in English in the same situations as you’d use “skit” in Swedish, English people will react.So both in cases where there are cognates and a lack of actual experience with native speakers, there’s definitely a disconnect.

For example, in English you can say \"the cat ate the bird\", but if you reversed \"cat\" and \"bird\" this would be a different sentence entirely. In Russian \"cat\" would have the nominative case and \"bird\" accusative, so you can swap the words around and it would mean the same, though perhaps with different emphasis.French doesn&#x27;t do this; as with English only the pronouns have vestigial accusative, and in any case most inflections are lost in speech because French drops consonants from the end of words. So you have to depend on strict word order to preserve meaning. reply kergonath 4 hours agorootparentprev> France cant do this. Why... I dont know why. Maybe because the are more desciptive.Oui oui.

I’m reasonably competent in French and if there is such a feature, I don’t see it. reply esperent 7 hours agorootparentNo, I don&#x27;t think so. In my experience of traveling around and trying to speak various languages in a broken fashion, the biggest difficulty is the native&#x27;s receptivity to trying to understand you. The second biggest difficulty is ease of basic pronunciations, and this does vary a lot between languages. For example, currently I&#x27;m in Vietnam, and local people do not try to understand foreigners who speak Vietnamese at all. By locals, I mean people I meet around during the day like shopkeepers and service people rather than my friends. The pronunciation is also extremely difficult because of the tones and the very large difference in regional accents. It&#x27;s frustrating and I have given up trying to learn the language because of this.I would accept that France is slightly harder to pronounce than English but as a beginner&#x2F;intermediate French speaker I don&#x27;t personally believe it.However, I definitely agree that people in France - especially Paris - are not receptive to foreigners speaking French at all. They don&#x27;t support you, and you do feel looked down on for speaking badly (in comparison to Vietnam where you will never feel looked down on, you&#x27;ll just receive looks of confusion). Again, I don&#x27;t mean friends that you make. I mean the general French populace that you meet while going about your daily business, in shops, restaurants, and so on.Spain, Italy, Greece are similar to France in that they are condescending towards non-native speakers. Mainland Greece was the worst for me. Meanwhile I would say that Portugal, Indonesia, Germany, and many English speaking countries (at least in cities) are quite helpful and friendly towards non-native speakers.

Latin of course remained the really \"important\" language of the Church and increasingly the law.There are roughly three named \"ages\" of English (in England): old, middle and modern. I can just about understand written middle English and have severe problems with old English.Modern English can be very flexible, which is probably why it has become popular as a lingua franca.

However, the rest of the grammar structure is still overwhelmingly of Romance origin.

Its needlessly complex especially when you know other languages solved it much better, and as with other bureaucratic stuff in France any attempt for reform failed.

But I guess if you like the feeling of struggling for whole life, looked down upon and gain motivation from it then its great.Second, I don&#x27;t know details of how schools work in France (seems a rather toxic place pushing way too hard for competitiveness but I may be wrong here), but I see result every day also in cca 50% of my colleagues - people are absolutely snobbish in the worst possible manner about their language to the point of being sometimes toxic, and automatically scowl at any tiny mistake. Guess what, as a foreigner trying to learn language you will make tons of them, even on C2 level. There is absolutely minimum help, they will just laugh at you like bunch of small kids, literally mocking you and pointing fingers at you. I mean 50+ years old higher managers bursting into laugh how stupid you are. Every single time. Schooling and overall mindset make french people behave like arrogant folks a lot (not so much say folks from African colonies, much much nicer folks to interact with; same for Swiss french and cca Belgians too. Don&#x27;t know much about Quebec folks, but in casual conversation french mock and insult them behind their back pretty horribly). I&#x27;ve never ever been mocked by natives for making even basic mistakes in any other language, its just part of basic human decency.I&#x27;ve seen recently shock and disgust among young French that some french local paragliding teacher exposed to decades of english-speaking tourists used some english words in his french. Those were some otherwise smart folks. I&#x27;ve had my very good American friend who is overweight literally gave up on french and France, on his month long trip there they were insulting and mocking him in the bars and restaurants, in hotels, in trains etc (I talk about staff, not other tourists). Man, I have hundreds of stories like this, unfortunately very consistent.I know 5 languages, 3 of them very different compared to my native one, and French is by far the worst of them to learn and just use it (I know there are worse, just describing my experiences). French folks need to come in terms of not being superpower nor center of the world anymore and accepting there is more than their language in the world. I&#x27;ve visited every continent (apart from Antarctica) and generally travelled a lot and literally nowhere I felt so little welcomed and rather just tolerated due to money bringing in like in France.

People are simply more accustomed to communicating across different languages and more accepting of non-native speakers and various accents, even if they are native speakers themselves. Ironically this tolerance as opposed to the supposed academic perfection of the language spoken in France makes use of the language as it was initially intended when it was created a lingua franca meant to be used by a wide variety of people. In France however there is often less tolerance for varying pronunciations and accents, not everyone is the same in that regard but it’s definitely something people experience in France (we would wish that maybe they would resort to English sometime to continue the conversation or correcting us but this is much less likely too).This isn&#x27;t just about non-native speakers but also applies to native French speakers from regions like Quebec or Congo. Despite using similar vocabulary, they sometimes face challenges being understood in France, mainly due to their distinct accents, I mean I believe this also occurs between various region of France reply dudul 9 hours agorootparent> . In France however there is often less tolerance for varying pronunciations and accents,Yes this was covered in my original message. Miss pronouncing a word in French can make it extremely hard to understand for a native speaker. And yes people from Quebec are an excellent example. They will often struggle when their accent is too strong when visiting France. And people are not ill meaning, Quebecois are very popular in France, it&#x27;s just genuinely hard.People often don&#x27;t know that the French language was literally a political weapon to create France. France is political construct, not cultural like most countries. It is an aggregation of different cultures, including different languages. It was vital for France to succeed as a construct to force the idea of \"correct French\". A French language that would be the same everywhere, without local variations. So yeah, the French ear is not used to dealing with mistakes or strong accents. reply grecy 12 hours agorootparentprev> Additionally they most likely already knew English and were able to decipher \"French broken by an English speaker\".No, they did not speak English.If they had, I wouldn&#x27;t have subjected them to my French. reply grecy 12 hours agorootparentprev> People weren&#x27;t correcting you to mock you.

    "originBody": "FSearch is a fast file search utility, inspired by Everything Search Engine. It's written in C and based on GTK3.

Instructions can be found here: https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/basic.html And of course: Thank you for taking the time to translate FSearch! Current Limitations Sorting lots of results by Type can be very slow, since gathering that information is expensive, and the data isn't indexed. This also means that when the view is sorted by Type, searching will reset the sort order to Name. Using the Move to Trash option doesn't update the database index, so trashed files/folders show up in the result list as if nothing happened to them. Why yet another search utility? Performance. On Windows I really like to use Everything Search Engine. It provides instant results as you type for all your files and lots of useful features (regex, filters, bookmarks, ...). On Linux I couldn't find anything that's even remotely as fast and powerful. Before I started working on FSearch, I took a look at existing solutions. I tried MATE Search Tool (formerly GNOME Search Tool), Recoll, Krusader (locate based search), SpaceFM File Search, Nautilus, ANGRYsearch and Catfish, to find out whether it makes sense to improve those. However, they're not exactly what I was looking for: standalone application (not part of a file manager) written in a language with C like performance no dependencies to any specific desktop environment Qt5 or GTK3 based small memory usage (both hard drive and RAM) target audience: advanced users Looking for a command line interface? I highly recommend fzf or the obvious tools: find and (m)locate Why GTK3 and not Qt5? I like both of them, and my long term goal is to provide console, GTK3 and Qt5 interfaces, or at least make it easy for others to build those. However, for the time being it's only GTK3 because I like C more than C++, and I'm more familiar with GTK development. Questions? Email: christian.boxdoerfer[AT]posteo.de",

For example, to attach a file instead of faffing around clicking in the open dialog, I type into fluent search(a frontend to everything) and it enters it in the current context i.e the open dialog.It has a few other qualifiers, like big: huge: etc to search large files. Same way with time etc.Rarely when you need it you prefix with regex: and you get everything you need.It&#x27;s very useful that both everything and fluent search integrate into explorer in that if you right click on the search result you get the same context menu as you would in explorer. Drag drop works, etc,. The issue with every other tool in every other OS is the lack of this feature.

In X11 if you close any app, you lose anything you copy from it. This is because in X11 windows do message passing to emulate a clipboard. Your browser say and fsearch send messages to each other to send data in few KB chunks(yes there&#x27;s an incremental transfer protocol where you have to support all kinds of irrelevant clients even if the last such client died before the turn of the century) So when one of the windows closes, it&#x27;s gg.

Most recently, I discovered that absolutely nothing in my iCloud drive can be found with Spotlight, even if the file is on disk and I&#x27;m just trying to match its name. For extra fun, I found an Apple support page that suggested the Windows-in-1999-esque procedure of blocking and then unblocking the directory from indexing in the Spotlight preferences. Unsurprisingly, this didn&#x27;t work.Testing out mdfind and trying to simply find a file in a specific directory (which only contains five files): mdfind -onlyin . name-of-my-file.mdNothing. mdfind -onlyin . -name name-of-my-file.mdNothing. mdfind -onlyin &#x2F;absolute&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;cwd -name name-of-my-file.mdNothing.This is pretty reflective of my experience with the Spotlight GUI.

The app works in two steps:Step one is building an index of the file system. This is simply done by walking the filesystem. The resulting index is stored in RAM and a file. On the next app start the index ia loaded from that file, which is much quicker than walking the file system.Step two is using this in RAM index for searching. This scales really well with the number or CPU cores and on modern systems a normal case insensitive substring search should finish almost instantly with few million files.The next release will support file system monitoring with inotify and fanotify to keep the index updated.

There&#x27;s probably some room of improvement there with clever parallelization, but it&#x27;ll remain a bottleneck.Everything is parsing a file called the MFT to build its index. This much more efficient but unfortunately this file only present on NTFS volumes, which makes it super useful on Windows systems, but not so much everywhere else.Another benefit you get on Windows is the USN journal, which allows Everything to keep the index updated much more efficiently. reply soundarana 9 hours agorootparentprevOn NTFS Everything reads the MFT, which is sequential on disk.Then on subsequent starts it reads the NFTS update journal to see what changed. reply pangey 9 hours agorootparentprevIs it possible to use eBPF for this task instead of inotify? reply wander_homer 3 hours agorootparentMaybe, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s much benefit to that.

    "originBody": "PC Components GPUs AMD strikes back at Nvidia with new MI300X benchmarks — MI300X shows 30% higher performance than H100, even with an optimized software stack News By Roshan Ashraf Shaikh published 16 December 2023 AMD also took one step ahead by making similar test situations to those Nvidia did with TensorRT-LLM while accounting for latency, which is typical with server workloads. Comments (11) (Image credit: AMD) Neither AMD nor Nvidia intends to back out of this argument involving the performance difference between the Instinct MI300X and the H100 (Hopper) GPUs. But AMD does make some strong points while comparing FP16 using vLLM, which is a more popular choice against FP8, which works only with TensorRT-LLM. The red team announced the MI300X graphics accelerator early this December, claiming up to 1.6X lead over Nvidia's H100. Two days ago, Nvidia fired back by saying AMD did not use its optimizations when comparing the H100 with TensorRT-LLM. The reply reached a single H100 against eight-way H100 GPUs while running the Llama 2 70B chat model. The Continued War of Benchmark Results and Test Scenarios In this latest response, AMD said that Nvidia used a selective set of inferencing workloads. It further identified that Nvidia benchmarked these using its in-house TensorRT-LLM on H100 rather than vLLM, an open-source and widely used method. Furthermore, Nvidia used the vLLM FP16 performance datatype on AMD while comparing its results with DGX-H100, which used the TensorRT-LLM with FP8 datatype to display these alleged misconstrued results. AMD stressed that in its test, it used vLLM with the FP16 dataset due to its widespread use, and vLLM does not support FP8. There's also the point that servers will have latency, but instead of accounting for that, Nvidia showed its throughput performance, not emulating the real-world situation, according to AMD. AMD's Updated Test Results with More Optimizations and Accounting for Latency with Nvidia's Testing Method AMD made three performance runs using Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM, the last notable one having measured latency results between MI300X and vLLM using the FP16 dataset against H100 with TensorRT-LLM. But the first test involved a comparison between the two using vLLM on both, hence FP16, and for the second test, it compared its MI300X's performance with vLLM while comparing TensorRT-LLM. (Image credit: AMD ) So, AMD used the same selected testing scenario Nvidia did with its second and third test scenarios, showing higher performance and reduced latency. The company added more optimizations when compared to H100 while running vLLM on both, offering a 2.1x boost in performance. It is now up to Nvidia to evaluate how it wants to respond. But it also needs to acknowledge that this would require the industry to ditch FP16 with TensorRT-LLM's closed system for using FP8, essentially ditching vLLM for good. While referring to Nvidia's premium, a Redditor once said, \"TensorRT-LLM is free just like the things that come free with a Rolls Royce.\" Stay on the Cutting Edge Join the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news — and have for over 25 years.

Most of LLM inference is MatMul and Softmax. It&#x27;s not rocket science to implement matrix multiplication in any GPU. We don&#x27;t have very complex custom kernel for the LLM inference. If AMD can provide fast GPU with cheaper price, a lot of people don&#x27;t mind to add support for them. GGML shows you can create a working LLM inference solution with one man&#x27;s work. reply godelski 5 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s not rocket science to implement matrix multiplication in any GPU.You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s harder. Saying this as someone who&#x27;s done more work on the former than the latter. (I have, with a team, built a rocket engine. And not your school or backyard project size, but nozzle bigger than your face kind. I&#x27;ve also written CUDA kernels and boy is there a big learning curve to the latter that you gotta fundamentally rethink how you view a problem. It&#x27;s unquestionable why CUDA devs are paid so much. Really it&#x27;s only questionable why they aren&#x27;t paid more)I know it is easy to think this problem is easy, it really looks that way. But there&#x27;s an incredible amount of optimization that goes into all of this and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really hard. You aren&#x27;t going to get away with just N for loops for a tensor rank N. You got to chop the data up, be intelligent about it, manage memory, how you load memory, handle many data types, take into consideration different results for different FMA operations, and a whole lot more. There&#x27;s a whole lot of non-obvious things that result in high optimization (maybe obvious __after__ the fact, but that&#x27;s not truthfully \"obvious\"). The thing is, the space is so well researched and implemented that you can&#x27;t get away with naive implementations, you have to be on the bleeding edge.Then you have to do that and make it reasonably usable for the programmer too, abstracting away all of that. Cuda also has a huge head start and momentum is not a force to be reckoned with (pun intended).Look at TensorRT[0]. The software isn&#x27;t even complete and it still isn&#x27;t going to cover all neural networks on all GPUs. I&#x27;ve had stuff work on a V100 and H100 but not an A100, then later get fixed. They even have the \"Apple Advantage\" in that they have control of the hardware. I&#x27;m not certain AMD will have the same advantage. We talk a lot about the difficulties of being first mover, but I think we can also recognize that momentum is an advantage of being first mover. And it isn&#x27;t one to scoff at.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;TensorRT reply doctorpangloss 4 hours agorootparentThis comment is not going to age well. In the interest of curiosity, in this indictment of yours, is there any specific reason, about the AMD hardware itself, that leads you to believe that such implementations don&#x27;t already exist, but are merely just not open sourced?I have a specific reason to believe this is all already optimized: poor adoption of Infinity Fabric by unsophisticated people, whereas NVLink is on every 3090 and DGX&#x2F;HGX box. But that doesn&#x27;t mean DC users haven&#x27;t optimized. reply godelski 4 hours agorootparentI really do want to see AMD kick ass. But1) the user above me thinks ML is just matrix multiplies, which it is far from that.2) It&#x27;s more than hardware, and one team has (huge) momentum3) You can have better tech and not win. It actually happens relatively frequently.There may be nothing better for the ML space than AMD being a meaningful competitor. It will give all of us better tools. It&#x27;ll make AMD better and it&#x27;ll even make Nvidia better, because (healthy) competition is good for everyone. But let&#x27;s not be naive in thinking it is just hardware and that one example is enough. It&#x27;s a good sign, but a Tesla driving on the highway in nominal conditions isn&#x27;t even close to fully self driving. It&#x27;s still a year away as it&#x27;s been for a decade.So I do hope this ages poorly. But I&#x27;m not holding my breath because as AMD succeeding is one of the best things for ML, hype is the absolute worst and there&#x27;s way too fucking much of it. And it it takes 5+ years to age, well I wouldn&#x27;t say it aged poorly. reply heyitsguay 1 hour agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that comment was an indictment of anything. As someone also in the space, it reads to me as a thoughtful explanation of why catching up to the CUDA ecosystem is so hard, even when the goal is \"just\" matrix multiplication (it&#x27;s actually not, but for the sake of a cleaner argument that&#x27;s ok). It&#x27;s entirely possible AMD or Intel or someone else has some super secret CUDA killer hidden away somewhere, but nobody has seen any evidence of it. It&#x27;s a bit of an extraordinary claim, and the community would love to see some extraordinary evidence. reply whalesalad 6 hours agorootparentprevEveryone has been writing cuda code. Hopefully we continue the shift towards using higher level frameworks&#x2F;abstractions that can determine the optimum machine code for the underlying hardware. I don’t really get it either.Nvidia is pouring $$$ into protecting their advantage as anemic as it might be. They give free compute and gpu resources to universities etc to cement the dependence on cuda. When you’re a beginner or someone who needs to just “get shit done” you’ll go nvidia at the expense of the greater good. reply nemothekid 1 hour agorootparent>Nvidia is pouring $$$ into protecting their advantage as anemic as it might be.This description isn&#x27;t fair. Nvidia was pouring money into CUDA for 16 years. AMD&#x2F;Intel only woke up once ChatGPT launched and nvidia started printing money. It&#x27;s not fair to call it \"protecting their advantage\" when nvidia invested into the ecosystem for years and AMD couldn&#x27;t even bother to ship working examples with OpenCL. I&#x27;m not sure why choosing the company that decided to invest in the platform for years is at the expense of the \"greater good.\" What \"greater good\" is there above actually working software? reply anvuong 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat the hell is the greater good here? I&#x27;m a researcher in a R1 university, I can quickly try stupid things on my personal 3080, then if it works I can virtually git clone the codes onto my lab&#x27;s server and bam it chops through the problems. After a few weeks I&#x27;ll get (hopefully) some publisable results that (hopefully) advance my field a little. Do you really expect most researchers to use half of their time debugging the unfinished ROCM stack that is just not there, sacrificing their output, and maybe even their tenure prospect? We love Nvidia solutions, at least in our field, not because it&#x27;s a monopoly, but because it&#x27;s actually the best solution right now. reply donor20 4 hours agorootparentI really like that you can prototype on your own consumer level card - the rocm stack has not matched that historically and has over promised and underdelivered for years now. reply dannyw 6 hours agorootparentprevAlso, the full consumer (RTX) stack is supported. Lots of people who are gamers, or want a hobbyist rig can go out to the shops and start with a RTX.AMD&#x27;s ML &#x2F; ROCm support for their consumer cards is still awful. reply plasticchris 6 hours agorootparentThey did add official support for the latest gen rdna cards to rocm. reply dannyw 5 hours agorootparentNot on Linux! reply ekianjo 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy only the latest gen? reply svnt 5 hours agorootparentBecause they want to recover their investment reply aryonoco 5 hours agorootparentActually because ROCm ships native machine code, as opposed to a bytecode, so supporting any additional architecture is a tonne of effort.I expect support will eventually be extended to a generation or two prior GPUs, but nothing beyond that. replypavelstoev 6 hours agorootparentprevTry Hidet - open source deep learning compiler written in Python, generating optimized CUDA https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;hidet&#x2F; reply jakderrida 5 hours agorootparentprev> They give free compute and gpu resources to universities etc to cement the dependence on cuda.It&#x27;s actually quite brilliant. It never occurred to me before that the resources we had access to at university weren&#x27;t the most popular because that&#x27;s what the library wanted. They were the most popular because the provider made them cheap&#x2F;free to widen their moat over the competition.It reminds me of Thomson Reuters launching Eikon, a superior alternative (imho) to Bloomberg terminals. Every business school has Bloomberg terminals.

I predict inference will move to edge computing based on mobile chips like the ones from Qualcomm in the midterm. reply wrigby 6 hours agorootparentThis. When I was still doing infra for a large recommendation engine, the training was what got the big GPUs. Inference was on CPU or (later) ASICs (may have been FPGAs?). reply mupuff1234 4 hours agorootparentprevUnless you have a model that&#x27;s good enough for your use case and it&#x27;s mostly inference from here on. reply visarga 4 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t quite understand. Most of LLM inference is MatMul and Softmax.Most operations are memory bound: slow because memory access takes longer than computation itself. The problem is we have to shove the whole model, billions of weights, in the SRAM once for every token generated. That creates slowness. reply Eridrus 7 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve seen multiple people mention training LLMs successfuly on AMD hardware, I think the software stack is close enough on these data center chips that you can productively use them and the bigger question, is if you can get your hands on them more easily than H100s. reply _3u10 5 hours agorootparentIt’s difficult to productively game on AMD cards I don’t even want to know how annoying it is to start training over because of a driver crash. reply gumby 7 hours agoparentprevI though usage of PyTorch >> cuda directly, which case cuda is less crucial. reply godelski 5 hours agorootparentPyTorch is using cuda on the backend. You might not see it, but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. So there&#x27;s no \"PyTorch vs CUDA\" because \"PyTorch __is__ CUDA\". You can also say it&#x27;s a lot of other things like ROCm. It&#x27;s best to think of the python in PyTorch as more of an API. reply woadwarrior01 1 hour agorootparent> So there&#x27;s no \"PyTorch vs CUDA\" because \"PyTorch __is__ CUDA\".Not true. PyTorch has had an MPS backend[1] for Apple Silicon for quite some time now. And lately, they&#x27;ve also added a HIP backend[2] for AMD hardware. I&#x27;ve written CUDA kernels for PyTorch in the past, it&#x27;d have been a lot easier if PyTorch were a thin wrapper over CUDA, but it isn&#x27;t.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pytorch.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;notes&#x2F;mps.html[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pytorch.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;notes&#x2F;hip.html reply hexaga 1 hour agorootparentprevTheir point seems sound. Restated: Using pytorch [is better than] using CUDA directly (i.e., ml devs interact w&#x2F; pytorch apis not CUDA apis). And if you&#x27;re using a wrapper anyway, whether CUDA is used or some other backend is less crucial (than if directly writing to a GPGPU api) so long as the wrapper works as expected. reply anvuong 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not that simple. Pytorch has its own computing model, calling it just APIs is really downplaying the phenomenal works behind the framework. Pytorch put Tensorflow to shame even though the latter had huge first mover advantage. reply godelski 4 hours agorootparentFor sure it&#x27;s not that simple, but the person I was responding to was at the stage of understanding that they were thinking PyTorch was better than CUDA. I&#x27;m trying to communicate to them, not someone with a more detailed understanding (I mean one of the top comments here thinks ML is \"just matrix multiplies\"...)Tensorflow had first mover advantage but they also had first mover disadvantage. TF isn&#x27;t that easy to write nor to debug. PyTorch got to see everything that was wrong with TF and fix it. No doubt Meta has put in lots of amazing effort. It is an incredible piece of software.I&#x27;ll also add that PyTorch does a lot of great stuff that people don&#x27;t use or recognize. There are a lot of good distributional works out there for prob and stats people that give you cuda acceleration. Really a lot of numpy can be replaced with pytorch and its great. But be warned of FMA and other optimization differences. reply girvo 7 hours agoparentprev> and in pure raster perf, they’re dominating the graphics space as well.Wait, is that actually true? The 4090 is superior in raster to the 7900XTX I thought? Happy to be corrected! reply klausa 7 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that they&#x27;re roughly on-par in raster performance, but Nvidia runs circles around AMD when it comes to RT and DLSS stuff. reply whalesalad 7 hours agorootparentyeah they do, but simply because they were first to market and have game studios using their stuff.ultimately dlss&#x2F;frame gen is a hack that no one on a high end card would ever use.ray tracing nvidia is king but they got the jump. that will normalize over the next generation or two. reply nodja 6 hours agorootparent> ultimately dlss&#x2F;frame gen is a hack that no one on a high end card would ever use.The irony of those technologies is that they shine best on high end cards.If you&#x27;re on a low end card and say pushing the limit of a game and are upscaling 720p to 1080p, then dlss can&#x27;t do miracles, there will be tons of defects due how little information about the scene the upscaler has. But if you&#x27;re on a high end system trying to upscale 1440p to 4k then even not only is the upscaler less likely to make a mistake, it&#x27;s also much less noticeable.Same with framegen, on a low end system that&#x27;s getting sub 60fps, the framegen not only adds noticeable input lag, but often makes noticeable defective frames in between, if your system was already pushing above 60 then not only is the input lag much more bearable, the possible defective frames stay on screen for so little that you&#x27;d have to be paying attention to it to notice them most of the time.They&#x27;re still useful for low end systems, they can prolong their lifespan quite a bit for current gen games, but as this tech becomes the norm, developers rely on them to hit performance targets and your card will be outdated just as fast as older cards used to. reply godelski 5 hours agorootparentprev> but simply because they were first to market and have game studios using their stuff.You say this as if momentum isn&#x27;t one of the most powerful forces in the universe. Many a better technology has gone extinct because a competitor simply had more momentum. It&#x27;s difficult to catch up and it&#x27;s difficult to stop.Nvidia also is aware of this and not making mistakes that many others do by sitting back and relaxing. They are doing everything they can to not let AMD even begin to compete, but they are also very aware that hardware is far from the full package. 75% max, but probably less. reply jacoblambda 6 hours agorootparentprevAs much as I wish this was true, a lot of new games require you choose between lower settings or DLSS if you want to maintain 1440p resolution and a decent FPS. This was true last generation with the 3090 (from personal experience) and it is true with this gen as well (based on second hand from my friends with current gen high end cards).You may not be running DLSS with a super high scaling factor but I almost guarantee DLSS or DLAA is going to be on for most games nowadays if you want to keep framerates stable on ultra. reply ThatPlayer 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t disagree with frame gen, but I think DLSS, FSR (and XeSS) are going to replace traditional anti-aliasing. Especially with older techniques like MSAA not being compatible with newer deferred rendering methods. Even at native resolutions, you still want anti-aliasing. These are simply the current bests at that.Alan Wake 2 will use FSR or DLSS for AA even at native resolutions, with no other AA option. I expect more games will do this in the future. reply theshackleford 2 hours agorootparentprev> ultimately dlss&#x2F;frame gen is a hack that no one on a high end card would ever use.This is completely false. reply hackerlight 5 hours agorootparentprevFrame gen is a hack, but DLSS upscaling isn&#x27;t a hack, it&#x27;s excellent. Native raster looks pretty bad compared to it due to aliasing, and FXAA&#x2F;TAA&#x2F;MXAA don&#x27;t work that well compared to DLSS at removing aliasing. reply whalesalad 7 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience it’s virtually identical to the 4090 in gaming, particularly when you consider that a 4090 is 2x the cost. The 4090 will do better, but not substantially. And in lots of games optimized for consoles (PS5 and Xbox are AMD based) the 7900XTX is actually the better card. I play a lot of COD and the 7900XTX outperforms there on framerate. reply DiabloD3 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s even neck in neck in titles where Nvidia paid the developers to trash the console optimized path (which would have been ported as an identical DX12 path), and write an entirely new, much slower, DX11 path.Why?Because Nvidia&#x27;s DX12&#x2F;Vulkan-style path in the driver is absolute trash, while their DX11&#x2F;OGL4-era path is very well tuned. Nvidia&#x27;s \"advantage\" is entirely software, the emperor wears no clothes.With games that Nvidia&#x27;s money couldn&#x27;t cripple games, the 7900XTX, the card that both costs less and uses less watts, beats the 4090 in 1080p, 1440p, and 4k targets. reply cma 5 hours agorootparent> Nvidia&#x27;s \"advantage\" is entirely software, the emperor wears no clothes.Have you seen fully realtime path-traced Cyberpunk? reply DiabloD3 5 hours agorootparentYep. I gotta give em props, almost looks as good as Control. reply causality0 7 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s the edge cases that are the problem. I regret getting a 7900xtx over a 4090 because RDNA3 is godawful at game console emulation. Even the 1070 I replaced runs rings around my 7900xtx when it comes to Switch emulation. reply whalesalad 6 hours agorootparentI have a hard time believing this. Switch is 720p low quality. Anything should be able to match that. Edge case indeed though - why not just play on an actual switch lol they are like $200 reply heyoni 5 hours agorootparentMost people emulating consoles like the switch are playing at higher resolution like 4k. reply hackerlight 6 hours agorootparentprevNot if you adjust for cost. 7900XTX is much better value raster in everything except perhaps raytracing (although even then there are some implementations where 7900XTX is better).Gamers buy 4090 only because DLSS is significantly better than FSR. reply girvo 5 hours agorootparentBetter value I absolutely understand. But I thought they were claiming its out and out better&#x2F;superior? As far as I was aware, the 4090 still edges out the 7900XTX in pure raster in most games, but again I&#x27;m not certain on that reply hackerlight 5 hours agorootparentI think you are right, 4090 is slightly better in most games, but at a much larger cost. reply whalesalad 5 hours agorootparentprevNo one with a 4090 is using dlss. The input latency is noticeable. reply maximus_prime 5 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re talking about the frame generation part. Without it, DLSS upscaling introduces no perceivable input lag. reply beebeepka 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s totally perceivable, though. reply hackerlight 5 hours agorootparentprevThe superior ML upscaling of DLSS is the why Nvidia dominates the gaming sector. AMD&#x27;s FSR upscaler introduces noticeable atrefacts and aliasing especially during motion, the tech isn&#x27;t close. reply stefan_ 5 hours agoparentprevYou are telling me what is supposedly a multi trillion dollar business being pursued by the brightest minds at Google and others would rather join the queue for a hardware drop from NVIDIA than enjoy a substantial competitive advantage being able to run on AMD hardware? For something that supposedly breaks down into such simple steps everyone is also building hardware to do it?Something doesn’t quite add up for this dependence on CUDA.

An 8 bit quantization of a model is half the size of a 16 bit model. You can load a model with twice the number of parameters using 8 bit quantizations as compared to loading a 16 bit model. GPU ram is always in demand and since 8 bit quants give you <1% performance degredation re: perplexity there&#x27;s no reason not to.That&#x27;s before getting to any potential 8 vs 16 bit processing speed differences the two companies are arguing over here. reply Tuna-Fish 8 hours agoparentThe hardware supports 8 bit, but the chosen software (vLLM) does not. The reason AMD chose to do the comparison with vLLM is that it is by far the most used inference library. So for now at least the market disagrees with you on the relative merits of 8 vs 16 bit processing.In any case, if the comparison was being done in 8 bit, the relative performance between the cards should be roughly similar as it is with 16 bit. reply brucethemoose2 8 hours agoparentprevIts more nuanced than this. Sometimes pure 8 bit inference (without any quantization tricks) reduces llm performance enough to impact certain tasks like retrieval.Its also important to distinguish 8 bit compute from the actual quantization scheme. vLLM in fact supports 4 bit AWQ, but the computation is not done in 4 bits on the GPU, and it wouldn&#x27;t even be close to pure 4 bit inference even if the hardware and vLLM supported that. reply andersa 8 hours agoparentprevBoth GPUs support both formats, so comparing an 8 bit quantized model on one to a 16 bit model on another is nonsense. That&#x27;ll massively affect the result. reply dhruvdh 7 hours agoparentprevIt should also be noted that H100 has 80 GB VRAM and MI300X has 192 GB. So, it can happily load the largest 8 bit model H100 can in 16 bit.

    "originBody": "Evaluating new software forges John Nunley · December 15, 2023 rust What options are there other than GitHub? Oh boy, I sure do love contributing to open source software on the largest software forge in the world! I hope they haven’t started down the slow and painful process of enshittification by following vague, ill-defined industry trends! Wait, what’s that? Computer! Enhance! Well, I guess I’m ready to find a new forge! Software Host Hellscape In all seriousness, I’ve been looking to move off of GitHub for a while now. Let me be clear, GitHub is still far and away the best website for open source discovery. Not to mention, its CI offerings are very nice, especially for something free. Yes, there are better paid CI offerings, but for something that costs zero dollars I’ve found it incredibly useful. However, one thing has made me skeptical of GitHub is its “Copilot” offering. I’ll admit, I was in the beta program for Copilot, and found it really neat. Being able to write large amounts of code from small comments was very nice, even if it was really bad practice. Then I found out it was training on GPL-licensed data, which left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. In addition to the fact that I’m increasingly uncomfortable with hosting my free software on a closed source forge, run by Microsoft. Let’s take a look at everybody else. GitLab Gauss GitLab is the original GitHub competitor. The Linux to Microsoft’s Windows, or the MariaDB to Oracle’s MySQL. This has made it the most popular GitHub competitor by far, by virtue of people vocally quitting GitHub in favor of [GitLab]. Unfortunately, I didn’t really consider GitLab when I was finding a place to move. First of all, they aren’t actually open source. They’re “open core”, which, I admit, is better than closed source. However, like I said, I’m uncomfortable building free software on infrastructure that isn’t. I know I can download GitLab and set it up on my own server. However, I’m a software developer, not a sysadmin. I want to spend my time developing software, not putting out fires and paying AWS bills for the rest of time. Also, GitLab has adopted the unfortunate strategy of “following along with whatever GitHub does”. They’ve tried to jump onto the bandwagon so frequently, they’ve gotten splinters. For instance, what happens when we check their homepage? Computer! Do the thing again! Good golly, it’s even the same wording! Yeah, I’ll pass. SourceHut Scramble sr.ht takes the opposite approach as GitLab. Instead of trying to follow along with GitHub’s trends, it’s elected to do go in the other direction. Whenever GitHub does something, SourceHut does the exact opposite. Pull requests? Too centralized, let’s construct a suitable code contribution system around email. Discussion? Why not IRC, it’s been around since the Bronze Age. Get rid of Mercurial support? Not interested. I really like SourceHut. When you go to their homepage, they’re not showing off their fancy CSS effects or telling you about their AI offerings. They give you a simple user interface and some of the projects they host. There was also much to impress me. Their CI offerings are better than GitHub, which alone justified me paying the humble $2/month price tag. Rather than needing a complicated YAML file to run a CI system, it’s just cloning Git repos and running commands. It’s delightfully simple yet powerful. Having native BSD and Plan9 runners doesn’t quite make up for its inability to run Windows, but I’m sure I can work around that. Not to mention, SourceHut has the second best repository discovery system. When I go to sr.ht’s “explore” tab, I’m immediately greeted by a slew of interesting projects. Whether it’s a powerful Forth dialect that brings a lot of genuinely exciting ideas to the table, or a tiny C11 compiler written in simple ANSI C, I’m always amazed whenever I open up that tab. I liked it so much that I announced that I was moving my personal projects to SourceHut. However, after moving my theo project to SourceHut, I found myself dissatisfied with a few things. For one, the email-based workflow was a lot clunkier than I expected. In theory, building code contribution on top of a standard protocol that’s been around since the 60’s sounds like a good idea. In practice, it’s a lot clunkier than you’d expect, especially since most modern email clients are simply not built to read and write code. After trying it for myself I can see that it might turn off a lot of people from contributing. I’m already losing a lot of potential contributors by moving off of GitHub. I don’t need those remaining contributors to also be turned off by a workflow completely different than what they’re probably used to. Still, I can imagine this workflow working for many people, especially ones who already have a decent setup for email-based projects like Linux. Codeberg Codeberg is a public instance of Forgejo, which is in turn a fork of Gitea. It’s got a pretty nice interface similar enough to GitHub’s. It’s got the familiar pull-request-based contribution interface. The CI is good enough, I suppose. Docker containers aren’t the best CI environment, but I can certainly think of worse. So what’s not to like? My main problem is that Codeberg has a very limited CI capacity, and I have a lot of projects that require significant testing. theo, for instance, requires these things to be tested: Make sure it compiles on Windows, Mac, Linux, WASM, Redox, and whatever oblique platform people run Rust on nowadays. Check the various different backends that theo supports: pure software rendering, wgpu and OpenGL. Not to mention all of the different interfaces to OpenGL, so wgl, GLX, EGL… Check formatting and linting. …which doesn’t even cover testing. For rendering frameworks like theo, you want to have some pre-defined rendering programs that render your code to images. That way, you can regenerate these images and compare against an existing set of images in order to check for regressions. This isn’t a practical concern, although it really should be. It’s a moral concern. You have an organization like Codeberg, donating a significant amount of time and resources to try to make a positive difference in the world of software. Now, here I am, sucking up all of those compute resources for my insignificant little projects. Of course, while pondering this moral concern, I realized that I’ve locked myself into a Catch-22. I can’t use any independent project’s CI because of my concerns that I would drain too many of their resources. On the other hand, I can’t use any large company’s CI because I don’t want to host my project with a large company. I can’t self host, because that would be a pain. Would it? Self-Hosting Gitea I said I didn’t want to self-host. I worked in IT for two years, so I’ve already gotten my fill of fighting with both servers and people. However, in a Discord I’m in, an acquaintance of mine talked about how they set up Gitea and Drone CI on a school Kubernetes cluster they had access to. I mentioned my predicaments in finding a forge service, and they said that it was only two configuration files. That tempted me. Not enough to deal with the absolute nightmare that is Kubernetes, but enough for me to rent out a couple of Lightsail servers to experiment. I’d like to say that I set up the entire thing in a weekend, but it wasn’t that simple. Sure, it was easy enough to install Gitea and Drone in Docker containers. Sure, it wasn’t too hard after that to set up my DNS records to forward src.notgull.net to that new serer. Yeah, it’s probably hacky to set up my CI system on a public cloud, but as long as I keep people from abusing it that aren’t me it shouldn’t be too bad, right? Of course, I forget my crucial weakness: my perfectionism. Sure, my site looks pretty good… but it looks a bit ugly. Let’s play around with themes for three days until I find one I like. Oh, the logo doesn’t look good with my new theme. Let’s convert the MS paint drawing I call my avatar into SVG and then set it up to be this site’s logo. Oh, Gitea has a weird templating system; let’s compile it from scratch! At the end of this week(!)long process, I had a somewhat functional Git forge, with the following features: A decent Linux Drone CI setup. A Dependabot clone for automatic updates. A system that allows everyone to create an account and open issues, but doesn’t allow people to create repos or mess with the CI. If you want to create a repo for PR’s sake, email me at dev at notgull dot net and I can set you up. A mirror to GitHub, so I can still take advantage of their code discovery. Yeah yeah, I know, but keeping an arm’s length from GitHub is a win in my book. I’ve uploaded a lot of my code to there, and it seems to be working well so far. I have to admit, it is somewhat liberating to have full control of how your code is forged. Parting Shots I still consider this to be in the “experimental” stage. If it ends up being too inconvenient or too expensive, I’ll probably move it somewhere else. Still, having my own space for code that I can do whatever I want with is very nice.

Certain types of projects are a red line to the owner and will be removed[0].I&#x27;ll be honest, I do not trust cryptocurrency stuff and don&#x27;t believe that it has utility. I hold none, I don&#x27;t use it. That being said, this makes me wonder what the next category of projects that SourceHut will ban is.What is the point of a free software forge if you can&#x27;t host certain types of (legal) projects? It&#x27;s hard to take a platform seriously, to move all of your work there when the administrators can (and most importantly, actually do) ban your projects based solely on their personal views.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcehut.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022-10-31-tos-update-cryptocurre... reply bayindirh 1 hour agoparentI&#x27;m actually pretty fine with this, because they are pretty open about one point:> We will exercise discretion when applying this rule.

They sure are luring you into ecosystems that require a huge escape velocity, but GitHub serves as less-friction entry point to open source software.GitLab self hosting is also nice and flexible, but it has a more \"enterprise open source\" feeling to it. Debian and Drupal can take advantage of it, but I don&#x27;t see myself hosting mini projects like my mini CSS library that is also used by three other strangers.Source Hut is really nice too. Admittedly I don&#x27;t like email based workflows, so I haven&#x27;t really thought about moving anything there.

I think Pierre is just framing things in terms of solving for teams that work with product + design + engineering to ship something to users that involves all of those parties, whereas GitHub has primarily catered to engineering.Today in software companies there is basically a gap where each discipline kinda prefers to work in it&#x27;s own software silo (eg. Asana &#x2F; Figma &#x2F; GitHub), but that doesn&#x27;t really make a lot of sense from a fundamental standpoint where all of those aspects of a team want to work very closely together. You end up kinda syncing a lot of info&#x2F;state across the silos, or via meetingss&#x2F;slack etc, so I think Pierre is trying to bring all that into one tool with some opinionated workflow.

Jaded people in tech like this I just try and avoid, especially when they come out against unalloyed good tech like containerization. Containers are just namespaces with additions. They&#x27;ve allowed us to narrow the gap of capability between the big three OSes, even if the other two need to virtualize Linux to do so.There&#x27;s also nothing wrong with LLMs. How you choose to integrate them into your life or forge is a choice but at the end of the day they&#x27;re just another tool in the toolbelt.

Though I’ve been a little discouraged by Gitea’s release of their own cloud hosting service.This blog post and the revenue growth at Gitlab over the last two quarters appear to be evidence of people wanting to moving away from GitHub (though their earnings report attribute the growth to other initiatives, clearly I had no real insight on this). As an extension of my self hosting of Mastodon efforts from last year I rolled up my other minor hosting efforts into https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hawt.cloud as a place to experiment with providing services like this.This all ties in with the “Open Web” or “Small Web” sentiments I’ve seen expressed recently.

    "originBody": "BY THE WAY Pilots hide mental health issues so they don’t ‘lose their wings’ Grounded pilots face lengthy waits and expensive evaluations to get back in the cockpit By Andrea Sachs Updated December 15, 2023 at 12:52 p.m. EST|Published December 15, 2023 at 6:00 a.m. EST (Photograph by Linnea Bullion for The Washington Post) Listen 15 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save The commercial airline pilot kept his condition a secret for years. He was supposed to inform the Federal Aviation Administration that he was seeing a therapist for anxiety and depression, but he couldn’t bring himself to share his despair. He was afraid of the repercussions. “I lied to the FAA about the treatment I was receiving because that would have opened a can of worms. I would have been grounded until I was better,” said the 31-year-old first officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his airline did not authorize him to talk with journalists. “It is very easy to just not tell them what’s going on.” The pilot continued working, but his symptoms worsened. During long stretches of depression, he ate little and was consumed by hopelessness. He could no longer conceal his mental health crisis from his employer or the FAA. He decided to ground himself. “I started to think I had two options: I either stop flying or I die,” he said. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement His story speaks to a larger problem in the profession: Many pilots would rather ignore or hide their mental health problems than disclose their condition and risk their livelihood. As a result, pilots who may be safety risks remain in the air while those who have admitted they need help face a costly, time-consuming and opaque process to meet the FAA’s standards for medical fitness. A recent incident in which an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot tried to take down a plane has pushed federal officials to address the flaws in their mental health system. The airline pilots and advocates interviewed for this report described a laborious series of medical evaluations that rely on paper documents sent through the mail and ask workers to submit to a maze of testing at their own expense. FAA officials acknowledged the system requires changes, several of which they have already begun to implement. “The FAA is committed to prioritizing the mental health of pilots and air traffic controllers,” the agency said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post. “The FAA has taken a number of recent steps to foster greater openness about mental health within the aviation community,” the statement added, referencing a recently announced rulemaking committee aimed at solving these issues. 5,000 pilots suspected of hiding major health issues. Most are still flying. In the case of the first officer, antidepressants helped lift the cloud of darkness. A year into seeking reinstatement from the FAA, he understands why many of his colleagues deny their problems, avoid medical care or self-medicate. “The system is so broken,” said the pilot, who has been living off disability provided by the airline. “The [aviation industry] doesn’t really want the stigma of pilots with mental health problems still flying. It’s a complicated thing to deal with in the public view, but it’s also a very outdated way of thinking.” Pilots experience pressures that are unique to their profession. They spend an inordinate amount of time away from home and their families. Their bodies live in a twilight of time zones. A healthy diet and consistent exercise can be elusive. And every six months or year, depending on their age and position, they must undergo a medical evaluation that can upend their career. Culture of silence and shame Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board held a full-day summit called “Navigating Mental Health in Aviation.” An employee remarked that he had never seen the agency’s auditorium so full. When it was Anne Suh’s turn at the microphone, she shared the story of her son, John Hauser, in a steady voice that belied her pain. On a Friday evening in October 2021, the 19-year-old student pilot at the University of North Dakota set off in a school plane to practice his aviation skills. About an hour after takeoff, his parents, who live in the Chicago area, started to receive alarming texts from John. He provided the tail number of his aircraft, said he loved them and bid them goodbye. The police discovered his crashed plane in a field in northeastern North Dakota. His parents, who are both medical practitioners, only learned of John’s mental health issues through the messages he left behind. Suh said he likely kept them private because he didn’t want to jeopardize his passion for flying or his future career as a pilot. During the summit, Suh read one of his notes aloud. “If there is anything you can do for me, get the FAA to change the rules on pilots seeking help with their mental health. I know it would change a lot of things for the better and it would help a lot of people out.” NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy had opened the day’s session with a critique of the aviation industry’s approach to mental health. She described it as punitive and shaming, and harmful not just to the pilot but to the whole sector. “The safety risk comes from a culture of silence around mental health,” she said. Penny Giovanetti, a top medical official at the FAA who attended the event, countered the criticism by sharing some recent developments. She said the understaffed agency has hired three psychiatrists — plus a neuropsychologist and two psychologists — to help chip away at the backlog of special issuance applications. According to the FAA, there were two psychiatrists on staff over the past three years to review applications. In May, the agency approved of a fifth selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a widely used type of antidepressant. Pilots who take one of these medications (but not plural) for depression can retain their medical certification, which was previously not the case. Giovanetti also told the board that she filled four pages with notes, which she intends to share with her FAA colleagues. How to become an air marshal, the most secretive job in the sky The pressures of being a pilot While pilots may face job-related consequences for divulging their medical histories, hiding their illnesses also carries risk. A spate of recent incidents has shone a harsh light on the industry’s culture of secrecy and evasion. “This population faces some really tremendous psychosocial stressors that are risk factors to depression,” said William Hoffman, a neurologist and affiliated assistant professor of aerospace aviation at the University of North Dakota. “Then you add in the health-care avoidance and the loss of certificate, and it really doubles down on them.” In October, an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot named Joseph David Emerson attempted to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Wash., to San Francisco. He later admitted to law enforcement officers that he suffered from untreated depression and had consumed psychedelic mushrooms in the days before boarding. Last week, an Oregon grand jury threw out the attempted murder charges against him for a lighter charge of recklessly endangering another person. During the same month as the Horizon flight, a grand jury in Utah indicted a former Delta pilot who threatened his co-pilot with a firearm last year. And this summer, a United Airlines pilot attacked a parking gate at Denver International Airport with an ax, causing $700 in damage, according to airport authorities. The day before the NTSB’s summit, the FAA announced the creation of the Mental Health and Aviation Medical Clearances Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC). The group of aviation and medical experts will focus on removing the hurdles deterring pilots from addressing their mental health issues. The committee will submit its recommendations by the end of March. “The Horizon pilot is very much a marker for us,” said Joseph LoRusso, a lawyer who helps pilots navigate the medical certification maze. “He forced [the FAA] to put this roundtable together sooner than it probably would have otherwise.” Share this article Share Public breakdowns among pilots are rare, and accidents caused by suicidal pilots are even less common. However, with more than 1 out of 5 adults suffering from a mental health issue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, medical and aviation experts estimate that hundreds of pilots could be silently suffering from depression, anxiety or other similar illnesses. In many cases, we don’t learn about their struggles until it’s too late. In 2013, a Southwest pilot named James Drain started to show signs of depression; he later attempted suicide but survived. After completing treatment, he focused all of his energies on regaining his medical certification. He saw FAA-required specialists, including a forensic psychologist who charged several thousands of dollars, and spent hours completing equally expensive cognitive tests. He submitted his thick docket of documents by mail and patiently waited for a response. “He didn’t fly for two years and yet he was jumping through every hoop the FAA was putting in front of him,” Jaime Drain, his widow, said from her home in Minnesota. “They would say, ‘You need to do this and now you need to do this and this and this and this,’ and he was doing it.” In 2015, a 27-year-old co-pilot who had received treatment for suicidal tendencies crashed a Germanwings plane into the French Alps, killing nearly 150 passengers and crew members. Black-box recordings revealed that he had deliberately crashed the plane, a French prosecutor said. Drain, a former flight attendant, said her husband sensed his career went down with that plane. “Shortly after that he got his answer from the FAA, and they denied him his license,” Drain said. “On May 21st, 2015, I was out on a trip. He went to a hotel room and he took his life. If he’d been able to get the proper help and do it openly, I honestly believe he’d be here with me today.” Advertisement Story continues below advertisement The long, expensive path to FAA clearance The FAA relies on pilots to self-report any physical or mental issues on their certification form, which an aviation medical examiner will consider when determining whether to pass, deny or defer an application. In addition to answering four questions about mental health, the pilots must list all of the medications they take as well as any physicians they have seen in the last three years. One exception is family counseling, because the therapy involves more than just the individual pilot. LoRusso, the lawyer, said aviators are fully aware of the consequences of lying on the form. The criminal offense is punishable by up to five years in jail and $250,000 in fines. Therefore, many pilots fill out the form truthfully, but at a cost to their health. “We know there’s a bunch of clinical science and data that says that if we can address anxiety and depression first, it won’t build into something more chronic,” he said. “But pilots aren’t willing to get that treatment, because now they’re not lying.” Hoffman leads studies on this aversion to seeking help. In an April 2022 survey of more than 3,700 pilots, 56 percent of respondents said they avoided health care for fear of “losing their wings.” In addition, nearly 46 percent sought “informal” (undocumented or underground) medical care, and almost 27 percent of participants misrepresented or concealed information on the questionnaire. In research released this October, he reported similar findings in a larger sample group that included Canadian pilots. The median annual pay for airline pilots, co-pilots and flight engineers was $211,790 in May 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For these highly paid professionals, being transparent about a mental illness can mean foregoing their salary — and losing a sense of purpose — for an indefinite period. “How bad does your mild anxiety need to be ... to warrant stepping away from flying for months or potentially years to get care?” Hoffman asked. “For many pilots, their mild anxiety needs to be pretty darn bad to do that.” The FAA has a list of ailments and illnesses that typically result in a denial or deferral of a medical certificate, such as bipolar disorder, psychosis, substance dependence or abuse, and a severe case of personality disorder. Aviation medical examiners can reach the same conclusion for milder cases of mental illness. To reverse the denial or deferral, the pilot must complete a series of exams, assessments and treatments mandated by the FAA. The young first officer who was prescribed Lexapro for his anxiety and depression said he spent $1,700 on a neuropsychological evaluation, participated in computer brain tests, submitted to a personality appraisal and met with a psychiatrist trained in HIMS, a substance abuse treatment program for aviators. After a final session with a medical examiner, pilots can reapply for certification. The FAA said it receives an average of 1,800 applications a day and approves 96 percent of the submissions that were flagged for closer consideration. The process can take six months or several years because of the multiple steps the pilots must follow to assure the FAA of their recovery and fitness to fly. The first officer who suffered from depression and anxiety submitted his paperwork by mail in September. Two months later, he experienced a setback when the agency informed him that he was missing a document. “Now that has to be forwarded from my doctor to the FAA, and it starts the whole process all over again,” he said. Think you can land a plane? We put average people to the test. A push to remove the stigma Because of the stigma attached to mental health problems, pilots are typically reticent about sharing their struggles with colleagues or a wider audience. The major airlines tightly manage their company’s narratives; United denied a request from The Washington Post to interview a pilot who had recovered from alcohol abuse. However, several platforms have emerged that provide aviators with a safe space where they can speak candidly. Many airlines and unions such as the Air Line Pilots Association provide peer-to-peer counseling and support groups. John Hauser’s family created a fund that champions similar initiatives for aviation students, such as the UpLift Peer Support Program and the Green Bandana Project; the swatch of fabric worn by trained students is code for “I’m here to help.” Emma Laczko, a pilot who created the aeromedical reform petition, and Maddie Miller, an aviation wellness expert and former airline employee, host “The Pilots Pandemic” podcast. Since 2021, the pair have worked to expose cracks in the FAA’s mental health system. They interview a wide spectrum of experts, including pilots who have firsthand experience with the medical certification process, widows of pilots who died by suicide, medical experts and activists. Laczko, whose late father and uncle were pilots who struggled under the FAA’s medical reporting system, said the podcast is approaching 100 episodes. “It really starts with breaking the silence,” she said. On the podcast, the hosts and guests decry the obstacles that discourage pilots from seeking help or staying the course to reinstatement. “We have many aviators who have sent in a test and then had to redo the test, because by the time the FAA looked at it, it was already past the due date,” she said. “So then they’re required to go back and get another test and pay again out of pocket for that test and resubmit to the FAA.” Over the past year, the FAA has made incremental changes to its medical certification process. The agency is working on shortening the wait time for certification decisions to 60 days or less. In April, it introduced a new digital system that allows medical examiners to upload supporting materials directly to the FAA instead of relying on standard mail. “The agency expects this capability will help our physicians manage the volume of cases more efficiently while also providing greater transparency for the applicants,” an FAA spokesman said by email. Advocates for pilots — lawyers, physicians, union leaders and bereft loved ones, among others — commend the FAA on making inroads but are pushing for more changes. Among their many goals, they want the FAA to stop lumping all mental health illnesses into one category and create a recovery program that recognizes the individuality of each case. They also argue that while the FAA is reviewing a pilot’s medical certification application, they should be able to fly under supervision instead of being grounded for months or years. Most importantly, advocates want the aviation industry’s perception of mental health to evolve. They say anxiety, depression and other mental health illnesses should be judged on equal terms with, say, high blood pressure and peptic ulcers. “This is like pushing a really heavy boulder up a hill, but we’re heading in the right direction,” Drain said.

Talking with other pilots and students, asking a lot of questions.They are starting to reduce some of the strict requirements and encumbrances placed on Pilots such as this because of the shortages.I&#x27;m in the unfortunate position of having a DWI from 2009 and have been told by multiple people in the industry that would hinder my career prospects as a pilot. Essentially, I&#x27;ve got no shot at getting hired by American or any other major airline because of something stupid I did when I was in college 14 years ago.I don&#x27;t have a drinking problem and am a completely different person. It sucks. reply askonomm 5 hours agoparentI never understood why in some countries the system never forgets - it&#x27;s like they want to punish you till death, even after you already served your sentence.In Estonia, no matter how horrific the crime, your record gets wiped after 7 years since you finished serving the sentence (got out of prison &#x2F; probation ended &#x2F; paid a fine), allowing for people to move on with their lives. reply Gustomaximus 3 hours agorootparentI like the idea of this but wonder if a better system would be record gets wiped after 7 clear years.So if someone is committing crimes every 3 or 4 years, the previous records show to reflect ongoing behaviour type, but if you have 7 &#x27;clear&#x27; years then all is wiped. reply stavros 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s 7 years after the punishment ends, which, yeah, if it&#x27;s been 10-15 years since you&#x27;ve committed a crime, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ve somehow been biding your time, waiting to commit the next one. reply poizan42 1 hour agorootparentprevHere in Denmark criminal records becomes inaccessible to non-government actors 2-5 years after sentence served, depending on the severity of the crime, and 10 years for the government&#x2F;public sector. In theory it&#x27;s never wiped and keeps being accessible to the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, so it may still affect your ability to get a security clearance.There is the caveat though that names are allowed to be published in some cases of more severe crime, so in cases like murder an employer might still be able to find out about it with a google search. reply gosub100 5 hours agorootparentprevBecause it would damage the reputation of the airline if, in a future incident, the media reports that \"and record show he had a previous arrest for DWI\". The media would spin it to look like the airline took the risk. I&#x27;m not defending that take, just explaining it. reply kccqzy 4 hours agorootparentThe key point is to expunge these old criminal records so no one could find them. Not the media, not a future employer. reply instaheat 4 hours agorootparentRight.

When those are won they will stop. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentSo newspapers will be afraid to report on things like that even when it clearly is in the in interest of the society for them to do that?Criminal records don’t exist just to punish people and penalize them for the rest of their lives but also to inform other what those people are capable of. Expungement should only be possible for non-serious crimes and&#x2F;or on a case by case basis reply alvah 4 hours agorootparentprevThe internet never forgets though. You&#x27;d have quite a job deleting all the old reports in the media. reply askonomm 4 hours agorootparentI mentioned in another comment here, but if you are in EU, the \"right to be forgotten\" makes it quite easy to remove results you do not like about yourself from search engines. Google for example provides a simple form to fill out, and from what i recall in about a month or so those links are gone from results. reply phanimahesh 3 hours agorootparentprevUnderstandable, but this is precisely why teenage antics should not leave permanent records for anyone to exploit. reply cinntaile 2 hours agorootparentThere is too much tolerance for dui&#x2F;dwi in the world.

I&#x27;m just saying. reply refurb 4 hours agorootparentprevEven the courts? If someone is convicted of murder, serves their sentence then 8 years later they do it again, do the courts know of the previous crime? reply askonomm 4 hours agorootparentYes, the courts will know (and possibly also police, I&#x27;m not sure). However anyone else will get back a criminal record report that&#x27;s empty. Like if you need to provide a criminal record for visa purposes, or when an employer requests one, or if a bank wants to decide whether or not to give you mortgage. So it&#x27;s not that your status as a human being in the eyes of the law are reset, it&#x27;s that for the purposes of opportunities given to you, you are equal to everyone else. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentWhat about child abusers? People convicted of fraud or other types of corruption? etc. Basically people that never should never be allowed to do certain types of work because it wouldn’t be in the public interest? reply askonomm 40 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure, actually. The law doesn&#x27;t seem to specify, although it does say exceptions can be made, so I figure that&#x27;s what happens. Estonia has also been known to deport its own citizens when they truly are a menace to our society. reply globular-toast 1 hour agorootparentprevOr perhaps it&#x27;s not about punishment but about protecting the public from potentially irresponsible people. Driving and piloting a plane should be considered privileges that come after training and demonstration of ability and understanding of responsibility. These aren&#x27;t things that should be rights and considered a punishment to take away. reply FpUser 4 hours agorootparentprevSuddenly I love Estonia. In North America punishment lasts until on dies. reply Arnt 3 hours agorootparentWe have this in Norway as well. The chief of police explained it when someone wanted to change it: \"We have a tradition here that the court sentences you, and that&#x27;s it. When you&#x27;re done with the court&#x27;s sentence, you&#x27;ve paid your dues to society.\" It&#x27;s a good thing.And that&#x27;s also why the newspapers will generally write that \"a 27-year old from X\" did this and that instead of using a full name. People widely known for a crime by their full name can apply to change their name at some point. reply btilly 3 hours agoparentprevIt could be worse.An estimated 1&#x2F;4 of all registered sex offenders were minors at the time that they became offenders. The single year of your life when you&#x27;re most likely to become one is 14.There are a lot of horror stories like a guy whose 13 year old girlfriend send him a nude photo, her parents found out and reported it, and now he can&#x27;t live within a certain distance of an elementary school for the rest of his life.Yeah, if a 24 year old man has pictures of a 13 year old, that&#x27;s a problem. But a 14 year old boy having pictures of a 13 year old girl?As a society, we really don&#x27;t believe in forgiveness. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentThe issue here is not the registered offenders list but that things like this are considered crimes and somebody could be convicted for them.It’s not about forgiveness, it’s about minimizing future harm. If you are an actual (and there should be a sufficiently high bar for that) convicted child abuser you should never be allowed to be employed in any job which allows you to have authority over children etc. in such cases “forgiveness” would certainly be against the public interest. reply yeowMeng 5 hours agoparentprevNot sure this will be helpful but here goes.I wanted to be a pilot but am tall (> 6 feet) and poor eye sight ( In many airplanes, there are legitimate restrictions on how tall you can be as a pilot -- there simply isn&#x27;t enough room up there for taller pilots to fit.Right, but they were designed that way. It was likely known at design time that there was a maximum height.Standard bathroom stalls won&#x27;t fit wheelchairs, but that doesn&#x27;t absolve companies from a duty to provide ones that are.There are obviously different physical constraints here than bathrooms, but I&#x27;d be surprised if there was a physical constraint limiting this.As for the eyesight, this strikes me as the kind of things copilots and backup glasses are for. Require every pilot with glasses to carry a backup pair in their shirt pocket. Or maybe contacts in and a pair of glasses (turbulence may be an issue with glasses).I&#x27;d be curious if they&#x27;re equally cautious with people who are diabetic or have cardiac risk factors. reply genocidicbunny 3 hours agorootparent> Right, but they were designed that way. It was likely known at design time that there was a maximum height.Airplane cockpits aren&#x27;t built the way they are for shiggles. Pilots need to be able to reach controls, and if you design a cockpit for fitting people over 6ft tall, it might become unergonomic, if not downright dangerous for shorter pilots. There are actual safety issues at play here.Similar for eyesight -- yes they can carry a backup, until they forget it. The safest thing is to require pilots to have adequate uncorrected vision, though some are loosening that to allow lenses. Do you want to fly on an airplane where there&#x27;s a nonzero chance the pilot is effectively incapacitated because he forgot his glasses?> I&#x27;d be curious if they&#x27;re equally cautious with people who are diabetic or have cardiac risk factors.To different degrees, but yes, they are. Some airlines will require their pilots to get regular medical checkups. reply ffgjgf1 53 minutes agorootparentprev> As for the eyesight, this strikes me as the kind of things copilots and backup glasses are for.Why take any unnecessary risks at all? If you can’t have your eyesight repaired surgical well… tough luck there are many other careers you can pursue.> they&#x27;re equally cautious with people who are diabetic or have cardiac risk factorsYes of course they are. Which again seems perfectly reasonable reply jacinda 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know about Type II but Type I can be extremely limiting. A friend&#x27;s spouse was diagnosed somewhere between 9 and 12 and it completely ended their dream of becoming a military aviator (also hoped to be an astronaut).They now work at NASA but have had to fight tooth and nail to go on longer expeditions related to search and rescue and it&#x27;s really only the advent of CGM that have made it possible, to be honest.Found this as well after a quick Google search; the first medical approval of someone with Type 1 Diabetes by the FAA was 2020: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beyondtype1.org&#x2F;commercial-pilot-diabetes&#x2F; reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprev> there simply isn&#x27;t enough room up there for taller pilots to fit.Under the ADA \"there simply isn&#x27;t a wheelchair ramp up to our building\" isn&#x27;t a legitimate restriction on hiring someone who uses a wheelchair—you put a wheelchair ramp in.OP&#x27;s point is that arguably the same should apply to other traits like height. The space constraints are somewhat arbitrary and could be remedied. reply genocidicbunny 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not correct. The ADA requires reasonable accommodation, not accommodation at all costs. So yes, \"there simply isn&#x27;t a wheelchair ramp up to our building\" is not legitimate, but \"there simply isn&#x27;t a wheelchair ramp up to our building and it would be prohibitively expensive or impossible to change that\" does work. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentBut if you keep getting new buildings made for you where it would be straightforward to build in but prohibitively expensive after the fact... reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentThe ADA doesn&#x27;t allow new buildings to not comply, unless the job itself couldn&#x27;t be done. Thus the roof can be not accessable, but only maintanence goes there and job has many parts that cannot be done in a wheelchair reply genocidicbunny 3 hours agorootparentprevWhich is irrelevant to the discussion for the most part. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t seem irrelevant to me. It means there&#x27;s a broken system and the regulations aren&#x27;t hitting the right spot. Responsibility is being split in a way that allows the accomodation to never happen. reply genocidicbunny 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s irrelevant because it has no relation to what ADA says about accommodations being made. Even if the ADA proscribed that new constructions had to have reasonable accommodations, it wouldn&#x27;t really change anything about the fact that the ADA doesn&#x27;t mandate accommodations in all circumstances, reasonable or not. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentFailures of the ADA model aren&#x27;t relevant to the ADA?? reply genocidicbunny 3 hours agorootparentPlease explain how the fact that the ADA only requires reasonable accommodations is a failure of the ADA model? It&#x27;s just a model. You&#x27;re talking about it&#x27;s implementation and practice in the world, I am just correcting a common misconception about what the ADA actually requires as it currently exists. reply Dylan16807 2 hours agorootparentThe failure is that the accomodations would be reasonable, but the disconnect between builder and buyer lets the bad design get solidified.And someone else already replied saying the ADA forces new buildings to comply. So if we did that with planes in this comparison, new models would fit more people out of the factory. Would have done so for decades. reply genocidicbunny 36 minutes agorootparent> the ADA forces new buildings to complyAgain, if reasonable to comply. Say I am building a new building on steep terrain where in order to get a compliant wheelchair ramp in with the maximum allowed grade that it can be, and all the appropriate flat spots for it. Let&#x27;s say that wheelchair ramp would occupy 3&#x2F;4ths of the whole property, making it impossible to build a code-compliant building on that property. The only alternative would be to purchase adjacent property but the owners refuse to sell. It can then be argued that making the new building wheelchair accessible is impossible without undue burden on the owner of the property.In fact, this sort of thing is _explicitly_ called out in 28 CFR 35.151:\"(i) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\"You also only need to provide accommodations for places the public accesses. A mechanical walkway that is only used by maintenance workers, for example, need not be accessible. Incidentally, airplane cockpits are pretty much a textbook example of &#x27;not public space&#x27; and thus are also not subject to accessibility requirements.Point is, the ADA is not as black and white as many perceive it to be. Dylan16807 4 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not a legitimate reason for airlines. They keep ordering cockpits without an extra couple inches on purpose.And there&#x27;s a ton of ways a pilot can become incapacitated. Having an extra pair of glasses is one of the easiest mitigations around, if the odds are actually that bad. reply kortilla 4 hours agorootparentThey don’t order cockpits. That’s not how the industry works.It’s also not about “enough space” in the entire cockpit, it’s about the layouts of all of the controls and being able to reach them.“Extra pair of glasses” is not a solution in severe turbulence where the plane drops 100ft in 1 second. reply Dylan16807 4 hours agorootparentPlanes can be customized, and the baseline design is based on what the majority of airlines want.It&#x27;s the fault of airlines. Nitpicking is fine if you want to add more details but doesn&#x27;t change that.And taller people on average can reach more controls, not less.For glasses, how often does that make them come off compared to any other random reason for incapacitation? And what if there&#x27;s a strap trying to keep them on? Acting like this is the only risk factor in isolation is bad. reply mlyle 3 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s plenty of scope for customization, but generally not in changing the shape of the cockpit.Airliners are good at fitting 99%+ of the population well. But, in the end, airliner cockpits have switches and indicators up \"high\" and stuff down low that has to be easily within reach, but also not crowd your movement. There&#x27;s a lot of adjustability, but adjustability (seat rails, etc) has been causes of accidents.If you&#x27;re within 5&#x27;2 to 6&#x27;3, odds are you can easily clamber in, fit, reach all the controls. That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s required. Even if you&#x27;re outside of that range it might be OK (there is a 4&#x27;11 787 captain out there...)As to glasses, there&#x27;s no problem with having poor vision if it can be corrected with lenses. Aviation is not perfectly inclusive or accommodating of every disability, but it&#x27;s not needlessly restrictive, either. reply hsbauauvhabzb 4 hours agorootparentprevJust because it was built that way doesn’t mean it’s not discriminatory. An aircraft being half a foot larger wouldn’t have been a big deal if they were built to accomodate tall people in the first place. 6’2 is not an uncommon height. reply schmidp 3 hours agorootparentI am 6’4 and I am baffled by that argument. Not being “discriminatory” against pilot height is not the most important design choice in an airplane. What about a 7 feet tall person? Would it also be “discriminatory” if they can’t be a pilot? reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentHow difficult is an extra foot? People only get so tall.But there is a pretty big difference between accommodating 93 percentile for men and 99.96 percentile, and that&#x27;s only 5 inches in height between 6&#x27;1\" and 6&#x27;6\". reply dividedbyzero 3 hours agorootparentI think if you&#x27;re in the 99.96 percentile for low height in women, that additional foot would be pretty difficult.

But it&#x27;s not a competition. You don&#x27;t need to put controls further apart to allow a taller person to fit, you can make it happen with chair adjustments. reply ffgjgf1 44 minutes agorootparent> need to put controls further apart to allow a tallerYou know that how exactly?Maybe that the case but if it’s not maximizing safety and minimizing failure risk (so by extension any unnecessary complexity) should be prioritized over any accessibility concerns under any circumstances replygenocidicbunny 3 hours agorootparentprevHalf a foot larger in what way? Length won&#x27;t help much. Height? Then you&#x27;re adding _a lot_ of additional weight because you have to increase the radius of the fuselage. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentBig commercial planes do not have their radius defined by the seats and controls in the cockpit.

If someone with a documented mental health condition crashes a plane, blame goes to all parties who know of the pilots status.If you don’t have that information in the first place it’s ‘tragic’ and ‘unavoidable’.Maybe it’s time we as a society start understanding risk, because while the information will certainly be ‘in-your-face’ in the event of such an incident, the rate of incidents in total would go down. reply AlecSchueler 4 hours agoparentThe goal isn&#x27;t to minimise the number of incidents, it&#x27;s too minimise insurance premiums. reply irjustin 6 hours agoprevThis is terrible for everyone involved.I have zero idea what the solution is.[Edit]After a little thought, honestly, automate the whole thing.

The latter is being already discussed anyway.A lot of recent developments made things possible that were previously outrageous. Pilots will be reduced to mere backup, and eventually completely replaced by autonomous systems, just like the train engineers do nowadays, with the only pilots working remotely in command centers ready to take over if needed.If we can do remote surgeries using robots, there’s no reason this couldn’t be a thing. reply can16358p 5 hours agorootparent> Have planes equipped with remote control that can override pilots in extreme situations.TBH that would cause way many problems than it potentially could solve, not even mentioning the technical difficulties to implement.Though I agree with the rest, there should be a solution. reply Matheus28 5 hours agorootparentprevHave you used airplane internet?

I talk about the documented history of innocent people being convicted of a crimes, but there are many guilty offenders. I want prison conditions to be better, and I use it as an example of \"if you care about human rights, you care about them for everyone. Even convicted rapists and murderers.\" Sometimes I go off on another tangent because we should care about rights for immigrants as well. :) Then I lead into a 2nd bit where I say, \"There are many pedophiles out there. People who have the tendencies, and people who have acted. We know that women who are pedophiles go under or un-reported.\" To treat some of this, we need mental health facilities available even for people we find disgusting and monstrous. We need a safe environment where they can go in anonymously and seek help. It may prevent someone who is just thinking about children from touching a child. Most people would rather just execute a SUSPECTED pedophile. That&#x27;s how you get someone to hate themselves and the world and children and act on their impulses. Make the stigma and the reality for them worse. We love doing it in prisons. We love making prisoners suffer as a society.So to draw the awful parallel: We need mental health facilities available for pilots with no ability to report-out on how many are effected. We need to ensure anonymity, and provide resources with no idea of how well they may be helping someone on the edge. Maybe loose&#x2F;aggregate data points can be reported, but my strongest emphasis would be on providing anonymous support that is always and frequently available.If you care about pilots and the passengers they ensure safety for, you need to extend the resources with no indication of how effective that is. You want them to receive care&#x2F;treatment, for what very well could be a moments&#x27; ailment. If there is a long-term issue, it may help them with coping strategies. The alternative is letting it go untreated, and putting others at risk. reply dhsysusbsjsi 5 hours agoparentprevEasy - make mental health non-reportable to the aviation authorities.

If the concern is pilots are not being honest to save their jobs - it seems like they would still not be honest to a therapist if they were considering self harm. I&#x27;m sure it would just take one story of a therapist being overly cautious and reporting someone having benign issues for it to convince pilots not to talk to therapists.It would solve the problem of \"pilot needs someone to talk to about their issues with their wife\", which is nice.

That&#x27;s you, your family, and anyone else who depends on your income.The perception of this solution is still the same as the current one - I can be grounded.Initially it might work, but once that first guy gets grounded via the program (or maybe a few), word gets out that&#x27;s what this system ends up doing - you&#x27;re right back here wondering what the solution was that was so easy. reply shiroiuma 4 hours agorootparentI have a solution: pass a law that if any pilot gets grounded for mental health issues, then the airline industry (as a whole, in case his airline goes belly-up) has to continue to pay that pilot&#x27;s salary until he retires. reply irjustin 3 hours agorootparentThis protects the pilot pretty well, but this leaves the airline open to some pretty crazy fraud, no? reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t this how it&#x27;s handled in other countries when someone can&#x27;t work due to medical issues?
