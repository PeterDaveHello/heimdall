On Friday, the city placed electric road signs in two places to warn road users if their vehicles are too loud. The warnings will eventually be replaced by “noise cameras,” which, like speed cameras, automatically send a fine to the offending driver, Parool reports. The test with the noise signs will start at the Stadhouderskade in the city center and Molenaarsweg in Amsterdam-Noord. The installation consists of a noise meter and a screen a little further on. If the meter registers too much noise, the driver will see the message “Te luid” - “Too loud” in Dutch. Later this month, more sound meters and signs will be installed on Europaboulevard in Zuid and on Tussen Meer in Nieuw-West. The municipality hopes that the signs alone will already alert road users to the noise their vehicles make and prompt them to do something about it, a spokesperson told Parool. Rotterdam is conducting a similar experiment in collaboration with Amsterdam. It is part of a broader approach, the municipality of Amsterdam spokesperson said. “Other measures we are taking include a simpler way of enforcement and a feasibility study by TNO into the application of the noise camera. We try to reduce noise nuisance in various ways.” The noise camera consists of a box containing four microphones that can detect precisely where a sound is coming from. The box is connected to a regular speed camera, which takes a photo of the license plate to issue a fine. If the data from the current experiment proves reliable, Amsterdam and other large cities will ask the Cabinet to have the technology certified.

There are so many cars modified to have explosive sounding exhausts it&#x27;s unreal. I get woken up regularly in the night when they drive them around at 2AM making a lot of noise. I still don&#x27;t get why anyone would want to drive around sounding like that. There is no reason other than you want to look like a complete wanker and at that point society should crush your car to a fucking cube instantly.Edit: turns out we do have them and they have been fining people. But it&#x27;s mostly supercars. The problem is with shitty little cars with stupid exhausts which outnumber the supercars by at least two orders of magnitude. reply anigbrowl 18 hours agoparentI still don&#x27;t get why anyone would want to drive around sounding like that.Evidence from game behavior suggests ~30% of people are willing to experience some cost to themselves in order to inflict a greater one on other people. People like this don&#x27;t feel they are winning unless someone else is losing. If true, this explains a great deal.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.science.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;sciadv.1600451 - see figure 3 if you want to get right to it. reply nerdponx 18 hours agorootparentOutright malice probably only explains a small fraction of it. Partly it&#x27;s just fun to make a lot of noise, and if you have little&#x2F;no respect for other people then why not? reply anigbrowl 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the same mentality at work in either case, just diffuse rather than targeted. reply BoorishBears 16 hours agorootparentprevA less malicious part of it also arises from the fact that the cheaper the modification, the worse it sounds.You can make a car sound excellent with no drone with a $5,000 factory quality upgrade... or you can pay some bozo $100 to cut out your muffler and weld in a straight line pipe.That may not entitle them, but it represents how people might make this choice without intentionally being a nuance in mind reply Fatnino 45 minutes agorootparentI have a 23 year old civic with little to no rust (yay California) except for a huge rust hole on the exhaust just before the muffler. So the modification is free!I was looking into some kind of fix to wrap around the pipe but instead I had a very good deal on a 13 year old prius fall in my lap so now the civic is parked up while I decide what to do with it. reply navhc 16 hours agorootparentprevSo don&#x27;t make the modifications at all if it&#x27;s going to make it a nuisance? reply petesergeant 16 hours agorootparentprevNo no, cars and bikes leave the factory quiet. You have to expend time and money to Alex them noisy reply BoorishBears 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not true, there are cars that can break noise regulations stock, even mass production models: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;stock-hyundai-elantra-n-fails-...The key difference is even loud factory exhaust setups leave room for relatively quiet operation depending on how you drive.That Elantra driver was an idiot: he went in a town and drove in sport mode and drove in a way that forces extra loud popsIf he hadn&#x27;t been forcing it the car was perfectly capable of not making excessive noise.—The $100 bozo special on the other hand has none of that: it&#x27;s always loud and obnoxious.In fact it gets more obnoxious at cruising RPM because of drone.There are aftermarket exhausts that try to match the factory-style \"not loud by default\", but they&#x27;re expensive because it takes careful engineering and integrating things like valves and Helmholtz resonators. reply maeil 4 hours agorootparentprevThis does not explain it, qnd trying to do so through biology is the wrong angle.This issue is purely a cultural one, not a biological one, but this is not popular to investigate because 1. it&#x27;s considered impossible to solve and 2. brings up difficult questions regarding cultural relativity that aren&#x27;t appreciated in the modern academic Anglosphere.I&#x27;m continuously surprised that even on HN this comes up so often. A phenomenon is presented which is orders of magnitude more common in one culture than another, yet what is reached for is a biological, tech, or otherwise \"hard science\" explanation.In this case, the phenomenon is one of publically inflicting harm on others at a cost and no gain to themselves.I guess it has to do with the community (understandably!) having a strong tendency to approach everything from a STEM PoV when it comes to all but a small number of (mostly US-specific, policy or economic) topics.Just to prevent misunderstandings here, culture here doesn&#x27;t mean the culture of a nation but of (much smaller) communities, in 2023. reply xbar 13 hours agorootparentprevThat is a good study, and it does explain one of the behaviors.But do not discount the importance of powerlessness in these behaviors. People who have relatively less power in their work, their surroundings, their relationships, there ability to influence their own econonmic situation, etc, still need a way to express power. It is easy to couch it merely in terms of winning&#x2F;losing in the moment, but without context it is hard to see what the right solution is.If it is merely winning&#x2F;losing&#x2F;greater cost, with no particular motivation, then banning any particular annoying activity is as good a regulation as any other.But when you take away a dimension of power over an area that a person strongly associates with \"basic freedoms\" such as owning a camaro&#x2F;civic&#x2F;harley&#x2F;gixxer and tuning it to their liking, including making it incredibly and illegally loud, you are making a more fundamental policy decision than you might realize.My take is that these make for bad county&#x2F;state&#x2F;federal laws. They are fine for city laws that are associated with modest fines, because that is the kind of law that continues to enable some expression of control and personal power-- an important part of dignity.They annoy me. The people and their exhausts branded \"Neighbor Haters.\" But so do the pedestrians who choose to enter the intersection when the red hand is up and the countdown timer is at 3 seconds, and they feign feebleness in order to take nearly a minute to cross the street while 500 people in gridlock wait in all directions. But I see it for what it is and choose to respect their dignity, probably when they need it most. reply mmastrac 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is an extremely depressing statistic to read. I hope that it&#x27;s something we can modify culturally rather than being a hard-wired part of our brains. reply anigbrowl 10 hours agorootparentTroublingly, the study suggests otherwise, noting that consistent preferences seem to be established by age 6 (and citing some other research documenting as such). While it&#x27;s not definitive or replicated, I do find the large n, multinational sampling, and experimental elegance of this own persuasive; it&#x27;s had a significant effect on my worldview. reply gremlinunderway 9 hours agorootparentprevapplying game theory to these kinds of social situation are really not all that interesting or really reusable in a real-world setting.\"In a perfectly predictable and rational world filled with rational actors, here is what would happen!\".Except people aren&#x27;t rational actors, they don&#x27;t have all information available to them, and there aren&#x27;t any \"rules of the game\" in real life. reply masklinn 21 hours agoparentprevMotorcycles too. Around here idiots revving and redlining their engine is a relatively regular occurrence. Much more so than cars, although that also happens from time to time. reply 0xEF 21 hours agorootparentI live in a motorcycle-heavy US town (blue collar, lots of guys who wish they were 1%ers - the biker outlaw variety, not the rich people variety). It sounds like a warzone during shift change around the industrial districts.Having been neighbors with a lot of these guys, it has been repeatedly explained to me that theh make their bikes louder to be heard for safety. The assumption here is car drivers are so engaged with their music&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;whatever turned up that they don&#x27;t pay attention to the traffic around them. They also tend to not look when switching lanes or, gods forbid, use their turn signal to show intent.While this sounds like a reasonable argument, I think it&#x27;s a load of bullpucky. Motorcycles are loud by default, and using aftermarket parts to make them louder is just part of the self-affirming statement of ego. These guys need you to know how big and bad they believe themselves to be that they&#x27;ll make other sacrifices in their lives to afford projecting that image.It&#x27;s really all very silly, to be honest. reply vladvasiliu 21 hours agorootparentAs a motorcyclist, if I had a penny for every time I&#x27;ve heard the \"loud pipes save lives\" mantra, I&#x27;d be a millionaire.It always felt like \"a load of bullpucky\", but the defining moment for me was one day riding down a quietish-street with a legal-but-still-obnoxious Akrapovic pipe. In front of me were two or three girls walking in the middle of the road, talking. They only realized I was there when I sounded the horn and seemed really surprised, judging by their jumpiness.If someone walking in front of the bike can&#x27;t hear that noise, I really don&#x27;t see how someone inside a sound-insulated box, in a generally noisy environment, probably blasting the radio, is going to notice the loud pipe. reply pdimitar 20 hours agorootparentMost people are either blissfully unaware of their surroundings regardless of the noises or they just tuned out said noises because there are so many of them.This is not an argument for noisier exhausts. It&#x27;s an argument to reduce noise in general, from all sources. Then people will react better to the louder noises. reply LispSporks22 18 hours agorootparent> Most people are either blissfully unaware of their surroundingsMaybe it’s my morbid search history, but I still look on in awe as people cross the intersection in front of me while deep on their phones. They don’t look up to check at all - not even at the start! reply pdimitar 17 hours agorootparentYeah same, it boggles my mind. I&#x27;m scared for my life of busy intersections, many drivers get impatient to the point of seemingly not caring if they&#x27;ll kill you. I never ever look at my phone while on the move. reply junaru 19 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, ban headphones while walking down the street! reply OscarTheGrinch 19 hours agorootparentPlease turn your vehicle in to the authorities to be cubed immediately. reply ghaff 17 hours agorootparentprevI know you&#x27;re being facetious and it would obviously be silly to ban them. That said wearing headphones&#x2F;earphones while walking around a city, for me, would reduce my situational awareness to a degree I would absolutely not be comfortable with. I know plenty of people are comfortable doing so but, while drivers and road design almost certainly bear the lion&#x27;s share of the blame for pedestrian injuries and fatalities, distracted pedestrians don&#x27;t help themselves. (Just the other week, I saw a person come super-close to getting hit in a parking lot as they were obliviously walking across the traffic lane buried deep in their phone.) reply goodcanadian 15 hours agorootparentI once saw a pedestrian step out in front a speeding police car with lights and siren . . . I guess because the walk light turned green? The police car had to slam on its brakes and honk before the idiot noticed it. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah that is dumb, I agree. It&#x27;s asking to be hit on the roads. reply abeppu 17 hours agorootparentprevI still think it&#x27;s \"bullpucky\" and two or three clueless pedestrians don&#x27;t demonstrate anything.When living in a neighborhood where almost all of the houses were old and poorly insulated, the motorcycles which went up and down our street were loud enough that indoors, with the windows closed, we would have to stop conversations, pause tv shows, etc, and wait for them to pass, because one simply couldn&#x27;t hear anything over them. This is a densely populated neighborhood; 4-8 apartments per building tens of buildings per side per block, so interrupting hundreds of people per block, and many thousands in the course of a ride seems a reasonable estimate. The motorcyclists would joyride in loops, so you would hear them multiple times, being disrupted each time. I think for this reason the disruption caused per ride is comparable to a streaker on the field of a major sports event that forces game play to be paused. For someone who disrupts whole neighborhoods in this way, on regular basis, to say it&#x27;s \"for safety\" seems like a narcissistic delusion. If I drive a car on the highway, and there are large trucks with big blindspots and drivers who I know are struggling after having been at it for 12h, should I have a siren to make sure they know I&#x27;m there?I must hasten to add that cyclists and pedestrians also have to deal with drivers in massive metal deathboxes, and we do it without disrupting the whole world around us. reply lotsofpulp 20 hours agorootparentprevOr if they were like me, they were trying to ignore the loud sound damaging their ears that 99.999% is a vehicle nowhere near them. reply pharmakom 18 hours agorootparentprevIf the only way for a vehicle to be operated safely is for it to be incredibly loud, then how about we ban them from urban areas or perhaps in general? reply avidiax 16 hours agorootparentDoing dangerous stuff is cool. All the coolest bikers stealth their bikes. Put on extra silent exhausts. Dress in all black. Dim their lights. Hide in the blind spots of other cars.Hire some people to put that on TikTok, and it&#x27;s problem solved. reply KRAKRISMOTT 15 hours agorootparentprevThey are banned in many major European and Asian cities for a good reason reply hgsgm 16 hours agorootparentprevBan cars because loud noises are required to make them not kill people? Good idea. reply greenbit 20 hours agorootparentprevAt the low frequencies that tend to dominate and at that volume, it&#x27;s relatively difficult to figure out where the source of the sound actually is, especially with buildings around that reflect sound every which way reply vladvasiliu 20 hours agorootparentIt was a one-way street, so it was pretty clear where the traffic was coming from. reply sampo 18 hours agorootparent> It was a one-way streetI don&#x27;t think pedestrians are generally aware if a street is one-way or not. reply Someone 20 hours agorootparentprevI do not think that matters much.I don’t think your brain learned about one way streets and started fully trusting drivers to follow the law, certainly not the low-level parts that govern the “there’s something there you may need to pay attention to” mechanism. reply vladvasiliu 20 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean?I usually am aware that I&#x27;m in the middle of the street when I&#x27;m not supposed to be there (think when there&#x27;s something blocking the sidewalk or similar). In this case, I&#x27;ll absolutely pay a lot of attention to my surroundings. Hell, even when I cross the street at a green light, I&#x27;ll look before I step off the sidewalk.Because in my mental model of traffic, drivers are very likely to not follow the law.I may very well be in the right and the guy running me over may very well be certain to get convicted, but what good does that do to me if my legs are broken or worse?I think it&#x27;s the same thing with the new electric cars, which have to make a noise because people can&#x27;t hear them coming otherwise. This, to me, means that pedestrians are expected to pay at least some attention to their surroundings. Which, of course, doesn&#x27;t mean you should run them over or otherwise put them at risk if they&#x27;re careless.But my overarching point is that enough people don&#x27;t pay attention even when they are expected to, and no amount of noise is going to change that. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparent> Because in my mental model of traffic, drivers are very likely to not follow the law.You are actually agreeing with your parent poster here. What you said is exactly why people look both ways even on a one-way street. reply ttymck 19 hours agorootparentI think the point, consistent with the original story, is that most people don&#x27;t look either way when crossing the street. reply mistercheph 20 hours agorootparentprevBehold, the dialectic of the material conception of the human mind. In my mind it bears an uncanny resemblance to the liquid humours posited by our forefathers, no? reply natch 19 hours agorootparentprevDeaf people exist. And there are going to be people in the middle of the road from time to time; it happens. And sometimes people make mistakes. I’ve even seen people not realize that a street was one way. And sound reflects and bounces, and vehicles are capable of moving at different speeds; they’re even capable of moving the wrong way or on adjacent roads or on cross roads or on fields, making the determination of location not always straightforward. And any factors that did or did not apply in your story may apply in others. Just all the more reason for drivers to be careful. reply LispSporks22 18 hours agorootparentprevEven louder pipes with high frequency noise should help with directionality &#x2F;sMy bike came with a Yoshimura and it is deafening to me even on a 372cc. I had to buy a baffle for it and wear earplugs. My watch warns me it’s still 90 to 100 dB.I guess it kinda sounds cool for about a minute before being unhealthy. It was a surprise to me that anyone want such a thing when I first started out. reply a2tech 15 hours agorootparentprevThe sound on those bikes are directed almost entirely backwards. Which is why you can hear a Harley that blows by you until they get 2 miles ahead, but that same bike is essentially silent while it’s closing on you from behind. It’s a stupid argument. reply brailsafe 19 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s an absolutely delusional argument imo. I think SciShow did an episode on it, but drivers can not hear motorcycles until they&#x27;re right next to them, and I believe it has to do with how sound travels. reply olyjohn 14 hours agorootparentprevPipes point backwards. They still don&#x27;t make enough noise to be heard from in front. That&#x27;s why loud bikes always scare people, you don&#x27;t hear them coming until they are next to you and blasting past you. It&#x27;s silence and then deafening roar.Loud pipes save lives is bullshit. Defensive riding, good safety gear, and staying out of blind spots saves lives. reply i_am_proteus 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve noticed the same on my motorcycle. The pipe points out the back. reply notacoward 20 hours agorootparentprevExactly. As far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell, mere noise will do absolutely nothing to get most drivers&#x27; attention. I&#x27;ve seen drivers fail to notice a police car or other emergency vehicle behind them, siren and lights both on, as they stare fixedly at the phone in their lap. Even in less extreme cases, most drivers will just treat loud motorcycle noise as part of the general din of being in a place where they exist. It won&#x27;t generally have any effect at all on their decisions to speed up, slow down, or change lanes. Fun fact: the more common a noise is, the less likely it becomes that it will have any effect at all on people&#x27;s behavior. reply dahfizz 16 hours agorootparentprevPeople are conditioned to ignore the droning sound of exhaust. It&#x27;s ubiquitous and also not very directional. Horns, on the other hand, usually work to get peoples attention. reply jorvi 20 hours agorootparentprevOr they were just blocking your way.Whenever I hear a douche nozzle with an extremely loud exhaust, I start crossing &#x2F; walking obnoxiously slow. Two can play the game. reply vladvasiliu 20 hours agorootparentIt was a legal, unmodified exhaust. It was loud, but not \"extremely\" so. Also, they were not crossing, they were walking down the middle of the street. You know, where cars are supposed to go. People walk on sidewalks.This was a Paris street, with two large sidewalks on either side of a narrowish one-way street. It&#x27;s not like they had no other practical choice. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparent\"Legal\" is an arbitrary metric likely formulated in concert with the car&#x2F;bike manufacturers via corrup... excuse me, via lobbying, so you should really know better than to use that term as a shield.Do you not agree that noise pollution is a real problem that has grown to unacceptable levels?Expect even more civil disobedience -- I&#x27;ve observed the same as you in my city, people started doing it on purpose to sabotage cars and bikes taking way too much space on iconic scenic streets. reply vladvasiliu 19 hours agorootparentI do agree. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why I&#x27;ve sold that bike several years ago.But I very much doubt this was done on purpose. This was not an \"iconic\" street by any means, just a random street of no particular interest, with close to no traffic, pedestrian or vehicle. Such \"iconic\" streets do exist, and they usually have specific road rules where people are allowed to walk in the middle of street and cars are expected to avoid them (the streets) as much as possible. This was no such street.Plus, they were already walking down the middle of the road much before I was close to them. I&#x27;ve also seen other people do the same even with no vehicle in sight, in this or other similar streets. This is also a problem for bicycles, which also have to ride in the street and aren&#x27;t exactly a source of annoying noise. reply natch 19 hours agorootparentprevThey were in Paris! This changes everything. Of course they were walking in the middle of the street.Plus, Paris or not, with no setback for the buildings nobody wants to risk getting leftover washing liquid poured on them from a window. reply mschuster91 16 hours agorootparent> Plus, Paris or not, with no setback for the buildings nobody wants to risk getting leftover washing liquid poured on them from a window.Wtf, this is not backwater Russia we&#x27;re talking about (aka the places where the Russian units originated that were caught looting washing machines). I&#x27;ve never seen someone be as intentionally rude as to dump out water from a window. reply natch 5 hours agorootparentBut surely you are aware that Paris has many visitors.And that a good portion of them may be paranoid about this type of thing due to their very real experiences elsewhere. reply dustincoates 16 hours agorootparentprevI sort of see it all the time in Paris. I almost got dumped on a couple of weeks ago when walking my children. If we had been five seconds earlier, we would have been soaked.(I say \"sort of\" because I assume it&#x27;s generally people watering plants, but the amount of water coming down seems excessive.) replytime4tea 20 hours agorootparentprevHave you considered maybe you&#x27;re in the wrong? The hierarchy of responsibility puts a motorbike above (more responsible) than a pedestrian. Three people is more than one, so you are really saying you inconvenienced three more vulnerable people just so you, a single person, could go down a road, at speed, without a care for others. reply vladvasiliu 20 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t racing down the street, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying. And, at least in these parts, pedestrians aren&#x27;t supposed to walk in the middle of the street if there are sidewalks available (outside certain designated areas, of which this street was not one).Many a street has been converted to such an area. But rules apply to everybody, and sometimes even an obnoxious biker can actually be in the right. reply Gracana 20 hours agorootparentprevThat why I always drive on the sidewalk. It’s the courteous thing to do. reply j4yav 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s why I wear a car alarm strapped to my head, always going off, when I walk down the street. reply masklinn 21 hours agorootparentprev> While this sounds like a reasonable argument, I think it&#x27;s a load of bullpucky.I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s an outright self-defeating lie: they&#x27;re so noisy you will hear them all over with no ability to see them (and most of the time they&#x27;re irrelevant to you), so you just get listening fatigue, and you stop caring aside from being annoyed by the constant noise. And that&#x27;s just as a driver, as a nearby resident it&#x27;s infuriating. reply pdimitar 20 hours agorootparentprev\"Silly\" is really underselling it.One biker jumped to fight me once after I joked with him that he uses loud exhaust pipes to get a prostate massage while riding. People around him stopped him. I laughed my arse off. Apparently I hit a nerve.But yeah, that&#x27;s how much respect I have for these people. Whatever reasons they invent the fact of the matter is that noise pollution is already too much and everyone should be working on reducing it. Everyone. No exceptions. Including mothers with rattling strollers; having one with rubber wheels is not gonna bankrupt her family, I am pretty sure. reply eduction 18 hours agorootparentYou’re being an oaf about the strollers, the noise isn’t anywhere near as loud as for motorcycles (bizarre to compare them) and if you had kids you’d know the inflatable tires only work on large jogger or double wide strollers (and about those you’d be complaining how much space the pay take up on the sidewalk, in the grocery store, in the subway etc and if someone needs to ride the bus or a taxi they are not even an option). Typical complaining from a self centered non parent. reply pdimitar 17 hours agorootparentNo need for jumping to conclusions.

A more powerful (internal combustion) engine implies more noise. Of course the reverse doesn&#x27;t apply, more noise doesn&#x27;t strictly imply more power - it can just be an exhaust with lousy noise suppression. ALSO you might eke a little more power from an engine with less back pressure from the exhaust, so there is some real effect available.So if you&#x27;ve got some modified monster with an insane engine, it&#x27;s going to be loud. And if you&#x27;re a wannabe with a superficially-modified, underpowered car, you can add more noise easier than you can add more power, and hope to fool people.

The sound comes from extra fuel being ignited in the exhaust, which is done to keep the turbo spinning when you let off the gas. It helps minimize turbo lag. It also occurs in older race cars that had carburetors because they had less precise control over fuel injection compared to modern cars.That said, some people tune their car to imitate that sound with no purpose just cause they think it sounds cool.

It&#x27;s louder than a car is, but it&#x27;s not obnoxiously loud at all. You can&#x27;t hear it from inside YOUR car, for example.

This happens when you increase the fuel-air mixture above what the cylinders will support for combustion and often gives slightly (maybe 10%) better performance of the car, for the cost of much lower lifetime of many components (not just the cylinders), and of course making enough noise to wake the dead.There&#x27;s plenty of motorcyclists who do the same though. reply vladvasiliu 21 hours agorootparentEven though what you describe has, for some reason, become much more common lately, many exhausts are just loud for no good reason.

It&#x27;s a speed camera with some directional microphones that triggers if there is too much noise, probably with some filtering to try to avoid triggering on noise that isn&#x27;t loud car noise.There are actually acoustic cameras that are much more like a \"camera\" in that you get a 2D map of the sound reaching the device. This can be overlaid on an image from a light camera and you get an image where you can see where all the sounds are coming from.Some of them can make acoustic movies, where each frame is a light camera image overlaid with the sound map, usually coloring the optical image based on the sound with color indicating frequency and brightness indicating loudness.With these you can do neat things like make a sharp sound and see the echo bounce around a room, or look at something making a variety of sounds and see which sounds are coming from where.They often include software that is kind of an audio image version of Photoshop. You can use that software&#x27;s equivalent of the eye dropper tool to point anywhere in the image and here the sound coming from that point. E.g., if you had an acoustic movie of the strings of piano and the pianist was playing a 10 note chord you could pick an individual string and play back the sound of just that string.Here&#x27;s a video where science YouTuber Steve Mould was loaned some to play around with, showing some of the cool things you can do with them [1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QtMTvsi-4Hw reply johnwalkr 18 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a minor nit-pick either way but a speed camera doesn&#x27;t make an image of the speed nor usually use images to calculate speed. It usually measures the speed using radar, laser or wire loops and then captures an image.

It&#x27;s almost like they don&#x27;t have mufflers. I wonder if they are regulated differently? reply prmoustache 21 hours agoparentMy maxi scooter has its OEM mufflers and it isn&#x27;t too noisy.Problem is many people mount noisy aftermarket ones. They mount back the original one when they have the scheduled inspection.Having said that, outside of the amount of decibels there are engines that are more annoying. 2-strokes high pitch screamers and single and bi-cylinder with lots of low frequency &#x2F; bass noise.And there are models that are probably made to pass homologation but do higher noise outside of the rev range used during homologation&#x2F;inspection. The Yamaha T-Max is one example. It should be prohibited and all its drivers euthanasied.

Volvo tries to solve this with foam insulation for the intake area but that never lasts more than a few hundred thousand miles. Ive seen vortec trucks set off car alarms.then theres the desperate attempt to keep unmaintained trucks on roads. If trucks dont get service regularly for urea tanks and other emission control devices, theyre supposed to go into &#x27;limp&#x27; mode. 30kph, no faster, until service is made. well truck companies got around this by instituting &#x27;regenerative&#x27; mode. if you walk past a very loud truck (and i mean freight train loud) idling in the street during a delivery, chances are good its past its service interval and has entered regen mode. idle engine speed is ramped up from 750 RPM to nearly 3500 in an attempt to generate temperatures hot enough to combust waste gasses instead of clean them on exit (frankly it doesnt really work.) its hard on the entire engine and environmental system but hey, truck still gets to do its job for the week. reply swores 19 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t see anything in your comment that suggests a problem with their plan if the goal is to prevent vehicles from being too loud.... sure there may be some vehicles that are too loud because of good intentions on the emissions side, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they&#x27;re too loud? reply zdragnar 19 hours agorootparent> i think Amsterdam is going to be surprised at just how many \"clean idle\" diesel and modern trucks they are going to catch simply due to the nature of the regulationTo me, this didn&#x27;t read as a problem with the plan so much as an observation that they&#x27;re going to be catching a broader profile of problem vehicles than they anticipated.All in all, probably a good thing, but (as a foreigner who hasn&#x27;t been there) it was, for me, an interesting observation. reply johnwalkr 18 hours agorootparentIt took me a few reads to come to the conclusion that this was the meaning instead of opposing the law.

It is not, it's just another app. I've scanned these before and gotten an \"Instant App.\" I figure this is minimal friction for this person, so I suggest she do so. she pulls up a QR Scanner app - either because she's been bamboozled into believing that's the only way to get QR support, or because her particular Android phone actually does not have it built into the camera for God knows what reason; I didn't have time to figure out which. at first she struggles to figure out how to change cameras, but this turns out to be only because she's used to every camera app opening with the front facing selected by default; it has actually selected the rear camera, so I help her get it aimed right, and it goes bleep, and then... pops up an ad. i have to stop her before she hits open on whatever sludge is trying to put itself on her device then we get a screen with 30 different elements on it describing different qualities of the QR code. the most prominent is a \"Search The Web\" button, which would have dumped the scanned URL into Google for some reason and produced irrelevant results; i have to direct her to tap the tiny blue link. that link opens Instant App. Google play prints a huge permissions message; I direct her to accept it. it installs a 16mb app; so what was the point of Instant here, exactly? well, that's moot anyway, because as soon as it opens, it asks for permission, and then simply installs the normal version of the app, 24mb. we get into that. it asks for the street address of the lot. I have never seen this information printed on any parking lot in my life. it suggests several \"nearby\" options; they are actually half a mile away. unable to figure this conundrum out even for myself, i sigh and walk her through installing Park Mobile, which I know works. i help her find the lot ID. it asks for duration. she picks two hours. it asks for payment. she gets out her CC and types in the info. proceeding to checkout, it then... selects google pay. even though she just put in a CC. she hits proceed, and i go \"is that the right card?\" and she double takes and goes \"...no.\" i maybe just saved this woman from losing $30 in overdrafts. I direct her to tap the payment options field. nothing. i sigh. \"I'm sorry, it looks like you have to tap that tiny pencil icon in the CORNER of the field.\" yep. finally she's able to select her credit card. she hits proceed. it now pops up the duration selector again. what???? why????? it's back at the default of 1 hour, and she tries to pick two again, but it just won't do it. I happen to know this UI pretty well, so I know that if parking time was actually limited to 1 hour, it wouldn't show the option at all. This is just completely glitched out. with no other options, she just picks one hour, and successfully pays. we both breathe a sigh of relief, and I advise her that if she needs more time, she should be able to just tap a button in the app to extend her parking. I really hope it actually works like I described. throughout all this we had to grant Location permissions at least three times, and each time you have to decide between three options, none of which are \"Yes.\" the one you want is \"while the app is open\" but there is no way to know this, and nobody alive has ever picked either of the other options. nobody would. i have struggled to write an ending to this post three times. words genuinely fail me. #the decline 55 comments You must log in to comment. in reply to @cathoderaydude's post: Art Raccoon @Art-Raccoon 2 days ago I remember my parents parking at some lot in some Michigan town in the mid 2000's. Parking lot was manned by a booth with a guy sitting in it playing Oblivion on the 360 who looked up, silently took 3 bucks with a smile, and went back to playing. I wonder what that lot's like now. login to reply flowers, @nicky 2 days ago i would kill for that job rn lol login to reply Art Raccoon @Art-Raccoon 2 days ago I distinctly remember telling my parents that's exactly the kind of job I wanted. login to reply Rena @RenaKunisaki 2 days ago My first job was like this sometimes. A cashier at an automatic car wash. At night I'd be the only person in the building and there wouldn't be many customers, so I was getting paid to read, watch anime, and play music. On the other hand, I sometimes had to stay half an hour past closing time to finish cleaning after some idiot decided to go through at the last possible moment with an entire landfill in their uncovered truck bed, so. (I wasn't paid for that time either and was too young and naive to realize that was wrong) login to reply colin @vogon 2 days ago my mom came over to my place earlier this year to help me on a big project, and the nearest public parking is in a building next to a local bank. the signage notes that during the week, during bank hours, the parking is for bank customers only, but it was a saturday at about 11:30 AM. after having to install one of the multiple dumb parking apps, we noticed that the lot wasn't even listed in the list of nearby lots, then manually punched in the lot ID number to be confronted with a screen saying that the lot doesn't open until noon (news to us) and they don't accept advance payment. we ended up having to go into the bank and make sure that they wouldn't have us towed in the next half hour, then set a reminder for noon to pay up for the rest of the day. stupid fucking system, and to save what, like $80 a day on parking attendants? $100? login to reply Nire Bryce @NireBryce 2 days ago parking lots are low margin because they're waiting on the land around them to get more developed so they can build on the lot it's really funny because it kills parking downtown every time login to reply colin @vogon 2 days ago this parking lot is inside a building! it's on the ground floor, sandwiched between the below-ground parking for residents and the apartments themselves. if nothing else, there should already be people at the building during all of its operating hours and one of them could just be assigned to clean out the cash box and ticket people for not paying. login to reply Nire Bryce @NireBryce 2 days ago yeah. the good news is no one's watching so you could hit a few support pillars with a uhaul if you wanted login to reply @aune 2 days ago god this is all infuriating login to reply Kel @Keloti 2 days ago Jesus christ on earth login to reply NeckSpike @neckspike 2 days ago Jesus Christ.

That's the real heroism of our era. I just hope the 1 hour wound up being enough (or that the system was lenient enough to not notice if she went overtime). 🤞 login to reply gravis again @cathoderaydude 2 days ago The app pings you at the ten minute mark to extend your parking time, which is exactly the kind of thing that sells shit like this. Like, I'm glad the apps exist! I have extended my parking four times in one day without having to go back to the car, and that's great. I've also done wacky shit like parked, gone up to my office, transferred money around at my bank, and only then paid for my parking, since you don't actually need to be at the lot at all to do it. They didn't intend for me to do that, but nonetheless. The problem is just that these fringe benefits are not worth the pain and complexity. login to reply Pendell @pendell 2 days ago In an ideal world there would literally be One, Simple App that just hooked into APIs all the parking companies operated, at no cost to the parking companies.

Super Mario Bros: 40KB Super Mario World: 512KB Super Mario 64: 8MB Ocarina of Time: 32MB If your parking app needs more storage than a AAA 3D dungeon crawling adventure game, you're doing something horribly wrong.

Does QR, 1D retail, 1D industrial, 2D industrial, etc. Great for scanning serial number on incoming junk at work for example. You can google the numbers directly from the app, or if it's a URL it will show it to you without going there so you can get a bit of a vibe whether it's safe to visit or not. Good for tracking numbers too. Scan directly from the shipping label, copy and paste to the client, be assured there are no errors. I use it a lot. login to reply Nire Bryce @NireBryce 2 days ago the big reason ZXing was what I recommended people was that of all of them it had the least tracking permissions for a QR app because it was someone's side project who was already pretty well paid login to reply rabbithawk256 @rabbithawk256 2 days ago modern technology:isaacGui login to reply Otter Arriving on Platform 1 @art-kitkat 2 days ago It's great because if you'd rather take public transit KCM can't run their buses at all lately and ST has the tunnel single tracking so if you need to go anywhere in a timely manner I guess you should just buy a car huh? No I don't know where you'd park it but who cares look at shiny new car ooo economy number go up login to reply living in 16QAM @vxo 8 hr. ago It horrifies me when I see public transit systems go over to low quality apps for fare collection or a card that's not available on board the buses, no, you have to go to one specific customer service office that's downtown but not at the hub where half the bus routes intersect, or it's available only at one kiosk in one train station that's only open Monday through Friday 10 am-3 pm. Screw it, this is just a far better argument for free public transit as most of its costs are already being paid through sales and property taxes login to reply @aune 2 days ago I do actually prefer the separate reader app than Camera, though. I'd rather not have my camera doing anything. login to reply @garak 2 days ago I'm posting a counter-experience, not to disagree with you, but to give hope. It's possible for things to be better, because sometimes things are better. Sometimes. There is one parking app in Pittsburgh. Just the one. Street parking, empty lots, multi-story garages, empty grass fields. All of them are ParkMobile. The only exception is when the parking lot is a gravel field eight blocks away from the monster truck rally, which doesn't have an app at all, it has a dude with a rubber-banded stack of bills. And, critically, there are pay stations. Again, street parking, lot, garage, whatever. Every quarter-block, big chunky physical thing the size of a payphone. On the side are app instructions and zone number, on the front is a standard-ass monochrome kiosk interface that takes cash and card. I have repeatedly seen senior citizens from out of town figure out the pay station in a few minutes, which ain't great but it ain't terrible. The biggest source of confusion is from people expecting a physical receipt to put on the dash. I suspect the main reason it works that way here is because most surface lots and garages are actually operated by the local government, and it's the same department that's in charge of street parking. There's probably a directive somewhere that says every parking spot must have a physical pay station within 50 feet, and it actually happens. I'm sure there's a lesson here. login to reply Geight @Geight 2 days ago Both times my card has been skimmed have been during two separate trips to Seattle, before I moved here, and I strongly suspect both times were from when I would pay for my friend's parking in the city because as a simple midwesterner I was shocked and appalled at how much they wanted to charge by the hour. They hadn't all transitioned over to apps yet, these were all little self-serve kiosks, but the whole time I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being fleeced somehow. It's been bad, it's getting worse, it will become worse. login to reply Bubunsparce @evie 2 days ago They’re slowly starting to get rid of more and more good ol’ coin meters in downtown Olympia for smartphone payments only and man it sucks. Cant just push the button to get a free 15 minutes for a quick stop on certain streets anymore AND it’s more expensive than the coins login to reply Moose @M00se0nTheLoose 2 days ago With the location permissions, there are some apps you want to select \"At all times\", but I get what you're getting at. It's sad for people who don't understand how the things work. It's also a sort of example of companies trying to give you more choices for privacy (asking how much location data you want to give an app), but overall just making it more confusing for the end user. Where I worked, we were doing trade for some, what we thought, were gift certificates to a local car wash. We were then going to sell off the gift certificates. Well, sort of luckily, I bought one first and realized it's not a gift certificate. It's for money off a monthly subscription to the car wash. You need to download an app to use it. In fairness to the Car Wash, you can unsubscribe immediately, so you're not actually locked in for forever after putting in the \"gift certificate\". But I brought it up to my boss because like... for someone who doesn't know better, they just simply wouldn't know how to use the card, or it would've been declined at the car wash itself, since you have to redeem it through the app. We ended up not selling any of the certificates because we didn't want people to get confused and/or have to walk people through it. On one hand, I personally like the unlimited subscription to a car wash. However, it struck me as so odd they have no other way to give you a gift certificate. You can pay with cash/ card when you're at the car wash, so you don't need the app. But if you want a gift certificate? Need the app. Just odd to me login to reply Lizardguy @Lizardguy64 2 days ago I feel every digital service needs an analog option. login to reply ilc @ILC 2 days ago My family were on Vacation in LA back in 2019 and we needed to wash some clothes. The Apartment had no washer or a place inside to wash clothes (at least we didn't have access to it), so we had to go to a nearby laundry mat. The laundry mat didn't accept cash or credit/debit, you had to purchase a proprietary card, then put money into that card to use the washer. So we ended up spending a lot more on cleaning clothes because of the cost of the card, which we immediately discarded since we only needed it once. I seriously don't understand why they don't use a card and QR reader along side the cash/coin slots. It's because money, of course. Also I never had a phone that came with a QR code until recently. My Mom's Galaxy S5 didn't have one my LG Phone from 2016-17 didn't have one, and my Pixel 4a installed with CalyxOS didn't have one either, up until a couple months ago where they replaced the camera app that actually had a QR code reader. QR codes have been a standard for years, so why did it take so long for the readers to come on the phone by default? login to reply Froey 🏳⚧ @froey 2 days ago I really hate this. login to reply Heathen @Heathen-Cat 2 days ago It would be difficult to go after but I feel like the level of complexity involved should constitute an ADA violation login to reply Gwyn @hellgnoll 2 days ago My apartment building swapped over from passes you put on your dash to some stupid app for the visitor parking, which is the most agonizing experience to use in practice.

What is the point if technology doesn’t improve people’s lives? What is the point if we don’t apply technology judiciously to a problem and consider the needs, background and capabilities of everyone who might use it? The amount of effort expended on things that make people’s lives worse is astounding.

One time I had so much trouble getting Parkmobile to work I just gave up and risked a parking ticket. I didn't get one, so ended up saving a few dollars. And it's frustrating because this stuff doesn't have to be so hard. Why does Apple Pay work in some parking locations but not others? Why does the app forget you saved payment info? Why does one credit card that otherwise works fine get declined while another one works? It's sheer insanity, and it doesn't have to be. You're awesome for helping that lady.

It is a shame that western society has been perhaps a little too effective at separating these concepts. The very same contract could be any of them in different contexts:\"Party A pays 1 Pound Sterling for the item owned by Party B\"Crime: Party A blackmails Party B into selling them the item at a discountCommerce: Party B offers the discount to entice Party A to try the item out, so that they can sell more at full price in the futureAltruism: Party B wants to give the item to a good home rather than destroying it (if that would cost them, then it&#x27;s even mutually beneficial altruism from both parties)Clearly it is the context about how the contract was made that distinguishes the situations.

Daley gave control of parking meters to a private company until 2083. Sold out his citizens. For a super discount. And now, in a shocking twist, the private company is squeezing the citizens and government.It&#x27;s a pretty good watch. reply lionkor 2 hours agorootparentOh, wow, thank you! Appreciate that a lot replyp1mrx 12 hours agoparentprevyoutubetranscript.com + ChatGPT summary:Street parking, a universal hassle, is especially problematic in Chicago due to the infamous Chicago parking meter deal. This deal permitted a private company to take control and revenue from all 36,000 of the city&#x27;s parking meters. In return, the city received a lump sum of $1.16 billion. However, this arrangement has led to numerous financial and political challenges that won&#x27;t conclude until 2083.The root of this decision can be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis when Chicago was grappling with a significant budget deficit. Mayor Richard M. Daley, in an attempt to address this, chose to privatize the parking meters without adequate analysis. Surprisingly, the city&#x27;s aldermen approved this deal by a vote of 40 to 5, despite having limited time to review the terms. These aldermen have since faced criticism for their apparent lack of due diligence.The beneficiaries of this deal, Chicago Parking Meters LLC (a consortium formed by Morgan Stanley, Allianz Capital partners, and The Sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi) saw immense profits. This was largely due to stipulations in the agreement that increased parking rates, ensuring a steady rise in revenue. Furthermore, the city now finds itself in a position where it has to pay penalties whenever it undertakes any actions that could potentially dip into the company&#x27;s profits. This has amounted to Chicago paying the company over $75 million since the deal&#x27;s inception.Additionally, this arrangement severely restricts the city&#x27;s urban development endeavors. For instance, adding bike lanes or implementing other urban reforms now comes with the caveat of compensating the company for any possible lost revenues. An attempt to challenge this by claiming the company held an illegal monopoly was dismissed in court twice. The courts deemed that while the deal might not have been the wisest choice, it wasn&#x27;t illegal. So, due to the financial pressures of the crisis, Chicago ended up making a deal that has permitted financial institutions to reap substantial profits from city property for an extended period. reply seabass-labrax 10 hours agorootparentThis is where the sovereignty of the people is so important. A country (or in this case, a city) should not be able to enter into a deal which it is unable to back out from. To actually prematurely terminate a public-private contract would be of course very damaging to the reputation of the city&#x2F;state&#x2F;country&#x27;s reputation, and thus would increase the remuneration private companies expect from running public services due to the additional risk, but would be beneficial to each citizen in the long-term if done with caution. reply etothepii 12 hours agoprevThe problem of the modern automation is that if I can save my company 1c by wasting an hour of your time then I am incentivised to do so. reply throwawaaarrgh 12 hours agoprevnext [21 more] I.

A few years back, I started a home hobby weather project using an Arduino to collect microclimate data right from my backyard. It quickly became an expansive endeavor. I integrated it with a backend running on Kubernetes, had a React Native interface for mobile updates, and to maximize performance, parts of data processing were done using Rust and OCaml. I was exploring the trade-offs of the CAP theorem in real-time. You&#x27;d be surprised at how often \"weather inconsistencies\" were just my nodes not agreeing on state.

The experience depends a lot on weather conditions and micro-geographical factors.1) underwater visibility around land masses is dependant on precipitation and swell conditions over the previous few days - i.e. the water will be murky if it&#x27;s been pissing down and blowing a gale for the last 2 days. This is not so much a factor around offshore islands in deep water with strong currents.2) In hilly areas, it&#x27;s best to go out when there is an offshore wind, as the land mass shields the water from the wind, making the surface smoother.3) people have preferences as to the direction and tide (incoming&#x2F;outgoing&#x2F;time after low&#x2F;high tide).4) It&#x27;s great when the sun is out, and if you are spearfishing then you want the sun at your back so the fish can&#x27;t see you.In short there are a a lot of factors that, in some magical snorkeling forecast system, could all be rolled up into a score out of 10 for a specific geographical spot at a specific time. reply mechhacker 20 hours agoparentprevI use a different free app for forecasts, and it typically catches thermal winds like sea breezes with the default model.

I feel like the radar view is overstating the weather to look more impressive. reply jandrewrogers 18 hours agoparentNational weather radar is difficult to interpret. It isn&#x27;t showing what people intuit it is showing, the relationship between that picture and what is going on outside is complicated. To make it even more complicated, weather radars switch modes depending on the weather conditions in their area of coverage which causes the underlying phenomenon they are measuring to change, so it isn&#x27;t even consistent in that sense. The underlying metadata captures the operating radar mode but most people will have no idea what to do with that information.And then there is the fact that weather radar captures a lot of phenomena that are not \"weather\". reply hnburnsy 16 hours agorootparentThanks for that explanation but windy consistently seems overstating rainfall. reply jandrewrogers 15 hours agorootparentMost rain never reaches the ground and the radar is measuring rain that is very far above ground level, so it generates false positives.Reliable at-ground-level rain measurement has to come from other sources, like automotive sensors, ground weather stations, RF propagation measurements in mobile networks, etc. The downside is that these often have much less coverage than the radar. reply IAmGraydon 21 hours agoprevWindy is definitely the ideal weather app for geeks. My favorite feature is the ability to switch between the 6 forecast models or even see all of them at the same time. reply JKCalhoun 21 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s pretty, does anyone know if it is accurate? reply rz2k 21 hours agoparentWhen you click on a forecast you can choose the model or forecast provider, and you can set your default with an account. Windy.com just organizes the data, especially grouped by outside activity such as surfing, sailing, parasailing, but uses other data sources and doesn’t create its own forecasts.For my microclimate, I’ve found that Meteoblue is the only forecast that doesn’t forecast the high temperature 10 degrees too low when there is a heat wave. reply counters 20 hours agoparentprevWindy visualizations raw or direct outputs from the weather forecast models run by agencies in the USA and Europe. These models are the \"bread and butter\" of operational weather forecasting, and are the baseline in accuracy for all weather forecasts generally.That being said, you shouldn&#x27;t treat these outputs as gospel. All these models will get the big picture correct, but they have limitations with respect to spatial resolution. So if you click on the Windy map and look at your local forecast, take it with a grain of salt - the model doesn&#x27;t resolve down to the scale of your backyard. The status quo is for companies or agencies to use statistics or ML to \"correct\" the forecast against local observations, which dramatically improves the accuracy of forecasts like, \"What will tomorrow&#x27;s max temperature be\" or, \"what is the probability it will rain this evening?\" reply speed_spread 21 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been using the Android app (with a subscription) all summer for sailing. It&#x27;s good enough to help me decide 72 hours in advance which day to go out and on what body of water. Also helps determining if I&#x27;ll need to have another meat bag onboard (beside my own) to keep the mast pointing up during gusts, so I have a time to make phone calls. reply kejaed 21 hours agoparentprevIt’s as accurate as the underlying models, from which you can select the one you’d like to see visualized.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.windy.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;what-is-forecast-model-3397 reply jeffbee 20 hours agoparentprevI need to combine it with some other site like weather underground because it seems to me that windy uses past model outputs for current conditions, instead of actual observations.

I wonder if that means the models are all done with Euclidean geometry or is it just a display thing? reply lbrindze 4 hours agorootparentMost of all models are resolved in some sort of projected space. It depends on the model (e.g GFS uses an inflated cube, the ICON global from dwd is projected on to an icosahedron, IFS just moves most of the calcs to a spectral space instead of point-grid, and many regional&#x2F;meso scale domains use a conic projection). Also by and large it’s easier to assume the earth is spherical and then nudge any differences in datum to Mach your crs.Most often, final global models are output on to an orthogonal (plate-caree) lat&#x2F;lon grid. Data at the poles (singularity) is always a bit fidly reply globular-toast 35 minutes agorootparentWhat is the reason for modelling on a projected space? It seems to me at least mathematically to be fine to come up with equations in polar coordinates. It&#x27;s still a metric space with great circle distance. Is it a performance tradeoff?

    "originBody": "Aircraft Navigation Log on a $20 receipt printer Howdy! I’m Carlos and I like tech and planes (among other things like having massive servings of pasta). I’m currently studying for my commercial license in Europe. So far most of my flight training has happened on a Piper PA28 (the -180 variant) my school's plane doesn't look this pretty It’s from the late 60s, often there are at least 1 or 2 things that don’t work properly and it shows - the thing is old! I imagine at some point I’ll jump into modern jets, and so I am happy to spend the first few hundred hours being as much of an ‘aviator’ as possible. As a bit of background, these planes are single pilot operation, so the idea is that whoever is flying is doing the navigating, the radios, the checklist, the flying, the communicating and the looking out and in. It can get busy. The one thing on this plane that is just hard to adapt to is how cramped it is and hot it can get - I’m talking about 38C/100F in a vibrating machine for 3h. And I say that with the knowledge of all the other issues this plane has (magnetos may drop excessively, gyro basically useless, fuel pump is old…). We get these things called kneeboards, that provide a ‘comfy’ space for us to write down things like the weather reports, the tower instructions and how accurate our routing plan is as we follow it along. how comfortable is that! does it come with a cupholder? Whilst this picture looks pretty spacious, my plane is more cramped than that, and I’m sitting at a weirder angle. In my kneeboard / floating around the plane I have: Checklist (before taking off checklist, taxiing checklist, …) Map (big unfolding 1:400 map) (like the ones in the cartoons that open and open and open) Piece of paper to jot on (weather, tower instructions, tic tac toe..) Nav log (more on this soon) All of those documents have to be hot swapped for one another at different phases of the flight, and so there is actually a pretty big market for kneeboards and all the shapes and sizes they can come in. the kneeboard, the cargo pants of the air The Nav log is the term we give for a paper with point-to-point instructions from one waypoint to another. It typically has a lot of information to help us navigate (and even more info that we really use but had to write down to work out other things). Here’s a sample, but don’t worry too much about reading it. an example of a Navigation Log Realistically, out of all those numbers, I’m only really looking at a few because things like the wind correction angle only really matter so that I can work out other information (except in some edge cases). Since I’ve grown happy with how I work out the items in the Nav log (an important skill when you are in training), now I occasionally use this tool (screenshot below) which automatically fills most of those fields for me. For the most part it is repetitive work, like “how do my heading and wind interact with each other, hmm let me see.. ”. I simply look at my 1:400 map and then pick out the waypoints in this browser tool. This allows me to prep other parts of my fight that I might be doing that lesson whilst still having a fleshed out Nav log! one of the tools available for flight planning I then get a PDF which I can then copy by hand into my Kneeboard nav log. Sweet! Like I said I also like computers and toyin’ around with them, and so the other day I bought a receipt printer. Why? Well… they seemed super cool for small projects don’t use ink can get them second hand easily plug and play into Linux (/dev/usb/lp0) look cute (mostly through the use of googly eyes So then I thought… hey… what about the windshield pillar or a-pillar (if you speak cars) in the plane? it's strange to find unsued space in a cockpit I mean, that thing is in the middle of the cockpit, serves no function (other than the obvious one of preventing a total structural collapse) and is strangely receipt sized.. surely.. I could use that to alleviate some of my issues with the cramped kneeboard. Why don’t I make a git project that will let me have nicely formatted receipt prints of my nav log. I thought the Navlog would be the easiest thing to do so that’s where I started. Oh how wrong I was. Knowing that I’ll be using SkyVector for the foreseeable future I wrote a quick (ish) script to grab their Nav log. Ideally I could export a Navlog in some format like the Garmin one, but not really - only a weirdly formatted PDF. Anyways, fair enough -- I’ll just grab the whole PDF text with Ctrl+A and then ask the user to paste it into my script. Thanks to: Regex (special weird code that searches for patterns in code) think “take this ‘he3ll4o, $$th3er8e’ and remove everything that isn’t a letter String splitting (less weird looking code that lets you play around with a chunk of text) think “from the above example, split hello there into [“hello”], [“there”] Some math to fill in here and there think “once we have [speed] and [distance] from the PDF work out the time taken” I actually got a somewhat pretty looking Python dictionary / JSON of every leg of the journey. { \"from\": null, \"to\": null, \"wind_direction\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"temp\": null, \"temp_deviation\": null, \"TAS\": null, \"Track\": null, \"WCA\": null, \"TH\": null, \"Var\": null, \"Magnetic Heading\": null, \"Ground Speed\": null, \"Distance\": null, \"ETA\": null, \"CumulativeETA\": null } Then that JSON was exported into a PHP file (thanks Mike42’s escpos-php/ library!) which is what I’m using for formatting text in the receipt printer (mostly just font size and text-wrapping) and boom! version 1 -- still with a few things to add! I have to say it works surprisingly well. I use that to quickly understand where I am whilst I play with the map and communicate on our area’s busy air to air frequency. I don’t consider this to be dangerous since I also carry with me the full Nav log, so at any doubt I have all the other details, but hey, it never hurts to have extra easily-accessible information in unused space! The script also works for simpler things, like printing the lesson plan if you want to. Hopefully in version 2 I can make this feature a bit more extensive, and maybe have some nicer formatting, maybe a QR reference to the lesson plan, etc..etc… the lesson plan is normally on an internal web app, I’d rather sellotape it to the plane! the welcome screen!

Uses a ribbon to transfer the ink rather than treated paper.A lot of manufacturers make the same printer in thermal transfer or direct thermal models. reply clumsysmurf 12 hours agoparentprevAlso, most thermal paper is high in BPA&#x2F;BPS.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pca.state.mn.us&#x2F;business-with-us&#x2F;bpa-and-bps-in-... reply chaxor 11 hours agorootparentGeneral Aviation still uses lead in their gas, despite it being shown several times in enormous nationwide studies consistently to not be necessary, and often simply requires more cost in maintenance (lead builds up on spark plugs causing a lot of issues).So environmental impact isn&#x27;t high on their list already, and this BPA issue is very likely going to be completely ignored by anyone in that field. reply Scoundreller 11 hours agorootparentYes, but the avgas lead situation is primarily a problem for the people behind&#x2F;under the aircraft, not inside the aircraft. reply chaxor 9 hours agorootparentYou still have to fill it up by touching and breathing in the fumes while pumping it into the tank, so not exactly, but you&#x27;re right that it does affect others as well. reply btgeekboy 8 hours agorootparentI realize this is an anecdote, not data, but after flying my own plane for 5 years and getting >500 hours of flight time, plus soldering off and on for 30 years with leaded solder, my lead levels were fine at my last physical. I don’t drink avgas or anything, but don’t take precautions other than attempting to avoid getting it on bare skin. reply bombcar 3 hours agorootparentWe got one of them fancy lads what drinks the jet A, boys. Thinks the 100LL ain’t good enough, no doubt!:) reply Scoundreller 9 hours agorootparentprevdunno about the evidence, but I kinda figured post-combustion lead is more atmospheric than pre-combustion lead. Elemental lead doesn&#x27;t really absorb through the skin (and gas doesn&#x27;t evaporate too well at low temperatures) as far as I know. reply hexaga 9 hours agorootparentLead added to fuel is in the form of an organic compound, so I&#x27;d expect the opposite effect. Obviously there&#x27;s more distribution post combustion, but from a bio-availability standpoint spraying tetraethyl lead around in equivalent quantities would be a much more severe problem.Naively (without looking at data for concentrations in various environments), I could buy that people regularly handling &#x2F; being around leaded aviation fuel are worse off than those breathing the (dilute) exhaust products. reply mickdeek86 9 hours agorootparentprevGuessing parent was referring to the practice of heating BPA-laden paper in the near vicinity of commercial food-prep reply hereonout2 5 hours agorootparentprevI remember this being discussed on HN before. It felt a bit like \"till receipts are killing us\" which in the context of someone flying a 40 year old plane with noted defects might not be a primary concern.I wanted to buy a thermal printer myself but couldn&#x27;t find a definitive answer or evidence of the BPA part being a risk. I got one that uses BPS instead - other papers also raised concerns about this, but again I couldn&#x27;t find direct evidence of health issues associated with the handling of till receipts.I decided as the receipt printer will be used infrequently and I have been handling till receipts for the last 4 decades I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it. BPA is also present in food cans and plastic bottles - the link you sent states the concentrations are higher in receipts - but at the same time I don&#x27;t intend on eating the receipts or rubbing them into my skin.Generally I&#x27;m quite cautious about chemicals in everyday life, I try and reduce the amount in our house using natural products for cleaning for example.At the same time we&#x27;re constantly surrounded by toxins so I often find myself having to do this sort of rationalisation to avoid worrying about seemingly everything all the time. reply est31 6 hours agorootparentprevBanned in EU since 2020: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;eli&#x2F;reg&#x2F;2016&#x2F;2235&#x2F;ojThe first few months of 2020 were quite busy: they gave us blue receipts, covid, and brexit. reply carloslagoa 14 hours agoparentprevthat&#x27;s interesting, thanks for the insight -- I was aware of thermal&#x27;s darkening but unaware of it&#x27;s speed.

I don&#x27;t actually know any and I may be talking out of my ass but err. I&#x27;m sure there are! reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentOver here in Poland, companies usually require a \"proof of purchase\", which can be a receipt or an invoice. As a buyer, it&#x27;s up to you which one you want to receive[0]. There&#x27;s a special kind of pseudo-invoice called \"personal invoice\", which is like a VAT invoice except you don&#x27;t need to be a company or provide a tax ID for it. This is the one you want in any scenario when you expect to hold on to the proof of purchase for longer than it takes to reach the nearest trash can - its killer feature is that it can&#x27;t possibly fit on a thermal paper receipt[1], so you get it printed out using regular, durable means, on regular office paper (and&#x2F;or e-mailed as PDF).--[0] - On-line you usually get to pick at check-out, off-line you usually have to ask before paying.[1] - Technically it could, but it would be quite an achievement, and it&#x27;s sufficiently non-standard that nobody bothers. reply Scoundreller 11 hours agoparentprevWorth reading this Brother study on thermal paper degradation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anixter.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;Suppliers&#x2F;Brother&#x2F;White%...Worth looking at Figure 3 showing how different samples of thermal paper have vastly difference reactions to high temperatures.Once had a set of Aliexpress plastic water carriers take 6 months to arrive to me during COVID and it when it arrived, it seemed like the plasticizers from the carriers (or the factory?) severely degraded the thermal shipping label. reply andromaton 8 hours agorootparentWe use high temperature paper (170F, 20% dark at 6mJ&#x2F;mm²).

And for some reason they always want to put the kitchen printer right under the heat lamps. reply whartung 16 hours agoprevYou should look into a roll chart. It’s a small device typically mounted to a handlebar of a motorcycle that contains directions.As you reach each waypoint, you turn a knob and roll the next waypoint into the window. It should work just great with your receipt printer and your not limited to the length of the A pillar in your plane. reply DavidPeiffer 12 hours agoparentI like any excuse to mention the Jones Live Map. Back in the day it hooked up to a car odometer and when the arrow pointed to a direction, you&#x27;d take it.It works well as long as you never miss a direction, then it gets off.It&#x27;d be horrible with the variability in land speed from the same engine speed, but maybe that&#x27;d be part of the \"fun\" trying it for an airplane.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sealcoveautomuseum.org&#x2F;collection-test&#x2F;jones-liv... reply carloslagoa 10 hours agorootparenti had no idea this existed -- amazing reply DavidPeiffer 10 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re ever in Maine, I highly recommend the museum.

The fanciest thing in the plane was probably the HSI.On the instrument ride, I had to shoot an NDB approach to minimums in actual. That was a good time.I assume planes don&#x27;t even come with NDBs anymore. I used to tune into AM radio on them just to have something to listen to to pass the time.I used the latest Microsoft Flight Simulator recently and loaded up the C-172. It just stared at the screen for a minute, realizing I don&#x27;t know how to use a G1000 so I couldn&#x27;t fly it. I mean, I could start it up and get it off the ground, but for IFR navigation? No clue. Lots of buttons and fancy graphics.The march of progress. reply _s 11 hours agoparentHonestly - as someone who did their primary and instrument using steam gauges, and now mostly flies a Cirrus Perspective+ system (G1000 with some extra&#x27;s), you&#x27;ll get up to speed in less than a few hours of digging through the manual and playing in the SIM.After about 10 or so hours, you&#x27;ll start finding so many small things that make life infinitely easier for single-pilot ops that it&#x27;s ridiculous we can do x or y with so little effort.Running lean of peak, having a TOD, programming in our steps, hitting the approach button and just letting the plane fly is black magic at times. There&#x27;s no going back for me at this rate, especially when I just want to go places. I&#x27;ve got a single-seat Yak for when I truly want to \"fly\"! reply svarlamov 16 hours agoparentprevG1000s are great, but it&#x27;s disappointing that just about everything else has remained basically unchanged on GA aircraft for the last 30+ years. I hope that we will see some actual innovation in GA engines, airframes, and fuels soon. Fuels might be the most promising for the near-term. reply V99 14 hours agorootparentThe innovation&#x2F;future exists, but is not evenly distributed. For example Diamond planes [1] have: - The same G1000 (NXi) - A composite body - Jet-fuel burning engines adapted from recent Mercedes diesels - Computer control of that engine through one knob instead of managing the throttle&#x2F;mixture&#x2F;prop separately like cavemen - Crash testing, like impact absorbing seat structure and separately enclosed fuel tank modules that are unlikely to rupture instead of just filling the wing.And a new one costs about the same as a new Cessna 172 that&#x27;s been essentially unchanged since the 60&#x27;s except for the G1000 like you said.But \"the same\" is a pretty nice house in most of the country (~$600k) so everything is hand-built, so costs are high, demand is kept low. Commercial students trying to get their 1500hrs mostly just need the lowest cost, not the nicest or safest.Another big area of innovation and also lower costs is in experimentals and&#x2F;or light-sport.

A new DA62 is well into $1.5m with the options you&#x27;d want if spending that kind of money, and a 2-year wait last I heard.Meanwhile you could build something like a Velocity V-Twin well-equipped for under half a million. Paying for certified lawyering is expensive. reply ryandrake 15 hours agorootparentprevNearly all the innovation in general aviation, particularly regarding situational awareness and safety, is happening in the Experimental category. Moving maps, synthetic vision&#x2F;terrain alerts, ADS-B in and out, engine monitoring, airspeed-aware electronic trim control, fuel injection, electronic ignition, FADEC systems... yes, all are available on newer certificated planes for $,$$$,$$$, but much more affordable and accessible in the Experimental world. And, the builder&#x2F;owner can install and configure everything himself. Garmin&#x27;s latest G3X update includes the ability to use rudimentary set&#x2F;clear logic signals to do if-this-and-that type CAS alerts, and configure your gauges to behave differently during different phases of flight. All owner-configurable. reply aledalgrande 15 hours agoparentprevReminds me of my (pretty recent) sailing course :) I went on a few short sailing trips after and other people on the boat only trained on the boat we were on, which was much fancier than the one I first had to deal with. The original one had:- tiller instead of wheel (my brain could not)- no bathroom (bucket available)- no furling foresail (got to change to a storm jib in strong winds)- no auto locking winch- no auto pilot- no depth sensor- no gps&#x2F;screen- no fuel gauge- no clutches (only a couple of jam cleats that didn&#x27;t work really well)- retractable engine (so we had to lower it&#x2F;pull it up manually, was fun to use it to stabilize the boat a bit when winds were strong)Boat was also a bit smaller 31&#x27; vs 34&#x27;. I&#x27;d still take my course on that boat if I had to redo it, it was a deeper learning experience. reply seabass-labrax 10 hours agoparentprev> The fanciest thing in the plane was probably the HSI.The HSI is probably the most intuitive navigation instrument for me. You point the picture of the plane to the heading you want to fly into or away from the radio beacon, and it tells you whether you need to fly left or right in order to intercept the correct course.For fun, I fly the Lockheed Super Constellation^1 in my flight simulator (FlightGear; it&#x27;s FOSS) in CAT2 or even CAT3 weather mode, and try to fly from one airport to another using only the &#x27;steam gauge&#x27; instruments and my memory of the radio navigation frequencies. Recently I&#x27;ve been hand-flying without the autopilot as well. I&#x27;m the pilot, navigator, radio man and flight engineer for the quad R-3350 engines all in one seat.

My school is the cheapest on the block and we have the oldest planes, the other day I sat in another&#x27;s schools C172 and saw the G1000 and.. \"damn.. look at all those colours and uh what does this button do\" was just about all I could sayI think in regards to safety, screens have the upper hand 99% of the time however...a) the 1:1 of screen X to screen Y doesn&#x27;t exist, I (think) you have to pretty much learn the new systemb) there&#x27;s a certain je ne se quais to instrumentsc) the school that has the G1000 needs a G1000 trainer as well as an IFR trainer (though I guess that&#x27;s fine because then you have experience in both)d) too much screens may not be the best - the G600 has touchscreens now reply V99 14 hours agorootparentGuessing you meant 6-pack&#x2F;steam-gauge trainer, since anything with a G1000 put in is virtually guaranteed to be IFR-capable.There&#x27;s no hard requirement to learn one versus the other. If you&#x27;re a new student today and looking to go to one of the big-boy airlines you&#x27;ll probably never need to fly a 6-pack if the school you pick has G1000&#x27;s. reply carloslagoa 14 hours agorootparentYup!

That&#x27;s crazy you did it twice. reply EMM_386 13 hours agorootparentYes, US in the late 90s.I went to colllege to become an airline pilot, and I was shocked that I ended up having to fly an NDB approach in actual conditions to minimums. You just don&#x27;t see that anymore.And the tolerances on the checkride is that you can only deviate from the course by a certain number of degrees.I vividly remember staring at the ADF with the needle swinging wildly left to right as we were tossed around thinking \"surely I can&#x27;t get failed for turbulence\"? reply zeroc8 1 hour agorootparentI also did my IFR in the 90ies on steam gauges.

    "originBody": "Skip to content Home About Contact the site’s owner Search SCIENCESWITCH Exploring the Depths of Curiosity with Razeez CHEMISTRY Why Do Old Books Smell So Good? Date: August 19, 2023 Author: ScienceSwitch 1 Comment Have you ever wandered into an old library or dusty bookshop and paused to breathe in that familiar vanilla-coffee-grassy scent wafting off the aged tomes? That nostalgic olfactory experience is thanks to a bouquet of chemical compounds. Modern books smell different because of changes in manufacturing, while old books release distinctive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they slowly decay. Scientists are sniffing out these VOCs to reveal secrets about a book’s age, condition, and history. The Chemistry of Paper Paper is made of cellulose fibers bound by lignin, while inks and bindings add other organic compounds. Cellulose is a polymer made of long glucose chains, while lignin is a complex polymer found in plant cells. Over time, light, heat, and moisture cause the paper and compounds to break down, releasing VOCs that vaporize into the air. The manufacturing process also affects the VOCs released as the book ages. Telltale Scents An almond scent comes from benzaldehyde in the paper. Vanillin, the main compound in vanilla, is responsible for a sweet vanilla fragrance. Ethylbenzene, used in inks and paints, has a sweet plastic smell. 2-Ethyl hexanol, found in solvents and scents, smells lightly floral. Advertisement Privacy Settings New books use modern chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and alkyl ketene dimers, so they give off different VOCs. The VOCs can also indicate exposure to smoke, water damage, or other aging factors. Reading the Chemical Clues Scientists can analyze the VOCs from an old book to determine its age and condition. The mix of compounds can reveal if a book came from an early print shop versus a late 19th century press. They can also identify degradation and preservation needs. Librarians and historians use VOC analysis to study collections and even match orphaned books with the libraries they came from based on chemical fingerprints. It provides clues to an old tome’s origins and secrets as it aged over decades or centuries. The Life Story in a Whiff So next time you get a whiff of an old book, take a moment to enjoy that aromatic time capsule. Its scent has a story to tell, echoing the people, places, and processes that brought an ancient text to you. With each sniff, we get a little closer to understanding our bibliophilic past. FAQs Why do old books smell the way they do? Old books release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they slowly decay over time. The specific VOCs depend on the paper, inks, and binding materials used, which give old books their distinctive scents. Do new and old books smell different? Yes, new books tend to smell more crisp and fresh, while old books have mustier, sweeter scents. This is because new book manufacturing uses different chemicals that produce different VOCs as they break down. What chemicals cause that nostalgic old book smell? Compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol are often responsible for old book scents. Benzaldehyde has an almond-like scent, vanillin smells like vanilla, ethylbenzene is sweet and plastic-y, and 2-ethyl hexanol is lightly floral. Can scientists learn about a book’s history from its smell? Yes, analyzing the volatile organic compounds released by a book can reveal details about its age, manufacturing origins, condition, and past exposure to elements like smoke or water. This helps determine preservation needs. How does paper decomposition create VOCs? Paper is made of cellulose and lignin. Over time, heat, light, and moisture cause these polymers to break down and release VOCs, which enter the air. The specific VOCs depend on the paper production process. Do libraries and museums use VOC analysis? Libraries and museums are beginning to use VOC analysis to identify preservation needs in collections. It can also help match orphaned books by chemical fingerprint to determine their original source library. SPREAD THE KNOWLEDGE! FacebookTwitterRedditWhatsApp Loading...

I guess it probably wasn’t the computers themselves, but maybe that foamed rubber material used for mousepads and such, plus maybe some static charge in the air from CRTs or something? Any time I catch that smell, I’m immediately back playing Loom and Monkey Island and oogling at Pentiums and 1 GB hard drives. reply hattmall 16 hours agorootparentAre things just not as fascinating now? Is there anything similarly cutting edge today. I know that part of it I was much younger but I also remember most of the people around were way older and seemed to share in the wonder and amazement at those GB+ hard drives and the thought of 32mb of ram.I guess there&#x27;s just not anything new that&#x27;s advancing so rapidly.?.? Like my computer is 13 years old and is still overpowered for 99% of tasks. And they are still selling brand new computers with far lower specs. Imagine in 1997 being satisfied as a developer with a computer from 1984!I also have other interests and it feels like they have plateaued similarly. I guess I&#x27;m still getting some dopamine from solar and battery tech, price drops at least, and some neatness around microcontrollers and IOT but like even food has stopped seeming innovate. It used to be worthy of a day trip to drive into the city to eat at new exotic offerings and now every small town has mostly the same stuff and there&#x27;s nothing really new in the city either. reply Schiendelman 14 hours agorootparentWhat you&#x27;re experiencing is largely that now everything is nearly instantly discoverable. In the 1980s and 90s, you would find out about new technology or product at a computer store. You might read an article in a computer magazine about a technology, but for a product, you&#x27;re as likely to learn about it from a knowledgeable clerk. And clerks had to be knowledgeable because they were that initial discovery mechanism.Now, you find out about a new technology or product instantly, and you learn about them constantly. It is rare that a company develops something new enough that it&#x27;s significantly differentiated from something you already know about (or even have) that it&#x27;s exciting.Even Apple had a lot of leaks before Vision Pro (which is potentially the most exciting new technology product, at least for me, in years). They had to balance when to announce it with the leaks - to maximize the impact while ensuring you didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to get one. reply sublinear 13 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re missing the point. Even the Vision Pro is just incrementally better than Hololens almost a decade later. reply zimpenfish 13 hours agorootparent> the Vision Pro is just incrementally better than HololensHololens had 1268x720 per eye[1] or 1.8MP across both eyes. Vision Pro is 23MP across both eyes. Are you seriously saying that&#x27;s \"incrementally better\"? It&#x27;s a literal order of magnitude more pixels![1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;419869&#x2F;we-found-7-critical-h... reply II2II 10 hours agorootparentIf that order of magnitude more pixels doesn&#x27;t enable people to do more, make the old and impractical the new and practical, or even leave people with the desire to upgrade, I would argue that order of magnitude more pixels could be incrementally better.Then again, sometimes incremental ends up sneaking up on us and being revolutionary in the end. There are many technologies that appeared in the 80s (if not earlier), yet did not turn out to be practical until several decades of incremental development happened. reply lukevp 8 hours agorootparentI’ve personally used a HoloLens, and I would consider it not useful outside of very specific edge cases. The viewport is extremely small (as in, most of your vision is not the hologram despite it still restricting your vision considerably), it’s hazy, low res, not very bright, and objects were not perfectly stable. It still was exciting as crap to use one, but a HoloLens vs the hardware of the vision pro is about on par with an original PlayStation vs a PS5. It’s more than a generational leap. I haven’t seen a vision pro in person, but I’ve seen a Vive, and that’s already leaps and bounds above a HoloLens in quality. The HoloLens works differently than the vision pro, which is really an extremely sophisticated VR headset, so they’re not even the same product category really. A HoloLens is more similar to a Google Glass. reply lagrange77 6 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s still &#x27;vertically scaling&#x27; the number of pixels of hololens like devices. That might have needed innovations in manufacturing, but the product itself is not much of an innovation in my book. reply Schiendelman 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s honestly very similar to saying \"4K Blu-rays are just incrementally better than VHS\", by ignoring most of the differences and just considering that they&#x27;re both media for video. reply zdragnar 7 hours agorootparentAnd yet, you&#x27;re doing exactly the same thing with both. The experience is better, and there&#x27;s some novelty with extra features you can interact with (though aside from subtitles, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used them myself).In terms of what they do for the user the difference is, in fact, incremental compared to when VHS first became available. VHS enabled you to choose what to watch whenever you wanted. Prior to that, you got whatever was on whatever channels you had access to.I will definitely grant that enabling subtitles was a profound difference for a subset of viewers (those who enjoy foreign media and the deaf) but even that came about with DVDs, not Blu-ray. reply sublinear 5 hours agorootparent> enabling subtitles was a profound difference for a subset of viewers (those who enjoy foreign media and the deaf) but even that came about with DVDs, not Blu-ray.Closed captions were available on many, but not all, VHS tapes. Not all DVDs had subtitles either. The problem with CC on VHS was that it was often the first thing to degrade before the picture and then the sound.Foreign films often had subtitled releases \"baked in\" to the video. Here&#x27;s another hit of nostalgia. There were times you&#x27;d walk into a Blockbuster in the USA and the only available version of a hot new Hollywood release was the Spanish or French subtitled version. You had to deal with the lost sections of image dedicated to subtitles in a language you might not even understand! reply causality0 12 hours agorootparentprevIt feels like the consumer base is much less diverse than it used to be. Tech used to look like a cornucopia of different shapes, colors, features. Now it&#x27;s all the same. Twenty years ago the \"gaming phone\" was an Ngage and the \"fashion phone\" could pass for a tube of lipstick. In 2023 the \"gaming phone\" has an extra pair of invisible touch sensors and the \"fashion phone\" comes in pink. reply grogenaut 16 hours agorootparentprevYou missed out on 3d printers in the last 2 decades apparently. Those have gone leaps and bounds from very rickety prototypes like the og MakerBot to cheap workhorses. Stepper motors used to cost like $75 ea and are now like 4 for $15.Smart phones as well.Many of these things you don&#x27;t notice till they&#x27;re everywhere.If I spent more time I could list many other things I think but I don&#x27;t know your filter reply harimau777 7 hours agorootparentHave the 3D printers that are affordable and available enough for regular people advanced in their material capabilities much? The inability to print high strength materials like high impact polycarbonate or metal was what made early 3D printers mostly a novelty for me.

(I totally would download a car.)Now all of a sudden we have AI&#x2F;ML, self-driving cars, high fidelity consumer mocap, AR&#x2F;VR. The types of things coming out now seem way more sci-fi, cutting edge, and optimistic.

Remember the days when we used scripts that would parallelize searches over lycos, yahoo, webcrawler, altavista, alltheweb, ... reply wddkcs 14 hours agorootparentThe counter point is that the innovation never stopped, it just moved down a level. We &#x27;optimized&#x27; the hardware (as in gave it sufficient form to fulfill necessary functions) then did the same for the application space. Twitter, Facebook, Google, music streaming, all solidifying their phone presence over the past ten years.Just as the application space has begun to stagnant, suddenly our data is speaking back to us through LLMs. Such models will be the next space we&#x27;ll &#x27;optimize&#x27;, but these models will also be optimizing themselves. Strange loop. reply failuser 11 hours agorootparentprevNokia also released 9210 about the same time as 3310. From that perspective iPhone was even less of an improvement and a step back in some aspects. reply buescher 11 hours agorootparentprevIn 2001 you could get the Kyocera Palm phone, which is a more valid comparison. But yes. reply iamflimflam1 6 hours agorootparentprevI totally would download a car.Underrated reference. Well done. reply II2II 11 hours agorootparentprevIt was more than the rate of progress, though the rate of progress certainly helped. For a lot of people the computers of the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, and 90&#x27;s captured their imagination because of how it could change the world. The same could be said of prior technological revolutions.Even though we see a lot of technological progress these days, we are mostly out of the revolution phase. The computer is a part of our lives, much like electricity, the automobile, and the airplane. Those who love gadgets will be excited about each new step, yet it is nowhere near as exciting to everyone else. That is not to say that we are out of the revolution phase. People were genuinely excited about developments in mobile phones until a few years ago. This current hubbub over AI may stimulate people imaginations if it doesn&#x27;t end up stalling again.I chuckled at your comment about a 1997 developer being satisfied with 1984 technology. It seems like some 2023 developers are excited about 1984 technology. In many cases, it is because the tooling for things like build your own computers at the component level has become more accessible (rather than being an exercise in pure nostalgia). reply shubb 14 hours agorootparentprevThe smell of a newly opened rewriteable CD reply netule 9 hours agorootparentWow, I can still evoke the memory and scent of that first spindle of blank CDs I bought for my 1x CD writer. It&#x27;s so distinct and unforgettable. reply citizenpaul 11 hours agorootparentprevthe short answer is pretty much all tech we use was invented in the 1970&#x27;s and is just being iterated on at this point. There really is not much new coming out and all the really cool stuff has turned out to be too difficult to be reliable or require too much power to ever get beyond toy status. reply Forge36 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know what you smelled.

Perhaps this book was taken to the beach a few times while that that one used a slightly unusual glue.

Why do textbooks always have to be massive?- Why are there so many &#x27;infoboxes&#x27; and &#x27;did you knows&#x27; and &#x27;warnings&#x27; (a characteristic that textbooks share with do-it-yourself and self-help books)?- Why do almost all textbooks start with lengthy &#x27;How to Use This Book&#x27; chapters? If you&#x27;re in a course, you should have already been told, and most of those seem pretty common-sense anyway.My favourite business textbooks that mostly avoid these disadvantages (as I see them):- Managing without Profit, Mike Hudson: an almost complete guide to the mechanics of non-profit organisations; perfect if you already have a good grasp of for-profit business fundamentals.- A Manager&#x27;s Guide to Self-Development, Mike Pedler, John Burgoyne and Tom Boydell: mostly tests in the same vein as Myers-Briggs, explaining various aspects of personality, behaviour and strategy.- Interpersonal Skills at Work, Maureen Guirdham (not the John Hayes book of the same name!): very academic look at the social dynamics of workplaces, with proper citations to actual studies for further reading; very thought-provoking and genuinely useful if applied carefully. reply WalterBright 11 hours agorootparent> For instance:Those weren&#x27;t in any of my Caltech textbooks. reply selimthegrim 11 hours agorootparentprevOxford UP textbooks always smelled like this, Atkins in particular reply inopinatus 14 hours agoparentprevThere was an attempt to standardise scented content back in the &#x27;80s, but it didn&#x27;t stick.

I was a caretaker during these times for them. Talking with them, changing them (people are really heavy!), feeding them, medicating them, bathing them, etc. We had very good hospice support and paid a lot for it, but during the pandemic, everything kinda went to shit, so it was up to me and a few others most of that time.Dying of cancer is unique to every person and their cancer&#x27;s progression. But, from my own experiences, dying of cancer is a fucking horrible way to go.The pain is quite bad as it colonizes various nerve bundles and organs. Morphine only does so much and wanes as the person gets addicted to it and requires more and more to get the numbing results. As such, your mind goes with the morphine intake, a welcome relief really. You can lose function in your limbs and bowels too, though not always. You stop eating and drinking, but you don&#x27;t stop thirst and hunger. Death really does become a welcome relief after enough weeks&#x2F;months of this. Then there is the just normal health hazards and pains of laying down and generating filth. The rashes and sores, the muscle loss, the boredom. It&#x27;s quite horrible. And that&#x27;s with loving family members helping you at a moment&#x27;s notice. One pro-tip here, if you can get a death doula.Look, I get the sentiment here. Yes, live your life, don&#x27;t worry so much about how it&#x27;s going to end. There&#x27;s likely nothing you could have done different anyway. Your end is going to really suck, no matter what. Better to have it be quick and as painless as possible.But, I do want to advocate for taking common sense measures about carcinogen avoidance. Those are absolutely worth the time and effort. Do not smoke, don&#x27;t have lead paint in your house, don&#x27;t be stupid or lazy about getting these things away from you. Your future self will be very thankful you did that.

Often times the first thing I do when I have a new book is just open it halfway and burry my nose in between the pages. Maybe it is a fetish? Hmmm. Never thought of that.I also always enjoyed smelling the gas at gas stations when I was a kid, would open the window.I do wonder if it&#x27;s a psychological thing, or if there is really some chemical substance that is slightly addictive. reply fuzzfactor 17 hours agoparent>What chemicals cause that nostalgic old book smell?>Compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol are often responsible for old book scents. Benzaldehyde has an almond-like scent, vanillin smells like vanilla, ethylbenzene is sweet and plastic-y, and 2-ethyl hexanol is lightly floral.All of these are chemicals having very characteristic strong odors in their pure form, and can be somewhat overwhelming.Ethylbenzene is an Aromatic hydrocarbon normally found in major concentrations in some paints and thinners, and industrial felt-tip markers containing the xylene-based inks which are flammable, toxic and can make you dizzy breathing too much.2-Ethylhexanol smells even worse, it&#x27;s really rough. If you get one drop on your foot, you&#x27;re going to want to leave your shoes outside when you get home.These kind of things just smell unique and are detectable in such low concentrations, plus can form a type of barely perceptible \"bouquet\" that imprints well enough to guide a potential effort toward its elusive source.I would have to estimate the dose makes the poison like so many other things.

The downsides being that physical books don&#x27;t keep their page and are uncomfortable to hold, more so for kid hands, and laying down in bed to read or trying to prop up a book exacerbated its technological inferiority.I always suspected for others that the smell was a greater part of the experience and association with reading a book. and maybe some prior social benefits doing it in public. reply ghaff 21 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s some combination of snobbery, appreciating the tactile nature of physical books, and having bookshelves and piles of books in the house that appeal to many people.IMO ebooks are inferior for some purposes. Books that are meant to be appreciated as books--e.g. books of photography. Cookbooks in which I make notes and put stickies. Various other cases.But if I&#x27;m mostly just reading flowing text, especially fiction but non-fiction as well I appreciate a format that lets me carry a library in a form factor that&#x27;s smaller than a hardcover and which I can easily read in any lighting conditions. reply hotnfresh 19 hours agorootparentI think ereaders are a worse UI for all but wholly linear, light reading. If I’m reading some trashy fiction, ereaders don’t bother me—anything else, and they’re worse than a real book.The two-page-at-a-time interface is a ton better and enables features like facing-page translations or setting a full-page illustration or other graphic opposite some text. Got two (largish) books, you can have both open and visible at the same time, four total pages. Footnotes are a lot better in a real book. Typesetters can control formatting—text placement on the page, were page-turns fall, that kind of thing—much better, so poetry texts may be better in a real book. I find holding or marking an endnote or index section and flipping back and forth to that faster, and less error-prone than doing the same on an ereader.The book being a distinct physical object aids with memory. You see the title and author as it sits on the table in a room you’re occupying, even if you’re not reading it (I’ll often forget who wrote an ebook I’m reading, even if I’ve spent hours with it). Spatial memory is powerful. I not-uncommonly use it to locate parts of a book kinda by feel, like tracing a familiar but poorly marked trail in the woods. Ebooks feel like trying to find a particular spot on the open ocean, with no stars and out of sight of land.Full text search is the only directly book-related feature of ebooks that I think gives them an edge, but that’s no replacement for a good index, and if I had to pick only one of the two, I’d take the index. It’s pretty good, though.What remains in their favor is compactness, and boy is that a big advantage, so I do read ebooks even for some books I’d prefer to read on paper. But IMO the UI is, overall, a whole lot worse than a real book.[edit] oops, sold ebooks short on one point: you don’t need to hunt down separate large-print editions, with them. Same thing that makes them so bad for text that benefits from a human having taken care with text formatting and placement, makes them great if you need large print. reply hanniabu 21 hours agoprevSo is it a health hazard to work in a museum library? reply wrp 20 hours agoparentIf you mean a library of old books, yes, it can be if toxic books are not properly handled. reply 1letterunixname 20 hours agoparentprevDepends if the building has Legionnaire&#x27;s or asbestos.Moldy books also exist.

The memory requirements are huge, quantization is effective, and token generation is surprisingly serial and bandwidth bound, making it good for CPUs, and an even better fit for ggml&#x27;s unique pipelined CPU&#x2F;GPU inference....But Stable Diffusion is not the same. It doesn&#x27;t quantize as well, the unet is very compute intense, and batched image generation is effective and useful to single users. Its a better fit for GPUs&#x2F;IGPs. Additionally, it massively benefits from the hackability of the Python implementations.I think ML compilation to executables is the way for SD. AITemplate is already blazing fast [1], and TVM Vulkan is very promising if anyone will actually flesh out the demo implementation [2]. And they preserve most of the hackability of the pure PyTorch implementations.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VoltaML&#x2F;voltaML-fast-stable-diffusion2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlc-ai&#x2F;web-stable-diffusion reply WinLychee 19 hours agoparentThe above project somewhat supports GPUs if you pass the correct GGML compile flags to it. `GGML_CUBLAS` for example is supported when compiling.

And as a bonus using the Q8_0 format (the one that seems to be the fastest) it also saves ~2.3GB of data too.That said, it seems to be buggy with anything other than the default 512x512 image size. Some sizes (e.g. 544x544) tend to cause assert fails, sizes smaller than 512x512 (which i tried as 512x512 is quite slow on my PC) sometimes generate garbage (anything smaller than 384x384 seems to always do that).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32555608 reply gsharma 11 hours agorootparent> sizes smaller than 512x512 (which i tried as 512x512 is quite slow on my PC) sometimes generate garbage (anything smaller than 384x384 seems to always do that).Not sure about the speed, but the garbage output might be due to the model instead of the library.

After that, both ggml_vec_dot_f16 and ggml_vec_dot_f32 took first place in profiler.Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;ggml&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;ggml.c#L10...But I agree, that in theory, and only with AVX512 BF16 (not exactly FP16, but similar) will be fast with VDPBF16PS instruction. Implementation is not there yet. reply brucethemoose2 13 hours agorootparentInteresting.I saw some discussion on llama.cpp that, theoretically, implementing matmul for each quantization should be much faster since it can skip the conversion. But practically, its actually quite difficult since the various BLAS libraries are so good. replypatrakov 16 hours agoparentprevCPU-only, 8-bit quant, Intel Core i7 4770S, 16 GB DDR3 RAM, 10 year old fanless PC: 32 seconds per sampling step, correct output. reply naillo 20 hours agoprevAwesome that they implemented CLIP as well.

Hopefully we can have a better and open clip model eventually. reply waynecochran 20 hours agoprevNice to see ML folks getting weaned off of Python and using a language that can optimally exploit the underlying hardware and not require setting up a specialized environment to build and run. reply codethief 20 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s a rather odd comparison to make. First of all, OP, like llama.cpp, doesn&#x27;t use the GPU – in contrast to most Python ML code. It&#x27;s not hard to write Python code that \"optimally exploits\" the GPU. You might call the GPU a \"specialized environment to build and run\" but it&#x27;s arguably much better suited to the problem.Second, OP, like llama.cpp, produced efficient and highly specialized code after it was clear the model being specialized for (StableDiffusion &#x2F; LLaMa &#x2F; …) works well. Where Python shines, though, is the prototyping phase when you have yet to find an appropriate model. We have yet to see this sort of easy & convenient prototyping in C++.Now, this is not to take away anything from the fantastic work that&#x27;s being done by the llama.cpp people (to whom I also count OP) in the \"ML on a CPU\" space. But the problems being solved are entirely different. reply segfaultbuserr 20 hours agorootparent> Where Python shines, though, is the prototyping phase when you have yet to find an appropriate model. We have yet to see this sort of easy & convenient prototyping in C++.+1.To produce a highly-optimized C&#x2F;C++ kernel that utilizes the CPU to the fullest extent, it requires tremendously amount of talent and expertise. For example, not everyone can write a hand-vectorized kernel with AVX2 intrinsics (outside a few specialized applications like 3D graphics, media encoding, and the likes), and even fewer people can exploit the underlying feature of the algorithm for optimization, such as producing usable output at greatly reduced numerical precision. The power of LLM provides strong motivation to drive the brainpower of countless programmers all over the world to do just that. New techniques are proposed and implemented on a monthly basis, with people thinking and applying every possible trick on the LLM optimization problems. In this regard, moving from Python to C is totally reasonable.In comparison, right now I&#x27;m working on optimizing a niche open-source scientific simulation kernel with a naive C codebase. Before me, there were hardly any contributors in the last decade.Python has its place because not everyone has a level of resource and expertise comparable to ML. In particular, when the bulk of the data processing of a Python script is in done in a function call to a C++ or FORTRAN kernel like scipy, the differences between naive C and naive Python code (or Julia code if you&#x27;re following the trend) are not that much, especially when it&#x27;s a one-off project for just publishing a single paper. reply hotstickyballs 19 hours agorootparentIt’s going to be a tf or PyTorch feature rather than going directly to writing things in C.

I&#x27;m actually a developer on quite a prominent large scale neural network training library and a DL researcher that uses said library. With my developer hat on I like to have minimal dependencies and keep Python scripting as decoupled as possible from the CUDA C++ implementation. With my researcher hat on I don&#x27;t want to be slowed down by C++ development every time I want to change my model or training pipeline. At least for me, C++ development is slower and more error prone than modifying Python.Obviously doing any heavy lifting in Python is a bad idea. But as a scripting language I think it&#x27;s good, especially if you keep the environment simple. I don&#x27;t think the answer for DL training is to dump Python entirely and start over in pure C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;Julia&#x2F;whatever. Learning C&#x2F;C++ is too big of an ask for everyone working on the model design and training side and it would slow down progress significantly - most of that work is actually data munging and targeted model tweaks. But I do think there&#x27;s still a lot that can be done to decouple Python from the underlying engine and yield networks where inference can be run in a minimal dependency environment.

Migrating an existing project like that is difficult. The chrome team in particular lamented the difficulty. But starting a new project? If you have a team familiar with performant c++ the speedbump of starting a greenfield project in rust is negligible, and the ergonomic improvements in the build system and the language itself will make up for that in any project that takes more than a few months. For that speed bump you get memory and thread race safety, far better than any stack of c++ analysis tools could ever provide with a tiny fraction of the unit tests you&#x27;d write in c++.

That qualifier encompasses quite amount of software space, but not all of it, and I would argue not even the majority of it.If you don&#x27;t know what you are doing, if you are exploring ideas, Rust will just get in the way. At some point you will end up realizing you need to adjust lifetimes, and that will require you to touch non-trivial amount of your code base. If you need to that multiple times, friction will overwhelm your desire to code.I have a pet theory that, the people that find Rust intuitive and fun, are the people that are working on well beaten paths; Rust is almost boring at doing that, which is a good thing. And the people that find Rust gets in their way are the people that like to experiment with their solutions, because there aren&#x27;t any set, trusted solutions within their problem space, and even if there are, they like to approach the problem on their own, for better or worse.In any case:> why would anyone start a greenfield project like this in C++ these days?The video game industry can single-handedly carry C++ on their back, kicking and screaming, if need be. Rust is uniquely unfit to write gameplay code due to game development&#x27;s iterative nature. Using scripting languages doesn&#x27;t cut it either, because often, slower designer made scripts will need to be converted to C++ by a programmer, and pull in the crazy reference hell of the game state into the C++ land.I would say Rust is OK for engine level features -- those don&#x27;t change that often, and requirements are usually well understood. But that introduces a cadence mismatch between different systems too, so there is a cost there as well. But for gameplay? There&#x27;s a reason why many Rust based game engines use crazy amount of unsafe Rust to make their ECS.

Examples on Windows: Direct3D, Direct2D, DirectWrite, MediaFoundation. Examples on Linux: V4L2, ALSA, DRM&#x2F;KMS, GLES. These things are huge in terms of API surface. Choose Rust, and you gonna need to write and support non-trivial amount of boilerplate code for the interop. Choose C++ (on Linux, C is good too) and that code is gone, you only need well-documented and well supported APIs supplied by the OS vendors.Similarly, some software needs to integrate with other systems or libraries written in C or C++. An example often relevant to HPC applications is Eigen. Another related thing, game console SDKs, and game engines, don’t support Rust.For the project being discussed here, GGML, for optimal performance the implementation needs vector intrinsics. Technically Rust has the support, but in practice Intel and ARM are only supporting them for C and C++. Not just CPU vendors, when using C or C++ there’re useful relevant resources: articles, blogs, and stackoverflow. These things help a lot in practice. I don’t program Rust, but I program C# in addition to C++, technically most vector intrinsics are available in the current version of C#, but they are much harder to use from C# for this reason.All current C and C++ compilers support OpenMP for parallelism. While not a silver bullet, and not available on all platforms supported by C or C++, some software benefits tremendously from that thing.Finally, it’s easier to find good C++ developers, compared to good Rust developers. reply galangalalgol 18 hours agorootparentThere are existing supported bindings for direct3d from MS, as they themselves are migrating. GLES and ggml also have supported bindings. I like nalgebra + rustfft better than eigen now. Nalgebra still isn&#x27;t quite as peformant on small matricies until const generic eval stabilizes, but it is close enough for 6x6 stuff that it is in the noise. Rustfft is faster than fftw even. Rust has intrinsic support on par with clang and gcc, and the autovectorizer uses whatever llvm know about, so again equivalent to clang.On the last point, I will again assert that a good c++ developer is just a good rust developer minus a month of ramp, that you&#x27;ll get nack from not having to fight combinations of automake, cmake, conan, vcpkg, meson, bazel and hunter. reply Const-me 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll be very surprised if MS will ever support rust bindings for media foundation. That thing is COM based, requires users to implement COM interfaces not just consume, and is heavily multithreaded.About SIMD, automatic vectorizers are very limited. I was talking about manually vectorized stuff with intrinsics.I&#x27;ve been programming C++ for living for decades now. Tried to learn rust but failed. I have an impression the language is extremely hard to use. reply galangalalgol 17 hours agorootparentNot sure how fully featured it is. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lib.rs&#x2F;crates&#x2F;mmfYes, rust directly supports modern intrinsics, that is what rustfft for instance uses. I try to stick with autovec myself, because my needs are simpler such that a couple tweaks usually gets me close to hand-rolled speedups on both avx 512 and aarch64. But for more complicated stuff yeah, rust seems to be keeping up. Some intrinsics are still only in nightly, but plenty of major projects use nightly for production, it is quite stable and with a good pipeline you&#x27;ll be fine.I&#x27;ve written c++ since ~94, and mostly c++17 since it came out. About a quarter of a century of that getting paid for it. I never liked or used exceptions or rtti, and generally used functional style except for preallocation of memory for performance. I think those habits might have made the transition a little easier, but the people on my team who had used a more OOP style and full c++ don&#x27;t seem to have adapted much more slowly if at all. I struggled for years to internalize rust at home until I just jumped in at work by declaring the project I lead would be in rust. I have had absolutely no regrets. It really isn&#x27;t as bad a learning curve as c++. But we learned c++ one revision at a time. Also, much like c++ rust has bits you mostly only need to know for writing libraries.

The support alone is not enough, the API needs to match the C compiler extensions defined decades ago by Intel and ARM. reply theLiminator 13 hours agorootparentprevCurious how long you tried to learn rust? I&#x27;ve found C++ much harder to learn (coming from a python&#x2F;scala) background.Is it just a case of you forgetting how hard C++ was to learn? reply Const-me 10 hours agorootparentI have minimal experience with Rust. OTOH, programming C++ for living since 2000, with a few gaps when I used other languages like Obj-C and C#.I agree C++ is very hard to learn if you only have experience with higher-level languages like Python and Scala. I think there’re two reasons for that.C++ is unsafe. There’s no way around this one, it was designed that way, like C or assembly. Still, with modern toolset it’s not terribly bad. Compilers print warnings, BTW I typically ask them to treat warnings as errors to deliberately fail the build. On Windows, a combination of debug build, debug C runtime, and visual studio debugger helps tremendously. Linux compilers have these sanitizers (address, memory, thread, undefined behavior) which are comparable, they too sacrifice runtime speed for diagnostics and debuggability.Another reason, the language itself is very complicated, especially the templates. However, just because something is in the language doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to use it. You don’t need to be familiar with that stuff unless doing something very advanced, like customizing the Eigen C++ library. Don’t follow the patterns found in the standard library: unlike your code, that library has good reasons to use that template BS. If instead of templates you do something else, C++ becomes much easier to use, and most importantly other people will still be able to read and understand your code. Another reason to avoid excessive template metaprogramming, it slows down the compiler, because template-heavy code often needs to be in headers as opposed to cpp files.P.S. If you don’t need extreme levels of performance (defined as “approach the numbers listed in CPU specs”, the numbers are FLOPS or memory bandwidth), and you don’t need the ecosystem too much, consider C# instead of C++. Much faster than Python, often faster than Scala or Java, easy integration with C should you need that (about the same as Rust, much easier than Python or Java), the only downside is these ~100MB of the runtime. The reputation is weird, but technically the language and runtime are pretty good. For example, here’s a C# library which re-implements a subset of ffmpeg and libavcodec C libraries for one particular platform, Linux on Raspberry Pi4: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;Vrmac&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;VrmacVideo reply pjmlp 14 hours agorootparentprevNo there aren&#x27;t, unless you mean Rust&#x2F;WinRT demos with community bindings.Agility SDK and XDK have zero Rust support.

As a fellow game developer who learned to navigate the complexities of matchmaking and server orchestration the hard way (and begrudgingly), seeing Rivet open source a matchmaker and server orchestrator is exciting and honestly refreshing. For those outside of games, the use of modern webdev &#x2F; infra tooling is frustratingly nascent, and production-ready OSS usable by smaller-than-AAA-sized studios is even more rare, just beginning to come online (the efforts behind https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.ci are a recent shining example in game infra).I&#x27;m particularly encouraged here by the tools and approaches chosen — Redis for matchmakers, ClickHouse for analytics&#x2F;logs, Rust for speedy backend operations were tools I eventually came upon as best for the job after a long and painful process of iteration with inappropriate cloud dev tooling (with basically any datastore other than Redis you will run in to issues matchmaking).High traffic&#x2F;concurrency in matchmaking is a hard problem when you need fast, consistent matches. Existing industrial-sized matchmakers (Google&#x27;s OSS OpenMatch, AWS GameLift, etc.) require locking in to a very specific format or spinning up an entire K8S cluster, which for game devops teams already stretched thing is a tall ask). And for all that effort, you may discover the performance characteristics of their approaches aren&#x27;t what you need, or (as has happened to us with different game web service&#x2F;API&#x2F;middleware providers) they may choose to abruptly deprecate the service upon which you built.Appreciate the dedication to making this available and the focus on helping gamedevs get up and running as fast as possible. Looking forward to playing around with Rivet and seeing where it might fit in our stack — & would love to talk shop on this with anyone since I&#x27;ve been tortured by &#x2F; interested in these problems while trying to simultaneously run a game studio &#x2F; make new games &#x2F; keep everything online the last few years! reply doctorpangloss 7 hours agoparent> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.ciI don&#x27;t recommend it.Game CI has been in development for a long time.

Of course, I self host, and I am doing some real trivial stuff right now. reply devbug 15 hours agoparentprevThis echos my experiences, especially with the move to “live services” model for games. Often the teams working on the services for multiplayer games are very small so it’s all about leverage. They’re also embedded within a culture that doesn’t value or understand the practices and tools that are taken for granted in webdev, mostly because they’re hard to transfer to the other domains in gamedev.I’m glad to see the open source development of these tools. Personally, there’s a lot of stuff colleagues and I have built that I would love to see open sourced. Otherwise we just end up implementing the same services over and over again.Another example is patch delivery. It’s a solved problem yet everyone keeps rolling their own, or only shipping to Steam. Of course, all managed with some Jenkins scripts written by someone that’s no longer at the company. I want Fastlane for games that makes it easy to target the various distribution channels across desktop&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;console. reply lazypenguin 10 hours agorootparentThe lack of a standardized patch system for games is mind boggling! Sure there’s some for desktop software exes which just ship the new version every time but those apps are rather small and games can be several GB! We had to roll our own for our game but I couldn’t believe there wasn’t a universal standard when I went searching for one last year. Butler from itch.io looked interesting but I couldn’t decipher how to use it in the end. Also rolling patches manually seemed crazy to me and we ended up using a library similar to rsync that works pretty well and makes deploying patches easier but still not perfect. reply NKissel 14 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing your experience and kind words — we would always be happy to talk shop. I think it’s a shame that current infra solutions prevent a lot of hobbyists and studios from ever launching a multiplayer games, I would love to see it as prolific as single player experiences. reply Thaxll 12 hours agoprevThe fact that this solution is based on nomad is a big red flag:- no updates after December- you probably won&#x27;t have the right to use nomad after that- every providers offer Kubernetes managed solution, by using nomad now you&#x27;re pushing that burden to host and manage infra since no one is offering nomad servicesUsing Kubernetes is a huge advantage since all the dev ops tool can run on it, it&#x27;s tested and everyone is using it.As for more flexible than Agones I highly doubt that, do you have example? reply heipei 4 hours agoparentCounterpoint: Providers offer k8s managed solutions because it&#x27;s such a pain in the ass to run yourself. Nomad is far simpler to setup, operate and upgrade. And lastly the folks that are independent-minded enough to go with the less-popular option (Nomad) are also the folks more likely to host it themselves no matter what. reply doctorpangloss 7 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s true everyone doing anything with infrastructure should be using Kubernetes, it&#x27;s over, it has won.But it&#x27;s complicated.Game development uses all sorts of red flags throughout all of history.The people making successful games are talented enough to deal with the downsides of anything.Nomad specifically is used by e.g. Roblox to orchestrate. Do I think that&#x27;s a good idea? No. But it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work.With regards to your specific criticism I don&#x27;t think that stuff really matters, there are tons of people using tons of totally unsupported &#x2F; unsupportable game engines, open source libraries, etc. reply heipei 4 hours agorootparentI believe the it&#x27;s over because tech X has thinking is at best lazy and at worst dangerous.

It implies that the everyone&#x27;s requirements are the same and static and that solution X has reached all of those requirements.I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to agree, because iterating on what we have and developing new tech and practices seems like a good idea (the concept of 12 Factor Apps comes to mind).However, I can&#x27;t help but to wonder what this would look like, when taken to the extreme. Perhaps something along the lines of: \"We are only going to use Ubuntu for the servers and Java for all of our back end services, as well as React for the front end. Nothing else, no matter how many different projects there are.\"And on a certain level, it makes sense: consistency and skills that carry over seem like a nice thing to have, there&#x27;s even terms out there like a company being \"a Java shop\" and so on.That said, such inflexibility might not always be nice (e.g. trying to do machine learning in Java) but at the same time if a specific technology is in demand in the job market in most companies, you don&#x27;t really get much of a choice.To return from the analogy, in the particular case of Kubernetes, you&#x27;ll have to learn and use it and there&#x27;s only so much free time for exploring other options.> If people blindly accepted X has won we&#x27;d be still using Perl, XML, CGI-Bin, Apache, Angular, etcFor many folks, some of those might indeed be good choices.Some backup software that I use is written in Perl and is actually pretty good (BackupPC).XML can be a nice format to use and has lots of tooling available. Even SOAP wasn&#x27;t necessarily the end of the world thanks to WSDL - being able to plug a file into SoapUI and getting an API that you can play around with, something that took Swagger&#x2F;OpenAPI years to reproduce for REST.There&#x27;s something nice to be said about the simplicity of CGI and FastCGI still makes sense with something like PHP (PHP-FPM).I actually still use Apache for hosting my personal stuff - if has most of the features you might want and with mod_md it&#x27;s a bit closer to Caddy than Nginx in getting LetsEncrypt certs (ACME). If you disable .htaccess, reasoning about the config also becomes about as easy as with Nginx (nginx.conf).I&#x27;ve also seen Angular be used reasonably well and the \"batteries included\" feel of it was nice, especially when React had about 1500+ dependencies for a new project. I do personally lean towards Vue, though (oh and migrating away from AngularJS after the EOL was a pain, when that was relevant).My point is that if something is good enough for your needs and helps you put food on the table, then you can just go with that choice.Let those who prefer to experiment do so (hopefully not with your livelihood), celebrate their efforts and successes and learn from their failures, though. Kubernetes is established, Nomad is interesting, even Docker Swarm or Compose is okay. reply ForHackernews 12 hours agoparentprevKuberentes is such an overengineered disaster. In 10 years, everyone is going to wake up with a hangover and pretend they never heard of it. Anyone here built a SOAP system? Of course not, you would never. reply wbl 7 hours agorootparentWhat exactly is over-engineered about it? A lot of the seeming complexity is due to solving things that completing systems didn&#x27;t even try to tackle or did so incompletely.

I’m a hobbyist game dev whose been attempting a deploy of a simple multiplayer game on AWS, specifically gamelift, for about four months.Turns out I thought I knew more than I really did thus I’ve been spending much of my hobbyist time learning more AWS. I’m pretty stubborn about a local dev experience which takes time to establish an appropriate mental model to do. So it goes. Pro tip: find your application “interfaces” and discover what tooling can be used instead of a cloud resource (e.g. a mongoDB compatible document database is the interface to which AWS DocumentDB and MongoDB are concrete implementations). I have a docker compose file I use for local dev. It’s the best setup I’ve found for myself but I am open for advice.Anyways I’d just like to voice myself as a possible target audience. Being able to develop locally is important to me and the hardest parts with AWS is having little support on how exactly to do this. Assuming this is even a fair ask to make…P.S. another pro tip; I use Unity + Mirror networking for my multiplayer games. GameLift requires code integrated into your game code for it to function. I use nested prefabs to handle two cases: (1) when I want gamelift code to execute and (2) when I just want to focus on writing the multiplayer code. My production code uses (1) and I usually do development in (2). (2) is a child of (1).P.P.S. GameLift has a lag of about 2-3 minutes when registering my running game server in Unity editor with a “gamelift anywhere fleet” before it can receive traffic. I didn’t know about this for a while and stressed out over the inconsistency. Make sure to measure timings on this so you don’t go crazy. reply NathanFlurry 18 hours agoparentThanks for the kind words and tips!> Anyways I’d just like to voice myself as a possible target audienceLocal development is tricky, and we have plenty of room for improvement here.Currently we provide a special developer token [1] which will cause API endpoints to return mock responses when used locally. This way, you can use the exact same API with no difference in production & locally, so you don&#x27;t have to mess with nested prefabs.However, this doesn&#x27;t help much with exposing your local machine for testing. We&#x27;ve toyed around with the idea of something similar ngrok built in to our Rivet CLI and integrated in to the API.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rivet.gg&#x2F;docs&#x2F;general&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;dev-tokens#mock-respo... reply sovietmudkipz 11 hours agorootparentTo be honest I do wonder if my fixation with local development is even justifiable. Looking around at projects and documentation I do get the sense that local dev is not a priority, and maybe that isn’t a bad thing. Amazing projects exist. Perhaps other game devs are more resourceful than I am and simply build, working around limitations.I do enjoy learning and this constraint requires I deeply learn. However there is an opportunity cost. reply nextaccountic 11 hours agoprevWhen you say open source, do you mean that I can self host everything and not use your rivet.gg SaSS for anything?What are the features only available in SaSS?

We use EOS for connecting P2P lobbies and doing server browsing. When using unreal that service is basically free. Managing game servers is of course not part of the EOS package but it&#x27;s a big question if your game really needs dedicated servers or could do with p2p lobbies. Running your own servers is quite expensive after all. Also console support is also always a concern for us so whether they check all the boxes so we can use them inside the console ecosystem would be very important to know. reply waughpew 17 hours agoprevSo glad to see open source.

This total is then compared with the total difference for the initial state (which represents 0%).Darker areas have the biggest initial difference, and the whole pic is darker than the initial canvas, so get a lot of paint down and pay most attention to the dark bits, you&#x27;ll soon get over 70%. 85% is v good, and I think 90% is probably possible with enough skill and speed. reply kepano 10 hours agoparentI really wanted to hit 85% but the best I could do was 84.4% https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;t3saf5D.jpegThe scoring system could try to account for perceptual color differences, perhaps by ramping up the saturation of both images when calculating the differences. Since the original painting is relatively desaturated the current scoring mostly incentivizes focusing on light&#x2F;dark rather than shades of color.Lots of other great suggestions in the thread — would be fun to see a leaderboard! reply runnerup 10 hours agorootparentDoing the distance calculation in CIELAB &#x2F; Oklab color space would suffice. reply JoshuaDavid 1 hour agoparentprevI managed to get 80% with only horizontal bars: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;OnhVdyr.

And the company has been keen on keeping the use of its technology “hush hush.” As part of the deal with government agencies, Cellebrite asks users to keep its tech — and the fact that they used it — secret, TechCrunch has learned. This request concerns legal experts who argue that powerful technology like the one Cellebrite builds and sells, and how it gets used by law enforcement agencies, ought to be public and scrutinized. In a leaked training video for law enforcement customers that was obtained by TechCrunch, a senior Cellebrite employee tells customers that “ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime, how you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.” “We don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone,” the employee, who we are not naming, says in the video. For legal experts, this kind of request is troubling because authorities need to be transparent in order for a judge to authorize searches, or to authorize the use of certain data and evidence in court. Secrecy, the experts argue, hurts the rights of defendants, and ultimately the rights of the public. “The results these super-secretive products spit out are used in court to try to prove whether someone is guilty of a crime,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, told TechCrunch. “The accused (whether through their lawyers or through an expert) must have the ability to fully understand how Cellebrite devices work, examine them, and determine whether they functioned properly or contained flaws that might have affected the results.” “And anyone testifying about those products under oath must not hide important information that could help exonerate a criminal defendant solely to protect the business interests of some company,” said Pfefferkorn. Hanni Fakhoury, a criminal defense attorney who has studied surveillance technology for years, told TechCrunch that “the reason why that stuff needs to be disclosed, is the defense needs to be able to figure out ‘was there a legal problem in how this evidence was obtained? Do I have the ability to challenge that?’” The Cellebrite employee claims in the video that disclosing the use of its technology could help criminals and make the lives of law enforcement agencies harder. “It’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally,” the Cellebrite employee says in the video. “We want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome, we definitely don’t want that.” Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper said in an email to TechCrunch that the company “is committed to support ethical law enforcement. Our tools are designed for lawful use, with the utmost respect for the chain of custody and judicial process.” “We do not advise our customers to act in contravention with any law, legal requirements or other forensics standards,” the spokesperson said. “While we continue protecting and expect users of our tools to respect our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information, we also permanently continue developing our training and other published materials for the purpose of identifying statements which could be improperly interpreted by listeners, and in this respect, we thank you for bringing this to our attention.” When asked whether Cellebrite would change the content of its training, the spokesperson did not respond. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s senior staff attorney Saira Hussain and senior staff technologist Cooper Quintin told TechCrunch in an email that “Cellebrite is helping create a world where authoritarian countries, criminal groups, and cyber-mercenaries also are able to exploit these vulnerable devices and commit crimes, silence opposition, and invade people’s privacy.” Cellebrite is not the first company that asks its customers to keep its technology secret. For years, government contractor Harris Corporation made law enforcement agencies who wanted to use its cellphone surveillance tool, known as stingrays, sign a non-disclosure agreement that in some cases suggested dropping cases rather than disclosing what tools the authorities used. These requests go as far back as the mid 2010s, but are still in force today. Here’s the full transcript of the training video: I’m happy you can join us. And I’m happy to kick off this initial module covering the system overview and orientation for Cellebrite Premium. Thank you and enjoy. Did you know that Cellebrite Advanced Services has 10 labs in nine different countries around the world? Well, in order to leverage all of that capacity, we are working together to deliver this training to you, so you will be hearing from colleagues from around the world. The following list are those that comprise this current module set, I hope you enjoy meeting them each. Before we begin, it’s quite important to go over the confidentiality and operational security concerns that we must abide by by using Cellebrite Premium, not only ourselves in our own Cellebrite Advanced Services labs, but most particularly you in your own labs around the world. Well, we must recognize that this capability is actually saving lives. And in situations when it’s too late, we’re helping to deliver closure for the victims’ families, and ultimately solve crimes and put people behind bars. So, it’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally. In a bit more detail, these capabilities that are put into Cellebrite Premium, they are actually trade secrets of Cellebrite, and we want to continue to ensure the viability of them so that we can continue to invest heavily into research and development, so we can give these abilities to law enforcement globally. Your part is to ensure that these techniques are protected as best as you can, and to either consider them as “law enforcement sensitive” or classify them to a higher level of protection in your individual country or agency. And the reason why is because we want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And, if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome.We definitely don’t want that. We’re also aware that the phone manufacturers are continuously looking to strengthen the security of their products. And the challenge is already so difficult as it is, but we still continue to have really good breakthroughs. Please don’t make this any more difficult for us than it already is. And ultimately, we don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone. Ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime. How you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible. And now moving on to operational security or “opsec.” It starts with the physical protection of the premium system and all of its components that you’ve received in the kit. These little bits and pieces that make all this capability… magic. They’re highly sensitive assets, and we want to ensure that no tampering or any other curiosities are employed on these devices. And in some cases, there is the chance of tampering and disabling the component, and that’s something that you really don’t want to do, because it could knock out your agency from having the capability whilst you await a replacement. Additionally, exposure of any of these premium capabilities could be quite harmful to the global law enforcement environment. So, be careful with information sharing, whether it’s in face to face conversations, over the phone, on online discussion groups, via email — other things like that — just try to keep it sensitive and don’t go into any details. When it comes to written documentation, obviously, you don’t want to disclose too much in your court reports. But definitely put the bare minimum to ensure that a layperson can understand the basic concepts of what was done. Certainly mention that you used Premium, you can mention the version, but do not go into detail of what you’ve done with the phone: either manipulating it or whatever shows up on the graphical user interface of premium itself. And when it comes to technical operations and quality management within your organization, please be wary that any document that you put together as a standard operating procedure could be visible by an outside auditor for ISO 17025 or other people that could do a Freedom of Information Act request in your agency in whichever laws of your country. So just be careful with all that. You need to protect this as best as possible. And the other additional factor that you may not be aware of is that failed exploitations on devices — if they’re able to connect to the network — they could phone home and inform the manufacturer that the device is under attack. And with enough knowledge and intelligence, it is possible that the phone manufacturers might find out what we’re doing to achieve this magic. So please do your best to follow all the instructions and make this the best possible procedures [sic] going forward.” From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Wire @lorenzofb, or email lorenzo@techcrunch.com.

The courts are not scientific debate arenas. Burn forensics? Pseudoscience. Bite mark forensics? Pseudoscience. Lots of DNA-based forensics? Totally unreliable. Firearms ballistics forensics? Laughable pseudoscience. Polygraph tests? Laughable pseudoscience. Field sobriety tests &#x2F; \"drug recognition expert\" certifications? Lol, lmao even.All of this nonsense has been successfully used to convict people in court. Turns out, putting someone with PhD after their name or a white lab coat or a phony certification on the stand tends to work for prosecutors. reply AmVess 4 hours agorootparentYou are right on the money. Many of the tools law enforcement uses are straight up hocus pocus, and they lack the training or ability to question their methods.New York&#x27;s main crime lab completely blew DNA testing, and thus rendered all of their results worthless. This went on for many years. Instead of rectifying their mistakes, they swept it under the rug and forgot about it. To this day, thousands of people are in jail based upon wildly incorrect \"science\".It is rather unsettling to know that nearly everything the criminal justice system uses is no better than voodoo, and you are not far away from getting thrown behind bars for little more than the whimsy of people who are empowered to do so. reply buran77 43 minutes agorootparentThe pseudoscience of those forensics is powerful because if has a lot of technobabble that make it sound well supported by evidence, and because it can pass as a science to the jury and even judges. The crime series that people eat up rely on dishing that technobabble step by step so the average person feels like they&#x27;re being educated in detail about something that can apparently be replicated by anyone because \"it&#x27;s science\". Science is for everyone and people can peer behind the curtain to see how the sausage is made.But Cellebrite is unambiguously a private, for profit enterprise. They haven&#x27;t established themselves as a \"science\" like authority in the average person&#x27;s eyes, they actively avoid explaining the processes. They&#x27;re just a company paid by a customer to deliver what the customer wants. So in the average person&#x27;s eyes the difference should be obvious: this isn&#x27;t science, it&#x27;s not for everyone (just for the Police), and the people are not allowed to peer behind the curtain. And like authorities like to say \"honest people don&#x27;t need to hide things\".So as far as jury trials go there may still be a fighting chance. reply saghm 3 hours agorootparentprev> Many of the tools law enforcement uses are straight up hocus pocus, and they lack the training or ability to question their methods.I suspect that the real issue is the lack of incentive; it doesn&#x27;t matter whether they know (or are capable of figuring out) that their science is bunk if there&#x27;s no consequences for the status quo to continue. reply ClumsyPilot 1 hour agorootparentprev> Instead of rectifying their mistakes, they swept it under the rug and forgot about it.Yeah, that should be a crime. Their fraud led to false imprisonment reply duped 4 hours agorootparentprev\"Forensics\" is pseudo science. Little, if any of the \"science\" is peer reviewed. And what is is not convincing to anyone who has an undergraduate experience in a chemistry, biology, or physics classroom and lab. Circumstantial evidence is a lot more convincing than physical evidence, but the TV shows convince us otherwise.There&#x27;s really no incentive for forensic science to be a science at all, at the end of the day. You&#x27;re either working for cops, and paid for evidence to convict their suspect, or working for the defense, and paid to convince us the cops are wrong. There&#x27;s no one paid to tell us what reality we&#x27;re in. reply j16sdiz 2 hours agorootparentPeer-reviewed science have less than a hundred years of history.Even today, Large scale experimental science seldom get review from outside their lab. (Because the lab literally hire every expert in that sub-field)Calling something \"not science\" because it is not peer reviewed is just ignorant reply riedel 1 hour agorootparentprevIt is IMHO a very bad adverse effect of a good thing after all: a world where people decide is probably a better one than one where only science and technology decides (I guess there are enough dystopian novels about this one). The judicial system represents society: I do not think the believe in pseudoscience is any worse or better .Still there is certainly problems relating to the fact that people without money cannot easily produce counterargument and let \"real\" scientists present counterhypotheses. Further there are incentives to sell products to law enforcement that produce simple truth (I would by a product from a critical scientist). Also I think it is human rights problem, if states do not have to fully compensate the damages produced by applying known faulty technology as many other actors would have to. reply alsetmusic 9 hours agorootparentprevPolygraph is inadmissible in court. It’s used for interrogation as a prop. reply foooorsyth 9 hours agorootparentThe US Federal government still uses polygraph in the security clearance process today. In 2013, they indicted several people for teaching others how to beat the test. Here’s the DOJ press release (prepare to lose brain cells):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;owner-polygraph-indicted-alle...Clearly our government and legal system think highly enough of the technique to include it in interview processes. The NSA even has an entire production video rebuking the criticisms of polygraph. It’s not just a tool (in the eyes of the government) used to trick dumb criminals into spilling the beans. reply lozenge 5 minutes agorootparentThey don&#x27;t use readings from the polygraph. It&#x27;s more like a prop they use to try to get to your honest&#x2F;embarrassing truth.You can get false confessions on a polygraph interview but you can also get them in a normal police interview eg with the Reid Technique. reply zer8k 9 hours agorootparentprevNot a justification and only pure speculation but what if there&#x27;s another reason? You can&#x27;t think that the NSA and CIA are stupid. They know its bunk science that has been disproven 1,000 times over. But the psychological effects of being on the machine are very, very measurable.Perhaps its being used as a tool to evaluate a person in other ways. For example, you&#x27;re generally not arrested for admitting to crimes like smoking weed or stealing candy bars from a gas station. But admitting to crimes, or morality divergence (such as adultery), can mean with enough effort a smart intelligence organization could manipulate you. reply judge2020 8 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re not stupid but they have to maintain the shroud of \"this works\", both internally and externally, lest the word get out that \"the intelligence community doesn&#x27;t even believe in their own polygraphs\" reply foooorsyth 8 hours agorootparentThey don’t have to maintain anything. Admit it was a stupid practice and stop doing it. Maintaining appearances makes them look dumb AND stubborn AND unwilling to admit prior mistakes. Yeah, sign me up. reply mewpmewp2 8 hours agorootparentInterview process and courts are different though. If it is used as a vetting tool it would not be a big deal if it scores a false positive if it at the same time is able to identify at least some positives. If you have enough candidates certain accuracy may be worth it. reply Spooky23 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat does “this works” mean? You’re assuming it means to detect lies. Perhaps that’s not the value it brings. reply foooorsyth 9 hours agorootparentprev> You can&#x27;t think that the NSA and CIA are stupidAu contraire reply ch4s3 6 hours agorootparentYou’d be surprised what you can’t get a man of Yale to believe when honor is on the line. reply judge2020 8 hours agorootparentprevAs demonstrated in Oppenheimer, security clearance processing is not one where the US Government must obey any court or evidence rules. They can deny secret access for any reason at all.Did that case against polygraph.com ever go to trial? Sounds like a slam-dunk free speech case, but I imagine the DOJ was willing to settle for anything to avoid that being fought in open court. reply oceanplexian 8 hours agorootparentprevOne of the major reasons I would never work in defense. If I have to prove my worthiness to a clearance system that’s not far off from witchcraft and magic spirits, yeah, I’m gonna pass. Good luck finding intelligent people to work that kind of job. reply foooorsyth 8 hours agorootparentAgreed. Don’t mind them talking to my former neighbors or doing forensic accounting on my bank accounts to make sure I’m not a foreign adversary. Definitely do mind being strapped to polygraph and being forced to pretend that it’s not a complete waste of time for everyone involved. They’re filtering far more smart people than they’re filtering dummies who don’t know the device is just a prop. Can’t make stupidity a part of the hiring process when you’re offering government salary bands. reply jvanderbot 7 hours agorootparentI managed a group of very intelligent programmers with the highest clearance available, including taking polygraphs regularly.They know it&#x27;s just part of the system, and the routine.These folks have a slightly different mindset, and, I think, view procedures as important to weed out people who might cut corners, lean into their ego (how dare they make ME take a polygraph), or be careless with information. A nice side effect of this process is it selects for humility, openness, and conscientiousness.And they view the work they do as hugely important for the security of their nation. Including those who laugh at them for their chosen profession.They were some of the most professional, conscientious, diligent, and excellent technologists I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Definitely on par with anyone at FAANGs or startups that I&#x27;ve work in. reply foooorsyth 7 hours agorootparent>A nice side effect of this process is it selects for humility, openness, and conscientiousness.Or perhaps it selects for submissive, controllable automata that will go along with anything, with no limit on absurdity. Your rationalization of this stupidity is embarrassing. reply jvanderbot 6 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re entitled to that opinion, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great system, but I think it&#x27;s not the lunacy you&#x27;re implying. Military life, for example, involves a lot of bullshit routines, which have ancillary benefits of creating discipline and coherent mindset. I don&#x27;t mind disagreeing about how good or bad this is.But I do want to dispell the idea that people are less intelligent, less capable, or somehow mindless just because they disagree with you about this (Or OP), and choose to be part of it. reply iosystem 2 hours agorootparentBeing skilled != being intelligent reply flextheruler 6 hours agorootparentprevI don’t believe that’s an accurate representation of the situation on either side reply nukeman 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are plenty of cleared jobs that don’t do polygraphs. I work for a DOE contractor. Q-cleared, no poly. The vast majority of positions where I am don’t have a polygraph associated with them. reply redeeman 7 hours agorootparentprevto sibling:> They were some of the most professional, conscientious, diligent, and excellent technologists I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Definitely on par with anyone at FAANGs or startups that I&#x27;ve work in.such a shame they choose the most absolute evil actor to use those qualities for. which brings me to> conscientiousyeah.... I think its pretty much impossible not to know what evil lives openly in those places reply sdsd 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is not true. It&#x27;s a requirement in many states&#x27; probations that probationers undergo regular polygraphy. If they fail the polygraph enough times, they get kicked out of state-mandated therapy and are violated.Thousands of people are in prison right now over failed polygraphs.In places with strong courts that won&#x27;t put up with this, probation officers simply tell the therapist to write up the probationer for some other, vague non-compliance issue should they fail enough polygraphs reply efitz 6 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of the old urban legend about using a photocopier as a polygraph:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rN7pkFNEg5c?t=95 reply sgarland 9 hours agorootparentprevHow is ballistics forensics unreliable? Genuinely curious, I’ve never heard that. reply foooorsyth 9 hours agorootparentIt’s pretty much just complete non-replicable BS. The claim is that the rifling on gun barrels differs from gun to gun, and that they can examine grooves made in the bullets by the rifling and compare them to other rounds shot through the same barrel and find a match. It doesn’t stand up to independent scrutiny, and I would imagine that with modern machining the gun to gun differences in rifling on the same mass produced guns are minimal. Perhaps there are differences in fowling in well-used guns, but the notion that they’re gonna match a flattened bullet to a specific barrel is ridiculous. Basically a few kooks across the country wear white coats and claim that they can do this “science” and prosecutions pay them to be expert witnesses. Juries eat it up. It’s really nuts.The only legitimate analysis they’re doing is ammo brand matching. “Hey, there was a Sellier & Bellot 380 Auto casing at the murder scene. The suspect had S&B 380 in his gun safe. We got him.” reply AnthonyMouse 1 hour agorootparentYou should see the games they play with statistics.Find some 1 in 1000 match. Find another 1 in 1000 match. Claim they&#x27;re independent, so the chances of both of these are 1 in a million.What they don&#x27;t say is that there are 5000 things you can test that each have a 1 in 1000 chance, so you should expect to find ~5 at random if you test them all. The 1 in a million chance is if you choose 2 of the 5000 at random, test only those and they both match; not if you systematically run tests that only notify you when they find one of the matches. reply Modified3019 5 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of another bit of psudeo-science bullshit, claims that bullet wounds can be matched to close bullet size, like saying someone was hit by a 9mm vs .45 cal vs .40 cal if there is no bullet to recover. reply zer8k 9 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s really no way to relate rifling&#x2F;etc to a specific gun. Unless it was forged in some bespoke process that can also be accessed and replicated the rifling pattern will look like 100,000 different guns. Other analysis is also bunk (blood spatter, gunpowder stuff, etc). Ammo matching can provide circumstantial evidence but is likely defeated by just shutting your mouth.Most criminals subject to this are probably caught because they loaded the magazine without gloves and left a fingerprint on the casing that gets completely etched into it on firing. Or, you know, police do actual police work and pressure the right people into narc&#x27;ing on the suspect. reply trowawee 9 hours agorootparentprevRadley Balko has a great overview on the fundamental flaws with ballistics forensics[1]. The tl;dr is that the core claim of ballistics forensic analysis, that it is possible to reliably differentiate between two models of the same gun using just casings and shells fired from those guns, has never been proven to be valid.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radleybalko.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;devil-in-the-grooves-the-... reply klabb3 8 hours agorootparentGreat read, had no idea it was so incredibly bad! Definitely like pseudo-science, with extremely poor reproducibility. And a lot of dishonest massaging of words to make it seem much more certain than it is, benefiting the prosecution only. Imagine being innocent and having an “expert” take the stand and say it’s a “practical impossibility” that the bullet was fired from any other gun. The analogy with the tarot cards seems appropriate.Seems like markings can be exculpatory at best, for instance that casings or bullets clearly don’t match, but that the “unique markings” of an individual barrel is complete BS, especially with precision mass production of modern firearms. But in practice, it seems to rarely exonerate suspects, even if the evidence exists. reply adgjlsfhk1 9 hours agorootparentprevSome of it (e.g. what bullet type) is real, but angles and distances are largely impossible to reliably. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentprevDon’t forget that eyewitness testimony is also pseudoscience- especially cross race identification reply culi 5 hours agorootparentHell why not add juries themselves to the list? A widely cited 2011 study[^0] found that the probability of a jury granting parole was around 65% at the start of a session but dropped to nearly 0% right before lunch. After having lunch the probability again jumps to ~65%What kind of justice system do we have where whether or not people have had lunch is the biggest factor in outcomes?[^0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1073&#x2F;pnas.1018033108 reply thaumasiotes 1 hour agorootparent1. The study you link is the famous one about judges. It doesn&#x27;t mention juries, nor are juries involved in the study.2. Whether or not people have had lunch is not the biggest factor in outcomes. The most important thing you can read about this study is Daniel Lakens&#x27; commentary:> I appreciate that people have tried to think about which mechanism could cause this effect, and if you are interested, highly recommend reading the commentaries (and perhaps even the response by the authors).> But I want to take a different approach in this blog. I think we should dismiss this finding, simply because it is impossible. When we interpret how impossibly large the effect size is, anyone with even a modest understanding of psychology should be able to conclude that it is impossible that this data pattern is caused by a psychological mechanism. As psychologists, we shouldn’t teach or cite this finding, nor use it in policy decisions as an example of psychological bias in decision making.> If hunger had an effect on our mental resources of this magnitude, our society would fall into minor chaos every day at 11:45. Or at the very least, our society would have organized itself around this incredibly strong effect of mental depletion. Just like manufacturers take size differences between men and women into account when producing items such as golf clubs or watches, we would stop teaching in the time before lunch, doctors would not schedule surgery, and driving before lunch would be illegal. If a psychological effect is this big, we don’t need to discover it and publish it in a scientific journal - you would already know it exists.> I think it is telling that most psychologists don’t seem to be able to recognize data patterns that are too large to be caused by psychological mechanisms. There are simply no plausible psychological effects that are strong enough to cause the data pattern in the hungry judges study.

Zero days, obviously fall quite clearly under that since Cellebrite spends a huge amount of money on R&D to find and develop exploits. reply jwilk 3 hours agoprevArchived copy without GDPR nag screen:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230819193912&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunc... reply sneak 10 hours agoprev [–] It&#x27;s funny to me that Apple and the FBI coordinated to spin the whole iPhone decryption thing in the media after the San Bernardino shooting as Apple vs FBI (while in reality the FBI had all the access to all the data they wanted, via iCloud, via an encryption backdoor that Apple explicitly preserved for them).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusiv...Now Apple no doubt would love to do some RE on these devices to identify and patch any exploits they use, and many of the local PDs that can get Cellebrite to sell them these boxes probably will abide by these terms, having previously been convinced via Apple&#x2F;FBI propaganda that Apple is opposed to cooperating with law enforcement.It&#x27;s a little bit funny, but I think Apple security will win out in the long run as it only takes one instance of a leak for Apple to patch a vulnerability, and they do have a lot of money (and the cooperation of the FBI&#x2F;DHS et al). The text of the training quoted in the article makes it seem that Cellebrite knows they are fighting an ultimately losing battle there, as information never becomes more secret over time, only less so. reply dcastonguay 10 hours agoparentIIRC that&#x27;s not how any of it went down. The authorities wanted access to the device itself and were asking for a \"good guys only\" backdoor into the device to obtain anything that might not have been in the iCloud backup; Apple refused to do this and that is where the controversy &#x2F; news story came from.Apple was very open about the fact that law enforcement would have access to the iCloud backup, which is even mentioned in the article you provided. And there was no \"backdoor explicitly preserved\" for the FBI, the iCloud backup was just not e2ee. This was also (somewhat) common knowledge at the time and what was often suggested was to do backups through iTunes because there was still an option available to encrypt the backup. reply saagarjha 10 hours agoparentprevCellebrite keeps the good stuff on their premises.

But…the absence of GPS for more than a few hours is pretty weird. An automatic reboot and maybe nuke could be appropriate for some users. I guess then the faraday cage also needs a fake gps signal to defeat this. replykanbara 10 hours agoparentprev [–] except apple now has e2ee for iCloud, and apple still doesnt want others to get into their firmware and secure enclaves reply smoldesu 9 hours agorootparentThe fact that we have to call it \"their firmware and secure enclaves\" is a bit telling, though. The majority of consumer-facing devices today have a layer of inscrutability that we leave up to the manufacturer to implement properly. For instance, Microsoft has Bitlocker, but I couldn&#x27;t confidently say that isn&#x27;t backdoored either.Apple has whitepapers, but they&#x27;re about as verifiable as LK-99 in-practice. Their security model entirely revolves around the Apple-issued root of trust, and if you can&#x27;t trust them then you have to hit the bricks. If you don&#x27;t own both ends, the end-to-end encryption shtick is a theatrical farce. reply kanbara 3 hours agorootparentsure, all clouds are other people’s computers; laypeople just want things to work and don’t really care about whose root of trust they use.living in a world where you run everything yourself sounds good in practice but then you can’t communicate with anyone else.i’d like for the firmware to be open source and for the cloud to be federated, but it’s a pipe dream and i’m busy so i just gotta trust apple in the end reply gochi 8 hours agorootparentprevIt can potentially be a theatrical farce, but you&#x27;ve only created hypothetical scenarios in your mind for why that might be the case. Even if you did \"own both ends\", you still have to rely on other parties to contribute the pieces that you don&#x27;t watch over, unless you&#x27;re going to be E2EE from scratch (again, because you can hypothetically just say \"well what if the encryption scheme itself is backdoored\"). reply smoldesu 8 hours agorootparentBoth of those conceits apply to Apple&#x27;s scheme as well, though. Transparency enforces accountability, Apple themselves wouldn&#x27;t be using things like OpenSSL and bash if they weren&#x27;t open enough to scrutinize and modify. reply sneak 10 hours agorootparentprev [–] e2ee for iCloud is opt in (ie disabled by default) so approximately 0% of iCloud users use it.Until it&#x27;s on by default for new iCloud accounts and previous non-e2ee iCloud accounts get automatically upgraded to use it, the fact that it is offered is basically irrelevant.Additionally if you are using it to protect your iMessages, it&#x27;s ineffective, as your iMessages are stored on Apple servers twice: once for each end of the conversation. Unless both you and the other end of your conversation have both explicitly opted in to e2ee for iCloud, a single party enabling the setting does nothing for the security of iMessage, given that approximately nobody uses the feature today. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Skip to main content The Verge homepage / Tech/ Reviews/ Science/ Entertainment/ More Menu TECH/GADGETS/DESKTOPS WD refused to answer our questions about its self-wiping SanDisk SSDs / Months later, the company has nothing to say for itself. By Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. Aug 18, 2023, 1:35 PM PDT|49 Comments / 49 New Share this story Don’t buy the SanDisk Extreme. Image: Western Digital Eleven days ago, we sent these questions to Western Digital’s head of PR and published them publicly on The Verge: Why are these drives still on sale? Will you offer free data recovery services to affected customers? When? Are you proactively warning customers and retailers who have already purchased these drives that significant data loss is possible? If not, why not? What, exactly, is going wrong with these drives? How did this happen? What’s the fuss? For months, the company has been laughably silent about how its pricey portable SanDisk Extreme SSDs might lose all your data. It happened to my colleague Vjeran Pavic twice. It happened to Ars Technica. It happened to PetaPixel. Months after our inquiries, Western Digital continues to sell these drives due to deep discounts, fake Amazon reviews, and issues with Google Search that rank favorable results far higher than warnings about potential failures. We have now received a response from Western Digital head of PR Robin Schultz, but nothing about the company’s stance has changed. Schultz repeatedly refused to answer any of our questions. Her statement doesn’t even contain an acknowledgment of the issue and has no specific timeline for any real answers. The only reason we’re printing Western Digital’s statement is so you can see it for yourself: In response to recent reports of concerns about specific Western Digital portable SSD products, we want to assure our valued customers that we are taking all measures necessary to address any product-related issues. We understand the significance of our products to our customers and we take these matters very seriously. We are conducting a comprehensive review to gain a thorough understanding of the issues. After getting the statement, we asked Schultz three times whether Western Digital would answer our questions. Each time, she deflected. She also wouldn’t provide any idea of when the company might share its conclusions — if ever. There is one possible reason Western Digital is finally speaking up and yet saying nothing: the company just got sued. As The Register reports, California resident Nathan Krum has filed a prospective class action lawsuit, citing breach of contract, fraudulent and unfair business practices, and many other claims. Krum is suing over both the SanDisk Extreme drive itself and damages for any data lost. You can read the full complaint at the bottom of this story. And that’s just lawsuit number one: Ars Technica reports there are two more. Three SanDisk SSD lawsuits in total, each seeking class-action status for the same failures. Western Digital was already forced into a class action settlement over a previous questionable practice: in 2020, the company brazenly tried to sneak SMR drives into its “WD Red” lineup marketed for network-attached storage devices. The company paid $5.7 million to settle those claims. The company’s tricks didn’t end there: Western Digital’s NAS disks have started triggering warnings even if there’s nothing wrong with a drive, seemingly to scare people into buying new ones simply after three years have gone by. I won’t be buying a Western Digital or SanDisk product anytime soon. Update, 12:25AM ET: Added that there are actually three lawsuits, not just one, against WD. 49 COMMENTS49 NEW Most Popular WD refused to answer our questions about its self-wiping SanDisk SSDs Lamborghini’s Lanzador EV concept has over one megawatt of peak power Linus Tech Tips pauses production as controversy swirls Pornhub’s parent company is changing its name to total nonsense AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, rules a US Federal Judge Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

Three SanDisk SSD lawsuits in total, each seeking class-action status for the same failures.Good. I don&#x27;t really care about whether WD answers questions, I care about them losing a lawsuit and having punitive damages per affected customer that are far more than the retail value of each product, due to loss of data.I am baffled by why WD isn&#x27;t voluntarily issuing product recalls, replacements, and&#x2F;or firmware updates as necessary in this situation -- the hit they&#x27;re taking to their reputation is far worse in the long run. But fortunately we have the courts. reply j-bos 17 hours agoparentI agree, I&#x27;ve naively trusted the SanDisk brand but just today I went compared and bought an SSD, didn&#x27;t even look a WD or SanDisk. Their name is now tainted in my book. reply Tijdreiziger 16 hours agorootparentInterestingly Framework (the laptop company) ships exclusively WD SSDs, although I suppose you can bring your own SSD if you really want.Though I wonder which other brands are trustable? Just yesterday I read a comment on another thread mentioning how Samsung’s firmware is subpar (which, having owned several other Samsung products, doesn’t surprise me). reply mceachen 6 hours agorootparentSK Hynix is an OEM supplier for a bunch of brands, and seems to have good ratings across several different e-tailers.As for anecdata, I chew through SSDs due to high disk I&#x2F;O loads from running continuous integration test suites for PhotoStructure on a bunch of different test rigs. I&#x27;ve had several WD and Samsung SSDs fail, but have yet to kill one of my 10+ SK Hynix sticks.The best solution, of course, is to have automated backups in place, so drive failure is only a minor inconvenience, not a tragedy. reply wtallis 14 hours agorootparentprevThe solution is to give up on the entire idea of brand loyalty. These are commodity products. None of the products or companies are 100% reliable. To some extent, you get what you pay for, but paying more won&#x27;t guarantee a trouble-free experience. When some brands command a premium price in the market, across their entire product line, that&#x27;s really just a sign that they&#x27;ve managed to get customers to think their products are special. But everyone has shipped some lemons, and everyone has screwed over somebody with bad customer support. reply frognumber 14 hours agorootparentNo, I don&#x27;t think so. Off-brands are hyper-unreliable. There is a stack of chips for reliability, ranked from 100% working, to ones which e.g. have half disabled, or ECC+scrambler.On-brands at least &#x2F;try&#x2F; to be reliable. Off-brands don&#x27;t.WD&#x2F;Sandisk is a little weird, in that they went from on-brand to off-brand.I also haven&#x27;t seen many lemons from Crucial. They control the process end-to-end, and don&#x27;t really go for bleeding-edge performance or rock-bottom price. For me, they&#x27;ve always been good and reliable for both memory and flash.Kingston, Lexar, and Sandisk were premium brands which really tried to be reliable, until WD bough Sandisk.Samsung cares about reputation too, but pushes performance a bit more, so you sometimes get lemons. But on the whole, they at least try. reply wtallis 12 hours agorootparent> Off-brands are hyper-unreliable. There is a stack of chips for reliability, ranked from 100% working, to ones which e.g. have half disabled, or ECC+scrambler.Nah, that&#x27;s not at all accurate. There are tons of small brands that have both dirt-cheap drives built using whatever components are cheap that week, and more expensive products using high-grade current-generation flash and controllers. Kingston and Lexar brands operate that way, too, with a mix of cheap crap and more expensive products with quality components (often overpriced). And some of the small brands don&#x27;t really do bottom-of-the-barrel drives at all (eg. Corsair, Sabrent). And certainly Crucial&#x2F;Micron have had their fair share of serious SSD issues. Brand just isn&#x27;t the reliable indicator of quality that you and many other consumers wish it was. reply paulmd 9 hours agorootparentprevNo. Some of the best brands are the ones you’ve never heard of like innogrit and phison, because they’re the ones making the chips everyone else uses. Most companies are just building out reference designs from one of these handful of companies and the quality is completely identical.And the ones who aren’t, like Samsung, are notorious for even worse reliablity.The situation is completely reversed from 10 years ago, these are commodity products now and the people who use the reference design do better than the ones who go their own way, like Samsung. Samsung’s reliability has been worse than a random small brand like innogrit or Sabrent in the modern era, 100%. reply Tijdreiziger 14 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn’t really consider WD an off-brand. Off-brands to me are the cheapie no-name brands from China. reply philistine 10 hours agorootparentColloquially, those are the six-letter brands.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;NNfO3 reply frognumber 14 hours agorootparentprevCrucial is my go-to brand for reliability at reasonable prices.Otherwise:* Kingston has an excellent reputation for reliability, as does Lexar, but you often pay a premium.* Samsung and Intel are considered good, but they do occasionally make specific subpar models.Crucial is my go-to, thought.I also buy direct to avoid knock-offs. Buying premium brands from eBay or Amazon especially makes no sense, since knock-offs are so !@#$% common. reply Smoosh 11 hours agorootparentKingston were being anti-consumer around 10 years ago.

Charge went through on my CC for replacement drive + $25 advanced RMA fee + shipping.I sent Apple Card CS team a transcript of my interactions with WD, they filled a chargeback for everything. reply jjoonathan 18 hours agorootparentSimilar story with an $800 Asus monitor. The power supply blew inside warranty, I shipped it back in the original packaging, and they flaked on the warranty because the panel was cracked. Almost certainly on their side. They strong-armed the matter, but my proof pictures were a bit fuzzy so I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a small claims case or anything. They won. Ugh.Similar story with a $300 Fitbit. The battery died inside warranty (shorted capacitor) and they flaked. I bought off Amazon, but I guess you have to watch closely which store because only some of them come with a \"manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.\" Really? They can mention a manufacturer&#x27;s warranty in advertising and then just drop it in fine print somewhere? Ugh.Warranties are trash in the US. reply salad-tycoon 17 hours agorootparentHappens a lot with Amazon. They’ve been making it harder to find 1st party shipped and sold for sometime now. received a nice set of knives for wedding that instantly rusted, I then discovered all the things on my list were sold from sketchy third party, I then proceeded to free return many many pounds of kitchenware, cast iron, etc because ain’t nobody got time for counterfeit nonsense. This was a handful of years ago and it’s only gotten worse.There’s a lot more shady things going on with mismatched skus and reviews. What you see is often not what you get. Amazon is gutter level now. reply j-bos 17 hours agorootparentprevAmex buyer protection is great for these situations. reply creer 17 hours agorootparentprevThank you for pointing out the specific Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act vs sticker and such. Appreciate it. reply pixl97 18 hours agorootparentprevUh yea, probably should be sent to the state attorney for that bullshit. reply antisthenes 17 hours agorootparentprevAt this point SSDs are so cheap, I&#x27;m inclined to just buy a 7.5TB Enterprise SSD from Kioxia for $800 and call it a day.I understand that&#x27;s pretty expensive for a hard drive and probably not in most people&#x27;s budget, but having an enterprise drive seems like it would avoid most quality issues.Also, 7.5TB of SSD space is a good amount to last me a while. reply jl_418 16 hours agorootparentI am considering something like that, and noticed some enterprise &#x2F; data center SSD makers do not publish firmware updates. Checking as I type this: Kioxia seems to only have consumer SSD firmware&#x2F;tools&#x2F;binaries. Micron has a list of firmware downloads for their drives. Samsung seems to have only consumer SSD firmware&#x2F;tools, except for SM&#x2F;PM863. Solidigm has a comprehensive status and download page for their drive firmware, including all(?) previously-Intel drives. Western Digital seems to only have consumer drive firmware available without a support ticket.I am discounting whether email support could provide firmware, as I believe firmware updates should be as easy to access as possible (and have read forum posts describing the issues encountered when trying and usually failing to request via support channels). - If I missed something, please post it, would be good to know. reply lldb 17 hours agorootparentprevI use enterprise SSDs now for the same reason - serverpartdeals has been reliable so far and has old stock 8TB under $500. reply Tijdreiziger 16 hours agorootparentprevYou’re still going to want backups though, and at that point, drive failures shouldn’t be catastrophic because you can just restore onto a fresh drive. reply ciupicri 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but can you use it in a regular desktop (not to mention laptop) since it doesn&#x27;t use M.2? reply SomeoneFromCA 18 hours agorootparentprevTheir CMR 5400 WD Reds are the best drives nowadays quiet and fast. reply ta988 17 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t need any kind of support maybe. reply yla92 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat are other good options ? reply javajosh 18 hours agorootparentprev>Don&#x27;t buy anything from WD.I don&#x27;t doubt your bad experience. But do you really think that there do not exist other customers of other vendors with similar, or even worse, stories? The tacit assumption is that if even one such story exists, then one should avoid the vendor, but I question if that&#x27;s ever really possible past a certain scale. (Which is an indictment of scale itself! But that&#x27;s another discussion)It reminds me of an HN post during the Covid lockdowns telling people not to go to the hospital because they got MRSA at a hospital and were still dealing with it years later. It&#x27;s not that they were lying, it&#x27;s that they were giving bad advice based on their experience. It&#x27;s a risk&#x2F;reward calculation. If one bad experience is enough to delegitimize every service or product, then there would be NO services or products available to us. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 17 hours agorootparentI agree with what you’re saying but this talk of WD customer support going silent after a customer points them to a law they seem to be breaking -- and then proceeding to actually violate said law -- is not something I would write off as simply a bad consumer experience. reply twothamendment 19 hours agoparentprevMy parents still have one.

Granted, they where WD Green, an especially cursed series, but I‘ve not bought another WD product since. reply Tijdreiziger 16 hours agorootparentI haven’t had any such problems across various WD drives. They have marketing shenanigans (what with the Red&#x2F;Red Plus thing) but the drives themselves seem to be solid in my experience (haven’t tried any of their SSDs though).I feel like back in the day, it was actually Seagate who had the bad reputation, but when recently looking at the Backblaze stats, it seemed that all three remaining brands (WD, Seagate and Toshiba) are solid. reply philsnow 13 hours agorootparentIt depends how far back your \"back in the day\" is.. for me, the meme bad hard drive manufacturer was IBM with their Deathstar^W Deskstar driveshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deskstar#IBM_Deskstar_75GXP_fa... reply inversetelecine 19 hours agoparentprevEven their physical hdds you have to be careful.I haven’t kept up with their SSDs but last I remember they are still competitive&#x2F;good there. reply treprinum 19 hours agorootparentMy x299 board refused to boot from a 2TB WD SSD drive with a single memory chip (forgot which color it was)... No issues with Crucial, Samsung nor Intel. reply splix 18 hours agoparentprevI wrote about my experience with broken SSDs before. I had that one from SunDisk, and when it broke, I contacted support. Without much difficulty, I received a replacement, which works fine. I also had the same problem with a Samsung SSD, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get any meaningful response from them at all.So the lesson is not about the broken drives, as all of them could be broken.

For sequential it&#x27;s up to 3x with full stripe writes, up to 3x in random.2. Reads in a mirror can&#x27;t be &#x27;distributed&#x27; for the sequential access anyway - repositioning would eat all benefits, it&#x27;s always faster to read further than to seek and read.3. For 4 drives it&#x27;s negligible4. You can even swap in smaller drives, if your total dataset would fit, no hard limit5.

Yes, two mirrored vdevs are not the highest performance configuration for four devices, but they beat a single raidz vdev, which was the suggestion from the prior poster.2. Random reads are more important than sequential for desktop responsiveness, and mirrors can serve different reads from each disk in the mirror, effectively doubling IOPS (minus overheads).5. I am not sure I understand here. It seems like you&#x27;re suggesting 3 data drives and a parity drive. This would allow at most one drive loss before data loss. Two mirrors allow at least one drive loss and up to two drive losses. If there were two parity drives, this would allow up to two drive losses without data losses, but it seems this would have to reduce your claim in point (1) to being 2x performance, since two drives would have to be used for parity writes. reply justsomehnguy 13 hours agorootparentOuch.2. Double IOPS sounds good on paper, at 100% it is still to slow, 100 IOPS at best.5. Wait. Mirrored mirror (RAID11) on 4 drives would net you only 10TB usable.&#x27;Mirrored pair&#x27; sounds like an ordinary RAID10 which can tolerate 1 drive loss because it&#x27;s no longer redundant for half of the data. &#x27;It can tolerate another loss on the still redundant data&#x27; is... like pulling out - works most of the time, but some become parents on the first try.Hence RAID5 have the same redundancy tolerance (1 drive loss for losing R.) then, anything other is gambling.The better question - do you have a proper backup to protect from a logical corruption? Even RAID11 wouldn&#x27;t help from rf -rf in the wrong path. reply greggyb 12 hours agorootparentIt is objectively measurable and subjectively it feels better than tests on a single drive for day to day activity.

In a worst case failure scenario, I can lose one.These two descriptions of resiliency simply are not the same. I would obviously not run the pool in a degraded state for any longer than it takes to resilver the degraded mirror.Assuming disk failures are independent and one disk has already failed:- 2 mirror vdevs: 1&#x2F;3 chance that a second disk failure causes data loss, 2&#x2F;3 chance that it affects the other mirror- 4 disks w&#x2F; 1 parity: 100% chance that a second disk failure causes data loss.Again, this simply is not the same characterization of resilience. Please do not mistake this for me claiming that running this pool with three disks is anything other than a situation to remediate immediately.I take regular snapshots, and scrub regularly to ensure data integrity. Critical data is stored in at least three places, one of which is not my home. reply srhtftw 10 hours agorootparent> Please do not mistake this for me claiming that running this pool with three disks is anything other than a situation to remediate immediately.About a decade and a half ago I setup a 48 drive Sun 4540 this way. The OS needed 2 dedicated drives on the first controller so I assigned two neighboring drives on that controller near the intake fans as hot spares. The remaining drives were organized into mirror pairs with each drive on a separate controller. The final root was a concatenation of the pairs.This setup proved to be very robust. Although I left the company when financial troubles pushed the founders into a messy divorce, one of the founders asked me to come back a few years later after they restructured. The 4540 had been moved to a new colo but otherwise ignored because none of the admins knew Solaris or bothered to check the monitoring systems.When I returned I discovered in the time I was away 4 drives had failed but ZFS&#x2F;smf happily took two of the failed drives offline and replaced them with the spares. The two other failed drives left their respective pools degraded but functional. Replacing the failed drives was easy once they arrived.Although neglected for years, none of the applications or databases that relied on that server ever suffered any downtime from the drive failures. reply justsomehnguy 9 hours agorootparentprev> These two descriptions of resiliency simply are not the same. I would obviously not run the pool in a degraded state for any longer than it takes to resilver the degraded mirror.Then you are just wasting 10TBs.I&#x27;m firmly in Murphy&#x27;s camp regarding the storage troubles (hell, I can&#x27;t find a specific pic of my passed dog which I know I had from 4 (four!) copies of my photos, ffs) and I treat RAID just as a mean to increase availability.In your case, if you really wouldn&#x27;t run the degraded array until it is resilvered then your availability is excessive in the all cases except:how long it would take you to recover&#x2F;restore your data in a catastrophic failure?And why do you have only the critical data 3-2-1ed? reply greggyb 8 hours agorootparentFor the third time, my plan for growing the pool is based on being able to swap in new drives to trade them out with one existing drive in current mirror vdevs. As described previously, this allows me to grow two drives at a time and reduce risk of simultaneous failure in a vdev. As I mentioned before, this sort of swapping is not possible without degrading a raidz vdev.As you have brought up, this configuration optimizes resilvering speed, aka minimizing time spent in a degraded state. Resilvering a mirror is faster than resilvering a raidz, as it requires only sequential read from the good drive and sequential write to the new drive. Resilvering a raidz thrashes all drives in the vdev and requires re-calculating parity along the way. Is it more likely that one of three drives in the degraded raidz1 fails during resilvering or that the one drive in the degraded mirror fails? That is a tough question to answer. What if all the drives are the same age? Well then the likelihood is greater that a resilver will cause a cascading failure. Hence my thrice-repeated desire to use the ability to swap new drives into old vdevs to mix ages, and my mixed-brand vdevs, as described in the root of this thread.In short, resilvering is the highest-risk phase in a pool&#x27;s lifecycle. I am paying an extra drive&#x27;s worth of storage to optimize around this risk, and also to realize performance benefits we have discussed upthread.Again, I will state that objectively measurable improvements combined with subjective perception of better desktop performance is sufficient for me to claim that the performance improvement matters.My non-critical data is largely recoverable. Things like VM images and installers. These can be re-created and deployed from code that is in the critical portion, or downloaded from the internet. Indeed, my DR plan does not account for broad internet outages concurrent with a drive failure. A lot of the rest of the non-critical data is media that could be re-ripped from physical media (DVDs, Blu-rays). Being recoverable, it is not worth it to me to pay for cloud storage for the rest. Even \"wasting\" a drive&#x27;s worth of storage, it is still a lot cheaper per gigabyte-year to ... you know, not pay for that.So, why do you care so much about my specific storage setup?

That is a tough question to answerNot that tough. If the load of 4 drives working bring them to malfunction then resilvering by pairs only prolongs the agony a bit and technically you are now 2 (or even 3 or 4) times more susceptible to a failure during rebuild (foreach stripe what would fail).> Hence my thrice-repeated desire to use the ability to swap new drives into old vdevs to mix ages, and my mixed-brand vdevs, as described in the root of this thread.LVM allows that without limits imposed by ZFS.

If there was a need to do something with this setup (and not limited to ZFS), I would consider the following:use a part of the disks as a RAID5 (3+1) for the WORM-like data (ripped DVDs, installers etc): greater SEQ and RND access, more usable spacerunning RAID11 for the super critical data (so you can really lose 3 drives until you lose redundancy)there are also an option to run one mirror and another mirror or two simple volumes to have a protection against the logical failure, but you have ZFS snapshots which covers this use-case, for the most partOf course this is just fishes for though at best and again with ZFS (and [1]) there is not that much leeway, less the need to do anything.[0] heh[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37190493 replybradleyjg 16 hours agoparentprevThe only reliable storage solutions are s3, abs, gcs, etc. Nothing I’m doing at home is going to come close. reply greggyb 8 hours agorootparentAs an example, one thing I use my storage pool for is streaming movies via Plex (from Blu-rays I own).

I also haven&#x27;t seen as much hard data on SSDs and they&#x27;ve been evolving so fast, so everything feels a lot murkier. At least with spinning rust we have Backblaze&#x27;s drive stats going back many years now.- If it&#x27;s a single drive situation and reliability is very important, something aimed at \"enterprise\" tends to be a good bet. More firmware testing, more over provisioning, and so on. And if nothing else there tends to be less BS around getting warranty coverage honored. Also costs significantly more. Micron, Intel D3s etc.- If it&#x27;s multi-drive, don&#x27;t focus on finding the one best brand, use ones from different major brands with redundancy. The goal isn&#x27;t to try to ensure no drive failures, but rather lower the risk of correlated drive failures so that when they happen the system has time to restore redundancy and there&#x27;s no issue.- If it&#x27;s single drive and some down time is acceptable for cost then just roll the dice, though even there I&#x27;d stay away from QLC and the ultra mega bargain basement stuff.In all cases buy from somewhere reputable that actually sells drives directly, like B&H or CDW or the like. If you buy from Amazon beware of counterfeits and also \"new\" stuff that is heavily used.

I mean, putting aside whether SSDs themselves make sense in such an application at all vs spinning rust (same money will buy you a nice 14TB hard drive), but to the extent they do I still think the above holds. QLC is just physically fundamentally sketchier tech. And how sure are you (and how much trouble do you want to go through) about what your workload will be like long term? If you put the money&#x2F;time investing into getting together a decent little SSD NAS with a bunch of terabytes, and then a year or two down the road want to have some VMs on it too, or have a fileshare and then it gets hit harder than you expected, or there&#x27;s some bug that causes some write amplification, and then your QLC drives end up hosed was that really worth a few cups of coffee?Maybe so! SMR really is worth it to a few places as well. Or ZFS dedup for a software example (with hardware implications).

I say \"try\" because Dell makes it hard to tell who makes the different drives, but sometimes you can track it down by the specs or part numbers.Our buying cycle a couple years ago we ended up with some \"Toshiba THNSN81Q92CSE 1.92TB SATA eSSD\" in two systems, and ran into some severe performance issues, system IO wait time going through the roof. Ended up spending significant time with Dell support, them identifying a couple drives in each box to replace, and also doing full \"RAID chain\" replacements (controller, cabling, backplane). All of the replacement drives we&#x27;ve gotten have been Intel 1.92TB, so maybe Dell is seeing problems with Toshiba? Since then the systems have been solid, so maybe it was part of the RAID chain.Aside: Decades ago, right when Intel was coming out with their SSDs, I had a consulting client that was a Rural ISP. Their NFS server was on 8x 10K WD hard drives in RAID-10. The continually struggled with performance, and we kept tuning, but would regularly just outrun the IOPS, mostly with e-mail access. A friend of mine happened to have a 600GB Intel SSD production sample, so I asked if I could borrow it for a few weeks. Sent this laptop SSD that would fit in the palm of my hand out to this client, had them hook it up to the NFS server, and then did \"pvmove\" from the RAID array over to the laptop drive. Steadily, over the next few hours, the performance issues were gone. It was pretty fantastic to see an 8 drive RAID array bested by a laptop form factor drive. reply jeffbee 15 hours agorootparentThis can hardly have been a surprise. Intel&#x27;s very first mass market SSD from 15 years ago had enough IOPS to embarrass a whole room full of HDDs, and unless you know exactly what you are doing, a Linux NFS server will not benefit from any width of RAID-0 due to concentrating all filesystem metadata load on a single disk or pair of disks in the array. reply tagyro 16 hours agoparentprevMight not be the answer you want, but I found it easier to not trust any brand and instead opt for a mirror-RAID approach. Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive (and still has its own risks) but (IMO) it&#x27;s better than trusting any manufacturer. reply whitepoplar 18 hours agoparentprevSamsung Pro-series NVMe seems to be liked quite a bit. reply feedsmgmt 18 hours agorootparentThey have been having issues https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;pc-maker-pulls-samsu... reply jeffbee 17 hours agorootparentDamn, it&#x27;s incredible how much HN hates AMP, and how much better and faster this AMP presentation is compared to Ars&#x27; usual hostile layout. reply SomeoneFromCA 18 hours agorootparentprevThey have problems in Linux with autotrim, to the extent Ubuntu put trimming script into cron, if it detects Samsung SSD when installed. reply whitepoplar 16 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the best NVMe drive for linux these days?

Drive failures are more correlated than you think. If you bought and installed the drives at the same time, such a failure case is totally expected. The drives probably came from the same batch, and experienced similar amount of wear, so it&#x27;s only logical that they experienced the same failure case. reply voytec 18 hours agorootparentAh, the RAID array love story: one of many similar disks fails, you replace it, array starts rebuilding which causes an increase of reads from other drives and before rebuild is complete, more disks from the same batch start failing.I don&#x27;t deal with storage hardware much for some 6+ years, since I&#x27;ve switched to cloudy solutions. But at the beginning of my shared storage building journey, I considered arrays built from different disks somewhat \"lame\" or \"unprofessional\". I changed this viewpoint 180° after seeing multiple similar drives fail in a very short (hours, days) timespan for the second time.I now have more trust for home-built ZFS setup using different disks than a dedicated storage appliance using enterprise-grade disks with almost following serial numbers. reply katbyte 17 hours agorootparentRaid array should always be scrubbed every few months to prevent this exact situation reply singron 7 hours agorootparentScrubbing helps fix random errors in the drive data, but it won&#x27;t prevent correlated disk failure. If a drive fails during the scrub, then you still have to replace the disk, and it&#x27;s still very likely that another disk can fail in that time. If you just want to eliminate lemons, then you can do a burn-in test before adding it to your array, but IMO even bad disks usually don&#x27;t fail that quickly. reply nabeards 15 hours agorootparentprevScrubbed as in erased?

I only choose RAID-10 for this reason, because I&#x27;d rather have most of my data than none of it. reply bbarnett 19 hours agorootparentprevThese are spinning disks, not SSDs. Spinning disks are not known to fail like this, unless the manufacturer made a horrible mistake. reply ralferoo 19 hours agorootparentSpinning disks absolutely do fail this way. Drives from the same batch can easily work 5+ years fine and then fail within a few hours of each other. Even worse, in a RAID the additional load from starting a new replication after a hot swap can push a borderline drive over the edge, and this is precisely the time when your data is at its most vulnerable.I&#x27;ve worked at places where they always maintained a sizable inventory of new disks so that every time a new machine was provisioned, it would receive a RAID comprising of at least 3 disks bought from different batches at least a couple of months apart from each other, and as much as possible from different suppliers. reply gruez 19 hours agorootparentprevOn the contrary. The same principle applies to them. Spinning disks might not have NAND cells that wear out, but they have other parts that have manufacturing defects and can experience wear: bearings, actuators, heads, etc. If you have 100 identical cars that rolled off the assembly line in sequence, you would their failure date to be be clustered, rather than being evenly distributed. reply nottorp 19 hours agorootparentOn a tangent, wouldn&#x27;t it make it safer if you didn&#x27;t start a NAS with a bunch of identical drives, but you got them from different manufacturers and models?They&#x27;ll still fail, but hopefully they&#x27;d be less likely to do it at the same time. reply Filligree 19 hours agorootparentYes, that’s generally good advice. reply stOneskull 16 hours agorootparentthis is news to me and taken away my excitement of having my first nas. it&#x27;s very good to know though. i wonder about good-guy computer stores, mixing batches for naive customers like me, ordering 2 identical drives thinking it was best. it&#x27;s crazy, it really defeats the purpose of raid 1 if both drives are likely to fail at the same time. i guess i should buy another different brand drive, and keep one of the current pair in a drawer as the future replacement. reply Filligree 16 hours agorootparentTo take some further wind out, with current disk sizes there’s a decent chance of a second disk failing while you’re still replacing the first. Reading all the data off a disk is a stressful operation, you see.But that means you need RAIDZ2 or erasure coding to be reasonably safe, which takes you well outside what most of these turnkey systems can handle. reply stOneskull 14 hours agorootparentmaybe i&#x27;ll start a data-recovery savings account instead.. for whenever it happens reply Filligree 9 hours agorootparentBackblaze works well enough. replybbarnett 19 hours agorootparentprevSSDs in raids famously all failed at once. Spinning disks basically don&#x27;t, outside of (typically) firmware faults. Out of 100000 spinning disks I&#x27;ve managed, I&#x27;ve never had them fail at the same time.Mechanical things don&#x27;t fail as evenly as digital things. reply pixl97 18 hours agorootparentAs someone that has set up a lot of NAS devices, we&#x27;re talking thousands of disks over the years, I would not put my money on your statement.There are a lot of simultaneous failure modes. HP had one in SMART firmware that killed disks at some fixed number of hours.There are also temperature excursion events that can lead to arrays failing within 10s of hours of each other, not enough time to do a full rebuild of a single disk.Seagate had really crappy 3&#x2F;4 tb disks that loved to fail rapidly and nearly all at once. reply dragontamer 17 hours agorootparentIntel also had a famous bug &#x2F; &#x27;feature&#x27; where the SSD refuses to respond after a fixed number of writes.If all your drives were Intel and part of the same array, they&#x27;d all fail at exactly the same time.Reliable storage is hard. reply bbarnett 17 hours agorootparentprevSo your examples of failures include a firmware example, which I said \"outside of\", and an example where the drives were abused?And another poster os talking about SSDs?Sigh reply Volundr 19 hours agorootparentprevEh? I&#x27;ve been admining raid arrays since before SSDs were a thing. Making sure you build your array from disks from different batches to reduce the likelihood of simultaneously failing has always been the advice.I make no assertion as to WD quality, but failures like you describe have been the bane of sysadmins quite some time. reply Spooky23 17 hours agorootparentprevLol.It happens. On my first job a batch of drives started failing daily, in sequential order by serial number. There was a bearing defect - the vendor ended up replacing about 400 drives, which meant many weekends of migration and restores. reply bbarnett 17 hours agorootparentSounds like the exception that makes the rule.Just because you were in a plane crash, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s common or frequent.(With an apology to that guy who was hit with a nuclear weapon twice) reply Spooky23 3 hours agorootparentIt happens.

Maybe the issue is elsewhere, like the HBA or the motherboard ?For the story, I have a NAS with an AMD B550 motherboard and some Asmedia SATA controllers with a bunch of WD HDDs, using ZFS. At some point, they also started to throw weird read errors when under heavy load, but would work just fine the rest of the time.
