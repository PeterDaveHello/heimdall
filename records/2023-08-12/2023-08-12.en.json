    "originBody": "Skip to content Dan Slimmon Evidence-oriented SRE About Squeeze the hell out of the system you have ON 2023/08/11 BY DAN SLIMMONIN UNCATEGORIZED About a year ago, I raised a red flag with colleagues and managers about Postgres performance. Our database was struggling to keep up with the load generated by our monolithic SaaS application. CPU utilization was riding between 60 and 80%, and at least once it spiked to 100%, causing a brief outage. Now, we had been kicking the can down the road with respect to Postgres capacity for a long time. When the database looked too busy, we’d replace it with a bigger instance and move on. This saved us a lot of time and allowed us to focus on other things, like building features, which was great. But this time, it wasn’t possible to scale the DB server vertically: we were already on the biggest instance. And we were about to overload that instance. Lots of schemes were floated. Foremost among them: Shard writes. Spin up a cluster of independent databases, and write data to one or the other according to some partitioning strategy. Do micro-services. Split up the monolith into multiple interconnected services, each with its own data store that could be scaled on its own terms. Both of these options are cool! A strong case can be made for either one on its merits. With write sharding, we could potentially increase our capacity by 2 or even 3 orders of magnitude. With micro-services, we’d be free to use “the right tool for the job,” picking data stores optimized to the requirements of each service workload. Either branch of the skill tree would offer exciting options for fault tolerance and operational resilience. Either way, everyone had to agree: we’d outgrown our old, naïve implementation. Onward and upward! We can do hard things! In situations like this, presented with a dazzling array of next-generation architecture options that can be built to last us through the decade, it’s easy to forget what our goal was: to get database performance under control. Complexity costs attention. Sometimes, leaps in complexity must be made. It’s generally a good problem to have. If enough demand is being placed on your system to render obsolete your existing technology, then even more growth is probably on the horizon! If you can just put in the investment and build the more advanced architecture now, then you’ll be looking at a bright future of unconstrained year-over-year success. But don’t just consider the implementation cost. The real cost of increased complexity – often the much larger cost – is attention. If you decide to shard across databases, then not only must you pay the money-, time-, and opportunity cost of building out the new architecture: you must also take the new complexity into account in every subsequent technical decision. Want to shard writes? Fine, but this complicates every future decision about backups, monitoring, migrations, the ORM, and network topology (just to name a few). And don’t get me started on micro-services. Just think about how massive these costs are. How much feature delivery will have to be delayed or foregone to support the additional architectural complexity? Always squeeze first We should always put off significant complexity increases as long as possible. When complexity leaps are on the table, there’s usually also an opportunity to squeeze some extra juice out of the system you have. By tweaking the workload, tuning performance, or supplementing the system in some way, you may be able to add months or even years of runway. When viable, these options are always preferable to building out a next-gen system. Let’s return to the example of the overloaded Postgres instance. In that case, what we ended up doing was twofold: Two engineers (me and my colleague Ted – but mostly Ted) spent about 3 months working primarily on database performance issues. There was no silver bullet. We used our telemetry to identify heavy queries, dug into the (Rails) codebase to understand where they were coming from, and optimized or eliminated them. We also tuned a lot of Postgres settings. Two more engineers cut a path through the codebase to run certain expensive read-only queries on a replica DB. This effort bore fruit around the same time as (1), when we offloaded our single most frequent query (a SELECT triggered by polling web clients). These two efforts together reduced the maximum weekly CPU usage on the database from 90% to 30%. Now we can sleep at night. We have a huge amount of room to grow, both in terms of CPU headroom and our ability to shed load from the primary. And furthermore, since our work touched many parts of the codebase and demanded collaboration with lots of different devs, we now have a strong distributed knowledge base about the existing system. We’re well positioned to squeeze it even more if need be. This doesn’t mean complexity is bad Of course, I’m not saying complexity is bad. It’s necessary. Some day we’ll reach a fundamental limit of our database architecture, and before that day arrives, we’ll need to make a jump in complexity. But until then, because we squeezed first, we get to keep working with the most boring system possible. This is by far the cheaper and more practical option. Share this: TwitterFacebook Loading...

Not sure I&#x27;d trust that, but I&#x27;d bet many companies would rather use that then get a full DBA. reply endisneigh 14 hours agoprevThe bit on the database performance issues leads me to my hottest, flamiest take for new projects:- Design your application&#x27;s hot path to never use joins. Storage is cheap, denormalize everything and update it all in a transaction. It&#x27;s truly amazing how much faster everything is when you eliminate joins. For your ad-hoc queries you can replicate to another database for analytical purposes.On this note, I have mixed feelings about Amazon&#x27;s DynamoDB, but one things about it is to use it properly you need to plan your use first, and schema second. I think there&#x27;s something you can take from this even with a RDBMS.In fact, I&#x27;d go as far to say as joins are unnecessary for nonanalytical purposes these days. Storage is so mind booglingly cheap and the major DBs have ACID properties. Just denormalize, forreal.- Use something more akin to UUIDs to prevent hot partitions. They&#x27;re not a silver bullet and have their own downsides, but you&#x27;ll already be used to the consistently \"OK\" performance that can be horizontally scaled rather than the great performance of say integers that will fall apart eventually.&#x2F;hottakesmy sun level take would be also to just index all columns. but that&#x27;ll have to wait for another day. reply theptip 7 hours agoparentHonestly I couldn’t disagree more. I built a startup and paid little attention to perf for years 1-5, and finally in year 6 we started to get bitten by some perf issues in specific tables, and spent a few engineer-months optimizing.In terms of tech debt it would have been way more expensive to make everything perform well from the start, we would have moved much slower and probably failed during a few crunch points.Instead we paid probably a few $k&#x2F;mo more than we really needed to on machines, and in return saved man-months of effort at a time when we couldn’t hire enough engineers and the opportunity cost for feature work was huge. (Keep in mind that making everything perform well would have required us to do 10-20x as much work, because we could not know ahead of time where the hot spots would be. Some were surprising.)Joins may be evil at scale, but most startups don’t have scale problems, at least not at first.Denormalizing can be a good optimization but you pay a velocity cost in keeping all the copies in sync across changes. Someone will write the bug that misses a denormalized non-canonical field and serves up stale data to a user. It’s usually cheaper (in total cost, ie CapEx+OpEx) to write the join and optimize later with a read-aside cache or whatever, rather than contorting your schema. reply otikik 48 minutes agorootparent> a few $k&#x2F;moIsn’t that the cost of one engineer already? reply re-thc 3 hours agorootparentprev> I built a startup and paid little attention to perf for years 1-5, and finally in year 6 we started to get bitten by some perf issues in specific tables, and spent a few engineer-months optimizing.This screams of if I don’t see it it the problem doesn’t exist view of the world.How do you know it’s not a problem? Perhaps customers would have signed up if it as faster?The problem is also treating it in terms of business value and&#x2F;or cost.A lot of things are “free” and yet it’s ignored.For most people, in simple cases like turning on http3, brotli, switching to newer instances and many others are all quick wins that I see ignored 90% of the time.A good design, implementing some good practices etc are performance specific and don’t always cost more. reply kreetx 2 hours agorootparentA denormalized database model is considered bad desig to begin with, and has performance costs on its own. This is why the OP says this is a \"hot take\". :)Maybe there are situations where this actually helps, although the resulting datastructure to me looks more like a multi-key cache. reply crazygringo 10 hours agoparentprevThat is a hot take... ;)But joins should never impact performance in a large way if they&#x27;re on the same server and properly indexed. \"It&#x27;s truly amazing how much faster everything is when you eliminate joins\" is just not true if you&#x27;re using joins correctly. Sadly, many developers simply never bother to learn.On the other hand, having to write a piece of data to 20 different spots instead of 1 is going to be dramatically slower performance-wise, not to mention make your queries tremendously more complex and bug-prone, when you remember to update a value in 18 spots but forget about 2 of them.You mention cheap storage as an advantage for denormalizing, but storage is the least problem here. It&#x27;s a vastly larger surface area for bugs, and terrible write performance (that can easily chew up read performance). reply jiggawatts 9 hours agorootparentStorage might be cheap, but memory and bandwidth aren’t.Memory is the new disk, and disk is the new tape.You want everything to remain resident in memory, and spool backups and transaction logs to disk.If you’re joining from disk, you’ve probably done something wrong.E.g.: compression is often a net win because while it uses more CPU, it allows more data to fit into memory. And if it doesn’t fit, it reduces the disk I&#x2F;O required.This is why I look upon JSON-based document databases in horror. They’re bloating the data out many times over by denormalizing and then expand that into a verbose and repetitive text format.This is why we have insanity like placeholders for text on web apps now — they’re struggling to retrieve a mere kilobyte of data! reply yashap 4 hours agorootparentprevJoins are not inherently expensive, but they can lead to expensive queries. For example, say I want to find the 10 most recent users with a phone number as their primary contact method:SELECT …FROM UserJOIN ContactMethod on ContactMethod.userId = User.idWHERE ContactMethod.priority = ‘primary’ AND ContactMethod.type = ‘phoneNumber’ORDER BY User.createdAt DESCLIMIT 10If there are a very large number of users, and a very large number of phone number primary contacts, you cannot make this query fast&#x2F;efficient (on most RDBMSes). You CAN make this query fast&#x2F;efficient by denormalizing, ensuring the user creation date and primary contact method are on the same table, and then creating a compound index. But if they’re in separate tables, and you have to join, you can’t make it efficient, because you can’t create cross-table compound indeces.This pattern of join, filter by something in table A, sort by something in table B, and query out one page of data, is something that comes up a lot. It’s why ppl thing joins are generally expensive, but it’s more like they’re expensive in specific cases. reply franckpachot 3 hours agorootparentWith an index on User (createdAt, id) and one on ContactMethod ( primary,ContactMethod,userId), it should be fast (check that the the execution plan starts with User). Except if lot of recent users have no phones, but that will not be better in a single table (except if columnar storage) reply aidos 1 hour agorootparentI imagine so too. You’ll be able to interate over the users in order and hit an instant index on contact method. select * from user where exists ( select true from contact_method cm where cm.contact_id = contact.id and cm.method = &#x27;phone&#x27; and cm.primary ) order by created_at desc limit 10 —- partial index is even faster create index primary_phone on contact_method (contact_id) where method = &#x27;phone&#x27; and primary; reply Turskarama 3 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience with SQL, a query like that should return in under a second even if you have 100k or more users.There are some other tricks you can use if you&#x27;re clever&#x2F;lucky as well. If you&#x27;re just using integer IDs (which is reasonable if your system isn&#x27;t distributed) then you could order by userid on you ContactMethod table and still get the same speed as you would with no join. reply Zanfa 3 hours agorootparentprev> If there are a very large number of users, and a very large number of phone number primary contacts, you cannot make this query fast&#x2F;efficientI think specific numbers would help make this point better. With a few hundred thousand to low millions of users this should be plenty fast in Postgres for example. That’s magnitudes more than most startups ever reach anyway. reply tlarkworthy 2 hours agorootparentprevYes this is the exact situation where sql falls short. You can&#x27;t make cross-table indexes to serve OLAP-esq queries, and the most recent X is the common one for pagination in applications. I prefer to denormalize manually at write time in a transaction, rather than use triggers or materialized views. reply ako 2 hours agorootparentWhy do you prefer manually doing this rather than using materialized views? Materialized views seem easier to create and maintain? reply tlarkworthy 1 hour agorootparentBecause they are o(n) complexity to refresh so either you settle for eventual complexity or have expensive writes. By forwarding just the index data to the right table you maintain an consistent idiomatic index at 0(1) write cost reply aidos 1 hour agorootparentAgreed. Matarialized views will be limited in use until we get nice incremental updating versions. reply unnouinceput 2 hours agorootparentprevIf the tables involved in the join are of 100M+ records what I do when the joins use varchar columns to improve the performance is to use an additional integer column of the varchar one that is a CRC of it (or hash if you prefer that) and use the integer one instead in the join. reply aidos 2 hours agorootparentThat seems weirdly convoluted. So you store two columns to represent the foreign key? reply endisneigh 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree but I’m talking in the context where you can’t vertically scale anymore.I also don’t think it’s worth the trouble “never using joins” for an existing project. Denormalize as necessary. But for a green one I honestly think since our access patterns can be understood as you continue you can completely get rid of joins.Again, assuming your new project can’t fit on a single machine. If it can you’re best just following the “traditional” advice, or better yet keep everything in memory. reply fastball 5 hours agorootparentHow is it that your new project can&#x27;t fit on a single machine? reply aidos 1 hour agorootparentEveryone thinks they start their project with Facebook scale problems. reply yafbum 3 hours agorootparentprevCould be plenty of reasons, but say you want to support spikey traffic like whatever is related to events, news, realtime information, etc., or highly seasonal stuff like a school portal or selling flowers on mother&#x27;s day, you want the ability to scale horizontally very quickly to accommodate spikes reply cuu508 4 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps they&#x27;re building an internet search engine. reply feoren 12 hours agoparentprevThere are \"tall\" applications and \"wide\" applications. Almost all advice you ever read about database design and optimization is for \"tall\" applications. Basically, it means that your application is only doing one single thing, and everything else is in service of that. Most of the big tech companies you can think of are tall. They have only a handful of really critical, driving concepts in their data model.Facebook really only has people, posts, and ads.Netflix really only has accounts and shows.Amazon (the product) really only has sellers, buyers, and products, with maybe a couple more behind the scene for logistics.The reason for this is because tall applications are easy. Much, much easier than wide applications, which are often called \"enterprise\". Enterprise software is bad because it&#x27;s hard. This is where the most unexplored territory is. This is where untold riches lie. The existing players in this space are abysmally bad at it (Oracle, etc.). You will be too, if you enter it with a tall mindset.Advice like \"never user joins\" and \"design around a single table\" makes a lot of sense for tall applications. It&#x27;s awful, terrible, very bad, no-good advice for wide applications. You see this occasionally when these very tall companies attempt to do literally anything other than their core competency: they fail miserably, because they&#x27;re staffed with people who hold sacrosanct this kind of advice that does not translate to the vast space of \"wide\" applications. Just realize that: your advice is for companies doing easy things who are already successful and have run out of low-hanging fruit. Even tall applications that aren&#x27;t yet victims of their own success do not need to think about butchering their data model in service of performance. Only those who are already vastly successful and are trying to squeeze out the last juices of performance. But those are the people who least need advice. This kind of tall-centered advice, justified with \"FAANG is doing it so you should too\" and \"but what about when you have a billion users?\" is poisoning the minds of people who set off to do something more interesting than serve ads to billions of people. reply donavanm 1 hour agorootparentI apologize up front if I completely misunderstand your intent. However ...> Amazon (the product) really only has sellers, buyers, and products, with maybe a couple more behind the scene for logistics.Is a comically bad hot take that is so entirely divorced from reality. A full decade ago the item catalog (eg ASINs or items to purchase) alone had closer to 1,000 different subsystems&#x2F;components&#x2F;RPCs etc for a single query. I think you&#x27;d have to go back to circa 2000 before it could be optimistically described as a couple of databases for the item catalog.DylanDmitri sibling comment is a hell of a lot closer to the truth, and I&#x27;d hazard is still orders of magnitude underestimating what it takes to go from viewing an item detail page to completing checkout, let alone picking or delivery. Theres a reason the service map diagram, again circa 2010, was called \"the deathstar.\"> \"FAANG is doing it so you should too\" and \"but what about when you have a billion users?\" is poisoning the minds of peopleThis part I completely agree with. And many individual components in those giant systems are dead simple. I dare say the best ones are simplistic even. reply strgcmc 5 minutes agorootparentEx-Amazonian here, and while I agree with the facts you present, I do think the \"tall\" vs \"wide\" debate is being misapplied here.Amazon is extremely and perversely obsessed with, and good at, building decoupled systems at scale, which in essence means lots and lots of individual separate \"tall\" systems, instead of monolithic \"wide\" systems.So IMO, Amazon subscribes to a \"forest-of-&#x27;tall&#x27;-services\" philosophy. And even at that meta level, I would say the forests are better off when they grow taller, rather than wider. reply DylanDmitri 10 hours agorootparentprevFor Amazon, if we consider everything for website retail purchases, I would estimate tens of thousands of table schemas. This is counting:- Sellers (Amazon, third party, retail store) - Inventory (forecasting, recommendation) - Customers (comments, ratings, returns, preferences) - Warehouses (5+ distinct types, filled with custom machines) - Transit Options (long haul, air, vans, cars, bikes, walking, boats) - Delivery Partners (DSP, Flex, Fedex, UPS - forecasting capacity here) - Routing (between warehouses, within warehouses, to specific homes) - skipping AWS - skipping billing - skipping advertising on amazon.com (bidding, attribution, etc)There&#x27;s optimizations and metrics collected and packages transition between all these layers. There&#x27;s hundreds of \"neat projects\" running to special case different things; all them useful but adding complexity.For example ordering prescriptions off Amazon pharmacy needs effectively its own website and permissions and integrations. Probably distinct sorting machines with supporting databases for them. Do you need to log repairs on those machines? Probably another table schema.You want to normalize international addresses? And fine tune based on delivery status and logs and customer complaints and map data? Believe it not like 20 more tables. Oh this country has no clear addresses? Need to send experienced drivers to areas they already know. Need to track that in more tables. reply r00fus 10 hours agorootparentBut these aren&#x27;t the website, right? Amazon runs \"wide\" enterprise systems in the back end for sure. reply DylanDmitri 9 hours agorootparentOh yeah these are \"wide\" enterprise systems, and not for the website. I think we read the initial comment differently. reply wruza 4 hours agorootparentprevThis kind of tall-centered advice, justified with \"FAANG is doing it so you should too\" and \"but what about when you have a billion users?\" is poisoning the minds of peopleThe world runs on success stories, not on technology. I wish “wide” thinking was default, for both un-delusion and better development in this area. But everyone is amazed with facebook (not the site, just money), so they have to imitate it, like those tribes who build jets out of wood. reply xyzzy123 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks I think this is a really interesting way to look at things.What is the market for \"wide\" applications though? It seems like any particular business can only really support one or two of them, for some that will be SAP and for others it might be Salesforce (if they don&#x27;t need much ERP), or (as you mentioned) some giant semi homebrewed Oracle thing.Usually there is a legacy system which is failing but still runs the business, and a \"next gen\" system which is not ready yet (and might never be, because it only supports a small number of use cases from the old software and even with an army of BAs it&#x27;s difficult to spec out all the things the old software is actually doing with any accuracy).Or am I not quite getting the idea? reply ozim 54 minutes agorootparentFacebook was done by Zuckerberg without any specialized knowledge and people would like to go that route because it seems easier, making Twitter&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Instagram clone you don&#x27;t really have to know anything about insurances or handling industrial waste. Then it is basically people joining based on other peopleNowadays there are bunch of regulations on handling user data that one cannot do without knowing but when these companies started that was not an issue.My point is market for \"wide\" applications is huge but it is much more fragmented. Of Course SAP and Salesforce are taking cut in that by having \"one app for everything\"To get contracts you have to have specialized knowledge in specific area that your SaaS app would provide more value than configuring some crappy version in SAP. So you cannot just make an app in your basement and watch people sign up, but you have to spend a lot of leg work getting customers. That is why it is not really \"hot\" area for startups, because there is a lot of good money there but not unicorn money and most likely you won&#x27;t be able to have 2 or 3 different specialist niche products so you could diversify investment but you would have to commit to a niche which makes it also not really interesting for a lot of entrepreneurs who most likely would lie to jump to something more profitable when possible. reply feoren 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re getting the idea -- both your points kinda highlight that this is something that companies want, but are not really getting.As for the market, various sources have the \"enterprise software market\", whatever that means, at somewhere around $100 billion to $300 billion. We also see companies trying over and over to do this kind of thing. The demand is clearly there.Certainly the mandate \"help run the business\" is a wide concern, and that&#x27;s an OK working definition of \"enterprise\", and what most existing solutions are trying to do. There are hundreds of interconnected concerns, lots of things to coordinate, etc.There are other wide concerns, though. Almost anything in engineering and science. Take, for example, the question \"how can we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions?\" which a lot of companies are asking (or being forced to ask). If you wanted to build a SAAS product for helping companies reduce their GHG, you&#x27;ve got a wide problem, because there are a thousand activities that can emit GHG, and any given company is going to be doing dozens of them at once. But each company is different. Each state and country thinks of things differently. You might not even have the same calculations state-to-state.Hard problems in science and engineering are just naturally cross-disciplinary, meaning your system has to know a lot of things about a lot of subjects. There are just thousands of little complicating differences and factors. If you&#x27;re trying to solve a problem like this, absolutely do not de-normalize your database. reply other_herbert 10 hours agorootparentprevLotus notes is wide… I imagine their scope creep checker was just a sticky note that said Absolutely!! reply lanstin 10 hours agorootparentI miss notes - it was really a better way to organize companies than anything later. Historical valuable data, records of why decisions were made, ephemeral email like things but for groups, user programmable if it didn&#x27;t quite match your needs, robust encryption, it had it all. reply lifeisstillgood 9 hours agorootparentoh I always nust assumed Lotus Notes was just lesser Outlook. can you give examples - such has how did it capture why decisions were made - that sounds ... hard or just \"someone wrote it down\" reply anonzzzies 4 hours agorootparentIt was a low&#x2F;nocode environment; anyone (with enough rights) could knock up a simple app with rules&#x2F;workflows and share it with the company. It made collecting, distributing and organising information easy if you knew what you were doing. It also created complex monsters as it was both too easy and too hard to use. I liked it a lot; we moved from Notes to Exchange and Sharepoint back in the day and it was awful for effiency. We required so much more people to do the same things. Luckily I left shortly after. replypipe_connector 11 hours agorootparentprevI agree with the characterization of applications you&#x27;ve laid out and think everyone should consider whether they&#x27;re working on a \"tall\" (most users use a narrow band of functionality) or a \"wide\" (most users use a mostly non-overlapping band of functionality) application.I also agree with your take that tall applications are generally easier to build engineering-wise.Where I disagree is that I think in general wide applications are failures in product design, even if profitable for a period of time. I&#x27;ve worked on a ton of wide applications, and each of them eventually became loathed by users and really hard to design features for. I think my advice would be to strive to build a tall application for as long as you can muster, because it means you understand your customers&#x27; problems better than anyone else. reply feoren 11 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;ve worked on a ton of wide applications, and each of them eventually became loathed by users and really hard to design features for.Yes, I agree that this is the fate of most. But I refuse to believe it&#x27;s inevitable; rather, I think it comes from systemic flaws in our design thinking. Most of what we learn in a college database course, most of what we read online, most all ideas in this space, transfer poorly to \"wide\" design. People don&#x27;t realize this because those approaches do work well for tall applications, and because they&#x27;re regarded religiously. This is why I call them so much harder. reply lll-o-lll 6 hours agorootparent> Yes, I agree that this is the fate of most. But I refuse to believe it&#x27;s inevitableYes exactly. It is not inevitable, I’ve worked on several “enterprise” software suits that did not suffer from this problem. However! They all had that period in their history where they did, and this is why:Early on in a companies history there will be a number of “big” customers from whom most of the revenue is coming. To keep those customers and money flowing, often bespoke features are added for these customers and these accumulate over time. This is equivalent in character to maintaining several forks of an OSS project. Long term no forward progress can be made due to all time ending up in maintenance.The solution to this sorry state is to transition to an “all features must be general for the product” and ruthlessly enforce this. That will also mean freezing customer specific “branches” and there will be a temporary hit to revenue.

More often than not it&#x27;s historical-record type tables that are the issue - but the amount of data you need for day-to-day operations is usually a tiny fraction of what&#x27;s actually in the table, and you&#x27;re bound to start finding operations on massive tables get slow no matter what indexes you have (and even the act of adding more indexes becomes problematic.

Hide the actual, physical tables from the Application&#x27;s account!The application doesn&#x27;t need to know how the data is physically stored in the database. They specify the logical view they need of the data.

As with all things, it depends and use the query planner to measure what actually makes a difference.In our application we have one important join that actually makes things a lot faster than the denormalized alternatieve. The main table has about 8 references to an organization table. To figure out what rows should be selected for a particular organization, you could either query on those 8 columns, making a very big where&#x2F;or clause. As it turns out, PostgreSQL will usually end up doing a full table scan despite any index you would create.Instead, there is an auxiliary table with two columns, one for organization and one reference to the main table.

Eventually, you hit the wall in the OP, in that you need design level changes, not just quick fixes.The situation I mention in my comment was one of those: we&#x27;d about reached the limits of what was possible with the setup we had. We were hitting things such as bringing in new nodes was difficult: the time for the replica to replicate was getting too long, and Mongo, at the time, had some bug that caused like a ~30% chance that the replica would SIGSEGV and need to restart the replication from scratch. Operationally, it was a headache, and the split moved a lot of data out that made these cuts not so bad. (Cassandra did bring its own challenges, but the sum of the new state was that it was better than where we were.)Consistency is something you must pay attention to. In our case, the old foreign key between the two systems was the user ID, and we had specific checks to ensure consistency of it. reply kreetx 13 hours agoparentprevIn a way, in the article they also did a split: specific heavy select queries were offloaded to a replica. reply agentultra 13 hours agorootparentThey could probably squeeze more depending on their workload patterns. RDBMS&#x27; typically optimize for fast&#x2F;convenient writes. If your write load would be fine with a small increase in latency then you can do a lot of de-normalization so that your reads can avoid using tonnes of joins, aggregates, windows, etc at read-time. Update write path so that you update all of the de-normalized views at write time.Depending on your read load and application structure you can get a lot more scale with caching.Decent article. reply kedean 12 hours agoparentprevFunny enough I frequently have the opposite problem, justifying repeatedly why Cassandra is a bad fit for relatively short lived, frequently updated data (tombstones, baby). reply deathanatos 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d agree with you there.The specific data that went into Cassandra in our case was basically immutable. (And somehow, IIRC, we still had issues around tombstones. I am not a fan of them.) Cassandra&#x27;s tooling left much to be desired around inspecting the exact state of tombstones within the cluster. reply alexchamberlain 4 hours agoparentprevThe other thing worth noting is a server can read from 2 datastores - which as a sibling comment says, they ended up doing with a read replica.

In regard to Iraq weapons of mass destruction and terrorists, is there any evidence to indicate that Iraq has attempted to or is willing to supply terrorists with weapons of mass destruction?

It didn&#x27;t take a genius to notice that the goals set by the presidency were (literally) impossible and not the kind of thing you do achieve a war.But whatever position he had, Iraq turning into a clusterfuck wasn&#x27;t a sign of bad leadership by his part. It was a sign of bad ethics, but not leadership. His options were all of getting out of his position, disobeying the people above him, or leading the US into a clusterfuck. reply mickdeek86 11 hours agorootparentRumsfeld personally advanced the de-baathification directive - the lynchpin of the clusterfuckery - all on his own, and he certainly would have known to expect the &#x27;unexpected&#x27; results to be similar to de-nazification. This was absolutely his choice. Another point you have (unintentionally?) brought up is the dignified resignation option. While it is often a naive, self-serving gesture, we can reasonably imagine that the Defense Secretary publicly resigning over opposition to a war during the public consideration of that war, might have had some effect on whether that war was started.

He was totally wrong about it.It wasn’t his fault Turkey didn’t let the US attack from the north, but other than that, the fuck up is his responsibility, among others. reply Miraste 7 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a distinction missing here. Rumsfeld&#x27;s Transformation idea was correct with regard to the invasion, which was one of the most successful invasions in history, period.

What&#x27;s more, Congress has frequently and explicitly given the President authority to conduct large scale military operations and held oversight hearings, etc. of the execution of those operations - all without formal declarations of war; Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan being prime examples of this.Calling them \"special military operations,\" poor taste aside, especially with a focus on the formal process used, ignores the fact that all of those conflicts were entered and conducted with the full knowledge and involvement of Congresss. reply dragonwriter 12 hours agorootparentprev> Rumsfeld&#x27;s got some great quotes, most of which were delivered in the context of explaining how the Iraq war turned into such a clusterfuckIf by “explaining how” you mean “deflecting (often preemptively) responsibility for”, yes. reply froggit 8 hours agorootparent> If by “explaining how” you mean “deflecting (often preemptively) responsibility for”, yes.There&#x27;s no reason to think you can&#x27;t do both of those with the same statement. reply dragonwriter 6 hours agorootparentAbstractly, sure.I’m characterizing what I recall Rumsfeld concretely doing, not what is abstractly possible for one to do. reply xapata 13 hours agorootparentprev> could&#x27;veIf someone is 83.7% likely to provide good leadership, how would you evaluate the choice to hire that person as a leader in the hindsight that the person failed to provide good leadership -- was it a bad choice, or was it a good choice that was unlucky?(Likelihood was selected arbitrarily.) reply hluska 12 hours agorootparentLike everything in politics, I think this is a function of what team you cheer for.

Their questions will sometimes be about things we hadn&#x27;t even considerered (at least in some time) to be the case, but when you have to spell everything out it is indeed the case. In terms of teaching unknown knowns are critical to identify and instead make known knowns so that everyone can end up with a mostly equal playing field.As an example, there are a lot of unknown knowns that you accumulate over the years in certain lower level languages that need to be spelled out more clearly to someone who is coming at it as a later endeavor. It&#x27;s entirely possible to spend all your time in a completely managed language nowadays and the concept of the stack, heap, etc., will be largely alien to you. These ideas and their limitations need to be spelled out clearly in order for someone to build the same knowledge base and intuition.Unknown knowns are essentially endless in nature and extremely hard to find unless you have someone who simply doesn&#x27;t know to basically fall into traps and guide you toward finding your hidden knowledge. reply munificent 13 hours agorootparentprev> An awful lot of postmortems I&#x27;ve been a part of have come down to \"It didn&#x27;t occur to us that could happen.\" Would that not be an unknown unknown? reply roughly 12 hours agorootparentUsually there&#x27;s a tacit assumption of how the system works, how the users are using the system, or something else about the system or the environment that causes that - it&#x27;s not that the answer wasn&#x27;t known, it&#x27;s that it was assumed to be something it wasn&#x27;t and nobody realized that was an assumption and not a fact. reply thfuran 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s just an unknown unknown masquerading as a known known. replymacNchz 12 hours agoprevIn my experience, in web apps built on top of ORMs there is often a TON of low hanging fruit for query optimization when database load becomes an issue.

Sometimes you&#x27;ll want to aggregate some results beforehand, or adjust the WHERE conditions in a complex join.

It turns out that getting it to use RETURNING with INSERT is not trivial and requires you to set the non-obvious option `expire_on_commit=False`, which doesn&#x27;t guarantee use of RETURNING, but is supposed to use it if your db driver and database happen to support it and the ORM happens to support it for that particular combination of driver and database. And there&#x27;s no API to actually inspect the generated SQL even though it&#x27;s emitted in the logs, so there&#x27;s no way to enforce the use of RETURNING in your test suite without capturing and scraping your own logs (which fortunately is very easy within the Pytest framework).I like ORMs but this is just frustratingly complicated on so many levels. I also understand that SQLAlchemy is an enormous library and not everything will be easy. But I think this case exemplifies the trade-offs involved with using an ORM.(Yes I am aware that using insert() itself in Core does what I want, I&#x27;m talking about .add()-ing an ORM object to an AsyncSession). reply roughly 7 hours agorootparentI don’t mean this as a slight on SQLAlchemy - it does a lot of things very well and provides a ton of levers and knobs - but it’s absolutely the first place I look when I’m looking for performance improvements.A friend used to say Zookeeper was where the crazy lived in any application that used it - sqlalchemy is where the slow lives in any application that uses it. reply bootsmann 11 hours agorootparentprevThere is certainly an API to inspect your query, you can just call print() on the object iirc. reply nerdponx 10 hours agorootparentThe problem is with using `session.add(obj)` instead of `session.scalars(insert(TheClass).returning(TheClass), data)`. If there&#x27;s a way to get generated SQL from an AsyncSession, please do let me know. reply eru 6 hours agoparentprevA big problem with ORM&#x27;s is that object orientation is just not a good way to organise software nor data for most domains.Most business logic would be better expressed in the language of relational algebra (plus some extensions) than via OOP. reply Xeoncross 14 hours agoprev> The real cost of increased complexity – often the much larger cost – is attention....or just mental load. I&#x27;m tired of working on micro-service systems that still have downtime, but no one knows how it all works. Most are actually just distributed monoliths so changes often touch multiple services and have to be rolled out in order.

The whole point is that no-one can or should know how they all work; the fact that someone does in order to fix or modify the system is a strong signal that you&#x27;ve violated some of the rules - like single responsibility, and proper abstraction through API. But, in my experience, this is extremely common - debugging a pipeline of N microservices often requires running and building all N services locally. This is, strictly speaking, a monolith + network partitions + (infinite) build&#x2F;deploy variation. An extremely challenging work environment that is ultimately beyond any mortal programmer&#x27;s ability, IMO. reply atmosx 1 hour agoprev> Just think about how massive these costs are. How much feature delivery will have to be delayed or foregone to support the additional architectural complexity?I don’t know if the author has worked with micro services. MS solve a communication issue. If implemented semi-properly teams stop blocking each other and the overall result is _faster_ and _safer_ feature delivery to production because the scope a team (or tribe, etc) will be working on a smaller, isolated codebase. The challenge _usually_ is that now developers have to take the environment into consideration introducing new patterns (retries, structured logs, time outs, circuit breakers, possibly SLIs for other teams, distributed tracing, metrics, etc). Given a large enough org, someone will either adopt or write a micro-framework to handle all or most of them.To re-iterate if introducing MS stalled feature delivery, then it is a premature decision. YMMV, of course as there are other reasons to isolate part of the code base (e.g. compliance). reply andresp 1 hour agoparentI got to understand from personal experience that the anti-SOA people are usually the ones who stayed at the same company their entire carers, never saw any model other than the monolithic one, see SOA as a threat to their domain knowledge within the company and simply are not able to see its downsides (because they have adapted their ways of work around it and never experienced anything better). reply tomas789 0 minutes agorootparentI will offer myself as a counterexample.

It should also only be the default answer if you are not building a super critical system to life and limb. But it certainly gives a much lower total cost of ownership.

If you need to add a bunch of people to support complexity but both the money and the risk assessment doesn&#x27;t call for it, simpler is much better. I won&#x27;t say I haven&#x27;t seen the issue where eventually it was only a huge project to go forward, but I tend to think sometimes even that is less then the sum of having dealt with complexity to that point, it&#x27;s dependent on a lot about what you are building. reply zengid 12 hours agoprevThe solution they went with, squeezing juice out of the system by finding performance optimizations, brings me so much joy.It reminds me of Richard L.

Bankman-Fried will be remanded to custody directly from a court hearing in New York, where he will remain ahead of his criminal trial – which is due to begin on Oct. 2. WATCH NOW VIDEO06:20 Sam Bankman-Fried remanded into custody after bail gets revoked Sam Bankman-Fried will head to jail on Friday after a judge sided with a request by federal prosecutors to revoke the FTX founder’s bail over alleged witness tampering. Bankman-Fried was remanded to custody directly from a court hearing in New York. Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Bankman-Fried’s request for delayed detention pending an appeal. Unless the appeal is successful, he is expected to remain in custody until his criminal trial, which is due to begin on Oct. 2. “My conclusion is there is probable cause to believe the defendant tried to tamper with witnesses at least twice,” said Judge Kaplan during his ruling. As the court marshals took Bankman-Fried into custody at the end of the hearing, the defendant took off his blazer, tie, emptied his pockets, and appeared to remove his shoes. Bankman-Fried’s parents were both in the gallery. His mother had her face buried in her hands for much of Judge Kaplan’s lengthy ruling. The government requested that Bankman-Fried be remanded to a jail in Putnam, New York, where he’d have access to a laptop with internet access for defense preparation, as opposed to sending him to Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, the facility closest to the courthouse that has limited internet access for prisoners. Courtroom scene during hearing for Samuel Bankman-Fried in New York, August 11, 2023. Since his arrest in December, Bankman-Fried had been out on a $250 million bail package which requires him to remain at his parents’ Palo Alto, California house. Bankman-Fried’s court appearance on Friday is the latest in a series of pre-trial hearings related to the ex-billionaire’s continued dealings with the press – exchanges which the Justice Department characterizes as a “pattern of witness tampering and evading his bail conditions.” Judge Kaplan previously issued a direct and stern warning to Bankman-Fried in July over his conversations with the media. Members of the press, including counsel for The New York Times and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, had filed letters objecting to Bankman-Fried’s detention, citing free speech concerns. Defense attorneys had similarly argued that Bankman-Fried was asserting his first amendment right and did not violate any terms of his bail conditions by speaking with journalists. The defense had also been hoping that the discovery process would help Bankman-Fried’s case. Lawyers representing the former FTX chief stipulated that with Bankman-Fried jailed, he would not be able to properly prepare for his trial due to the mountainous amounts of discovery documents only accessible via a computer with internet access. In the motion requesting Bankman-Fried’s detention, the government said that, over the last several months, the defendant had sent over 100 emails to the media and had made over 1,000 phone calls to members of the press. The final straw, according to prosecutors, was Bankman-Fried leaking private diary entries of his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, to the New York Times. Ellison pleaded guilty to federal charges in Dec. 2022. Ellison, who is also the former chief executive of Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, has been cooperating with the government since December and is expected to be a star witness for the prosecution. During his 33-minute ruling, Judge Kaplan walked through his rationale as to why probable cause for witness tampering had been met by the prosecution, adding that Bankman-Fried’s contribution to the Ellison story was designed to “hurt” and “discredit” a witness. “Faced with a series of conditions meant to limit the defendant’s use of the internet and the phone, the defendant pivoted to in-person machinations,” the prosecution said of Bankman-Fried, whose revised bail conditions include restricted internet access and a ban from smartphone use. The government added that Bankman-Fried had over 100 phone calls with one of the authors of the Times story prior to publication – many of which lasted for approximately 20 minutes. The prosecution described the effort by Bankman-Fried – who faces several wire and securities fraud charges related to the alleged multibillion-dollar FTX fraud – as an attempt to discredit Ellison, characterizing it as a “means of indirect witness intimidation through the press.” It is an argument that proved sufficient to convince Judge Kaplan to send Bankman-Fried to jail ahead of his trial. The prosecution has had to cull charges twice to comply with an extradition agreement inked with The Bahamas – where Bankman-Fried was previously held in custody. The government told the Judge in a letter that next week it plans to file a new superseding indictment. This story is developing. Please check back for updates.

Yet, the vast majority of people need the news, which is indeed a summarization of very complex documents.Like in any other profession, journalists are better or worse at doing exactly that. You can question that this article does a good or bad job at it, but always assuming malfeasance is a dangerous populist view that doesn’t help anyone, it only reinforces your own flavor of high-level dunning-krueger effect.The reason why a journalist can be bad at doing this summarization in pieces like this is because they are human. Objectivity in reporting has been always a tremendous misconception of pure-breed American journalism. Journalists have preferences, biases, networks and more, like everyone else. They are not judges, and don’t have the law to stand by, but rather an ethical unwritten (or written, in case of a large publication that employs them) code of conduct. Surprise: they often disregard it.That said, the business of news is indeed a business (and that’s a major issue, in my opinion) with all that comes with it. Nonetheless, journalists are not “out to get you and manipulate your mind”. That is a dangerous interpretation by people who know nothing about journalism and feel reinforced by the musings of rich actually manipulative idiot savants like Elon Musk. reply strken 14 minutes agorootparentYou are probably correct that few journalists seek to mislead, but you skim over the real problem by saying it&#x27;s \"certainly commendable\" to want to read primary sources...and then just drop the subject. Why is it so damn hard to read the publicly available source material behind an article, if it&#x27;s so commendable to do so?You argued for five paragraphs that it&#x27;s not nefarious, but never gave your own answer; yes, some journalists are bad at summarising, but that doesn&#x27;t tell us why none of them provide sources, or are expected to.I&#x27;d guess the answer is some combination of deadlines and editors and market demand and it just not being critical to summarising the news, but it&#x27;s a bit milquetoast to complain about other explanations without giving one yourself. reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentprevThe main issue I have woth journalism in the digital, and social media age, is the sometimes utter misrepresentation of primary source material. One recent example was the article about UPS driver salaries, which based the headline on the UPS CEOs statememts. The reasons why stuff like this comes of as manipulative or agenda-pushing is:- it ignores that the salary agreememt was signed by UPS as well, hence it was acceptable from a business point of view- people tend to only read the headlines, and this headline created the impression of over paid UPS drivers and played of peoples jealousy- the journalist did not reference the publicly available salary agreement, nor did the salary maths themselve or compare the results to industry salariesThrow in that journalists simply cannot have the necessary domain knowledge to properly understand all the subjects they cover, the pressure to generate content, clicks and hence revenue, well, that means publishing content, and headlines, that have the potential to generate outrage &#x2F; engagement is a very common thing. And that is, at the very least, borderline manipulative, even without any biases or agendas said newspapers or journalists have to begin with.And that is even ignoring all the outright lying journalists (there were two prominent examples in Germany recently, one made up whole stories and interviews while the other pretended to be jewish to write a jewish opinion collumn). Or the pitfall of constantly two-siding issues. Or the fact that lying with numbers is just extremely easy. Or the clearly manipulative approach of publications like the the New York Post, The Sun or Bild. reply digitailor 19 minutes agorootparentprevI think addressing people&#x27;s expression of skepticism of the average motives of journalists by simply making the unqualified claim that the people expressing skepticism \"know nothing\" made the opposite point than you intended.This is an article posted to Hacker News where a defendant was incarcerated by a judge for media manipulation, and journalists who were involved made statements to the judge in support of the defendant. Since the defendant was incarcerated, that makes the journalists involved closer to malfeasant than not, but the entirety of your claim is that there is never malfeasance involved in journalism and the skepticism of the people you&#x27;re reprimanding is simply \"populism.\" Frankly, that comes off as a bit malfeasant, in the reflexively defensive sense.Would you like to claim I \"know nothing\" about the profession of journalism as well?

Maybe just apologize? reply rglullis 1 hour agorootparentWhat goalposts? Have you seen the media treatment given to SBF? Saying \"News channels are more interested in shaping public opinion than objective reporting and transparency about their sources\" shouldn&#x27;t even be a controversial statement. reply ALittleLight 1 hour agorootparentprevI think a much more parsimonious explanation is that news websites make money from their audience. It doesn&#x27;t help to send your audience to other sources - you&#x27;ll lose money.Your explanation doesn&#x27;t really make a lot of sense. If some people just need things summarized for them by a journalist - those people could read the article. People who want to read the source themselves could follow the link. Linking to original sources from an article neatly solves the problems for both types of audience.Of course, it brings back the problem I mentioned first - that linking to original sources would be sending some portion of your audience and paycheck away.I also think your explanation would be likelier to ring true if your colleagues weren&#x27;t tirelessly running down the reputation of your profession. My personal experience reading the news is not at all that journalists are usually trying to fairly or accurately summarize information - very much the contrary. reply TheOtherHobbes 38 minutes agorootparentI suspect the comment was trying to say that journalism is opinions about facts. And the facts are less important than the opinions. And this is fine.Good journalism is traditionally about holding power to account. Not seeing so much of that at the moment, except out in the mostly-unread fringes.As for SBF - someone else was downvoted for suggesting this is really about the parents.In my uninformed opinion, from the outside this looks like it may well about a very wealthy very narcissistic family which has persuaded itself it&#x27;s above the law.SBF appears to have absolutely no concept of moral behaviour or legal consequences - remarkable in itself. But there are wider questions about how his parents may have contributed to his beliefs and actions.However this plays out legally, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of interest in the psychology. replycoldtea 2 hours agoparentprev>and to provoke an emotional response in potential jurors and color a potential jurors view of that witnessSo just like every mass media and social media influencer would do about the same defendant?Or do those follow the \"innocent until proven guilty\"? reply etc-hosts 11 hours agoprevI was wondering why SBF was not immediately jailed when he was caught communicating with ex-FTX employees with Signal earlier this year.Also the news reported he was installing VPNs so that he could &#x27;watch football online&#x27; or something about as stupid. reply plaguepilled 22 minutes agoparentWhile I agree that there is an excess of evidence available to jail SBF with ease - and he should be jailed without question - I am bit unsure about your VPN comment.Specifically, if Sam uses a VPN after having communication restrictions put in place around what he can say, is that inherently suspicious to a court?

So all the things people know Tesla for today (and have made it a hugely valuable company) happened under his direct leadership as CEO.For SpaceX the idea that he is just a source of money is clearly ludicrous, given that it is entirely his brainchild.

The cessation of this substance does not always cause specific withdrawal symptoms. However, symptoms may be severe enough to require clinical intervention. For most inmates who use cocaine or other stimulants, medications are not ordinarily indicated as an initial treatment for withdrawal or dependence, as none have shown efficacy. Inmates are treated symptomatically.> SAMHSA recommends that patients withdrawing from stimulants should be monitored closely for depression&#x2F;suicidality, as well as prolonged QTc intervals and seizures, which may be additional complications of stimulant withdrawal.

You don&#x27;t get the 10 percent back.Larry Kramer, former dean of Stanford&#x27;s law school, pledged to cover 500,000 of it. Andreas Paepcke, a Stanford computer scientist, pledged to cover 200,000 of it.SBF&#x27;s parents have a house under a weird agreement where sale of the house is strictly controlled by Stanford University.SBF&#x27;s parents pledged to cover the rest of it (I think?)There is no way SBF&#x27;s parents are worth 25 million dollars.

The people who pitched in to the bail fund are well connected and this trial isn’t meant to harm them (from the judges point of view).But the fact that he’s in custody and isn’t on the run, means there’s more risk politically to forfeit the money than to give it back. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not like he actually ran away. This seems sort of reasonable. reply hattmall 9 hours agoparentprevNot if he&#x27;s compliant with the revocation. The idea behind bail is ultimately it&#x27;s the amount that needs to make you show up for trial. Either it&#x27;s an amount that you or whoever post it won&#x27;t be willing to lose or it&#x27;s the amount that someone can get for bringing you in.

But you understand that it&#x27;s going to lead to additional jail time, right? It&#x27;s a crime and a really serious one. It will be seen as aggravating behaviour, so extra time, perhaps extra charges, not a head-start.Edit to add: it&#x27;s entirely possible in a legal sense for the primary charges against him to collapse entirely and for him to still see extra time, not just time served, for witness tampering.

You get (bad) points (called levels) for how many people you harmed, dollar value of the harm, whether or not you used \"sophisticated\" means, etc, etc. These points are then converted to a sentence length according to this[1] chart. The main contributor in a case like this is going to be the dollar amount of the fraud (which is huge), as those points stack up quickly, capping out at 30 levels for a fraud of over $550M. So if as assume he gets the highest level, that&#x27;s 30 levels on its own, which if you read the guideline chart linked means a recommended sentence of 8 years for a first time offender just from those levels alone. Add all the other levels in and you can get to 43 (life imprisonment for first time offenders) pretty quickly.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussc.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;guidelines-manu... reply bemusedthrow75 9 hours agorootparentprevThree-strikes lifers exist, yes -- a system where your most recent crime is punished as an extension of a previous crime, even if the time was served.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rummel_v._Estelle reply dpkirchner 9 hours agorootparentprevMadoff did, but I only know that because it was remarkable enough to be big news. reply hnfong 3 hours agorootparentprevScamming and embarrassing the American Elite seems to be pretty serious crimes over there... replygigatexal 12 hours agoprevIs his brain fully formed?

People might nitpick the terminology you use to describe that person or criticize you for needlessly drawing attention to it, but nobody goes to bat for the sanity of a homeless person saying crazy shit about themselves.But if a very rich person living in mansion, doing lots of drugs, mentally stressed by the enormity of their crimes, starts making wild self-aggrandizing claims completely divorced from reality are they crazy? Suddenly people have an interest in defending their mental sanity. Why? Because rich people are entitled to more respect than the homeless by virtue of their wealth, and therefore we shouldn&#x27;t put common labels like crazy on them? Or maybe it&#x27;s because a rich luxurious lifestyle makes people immune to the onset of insanity? Were Caligula and Nero not crazy then? On the contrary, I think being very wealthy puts you at greater risk for becoming crazy; the more elite somebody is the more divorced from the typical human experience they become.

Nozick himself was advancing the progressive tradition. One way to understand it is to start by considering how the state was the tool leftist had used through the 19th century to advance individual human rights. Once the state had become totalizing in the way all modern capitalist countries are today, the only way forward to advance human rights further must involve the dissolution of the state since oppression is no longer caused by traditional social mores but rather by the system that replaced those. That’s why you often see weird alliances between rightists and libertarians: the few remnants of reactionary resistance against the state allied with what is at core a radical progressive movement. Leftists are a more natural ally with libertarians but cannot support libertarians as leftist power flows from state authority.There’s also a more specific history of libertarian plus leftist conference and other collaborations but I’m not knowledgeable on the details, merely that the info is there if you search for it. reply FabHK 2 hours agorootparentWhile Nozick was not traditionally right-wing, he was arguing for a pretty minimal state that’s not compatible with left, liberal, progressive ideas. reply samstave 9 hours agorootparentprev>>*arguing that criminal culpability is impossible because free will doesn&#x27;t exist.*OK - WTF?-There is a lot of discussion about &#x27;free will&#x27; - however, thats around predestination, blah blah -But to state that &#x27;*criminality*&#x27; doesnt exist DUE to predetermination is psycho bot BS.Some people more educated in philosophy or logic or whatever that I may be --- EXPLAIN THIS?? reply nullc 9 hours agorootparentTo paraphrase the old TV commercials.\"This is your mind on postmodern thinking.

FEBRUARY 22, 2023 In 2023, an energy turnover of 1 gigajoule was targeted. Now the researchers have even achieved 1.3 gigajoules and a new record for discharge time on Wendelstein 7-X: the hot plasma could be maintained for eight minutes. Experiment hall with Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald. The fusion facility is the most modern and largest stellarator in the world. (Photo: MPI for Plasma Physics / Jan Hosan) During the three-year completion work that ended last summer, Wendelstein 7-X was primarily equipped with water cooling for the wall elements and an upgraded heating system. The latter can now couple twice as much power into the plasma as before. Since then, the nuclear fusion experiment can be operated in new parameter ranges. \"We are now exploring our way towards ever higher energy values,\" explained Prof. Dr. Thomas Klinger, head of the Stellarator Transport and Dynamics Division at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald. \"In doing so, we have to proceed step by step so as not to overload and damage the facility.\" On 15 February 2023, the researchers reached a new milestone: for the first time, they were able to achieve an energy turnover of 1.3 gigajoules in this device. This was 17 times higher than the best value achieved before the conversion (75 megajoules). The energy turnover results from the coupled heating power multiplied by the duration of the discharge. Only if it is possible to couple large amounts of energy continuously into the plasma and also remove the resulting heat, a power plant operation is possible.

The picture does NOT show the plasma itself, but the… [more] Photo: MPI for Plasma Physics The plasma discharge lasted eight minutes Particularly heat-resistant divertor baffle plates are used to dissipate the largest heat flows at Wendelstein 7-X. They are part of the inner wall, which is now cooled by a system of 6.8 kilometres of water pipes since the completion of the device. No other fusion facility in the world currently has such a comprehensively cooled inner wall. The plasma heating consists of three components: the newly installed ion heating, the heating by neutral particle injection and electron microwave heating. For the current record, the electron microwave heating system was particularly important because it delivers large amounts of power over periods of several minutes. The energy turnover of 1.3 gigajoule was achieved with an average heating power of 2.7 megawatts, whereby the discharge lasted 480 seconds. This is also a new record for Wendelstein 7-X and one of the best values worldwide. Before the completion works, Wendelstein 7-X achieved maximum plasma times of 100 seconds at much lower heating power. Within a few years, the plan is to increase the energy turnover at Wendelstein 7-X to 18 gigajoules, with the plasma then being kept stable for half an hour. Background to nuclear fusion The goal of fusion research is to develop a climate and environmentally friendly power plant. Similar to the sun, it is to generate energy from the fusion of atomic nuclei. The Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics is pursuing the path of magnetic fusion. Because the fusion fire only ignites at temperatures above 100 million degrees, the fuel – a thin hydrogen plasma – must not come into contact with cold vessel walls. Held by magnetic fields, it floats almost contact-free inside a vacuum chamber. The magnetic cage of Wendelstein 7-X is created by a ring of 50 superconducting magnetic coils. It is a stellarator-type facility in which the special shapes of the coils are the result of sophisticated optimisation calculations. With the help of these coils, the quality of plasma confinement in a stellarator should reach the level of competing tokamak-type facilities.

The stellerator is really cool, and an alternative to a tokamak reactor. Tokamak is the doughnut shaped reactor, and it has a problem where the plasma near the outer circumference has less magnetic confinement. The stellerator is similar, but confines the plasma to a ribbon and folds it over on itself in a mobius-like arrangement.I used to be really interested in this, but forgot it existed over the years.

That isn&#x27;t even a song, it&#x27;s just a vinyl record skipping for a minute and a half. reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re not considering the first album with an actual track called Mobius. You&#x27;re thinking of the opening cut on Orbital II (the brown album). That one is the one where the \"where time becomes a loop\" becomes fun. The Mobius track is the one where \"whatever happens, will happen again\" is also included. Sorry, but I will have to deduct Orbital fanboi points, and you will lose your next turnhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4PG5PCd284oEdit: But as to the why, it&#x27;s fun. Just like the \"input&#x2F;output translation\" trickery. reply egypturnash 4 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s two copies of \"...where time becomes a loop.\" One on the left, one on the right. One of them is slightly shorter than the other, so that as they repeat again and again, they slide in and out of phase. The track ends after they come back into phase.If you listen to this with headphones, or speakers with decent separation, paying attention to this feels interesting. It&#x27;s similar to the way listening to \"binaural beats\" can do interesting things to your brain.Also if you are in the habit of putting an entire album on repeat and this is one of your favorite albums, then you&#x27;ve probably heard this a zillion times. If you have your music player set in \"randomize by album\" mode, then, well, it&#x27;s the first track on this album, so every time it comes up you&#x27;ll hear most of it unless you instantly decide you are not in the mood for Orbital 2, and even if you&#x27;re not in that mood it may be pleasant to let everything come back into phase before going to another album.----The next track on the album starts up entirely in the left ear, with a tinny, distant little loop, and the words \"Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day\". Once it brings in a deep bass, this bass is also doing some weird cross-ear phasing things.And then the third track also opens with \"Even a stopped clock...\"; a theme has been established at this point. Time is a loop, and a stopped clock is right twice a day. The opening of \"where time becomes a loop\" is also a bit of a joke; Orbital&#x27;s musical craft is very much about making a bunch of short loops that work together, and bringing them in and out over each other for four to seven minutes. Occasionally as much as thirty minutes, the extended version of \"The Box\" is glorious. This is something that utterly dominates most electronic dance music now, but Orbital was one of the first notable acts to really go hard on this, and this is their second album; they are saying \"yes it&#x27;s just more loops, we think they&#x27;re good loops, enjoy!\".By the time you get to the last track, you&#x27;ve probably forgotten about Worf&#x27;s repeated mantra. Especially if it&#x27;s your first time listening to the whole thing and Halcyon + On + On just blew all the cobwebs out of your head. But Orbital returns to the idea, with two different loops that are very close in sound and length, played on both channels: \"Input Translation\"&#x2F;\"Output Rotation\". They begin in phase with each other, drift out, and come back together. And the album is over.Or, if you have the CD player on repeat (remember, this album is from a time when people bought CDs and probably stuck them into a one-disc player, maybe a 3 or 5-disc player if they were lucky, and the whole album is built with an awareness of this), you&#x27;re back where you began, inputs translated and outputs rotated, and ready to be reminded of the Theory of the Moebius.Time has become a loop. Come out of the trance Orbital has put you in. Do you want to experience this loop again? Does it feel rude to jump to another album before Worf&#x27;s come back into phase again? You may as well let him get you back in sync with the moment the album began before going back into normal time. reply dylan604 4 hours agorootparent>remember, this album is from a time when people bought CDs and probably stuck them into a one-disc playerYou just describe the first time I every danced with Lucy.

I remember when I finally understood radians enough to really understand circles and waveforms—I felt so enlightened. Like I actually remember the moment when it clicked. For years I was just \"doing the work\" without actually understanding what I was doing, but once I was able to understand it… it&#x27;s like something changed in my brain.I want to be able to think in mobius, but my brain is currently like, \"No thanks.\" reply eternityforest 13 hours agorootparentDoing CAD design is really interesting. A lot of stuff is just 2.5D, extrusions of 2D sketches sitting on other 2D sketches.Then you accidentally make something truly 3D by intersecting things and realize you have no idea what you&#x27;re looking at, couldn&#x27;t imagine it if you closed your eyes, couldn&#x27;t replicate it if you had a picture of the result and didn&#x27;t know the 2D inputs that made it... and then you realize there are probably people out there who can see that entire design in their head.To me it&#x27;s like unicycling on a tightrope or skateboarding or realistic oil painting or playing piano well.

Say more! reply waterheater 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not that guy, but I can speak to what you&#x27;re asking. I&#x27;ve followed Wendelstein 7-X for almost a decade.Nuclear fusion occurs at extremely-high temperatures. As you heat your fusion fuel to sufficiently-high temperatures to allow fusion, the matter transitions into a plasma, which is great: plasmas react to electromagnetic fields. As such, a major challenge with achieving viable nuclear fusion is making a vessel capable of holding the fusion reaction. Because we can&#x27;t create on-demand gravity wells, the next best option for confinement is using electromagnetic fields to hold the plasma in the air.So, you now have an \"electromagnetic bottle\" capable of suspending a fusion reaction above the reactor&#x27;s walls. Now, you have another issue: how do you ensure the fuel will sufficiently mix to sustain a fusion reaction? One approach is to move the plasma in a loop. The topologically-simplest method to accomplish this loop is the torus. Such a plasma-confinement device is called a tokamak. A tokamak uses two magnetic fields, torodial and polodial, to accomplish its task. The torodial field is driven through the plasma to push it forward, while the polodial field pulls the plasma in toward the center. Proper balance of these fields will allow the plasma to circuit the vessel following a helical path, achieving confinement.However, driving two separate magnetic fields is energy-intensive, and a successful fusion reactor will want to minimize its own power consumption to maximize the amount available for external usage. Enter the stellarator. The stellarator also drives the plasma around in a circle, it but uses a single magnetic field. How? It \"tricks\" the plasma into \"thinking\" there&#x27;s only one magnetic field by using computer-optimized magnets with highly-complex geometries. This provides stellarators with a major engineering advantage over tokamaks and is a primary reason Wendelstein 7-X would have chosen it.With the confinement vessel topology largely identified, the next main step is to figure out how to build a vessel able to contain a sustained fusion reaction. For context, fusion experiments traditionally only operate on timescales of milliseconds to maybe a second. The reason? Fusion occurs at millions of degrees, and keeping the reaction vessel cool, ensuring a continuous supply of fuel, and dealing with reaction \"exhaust\" (e.g., alpha particles) and stray high-energy neutrons from the common deuterium-tritium reaction (which irradiate your reactor walls because neutrons don&#x27;t react with electomagnetic fields) is a major, major engineering challenge. Any operational, net-positive fusion reactor must be able to operate for days, weeks, and months on end.What Wendelstein 7-X has been attempting to do for years is demonstrate that building such a vessel is even possible. Their overall goal is to sustain a fusion reaction for about 30 minutes. Such a timescale will show a proof-of-concept system which enables sustained fusion reactions to occur.Currently, the preferred fuel is deuterium-tritium because the fuel is generally available and has an attainable fusion temperature. The stray neutron issue can be mitigated by lining reactor walls with lithium to breed tritium fuel. Even better is to use the helium3-helium3 reaction, which completely annihilate to produce pure energy as the output (welcome to e=mc^2, enjoy your stay). The main holdups are: (1) the reaction occurs at much higher temperatures than deuterium-tritium, and (2) he(lium)3 is quite scarce on Earth. Once Wendelstein 7-X shows how to engineer a proper confinement vessel at a \"lower\" temperature, you can then work on the higher temperature levels required for he3-he3. Also, he3 is plentiful on the surface of the moon, so mining the surface of the moon will be performed to obtain the required fuel, which is the fundamental premise of the movie \"Moon\".Someone asked for information on electromagnetic plasma containment folding. I recommend reading up on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It&#x27;s the mathematical and physical foundation of your interest. reply less_less 8 hours agorootparent> Even better is to use the helium3-helium3 reaction, which completely annihilate to produce pure energy as the output (welcome to e=mc^2, enjoy your stay).It doesn&#x27;t completely annihilate to produce pure energy. It produces helium-4 and two protons. Or you can react helium-3 + deuterium to produce helium-4 and one proton. The point is that helium-4 and protons are easier to shield against than neutrons, don&#x27;t turn your reactor radioactive, and at least in theory their energy can be extracted directly (eg through induction) instead of through heat.Edited to add: except helium-3 + deuterium still produces neutrons, because sometimes the deuterium will react with itself to produce helium-3 and a neutron. reply waterheater 3 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re absolutely right, thank you for the correction. he3-he3 doesn&#x27;t produce neutrons, which is the major advantage, in addition to the massive energy output.Here&#x27;s an interesting link which lists various fusion reactions: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Helium-3#Nuclear_fuel reply KyleBerezin 12 hours agorootparentprevOne guy asked why the mobius aspect is needed and I couldn&#x27;t answer. I know a lot of stellarators aren&#x27;t odd-period like Wendelstein, and the old designs didn&#x27;t do folding at all. Do you know what improvements the mobius design has over something like TJ-II? reply waterheater 12 hours agorootparentThe helical path creates a twist in the plasma which cancels out the drift forces. This is what I meant by \"tricking\" the plasma. User mjfl gives an even more technical explanation:> By twisting the plasma into a shape where the curl of B (proportional to J) is parallel to B, i.e. a helix, the cross product is 0, and thus there are no net magnetohydrodynamic forces on the plasma.Hope all that&#x27;s a good answer for you.> Mobius aspectYou might avoid using the word \"Mobius\" and instead use \"helical.\" A Mobius strip is important because it has two faces which form a single surface. The surface aspect isn&#x27;t relevant in this context, so a term which refers to the shape would likely dispel confusion in a reader.As far as I&#x27;m aware, each section of a stellarator is periodic in its own right, which means the end and start points of each section are the same. Though I&#x27;m not certain, the choice of four versus five is more likely an engineering factor rather than one of physics, whereas the distinction between a tokamak and stellarator is of physics and not just engineering. reply KyleBerezin 12 hours agorootparentIf a &#x27;particle&#x27; (I don&#x27;t know a better word) finds itself near one of the top divertors, at the same point in the next orbit it will find itself near the bottom divertor. That is a product of the \"mobius-like\" shape, so although it isn&#x27;t really a &#x27;ribbon&#x27; and isn&#x27;t really a mobius, it helps explain the concept concisely. I just don&#x27;t know WHY that shape helps lol. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t and it was just a practical design change like you said.edit: changed language about the divertors. reply waterheater 30 minutes agorootparentDid a little research to try and understand this better.The most precise term to describe the \"twisted ribbon\" flux tube in W7-X is \"toroidal helix\". The toroidal quality comes from the general torus shape of the stellarator, and the helix quality comes from the twisting of the magnetic field by magnets. (The torus shape is required only topologically; look up the knotatron to see what I mean.)The \"ribbon\" we&#x27;re talking about is properly called the flux tube. The flux tube is the volume created by the flux surface, which is where the magnetic field lines lie. A given volume of plasma contained within a flux tube should remain inside it, causing magnetic confinement of the plasma.The optimality of the confinement of the flux tube is expressed with the term \"omnigeneity\". Conceptually, a flux tube has onmigeneity if ideally all of the non-colliding plasma inside the tube stays in the tube. W7-X&#x27;s flux tube appears to be approaching omnigenity. (Another experiment which approaches omnigenity is HSX. Interestingly, HSX has one set of primary magnets, whereas W7-X has two. That&#x27;s likely because HSX achieves omnigenity via quasisymmetry, whereas W7-X uses various stellarator optimization techniques.)With these points, we can call the W7-X \"ribbon\" a near-omnigenous toroidal helix flux tube, which sounds way cooler. So, all that said, why is a helical property desired? From what I&#x27;ve read, the twist in the flux surface reduces plasma drift inside the flux tube.I think it makes sense to analogize this stuff as a circular semi-permeable pipe filled with a high-pressure \"magic fluid\" flowing around-and-around inside. By semi-permeable, it means fluid will leak from the pipe if the internal pressure is too high (remember that this is magic fluid). Trying to understand the helical twist along this analogy, I think the effect is evening of internal pressure across the pipe surface to reduce fluid turbulence and permeation while maximizing laminar flow. At least, that&#x27;s my best analogous interpretation of \"why\" the twist helps.The divertors are useful for long-term reactor operation but have no direct relevance to the magnetic field geometry. I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s two divertors for engineering reasons (performance, redundancy, etc.) and not for reasons of basic physics. reply golem14 11 hours agorootparentprevI suppose that any number of twists would be OK, but the more twists, the less efficient ?Is that what you are saying ?

Is it anything to do with the turbulence in the plasma flow being easier to control? reply cyberax 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s actually really easy to explain.Draw a torus and then draw rectangular \"bands\" across it, they will represent the containment magnets.Due to pure geometry, the area closer to the center will have a smaller distance between bars. This means that the magnetic field will be stronger near the center.This in turn means that particles will separate (depending on charge) and drift to the sides. It seriously interferes with the containment.You can fix that by changing the torus into something resembling \"8\", so that particles move to one side when they fly through the upper part, but then they&#x27;ll move back as they fly through the lower part.Of course, you can&#x27;t just do that in 2D because the part in the middle of \"8\" will have no magnetic field. You need something without self-intersections. You can try to move one side up and another down. But that doesn&#x27;t quite work either because you will get another set of preferred directions.So instead you go with the gentle twisting, resulting in the Möbius-looking shape. reply MBCook 5 hours agorootparentHow do Tokamaks solve the issue since they’re still torus shaped? reply cyberax 4 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t.

The Wendelstein has 5 folds, making it a mobius, but I think I read about one in Spain that had only 4 folds. That would mean the mobius isn&#x27;t imperitive, but I&#x27;m sure there is a good reason for it.Really a stellerator doesn&#x27;t need &#x27;folding&#x27; at all, they can be as simple as a twisted torroid.

Distributes the external&#x2F;internal forces more equally. Is it anything like this? reply KyleBerezin 8 hours agorootparentNo, twisted pair wires are really cool but different. When you push current down one wire you pull current down the other. The signal is passed through the differential of those 2 wires. If the wire is hit with EM interference, that change will be seen as a &#x27;common mode voltage&#x27;, that is, both wires will be &#x27;pushed&#x27; or &#x27;pulled&#x27; the same amount, and you won&#x27;t see a differential.That effect works both ways too, where a single wire with a digital signal will spew out radio waves, 2 wires with opposing signal cancel each other out and emit no em waves.The effect with the stellarator is more like stirring a pot. reply extrapickles 11 hours agorootparentprevIt primarily has to do with the physical construction of the magnets, in a toroid the inside of the toroid effectively has more windings per meter of circumference than the outside causing uneven containment.With mobius strip you regularly flip between inside and outside, so the plasma particles get more even force applied. reply Bjartr 12 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s about ensuring the plasma heat&#x2F;energy distribution is more uniform so you get fewer outlier particles with high enough energy to escape confinement and damage the interior of the reactor. Or something like that. reply tw061023 13 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s interesting is that stellarator actually is not just an alternative, but a wholly parallel branch of evolution - it&#x27;s not like one was invented strictly after another, and the authors of both designs never knew about the other&#x27;s work before they completed theirs.What&#x27;s even more interesting is that the fusor - the simplest possible design for a thermonuclear reactor, so simple that anyone skilled in electrical engineering and having access to proper civilan equipment can build one with ease - seems to be invented _after_ both stellarator and tokamak.That said, I never particularly liked stellarator design. The very _complexity_ of it somehow feels subtly wrong, like doubling down in the wrong direction.However, this is one of the cases where I would absolutely love to be proven wrong. We are far past due big breakthroughs in the field. reply waterheater 12 hours agorootparentCompared to a tokamak, the stellarator bring engineering efficiency while matching performance. Though ideas for the tokamak and the stellarator may have emerged together, the main reason tokamaks were built first is because they COULD be built.

Given the extreme heat of the plasma, and that it must be magnetically suspended so that it doesn&#x27;t even touch the sides of the containment, how is that heat transferred to some other medium to generate electricity? reply tsimionescu 13 hours agoparentMost of the answers are missing the actual (proposed) mechanism.The energy of the reaction is mostly carried away as high-energy neutrons. So, the way to get energy back is to \"capture\" those neutrons. Since neutrons are not electrically charged, you can&#x27;t use them to directly create electricity, so all you&#x27;re left with is using them for heat.Unfortunately, since they are electrically neutral, they&#x27;re also relatively hard to catch. You need a dense material where they will have a good chance to hit some nucleus. The proposed designs are typically some kind of liquid metal blanket being circulated around the reactor and onto a place where it can boil water to produce steam to spin a turbine. Lithium is the metal most proposed for this, since it also has the advantage that it can produce tritium when bombarded with neutrons (tritium being the super rare half of the fuel that goes into the reaction). reply nerdponx 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s always fascinating to me that, no matter how many interesting new ways to release lots of energy we develop, we are still stuck with the same method for converting it to electricity: release the energy as heat, use heat to make steam, use steam to drive generator. reply jessriedel 11 hours agorootparentThe reason just that this is a simple process for which a steam turbine can achieves 90% of the thermodynamic optimum.

As long as you have enough net energy, collecting that 4% might not make financial sense.With fuel costs insignificant, your cost per kWh is mainly capital cost. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s all capital just to keep it simple. I don&#x27;t know how much the input energy will be but if your choice is between, say, generating net energy of 50MW without a turbine or 54MW with a turbine, then you would skip the turbine if it adds more than 8% to the capital cost.

Hydro and wind just turn the turbine mechanically, they don&#x27;t heat up water to make steam.

This puts a cap on the maximum lifetime of this type of fusion reactor until significant parts of the structure need to be dismantled and replaced, and stored as highly radioactive waste.

I feel I should know that, I probably did but forgot. reply tsimionescu 3 hours agorootparentStars rely on gravitation to confine the plasma instead of magnetic fields, and they can reach the energy densities needed for other fusion reactions, typically D+D, which produces less neutrons. Also, there are hundreds of thousands of kilometers between the center of the sun and its outermost layers - neutrons produced in the core will have plenty of time to be absorbed by something else on their way out. reply jtriangle 13 hours agoparentprevSame way most electricity is made, you use the energy created to heat up water into high pressure steam, high pressure steam turns a turbine(s) which turn gensets that produce 3 phase AC current.This one in particular isn&#x27;t setup to do that, and as far as I know, none are yet. It&#x27;s a pretty simple engineering problem, and, until we can maintain fusion for months at a time, it&#x27;s not really something that needs to be built.There is, however, one fusion concept that shows some promise that doesn&#x27;t require all that that helion energy is developing (helionenergy.com) they&#x27;re yet to create net-power, but, their idea has some promise, and avoids the common problems with other forms of fusion power.

Mass is in this equation. reply willis936 13 hours agorootparentWhat if you have 10^20 particles? Each charged particle emits photons with energy&#x2F;frequency proportional to their speed (Bremsstrahlung). This is mostly from electrons because they are much lighter and so are much hotter&#x2F;faster. Plasmas are quasineutral though so you&#x27;ll have those electrons present. There is a long line of research trying to get away from that constraint with little luck so far (but it should continue to be worked on!).Jumpjng back up the stack: photon radiation is mostly considered a loss since it transfers energy out of confinement and does not impart it on other fuel. You nominally extract your heat via neutrons: same as fission reactors. Some designs (Helion) aim for reactions with charged byproducts.

How does inertial confinement look? Any thoughts on the newly funded start-up Blue Laser Fusion? Any thoughts on one of the older players, TAE? How about Commonwealth? Helion? Others? reply audunw 3 hours agoparentI think Helion is most promising for two reasons. 1. Even if the more traditional fusion power plants manage to generate the plasma itself in a device that’s not too expensive (big if) it seems that just the heat exchange mechanism itself would be extremely complicated and expensive. And since they’re thermal power plants you’re limited in where you can put them and how big they must be to be economical.2. As CO2 emissions come down, I think there will be some focus on thermal power plants contribution to global warming. Helion will still be adding heat to the planet that wasn’t there before, but there will be less heat for a given amount of electric energy. It’s also not going to rely on dumping all that heat in a river. I don’t know if Helion is feasible. But it feels like it’s the only technology that could be feasible. reply cyberax 6 hours agoparentprevI invested a non-trivial amount of my personal money into TAE (Tri-Alpha Energy).

Also, suggesting only the military should use it suggests it is stellarators are well suited for energy weapons versus powering homes&#x2F;industry, which is also curious, as energy weapons need huge impulse amounts of power, not power that is constantly available and ramps slowly by comparison. reply dumdumchan 7 hours agoprev> The energy turnover of 1.3 gigajoule was achieved with an average heating power of 2.7 megawatts, whereby the discharge lasted 480 seconds.Can a physicist&#x2F;thermal engineer explain what this means? reply danbruc 2 hours agoparentThey heated the plasma with a power of 2.7 MW for 480 s which in total deposited 2.7 MW × 480 s = 1296 MJ, i.e. 1.3 GJ, of energy into the plasma heating it up. That is the energy of 310 kg of TNT (4.184 MJ&#x2F;kg) or burning 38 l of gasoline (34.2 MJ&#x2F;l). Keep in mind that this energy was deposited into the plasma which has a mass of only about 10 mg. reply nielsbot 5 hours agoprevW7-X seems on track to meet their goal of 30 mins sustained plasma. I wish them all the best! reply YossarianFrPrez 14 hours agoprevIf I understand things correctly, the problem with magnetic confinement (e.g. Tokomaks, Stellarators) is that once you have heated a plasma such that it is \"fusing,\" how do you get the power out with out cooling the very plasma you&#x27;ve just spent a lot of energy heating up?Helion, a fusion startup, claims to have solved this problem via capturing an induced current from colliding two hot plasmas together. I&#x27;d be curious if there is any way the Wendelstein can produce electricity. reply Tuna-Fish 14 hours agoparentMost fusion power systems assume they are doing that as neutrons. D-T fusion conveniently has the proportion of energy that gets lost from the plasma as KE of neutrons be pretty close to the amount of energy that a conveniently sized fusion reactor can afford to remove from the plasma.Then you trap the neutrons with, for example, a lithium blanket, use them to breed more tritium, and produce energy with a turbine from the heating of the blanket. reply YossarianFrPrez 13 hours agorootparentAh, got ya.

But in developed countries, energy use per capita has been roughly stable for decades. The 2 main drivers of energy growth will weaken over time (population growth + countries becoming developed).Also, if energy use does increase by 10x, the solution is simple, build giant refrigerators powered by fusion energy to cool the atmosphere. (joke) reply MichaelZuo 11 hours agorootparentI could see a plausible 10x growth if literally the entire world achieved within the ballpark of 2023 US levels of per capita wealth. reply slashdev 13 hours agoparentprevAssuming I trust the math, that’s plotting exponential growth in energy usage out for 80 years, and assuming a fully nuclear grid. Neither of those is likely. Lastly the Paris accord is a pipe dream that will never happen. A target to aim for, and miss. Nothing more. reply aquafox 13 hours agoparentprevWhy the down votes? What is factually wrong with that statement? reply constantcrying 12 hours agorootparentThe threat of the earth heating up by 0.3 degrees due to energy production is irrelevant or at least absolutely worth it as a tradeoff for working fusion.The dangers of climate change is not that the earth heats up by some small amount, the earth can easily cope with that. It is that continued greenhouse gas emissons are causing a ever increasing heatup due to trapped solar energy.(It is also extremely strage that he argues for geothermal in his comments. Does he not realize what that is? Literally heating up the surface of the earth with energy from below.) reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 12 hours agorootparentprevThe burning of 1 kg of coal heats the earth in two ways:A) the energy that is produced immediately (about 24MJ)B) the excess energy absorbed from the Sun over many subsequent years, caused by CO2 emitted burning that coal.The B is much larger than A. The fusion only produces A, but not B. reply coolspot 12 hours agorootparentprevDidn’t downvote you, but having unlimited energy source is worth it and can allow us to remove heat from earth. Human-caused CO2 alone contributes 2.1W&#x2F;sqm while all current human energy production is 0.04W&#x2F;sqm . Removing extra CO2 alone would offset 50x energy production growth. Then you can do things like placing reflective satellites between earth and sun. reply pfdietz 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause the argument involves unlimited future growth in energy use. Compared to the current energy use, fusion (assuming it could be made to work practically) would indeed solve global warming. reply andbberger 12 hours agoparentprevthis is a basic consequence of thermodynamics and true for all power generation. the only thing to be done to minimize waste heat is to to increase temperature of the hot side of the heat engine, with ie advanced fission reactors.and fusion never had any advantage over fission anyways, other than that people aren&#x27;t scared of it yet. reply expertentipp 13 hours agoprevWith gas cut off from pipeline terminated in Greifswald, how will they power now this bottomless energy pit?

    "originBody": "NEWS ▼ CONTACT SUBSCRIBE Youtube-dl Site Goes Offline as Hosting Provider Enforces Court-Ordered Ban August 9, 2023 by Ernesto Van der Sar HOME > LAWSUITS > APPS AND SITES > Hosting provider Uberspace has taken down the website of YouTube-ripping software, youtube-dl. The removal is the result of a German court order in a copyright infringement lawsuit, filed by Sony, Warner and Universal. While Uberspace didn't host the open source software, it was held responsible for the website linking to the software hosted on developer platform GitHub. In 2020, the RIAA infuriated many players in the open source community by targeting YouTube-ripping tool, youtube-dl. The RIAA sent a takedown notice to GitHub, claiming that the software bypassed technological protection measures, in violation of the DMCA. GitHub initially complied but later changed course. After consulting legal experts, including those at the EFF, it restored the youtube-dl repository and launched a million-dollar defense fund to assist developers in similar disputes. Targeting youtube-dl’s Host This episode was a massive setback for the music industry, which had been fighting stream-ripping tools for years. However, instead of laying down their arms, Sony, Warner and Universal went after Uberspace, youtube-dl’s website hosting company in Germany. A German court previously ruled that stream-ripping software bypasses YouTube’s ‘rolling cipher’ download protection. This is seen as a circumvention of technical protection measures, a violation of intellectual property law in Europe. Earlier this year this line of reasoning was also adopted by the district court of Hamburg. While the open source youtube-dl software is hosted on GitHub, Uberspace was held liable as the host of the youtube-dl.org website because it linked to the developer platform. In its defense, Uberspace argued that the protection can be circumvented using any regular web browser and in any case, the youtube-dl software has plenty of legal uses. These arguments failed to sway the court. The court recognized that YouTube’s rolling cipher protection is far from perfect but concluded that it’s good enough to signal to average users that downloading content from YouTube is not permitted. “[T]he average user must recognize that YouTube content, unlike media content on other websites, cannot be downloaded with a simple right-click and must be aware that this is achieved using technology on YouTube and that youtube-dl ‘overrides’ this protection. It is therefore to be assumed that the average user acts in bad faith,” the Hamburg Court wrote. Ban Enforced The ruling was published in March but Uberspace wasn’t required to take action right away. The hosting company decided to appeal, which meant that the youtube-dl.org site remained online, unless the music companies posted a €20,000 bond. Initially, it didn’t appear that the labels would enforce the order, but that changed a few days ago. The plaintiffs informed Uberspace that they had posted the security, leaving the company no other choice than to take the site offline. Speaking with TorrentFreak, Uberspace owner Jonas Pasche says that his hands are tied. Failure to comply with the order would either result in a massive fine, or worse, a prison sentence. “I received that information from the plaintiff’s side on July 27, with proof that they did the security deposit at a bank. So I no longer have a choice but to follow the judgment. Otherwise, I would face a fine of €250,000 or jail time,” Pasche notes. For several days, people who visited youtube-dl’s website saw a blocking notice instead, which is shown above. At the time of writing, the website doesn’t load at all. Appeal ‘Censorship’ Order Uberspace will continue the legal battle and is prepared to fight the order up to the highest court possible. If the appeal is successful, Pasche will gladly unblock the site. “We are confident that a higher court will overturn the judgment of the Hamburg Regional Court, so we will be able to unblock the site as soon as this happens,” he says. Uberspace is not the website’s domain registrar, so youtube-dl may yet decide to point its domain elsewhere. For now, that hasn’t happened. The software remains available on GitHub where it also has a dedicated website. The hosting company previously told us that the Hamburg court’s ‘devastating’ order opens the door to privatized censorship, citing this threat as one of the main reasons to fight back. “The consequences of this will be that hosting providers receiving complaints will most likely kick out their customers without a court ruling, for things that might be perfectly legal,” Pasche said at the time. “This is a shameful day for the freedom of speech. It’s paving the way for privatized censorship. Do we as a society really want this? We strongly believe we’re on the right side of history here.” Next Post Previous Post Tagged In: Uberspace YouTube-DL You Might Also Like: PIRACY ‘Youtube-dl Hosting Ban Paves the Way to Privatized Censorship’ April 11, 2023, 19:33 by Ernesto Van der Sar LAWSUITS Music Labels Win Legal Battle Against Youtube-dl’s Hosting Provider April 4, 2023, 15:58 by Ernesto Van der Sar LAWSUITS Yout Seeks Clarification on the Legality of Youtube-DL Based Software December 12, 2022, 22:55 by Ernesto Van der Sar Submit a correction or tip.

That’s a hard goal.TPM1.2 (used up until a few years back) is already broken because it uses SHA-1.

If this behavior is illegal they might also have standing to sue whoever is sending the reports.All of that requires you to have at least some amount of evidence tying the false reports to the competitor, too.

At least in the US, you could certainly get sued for continually disrupting someone else&#x27;s business, but to sue another party, they&#x27;d need to also be in the US so they could be served and actually subject to being forced to appear in a US court and a judgment against them could be enforceable. Otherwise, you end up in a situation like some Chinese business owner just building their own McDonald&#x27;s.

This law never says the false accusation has to be made to a law enforcement agency, even though similar laws in other jurisdictions do explicitly say that; I don&#x27;t see why a court would insert that requirement when the text doesn&#x27;t explicitly contain it.

It’s called ‘receiving the signal’. reply Mordisquitos 13 hours agorootparentAll a conventional radio does is translate electromagnetic waves that are already surrounding it into sound waves that we can hear. An intellectual-property-maximalist lawyer could cogently argue that a radio that records the signal onto a tape or other storage device is somehow violating the IP rights of the authors, as it is interacting with the work in materially different way than an ordinary radio. Not that I would agree with this lawyer in any way, but the lawyer would at least have a basis to argue that one thing is not like the other.However, video streams are not a signal floating in the EM spectrum. They are 1:1 connections that must be requested, their content must be actively downloaded onto local memory, and the content must be transcoded and&#x2F;or decoded into images and sound to be consumed by a human. The point is that this description is as true for a video being watched on the official YouTube app on a Pixel 5 as it is for a video that has been downloaded with youtube-dl&#x2F;yt-dl on a PC. There is no material difference in the actual events taking place. reply belorn 12 hours agorootparentRadio has since the mid 1990 moved towards digital signals, and by now almost all conventional radio receivers do not covert electromagnetic waves into sound waves. They covert electromagnetic waves into a digital sound file, which then get copied into local memory and run inside a software program that plays the sound (and generally outputs meta data). It can also buffer sound if it wants to.As a interesting side-note, Norway has stopped using FM radio in favor of digital radio, and Sweden is on route to do the same. The primary argument here on Sweden in favor of keeping FM radio is that older car models might still not be compatible with digital radio, and the FM radio could in theory be useful case of national emergency. reply superkuh 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s literally exactly the same. I can listen to a broadcast radio signal with my rtl-sdr usb dongle and save as much as I want of the instantaneous streaming data.

The only difference with \"streaming\" is that lawyers think it is somehow not downloading when you delete it afterwards. Magical thinking. reply Espionage724 6 hours agorootparentDownloading implies data persists. AM&#x2F;FM radio and TV antennas take an active signal and play it on-demand, without persisting the data, and without copy-protection.The detail is with what&#x27;s in-between the signal and how you&#x27;re using it.- It&#x27;s fine for me to record antenna TV to VHS; there&#x27;s no copy-protection and it&#x27;s for personal-use- It&#x27;s probably questionable, but largely fine for me to record songs playing with my phone&#x27;s sound recorder; you can&#x27;t copy-protect public audible noise in this context- It&#x27;s not fine for me to put a dongle&#x2F;box in-between a Roku or TV streaming box in order to break HDCP to record content. The problem here is breaking the platform&#x27;s copy-protection.- It&#x27;s not fine for me to go to a torrent site and download a song.

This is, at minimum[1], a three-sided war between publishers, authors, and customers. Artists want to be paid but need to go through a publisher to sell[2], while customers want to watch&#x2F;listen&#x2F;read but need to buy through a publisher. Publishers have massive incentives to screw over artists by reducing or diluting their take in favor of whatever keeps the machine fed.While both publishers and artists need some kind of limited coercive copyright arrangement in order to have a market for their work, they tend to disagree heavily on who should own those rights and how long they should last. Artists want to sell the thing they made, but publishers want assets: they want a brand that can neatly fit on a marketing schedule or an accounting statement. The former only requires short term copyright owned by individual artists while the latter requires infinity-minus-one-day terms, four companies that own the world&#x27;s culture, and increasingly expansive interpretations of DMCA 1201 that invent DRM out of things never intended to be DRM.[0] Let&#x27;s not call them \"content creators\"[1] We can subdivide these groups further still, of course, but three groups is enough to make my point.[2] As per [1] we are treating distributors and publishers as part of the same group of middlemen. For example, while Amazon Kindle self-publishing does not do some of the same marketing or promotion that a traditional book publisher might, they are still intermediaries between authors and readers. reply pessimizer 15 hours agorootparentprevContent brokers. reply mellosouls 17 hours agoprevDiscussion on the RIAA attack from a couple of years ago mentioned in the article.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24872911The github reversal at the time, including a link to evidence received in support:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.blog&#x2F;2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-yo... reply hiatus 17 hours agoprev> Speaking with TorrentFreak, Uberspace owner Jonas Pasche says that his hands are tied.

Extended Tutorial Webserver Publish Share Network Access Port Forwarding Access Control End-to-End Encryption SSH Integration VPN Integration Load Balancing SNI Proxy Comparison With Other Tools Tailscale vs. Narrowlink Client Gateway Agent Token Generator Comparison With Other ToolsTailscale vs. Narrowlink Tailscale vs. Narrowlink TIP If this is your first visit to this website, please take a moment to review the Introduction section to gain a basic understanding of Narrowlink. Then, reading this page will be more beneficial. Narrowlink and Tailscale are two open-source solutions with different architectures that enable secure remote access and connectivity across networks. They share some similarities but also have key differences in their architectures, features, and use cases. Overview Tailscale is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that provides a zero-config VPN using the WireGuard protocol. It is partially open source and uses a peer-to-peer mesh architecture that connects devices through the Tailscale cloud services. Tailscale aims to be easy to use out of the box. Narrowlink is a self-hosted platform that consists of a gateway, agents, and clients acting as a proxy server. It uses a client-agent-gateway model to facilitate connectivity across restricted networks. Narrowlink is fully open source and designed to be flexible, transparent, and secure, and it can be deployed on your infrastructure. Tailscale and Narrowlink are both excellent solutions for remote access and connectivity. However, Tailscale focuses on enabling access between different devices, while Narrowlink focuses on accessing services through agents as proxies. Architecture Narrowlink uses a centralized gateway to which clients and agents connect over HTTP/S protocols. The gateway handles routing and connections between agents behind firewalls/NAT and clients. Narrowlink does not have centralized configuration management to define agents, clients, access control policies, etc. The gateway is configured dynamically based on the tokens that agents and clients use, making it easy to scale and deploy. Tailscale devices connect directly to each other over WireGuard in a mesh architecture in a peer-to-peer fashion. Tailscale uses a centralized configuration management system to define devices, access control policies, etc. Traffic is routed through the Tailscale cloud services to facilitate connections between devices. Open Source Narrowlink is completely open source. All components, including the gateway, agents, and clients, are open source. Tailscale uses the open source WireGuard protocol, and its client apps are open source, but the coordination services are proprietary. Security and Privacy Both Tailscale and Narrowlink are considered secure and private. Tailscale uses the WireGuard protocol and provides end-to-end encryption between devices by default. Narrowlink uses the HTTP/S protocol to transfer data between agents and clients to the gateway, which is encrypted by default. Since the data is transferred through the gateway, the gateway has access to the data. However, Narrowlink has implemented optional end-to-end encryption between agents and clients using the XChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher, adding an extra layer of security and privacy. Due to the nature of the peer-to-peer architecture, the connection between Tailscale devices can be observed by the ISP and the Tailscale cloud services. However, the data itself is encrypted and cannot be read by the ISP or Tailscale cloud services. In Narrowlink, the ISP only observes the connections between agents or clients and the gateway, which are covered by the HTTPS protocol, appearing as normal web traffic, and the gateway has access to the connection data and info. However, if end-to-end encryption is enabled, the gateway cannot read the data. Tailscale requires special permissions such as root/admin access to install and run the client app. It sometimes requires changing the OS and firewall configuration to enable IP forwarding. Narrowlink does not require any special permissions to install and run the agent and client for any of the functionalities. Internet Sharing Both Tailscale and Narrowlink can be used to share internet access between devices. This concept is known as \"exit node\" in the Tailscale architecture. Tailscale needs to enable IP forwarding on the exit node device, which can lead to security issues as other computers within the same VLAN may use your computer as a gateway. In contrast, Narrowlink does not need to enable any sort of IP forwarding feature or change your firewall configurations, as it acts as a proxy. Additionally, you can apply ACLs to restrict access to the internet. Access Control Both tools use ACLs to control access to devices and services. However, access control in Tailscale is limited in comparison to Narrowlink. Tailscale only supports IP-based ACLs. Narrowlink supports more granular ACLs, including IP, domain, port, and time-based whitelist and blacklist ACLs. Since Narrowlink accesses services through the agent, the ACLs can be applied to the external network that the agent is going to connect to. For example, you can share your network access with your friend while restricting access to specific services on your network or limiting them to access one of the services on the agent's network. Self-Hosted Narrowlink is designed to be self-hosted on your infrastructure, providing more control and transparency over the data and traffic. Tailscale is a closed SaaS platform that must be used over the internet through their cloud coordination service. CDN Compatibility Since Narrowlink uses HTTP/S protocols as a transport channel, it can be deployed behind a content delivery network (CDN) such as Cloudflare to improve performance. In other words, agents or clients can connect to the gateway through the CDN. Tailscale uses the WireGuard protocol, which is not compatible with CDNs. Publishing Services Both Narrowlink and Tailscale can publish your local web services on the internet and automatically issue certificates for them. Tailscale calls this feature \"Funnel,\" but this feature only works for HTTPS connections, and users must use Tailscale's infrastructure to publish their services, using Tailscale's domain (custom domains are not supported). Tailscale issues the certificate on the client machines, preventing the Tailscale infrastructure from decrypting your traffic and using an SNI proxy to route the traffic to the correct client. Narrowlink is more flexible in this case, offering three modes of operation for publishing web services on the internet: HTTP/S transparent proxy mode: In this mode, Narrowlink automatically issues and manages the certificates on the gateway, publishing your services on both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. In this mode, the gateway decrypts the TLS traffic and routes it to the correct agent. This mode is perfect for use behind CDNs and is useful for users who prioritize caching and performance over security. SNI proxy mode: In this mode, Narrowlink relies on the SNI extension in the TLS protocol, similar to Tailscale, and does not decrypt the traffic. Certificate management should be performed by the users, and they can even use their custom certificate. This mode is useful for users who prioritize security over performance. Mixed mode: In this mode, users can define that HTTP connections use the transparent proxy mode, and for TLS connections, it acts as SNI mode. Since Narrowlink is a self-hosted platform, you can use your custom domain and publish your web services on any port and protocol. Network Performance Tailscale technically offers better network performance than Narrowlink due to its peer-to-peer architecture. However, the performance of Narrowlink is still good enough for most use cases. Narrowlink's performance depends on the bandwidth of the gateway and devices, while Tailscale's performance depends on the bandwidth of the devices. Narrowlink can also be deployed behind a CDN to utilize caching and enhance performance for publishing services. Efficiency Narrowlink has better efficiency in terms of binary size, memory usage, and CPU usage. Narrowlink is written in Rust, while Tailscale is written in Go and C++ for most of its functionality. For example, the Tailscale client binary size is 46MB (tailscale 18MB, tailscale 28MB), while Narrowlink with libc and TLS library static linking is 3.5MB (Ubuntu x64). Bottom Line When evaluating Narrowlink vs Tailscale, there are some key differences to consider that are important to understand. This bottom-line summary outlines the major distinctions between the two solutions: Tailscale focuses on direct peer-to-peer encrypted connections between devices, while Narrowlink focuses on accessing services through agent proxies. Tailscale uses a SaaS model relying on its cloud coordination service, while Narrowlink is self-hosted for more customization and control. Tailscale uses WireGuard for better raw throughput performance between devices, while Narrowlink has adequate performance for most use cases. Narrowlink supports advanced ACLs, access to external networks, and custom proxy behaviors, while Tailscale has basic IP-based ACLs. Narrowlink can be deployed behind CDNs, while Tailscale does not integrate with CDNs. Narrowlink offers more flexibility in publishing and exposing services, while Tailscale is more limited. Tailscale aims for easy out-of-the-box device connectivity, while Narrowlink offers more options and customizability. Narrowlink has smaller binary sizes, lower resource usage, and avoids large dependencies. Narrowlink provides additional security by tunneling all traffic through HTTPS to the gateway, while Tailscale uses WireGuard, which exposes some metadata. Narrowlink is fully open source, while Tailscale is partially open source. In summary, Tailscale prioritizes peer-to-peer device connections with its architecture and SaaS model, while Narrowlink prioritizes self-hosted proxy access, ACL flexibility, customizability, and HTTP/S security at the potential cost of some performance depending on the gateway.

Tailscale isn&#x27;t really \"open source\" - or at least not without heavy qualification. I&#x27;m not an open source zealot by any means but that line just seems a little misleading.The clients are partially open source [0], but the server isn&#x27;t at all.There is an open-source implementation of the Tailscale server called Headscale, but Headscale is not Tailscale. This distinction is important because a significant part of the value proposition of Tailscale compared to other overlay&#x2F;mesh networks is their very well designed web UI which makes managing their Wireguard based networks very user friendly. Headscale has no UI (edit: there are some third-party \"unofficial\" Headscale UIs [2]).In fact the Headscale repo still says explicitly \"This project is not associated with Tailscale Inc.\" [1] even though I understand that it is (unofficially?) supported by Tailscale these days.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tailscale&#x2F;tailscale[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;juanfont&#x2F;headscale[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;juanfont&#x2F;headscale&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;web-ui.... reply LambdaComplex 17 hours agoparent> I understand that [Headscale] is (unofficially?) supported by Tailscale these daysI&#x27;m not sure if it clears the bar of official, but it seems to be not-unofficial.

If the later needed to be \"cleaned up\". Maybe there were things in that code Tailscale did not want the public to see.Funny how Wireguard&#x27;s original pitch was that it was smaller and simpler than OpenVPN or other alternatives. Now people are commercialising some complex GUI on top of it. More \"features\" on a steady basis. Some of them might be closed source but pay no mind. \"Worse is better\". reply dcow 2 minutes agorootparentI don’t really think your comment is a fair take. While it very well may be “actually what happened”, there are a lot of other reasons to hire from and foster your community rather than try to compete with them. It’s possible Headscale just does a better job at capturing a clean boundary between a public open source tool and a proprietary backend and Tailscale might have just liked what they saw, said well this is essentially how we’d do it, and made the smart decision to put the person on payroll instead of taking advantage of the community. reply SadTrombone 9 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s absolutely nothing stopping you from just using WireGuard if you want to.

It implements a narrow scope, a single Tailnet, suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source organisation.(emphasis mine) reply crawshaw 16 hours agorootparentSure, and that seems very reasonable? If you&#x27;re running your own coordination server, stand one up for each tailnet you want to run. Different software has different operating requirements, and headscale is building to requirements that are better suited to someone running their own.E.g. our internal coordination server has a bunch of goop in it for talking to a couple of AWS services we use. No-one wants that. reply TaylorAlexander 15 hours agorootparentPersonally I just feel better recommending something to people if I know the service is 100% open source. I don’t care if the code includes stuff “no one wants”. I’m a talescale user and I love it, but I do feel a bit weird using and recommending a service with important bits that are proprietary. At the same time, part of why I like the service is that it’s dead simple to use. I imagine headscale takes more effort to set up and use. So I use the proprietary client, and just kinda feel weird about it. If it were open source I wouldn’t have those reservations. reply p_l 14 hours agorootparentHaving recently put some work to essentially sell headscale-as-a-service (to clients that for various reasons wouldn&#x27;t want to pay tailscale anyway even if they found the service great), about only issues between tailscale and headscale are that headscale got a bit of cruft regarding internal models that are currently being worked on, and for practical purposes it shows up in a bit harder time handling ACLs and no tailnet-peering support. reply TaylorAlexander 11 hours agorootparentIt strikes me that if you had to build a service platform, then that shows me there is a difference in the systems from a user perspective. I am a very technical user but I do NOT want to spend my time configuring network stuff, that&#x27;s the whole reason I use tailscale. The fact that headscale is self hosted immediately creates barriers that tailscale does not have. I already host several web servers and it a huge pain that I want to do less of. (Everything is fine on digitalocean until some update does something weird and I have to spend a few days debugging it). reply smoldesu 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a networking service. Inherently, there are things you will be able to orchestrate easier from a centralized perspective than a self-hosted one.You&#x27;re correct to nit-pick the difference between Headscale and Tailscale as software products, but I think this is splitting hairs. There are perfectly valid reasons why both are different. Given Tailscale&#x27;s featureset as a product, it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect it&#x27;s self-hosted alternative to be a pushbutton replacement. replylloeki 15 hours agorootparentprev> The client is completely open source on open source operating systems.IOW it&#x27;s by and large the GUI part that is not open source.

The gateway handles routing and connections between agents behind firewalls&#x2F;NAT and clients.> Tailscale uses a centralized configuration management system to define devices, access control policies, etc. Traffic is routed through the Tailscale cloud services to facilitate connections between devices.To clarify: Traffic _may_ be routed through Tailscale cloud services but the centralized Tailscale service is used primarily to coordinate configuration and only secondary as tunnel. If it goes down, the existing tailnet will keep functioning. In contrast, the Narrowlink gateway is an inherent central point-of-failure which all traffic needs to be routed through.From a quick look this looks like one of the major deciding factors between the two.

I&#x27;m sure with more time in the oven, it will eventually become a comparable replacement, but I wouldn&#x27;t be relying on it for anything production oriented. reply linsomniac 13 hours agorootparentJust for a counterpoint: I&#x27;ve been running headscale for 11 months, with just over 100 tailscale nodes, and it&#x27;s been pretty good. There was one version upgrade that completely exploded memory use (it originally was running on a 1 or 2GB VM, with the upgrade I had to switch to 16GB to avoid thrashing), but that was fairly quickly resolved.I would say it&#x27;s been a pleasant experience, headscale and the headscale devs have been fantastic.However, I would also agree with the statement that I wouldn&#x27;t use it in production. In particular: I was hoping to use it as an overlay network for basically all traffic, between production machines and to user workstations. For the overlay network, my biggest fear there is that when headscale goes down, the entire network pretty much immediately stops responding. The usual case for this is when I make an ACL update and make an error, the entire overlay is down until I get the ACL fixed.For replacing our OpenVPN, headscale+tailscale is going to be a clear win.For the overlay network, I probably should go with Nebula. Headscale has these things over Nebula: Easier user onboarding (users can just login, no key exchange required), tailscale was able to route around some network problems we saw in Comcast (though it sounds like Nebula has experimental ability to do that now), and headscale has vastly better ACLs. Tailscale&#x27;s are even better. Another downside of tailscale is that you can only connect to one tailnet at a time, so you can&#x27;t have a \"work\" and \"home\" tailnet and be connected to both -- you have to switch.Nebula has the benefit that there is no coordination server, so no worries about that going down. Even in the case of the Defined Networking SaaS, an outage of the control plane would just interfere with the ability to manage the network, until keys start expiring your network will continue to work.ZeroTier also is very good, I&#x27;d classify it as closer to Tailscale, but it does have the ability to connect to multiple networks. ZeroTier in many ways is very slick, but I ended up removing it from my list of options because of a bad interactions with their sales team. It&#x27;s ACLs are pretty obtuse though. reply linsomniac 12 hours agorootparentOh, another slight minus of tailscale is it&#x27;s manipulation of the system firewall rules, so if you have other firewall manipulation, in particular if you manage large rulesets via iptables-restore from a rules file, tailscale can lose it&#x27;s rules. On the plus side \"tailscale status\" will report \"health\" issues in that case to point you in the right direction. reply juanfont 17 hours agorootparentprevHeadscale dev here!What issues did you face? :) reply aliasxneo 16 hours agorootparentIt was last year, so it&#x27;s not in recent memory, but most of the problem was around instability. We ran into some frequent issues where we would begin troubleshooting, assuming it was something on the application end, only to find out that the issue was happening in the network. We eventually figured out that the Headscale network was randomly dropping in and out. I&#x27;m sure with a lot more time we could have identified the root cause, but unfortunately, we had a deadline and just paid Tailscale (and haven&#x27;t had any issues since).Like I said, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s coming along fine, it&#x27;s not just something that we were able to set and forget like with the Tailscale experience. reply juanfont 16 hours agorootparentWe have definitely improved a lot the stability and test coverage in the last year.

For instance, I have a server in Poland (while I live in Canada) where the direct connection is slower than connecting via Narrowlink behind the CDN (The gateway behind the CDN).2- And in rare cases, Tailscale cannot establish a peer-to-peer connection, opting to use DERP servers and their own servers (no longer strictly P2P as seen here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;kb&#x2F;1232&#x2F;derp-servers&#x2F;). In such cases, Narrowlink may provide faster connectivity.3- When you start your Tailscale client, it needs to perform NAT discovery. If a symmetric NAT exists, it takes time to connect due to network flooding for UDP hole punching, while Narrowlink can respond on demand (see the section \"The benefits of birthdays\" on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-nat-traversal-works&#x2F;).It&#x27;s also important to note, alongside the protocol, the software implementation is crucial. Narrowlink is written purely in Rust, while Tailscale has been created by orchestrating existing tools and uses the Go and C++ programming languages. I suggest you try Narrowlink and experience its computational performance.I believe Tailscale is an amazing VPN solution, but its protocol, infrastructure, and complexities might not be the best fit for self-hosted platforms. In contrast, Narrowlink is a Proxy solution (currently not a VPN) that is very simple to set up.Please note that narrowlink only encapsulate the TCP payload&#x27;s not its headers.I recently released Narrowlink (just two days ago), and it is in the early stages of its journey. I have various plans for this project, including a web interface, integration of the QUIC protocol, and more. I just need the support of the community and more time to enhance it. reply anderspitman 7 hours agorootparentDo you have an overview anywhere of the protocol you&#x27;re using to encapsulate TCP in HTTP? Why did you go with HTTP instead of WebSockets? Does Narrowlink support UDP?Sorry for so many questions reply SajjadPourali 6 hours agorootparentNarrowlink uses the HTTP&#x2F;S (WebSocket) protocol as transport; it encapsulates and decapsulates TCP and UDP connections on top of it. This means both UDP&#x2F;TCP tunneling methods are available out of the box. For example, the following screenshot shows a UDP tunnel for DNS purposes and its encapsulated traffic as TLS (HTTPS+WebSocket=WSS). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ibb.co&#x2F;wcHB8g2&#x2F;udp.pngI also invite you to continue the discussion on the github https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;narrowlink&#x2F;narrowlink&#x2F;discussionsYou are most welcome reply c7DJTLrn 9 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the detailed response. Nice work. reply brutal_boi 17 hours agoparentprevTailsacle also has a series of performance optimization and wireguard testing blog posts; considering some of their late offload additions, and even though they use userspace wg, I find it hard to believe they are nowhere in the same perf ballpark, but I could be entirely wrong here... reply benjaminl 14 hours agoparentprevThey should move to using QUIC which is the protocol backing HTTP&#x2F;3. QUIC incorporates TLS1.3 and has an extension for UDP style unreliable datagrams (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;rfc9221&#x2F;). It would be the perfect way to bring SSL&#x2F;TSL&#x2F;HTTPS VPNs onto a modern performant protocol while keeping the simplicity in of the https based VPN. It would still have the advantage of looking like https traffic, while have the performance characteristics of UDP based VPN protocol. reply pcthrowaway 17 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t SOCKS typically tunneling TCP over TCP? SOCKS has been rock solid for meAnd on the other hand, HTTP&#x2F;S is often using UDP for the transport now reply wmf 17 hours agorootparentNo, because SOCKS terminates the \"inner\" TCP connection at the proxy. reply zhaoweny 17 hours agoprevSeems Narrowlink is tunneling at socket level; while Tailscale is tunneling at network &#x2F; IP level.I think they are comparing apple to orange here. reply Joker_vD 17 hours agoparentAnd we all know apples and oranges are incompatible in every single way. Even their physical dimensions or prices can&#x27;t be meaningfully compared!Seriously though: both of those products aim to provide secure tunnelling&#x2F;network connectivity. They do it differently, which leads to different trade-offs including, among other things, at which level the OS network stack is intercepted. All of those things can be meaningfully compared (e.g., \"do I need my favourite application Z to explicitly support and be configured to use a HTTP&#x2F;SOCKS-proxy or will it &#x27;just work&#x27;™?\" — Tor and OpenVPN give two different answers). reply hobofan 16 hours agorootparentBoth of those products provide that functionality on paper, but they are widely different products with widely different audiences.I think their respective \"Get Started\" buttons show it best: Tailscale tries to get you connected to your team and to download the client as fast and easy as possible (= it&#x27;s a product for everyone in the company), while Narrowlink throws you to a lengthy explainer page that no non-technical user will bother with. reply Joker_vD 15 hours agorootparentNotice how you actually have compared those two products according to one particularly (arbitrarily?) chosen criterion. reply hobofan 14 hours agorootparentOf course you can compare apples to oranges, but if you know that a huge amount of the population is allergic to citrus fruit, it&#x27;s just a waste of time to compare their dimensions or prices.It&#x27;s not arbitrarily chosen, and I wouldn&#x27;t call it a criterion. I am arguing that they are different products for so different audiences, that all other criteria don&#x27;t really matter.> both of those products aim to provide secure tunnelling&#x2F;network connectivityYou are talking about technical capabilities, but that still doesn&#x27;t make them similar products.

Of course you can compare them: apples are better for making an apple pie than oranges; apples are cheaper and less squishy during transportation; oranges have more vitamin C; apples have more bio-available iron; oranges (subjectively) are tastier and less sour; etc. reply lazzlazzlazz 16 hours agoprevI think Defined Networking[1] is also in this category, but I haven&#x27;t seen too many comparisons.

When you create images in packer, you need to remove state, otherwise nodes would fight over the same IP when created from the same snapshot. AuthKey expiration for infra is 90 making this another secret that you need to manually rotate. When running \"tailscale up\" with --ssh it hangs ssh connection making Ansible scripts brittle. For non-tech use, the android app is pretty useless. Taildrop is weird, I would like to have NFS over tailnet that you can easily share with others. It seems that everyone wants to build VPN solution to sell to enterprises. There is probably more profit than building opensource mesh overlay :(Given all that, I think that narrowlink architecture is flawed and worse than tailscale. Narrowlink gateway is both single point of failure and performance bottleneck (looks a bit like Cisco AnyConnect). Wireguard is very nice and modern protocol, narrowlink would need to implement own custom alternative over https. It would be interesting to see how both perform in very large topologies. reply e12e 6 hours agoparent> I would like to have NFS over tailnet that you can easily share with others.Anything stopping you there?

A whopping 80% of bosses regret their initial return-to-office decisions and say they would have approached their plans differently if they had a better understanding of what their employees wanted, according to new research from Envoy. “Many companies are realizing they could have been a lot more measured in their approach, rather than making big, bold, very controversial decisions based on executives’ opinions rather than employee data,” Larry Gadea, Envoy’s CEO and founder, tells CNBC Make It. Envoy interviewed more than 1,000 U.S. company executives and workplace managers who work in-person at least one day per week. Some leaders lamented the challenge of measuring the success of in-office policies, while others said it’s been hard to make long-term real estate investments without knowing how employees might feel about being in the office weeks, or even months, from now. Kathy Kacher, a consultant who advises corporate executives on their return-to-office plans, is surprised the percentage isn’t higher. “Many organizations that attempted to force a return to the office have had to retract or change their plans because of employee pushback, and now, they don’t look strong,” says Kacher, the president of Career/Life Alliance Services. “A lot of executives have egg on their faces and they’re sad about that.” The ‘great resignation’ to the ‘great regret’ As some business leaders accept hybrid work as a permanent reality, others are backtracking on earlier pledges to let employees work from home on a full or part-time basis. As of July, 59% of full-time employees are back to being 100% on-site, while 29% are in a hybrid arrangement and 12% are completely remote, according to new data from WFH Research. Offices are still only half full compared to their pre-pandemic occupancy. Across industries, major corporations including Disney, Starbucks and BlackRock are requiring employees to spend more time at the office, with executives often citing the need for more in-person collaboration. Zoom is the latest to reverse course, telling employees who live within a 50-mile radius of a Zoom office that they need to come in at least twice a week. It’s an abrupt shift from the company’s previous policy, which allowed employees to choose between hybrid, in-person or permanent remote work. “We believe that a structured hybrid approach — meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams — is most effective for Zoom,” a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC Make It, adding that the company will “continue to leverage the entire Zoom platform to keep our employees and dispersed teams connected and working efficiently” and “hire the best talent, regardless of location.” The sunk cost of unused office space has been a major factor in companies’ decisions to change their RTO approach, says Kacher. Even six months ago, companies were willing to eat these costs in a tight labor market to recruit and retain talent. But now, “Some companies are getting impatient, and want to recoup these large investments,” Kacher explains. In New York City, office space costs, on average, about $16,000 a year per employee, the New York Times reports. Yet the constant risk of losing top talent has been enough to make companies reconsider their strict RTO mandates. Research has shown that companies that put pressure on employees to return to the office are more likely to experience turnover issues than those that don’t. Companies that have mandated a strict return to the office three days a week without first seeking employee input are experiencing the most angst, Kacher adds. “They’re the ones struggling with retention and recruitment,” she says. “Some of the companies I work with have even scaled back the number of in-office days they’re requiring in response to employee backlash.” Who’s winning the return-to-office fight The companies that are seeing the most success with returning to the office appear to be the ones that are making decisions with their employees, rather than for them. Take Ernst & Young, for example. The global accounting and consulting firm weathered some employee criticism for its initial return-to-office announcement in June 2021, when the firm told employees that they would be encouraged to spend 40-60% of their time in the office. Their plan was put on pause through the end of the year as Covid-19 cases ticked up once again throughout the U.S., so EY leaders used that time to ask employees about their reluctance to come into the office. Common threads stood out to Frank Giampietro, EY’s chief wellbeing officer for the Americas: Employees weren’t sure what to do about pet care or child care. In response, EY announced a fund in February 2022 to reimburse up to $800 per year for commuting, pet care and dependent care costs for each of its 55,000-plus U.S. employees. The fund, which is ongoing, had an immediate positive impact on employees’ in-office attendance, Giampietro adds. Since EY first rolled out this benefit in February 2022, EY has seen a 150% uptick in office attendance across the U.S. “It didn’t take a complete rehaul of our return-to-office policies to make employees happy,” he says. “We just needed to listen to our people and understand what, specifically, was problematic for them, and offer resources to address that.” Kacher anticipates that it will take at least another year or two before companies settle into an office routine that employees are content with and bosses don’t regret. “Some organizations are still in denial that people aren’t coming back to the office, and some have moved into the acceptance phase, where they’re ready to think more creatively or differently,” she says. “But it’ll take time for all of us to get there together.” Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

One thing that is however funny is the guilt tripping used by employers who have this straw-man version of a lazy WFH employee, and more so, employers who have a delusion that their workplace is important enough that people need to sacrifice a large portion of their lives just for the opportunity to be there in person.90% of jobs aren&#x27;t people&#x27;s \"passions\" and have no chance at becoming some big world changing venture. Lots of employers like to delude themselves that their company is some big important, cutting-edge enterprise that&#x27;s making a real impact in the world. People just work because they need to. Claiming that WFH is bad because you can&#x27;t bounce ideas off other employees and get into the real world-changing \"deep work\" is silly because that&#x27;s just the employer overvaluing the importance of their company. Those companies do exist, but they&#x27;re in the minority, and employers smart enough to have founded&#x2F;run those kinds of companies usually are smart enough to see the merits of a hybrid policy. reply troupe 11 hours agoparentI find it funny that when people were required to be home, employers talked about what great productivity they were getting with people at home.

This meant that my employer generally only got those 8hrs out of me, period; because I had none of my personal time to spare.

Well, unless you gave everyone their individual offices with doors. But you can’t do that can you. Because then what would make the senior people special? So you have to use cubes so everyone can hear each other on zoom calls. reply conductr 5 hours agorootparentprevIt’s because meetings and full calendars of check ins and touch bases is constant and actually is the productive work for an executive. They are the ones wanting productivity for themselves. The byproduct of this executive productivity is it causes the busy work for the people who are lower in the org chart. Busywork for them is a big source of their nonproductive time and what was freed up during mandatory WFH generating the productivity boost.Then what happened was a lot of the pending and backlog of projects and busyness got moved over to a completed status. But the lack of productivity at the executive levels meant that the project funnel wasn’t keeping up. So the company was at risk of having a ton of people with not enough to do.This is purely my personal anthropological perspective of the situation having been an active participant working closely with executives making these decisions the past few years as well as talking with colleagues that do the same.

A pure voice-only relationship can feel close, but it&#x27;s not the same thing. Current technology like Zoom and similar is just not a good replacement for in-person interactions.How many times have you spoken right over someone on a Zoom call or Discord server? The social queues are erased, and things become awkward and less productive. Creativity (which applies even in engineering) is diminished when you have to use online whiteboards and planning tools vs. a real physical whiteboard with everyone holding their own pen and bouncing ideas around in real-time. To use Zoom et al effectively, the pace of thought and contribution are greatly diminished into a sort of per-turn dance.WFH is fantastic when you have a head-down, concentration-demanding task that is very clearly defined. For most other things, it&#x27;s actually harder to get work done.WFH is simply not a replacement for team cohesivity. There is a great deal lost when you do not meet in person with the people you work with on a regular basis - we can&#x27;t just sweep that under the rug because we&#x27;d prefer to sit in our home office. We have to acknowledge the real tradeoffs - the loss of the \"team\".That&#x27;s not the say WFH doesn&#x27;t work. Some people make an entire career working from home after all.

But now, they&#x27;re less likely to have ad-hoc collaborations over Zoom because it&#x27;s a pain in the neck to find a conference room and feels borderline disrespectful to one&#x27;s neighbors to carry on a long call when they&#x27;re trying to focus.It&#x27;s all situational.

Surfing the web, playing games, chatting with their friends, whatever they can get away with when someone’s not watching. Or maybe doing their real tasks really slow.They’re just not a hard worker.Where is an employee who tends to do a good job is going to try to do it whether they’re in the office or not (assuming that’s possible for their position). They don’t really need to be monitored at home or at work. They would do basically the same either way.So all you’re left with is you need to check real productivity instead of the appearance of productivity. THAT’S what matters, not where the employee is physically located during the day.Some people are exceptions and will work significantly better in one environment or the other.

We&#x27;ve not found this to work well over zoom. Overall, this works out to a day or two a month, but most people choose to come in at least 1 day a week for various reasons (mostly social).We casually observed there seemed to be a split in employee WFH performance, with most performing as expected or better when WFH, but a minority performing MUCH worse. That is, significantly less than 50% of the productivity they have while in the office.We&#x27;ve had casual one-to-one meetings with those individuals, and while a few will sort themselves out, most just flat out deny a difference. So we resorted to adding some very basic anonymised monitoring tools to a random subset of staff laptops (hence throwaway account).What we found was that the majority are indistinguishable which days they are working from home and which days they are in the office, but a minority basically do no work when WFH. By this I mean, behaviour such as their laptop is idle for 20 minutes then active for a few seconds. As it&#x27;s anonymised we can&#x27;t be sure, but I&#x27;m guessing those are the staff we&#x27;ve identified as having a problem. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they had a second job.The problem is: what to do about it? We&#x27;re in the UK so just firing people without cause isn&#x27;t an option. HR are saying it would be unfair, humiliating and potentially constructive dismissal if we forced the problem staff into the office but not everyone else. There&#x27;s also a lot of valid discomfort and GDPR-related fear around the idea of installing heavy surveillance tools on laptops to collect evidence, and a concern that it will make for a hostile work environment. Even if we just used it very selectively on staff suspected to be breaking their contract, they would undoubtedly tell their colleagues which would lead to discontent. But without that evidence, it&#x27;s very difficult to legally justify sacking someone.The HR people are trying to force us back to the office because these issues are too challenging to deal with, but we (the tech team management) are trying to find a way to deal with staff who are taking the piss without upsetting everyone else in the process.What&#x27;s the play here? Genuinely looking for a good solution as, like many others, I personally enjoy WFH and don&#x27;t want to have to give it up. reply buzziebee 49 minutes agorootparentYeah this is a problem with specific employees, not with WFH. If people aren&#x27;t adult enough to manage their own time and perform their duties without someone over their shoulder then that&#x27;s a them problem.I worked at a company which had a similar approach to the one being considered , i.e. force everyone in. Every decision there was based on the lowest common denominators. This meant that the really good high performing people all quit. It&#x27;s a ghost town over there these days.Set expectations, support people with meeting them, fire them if they continue taking the piss. Don&#x27;t ruin it for all of you high performers because you can&#x27;t be bothered going through the process to fire someone. You&#x27;ll have better overall performance, satisfaction, and retention if you work to get the slackers either performing or out. reply WillDaSilva 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy not have the managers of the underperforming employees be straightforward with them? Tell them that, as far as the manager&#x2F;company is concerned, they&#x27;re underperforming (no need to single out the WFH aspect here if you don&#x27;t want to). They may deny that their performance while working from home is different from their performance in the office, but the manager can dismiss that. It&#x27;s unpleasant, but better than resorting to surveillance software, and better than making things worse for everyone just to help out this minority who underperform while working from home.Once they&#x27;ve been notified that they&#x27;re underperforming, try to help them out. If they can&#x27;t be helped, fire them with well-documented cause (their history of poor performance). reply ilaksh 10 hours agorootparentprevYou do have cause: decreased productivity.Make sure you have good ways to measure work product. For example, you can see if people are pushing to git repos.Set aside a couple of times where people are required to log into chat or voice room every day. Have them type in a report on what they are working on and be available during that narrow window to answer follow up questions. reply mickelsen 10 hours agorootparentprevSee if embracing async work does it for those individuals, with some pressure on the deliverables but instead of end-of-day of that day, you let them deliver the next morning prior to chatting. Basically the same pace, but you shift on them the accountability of meeting the deadline for whatever widget you need, so if they didn&#x27;t do anything that day, the expectation would be that they log in sometime during the night or very early in the morning to do it in one shot, because of the pressure being used as a motivator. If you identify that pattern, you have a procrastinator with potentially an attention&#x2F;motivation disorder.With a little of handholding and outcome motivation management, you should be able to hack into their dopamine cycle, keep their interest and those deliverables coming. reply cgio 7 hours agorootparentprevThey just procrastinate on their own rather than corporate laptop when at home. The solution is to make work about delivery rather than hours on a chair. If someone can do it in 20 seconds then good for them, less good for you (not personally) in terms of how efficient you are in allocating work and managing its delivery. Very few employees are motivated to do more than asked for them. The rest are not the exception but the norm, and getting them back in office with unchanged work management will only help in having them look elsewhere. That’s a motivation perhaps but if you have work to do you still need to improve because the next round of employees will be similarly distributed. reply Plasmoid 10 hours agorootparentprevStart with how you know they&#x27;re under-performing.

There&#x27;s nothing to be passionate about. Employers are just mad because it takes a little more talent to do as little as possible when remote. If you&#x27;re smart, optimizing your work to exactly the requisite sprint points (maybe a little more occasionally to show \"initiative\"), making the appearance of availability, etc will net you the same effect as zoning out at 2pm and staring at your monitor for the next 3 hours when in office. Even better if you learn to exploit PM&#x27;s miraculous ability to expand into any time available for work. Now you can reduce your sprint obligation commensurate to the amount of time the PM needed you to \"plan\".

But if you pay them too much, they&#x27;ll become financially independent.Mid six figures is an objectively life-changing amount of money that an engineer would be insane to walk away from & that few companies can match. But because it&#x27;s contingent on living in places where the \"working rich\" are on the lower half of the housing market totem pole, housing will always place significant pressure even on an obscene income, and your home will never be quite satisfactory. It keeps you on the treadmill working harder and longer, worrying about the stock price, chasing the next promotion or refresher so that you can afford a little more light, a little more space, a little less commute time.

Essentially a free economic boost. reply darth_avocado 12 hours agoprevThey’re not regretting the decisions. They’re regretting the fact their poor decision making capabilities are on full display.Most of these “bosses” would still be caught doubling down on the RTO narrative and threatening people to show up to work.Bosses with Elon style of management, please take a warning. A weekly email threatening to fire people if they don’t show up in the office 5 days a week only works the first three times you send it. After a while, half the people leave and the other half don’t show up to work anyway daring you to fire them all the while laughing at how ridiculous you sound. reply sharts 11 hours agoparentNot only that but those that stay are the “yes” men&#x2F;women who are either bootlickers or accept that they aren’t valued much and thus will put in minimal genuine effort and just comply with stupid directives to the letter.In the end you just don’t get that diversity of thought through disagreement&#x2F;evolution&#x2F;personal ownership that you otherwise get when people feel comfortable enough to genuinely show up and be mission-driven. reply schwartzworld 9 hours agorootparentI would bet lots of those who stay are the visa slaves who aren&#x27;t as comfortable with the threat of unemployment as domestic workers would be. reply darth_avocado 6 hours agorootparentAt Twitter, all the visa folks left, only domestic workers stuck around. I know it’s a common argument, but unfortunately not as true. reply dylan604 11 hours agoparentprevDoe these threatening emails convey any kind of warning to prospective new employees? Not just in the WFH&#x2F;RTO topic, but if they are this draconian in one area, would it not be safe to assume it would span other areas as well?Even if I was looking for a new job where the WFH issue didn&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;d personally still be hesitant about working at a place managed by people doubling down like that reply vntx 11 hours agorootparentIt would to me. Any employer who wouldn’t negotiate on something like this for a job that does not require being in-office is potentially toxic.Commuting can be expensive and even potentially dangerous. Car, insurance, gas, dangerous traffic, time wasted driving at least 2x a day.There’s also the potentially unproductive office environments: loud, annoying co-workers, constant interruptions, etc.RTO has costs, WFH has benefits and employers who don’t recognize that should be shunned. If the reason they require you to come back is because they wisely rented office space and didn’t even consult the employees on whether the workers would return, that should tell you how much you can trust management and how much they value you as an employee. reply faeriechangling 10 hours agorootparentThe safety issues are what kills me. In a large enough office you will regularly have employees getting maimed and killed on their commutes. This is literally justified on the grounds of employee productivity as if employers just get to wash their hands of any culpability for safety so long as their employees die on their way to or from work instead of at work.Employers literally demand blood sacrifice from their employees and wonder why their employees are either leaving or becoming non-complaint when they do this without accordingly raising wages. reply darth_avocado 11 hours agorootparentprevYou’re not wrong, but it’s not that obvious to people. Most people look at this from a perspective of “ohh I’m okay with RTO so I don’t care” or “ohh I like RTO and people should stop complaining and being so entitled”. What they fail to realize is that soon it will be your paid parental leave cut down to two weeks or medical plans moved to cheaper options with less coverage, what are you going to do then? reply ChuckMcM 11 hours agoprevI had lunch, not too long ago, with a senior executive of a silicon valley tech company that was moaning about how much of a pain it was to get people to come into the office and how it felt like things would never return to the way they were. And I told them I actually knew of a way to get 100% of their employees to return to the office happily. When they asked what this magic bullet was I said, \"Go back to offices, with doors.\"It isn&#x27;t that complicated. Even if you have to work out of your bedroom when you are home you can close your door and focus, that just isn&#x27;t the same in open plan office space. reply tester756 11 hours agoparentSo, you found simple solution for very complicated dynamic and you actually believe you solved this problem?I don&#x27;t care about offices with doors.Sure, they&#x27;re better, but still it doesn&#x27;t solve my issues - I care about commute - time and money, especially time.I&#x27;ve been commuting like 3h &#x2F; day before WFH and I don&#x27;t want to go back unless you pay me at least 2.5x reply dt3ft 11 hours agorootparentOnly this would make me consider going back to the office: a 5 hour workday, paid as 8. The 3 remaining hours would be compensating for the commute, which includes the time to get dressed. Commuting costs and food should be compensated as well.Nothing else. Even with the above, I would still prefer a hybrid or remote positions as long as I have a choice.Standing on a crowded train is not something I want to do every day (once a week is plenty), there is simply nothing the company can offer to make me reconsider. reply laserlight 2 hours agorootparent> which includes the time to get dressedThanks for mentioning this. It drives me crazy how people think of commute time as the time their engines are running, whereas the overhead of doing so is relatively significant. reply rabuse 11 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention the people who have children at home, and the massive savings of not having to pay for daycare. That&#x27;s major. reply seneca 10 hours agorootparentHow is working from home able to replace daycare? That&#x27;s a new one to me. reply dec0dedab0de 9 hours agorootparentWhen the Children are basically old enough to be alone, but not old enough to be alone all day. Like 9-13 reply cyberlurker 10 hours agorootparentprevYea that makes no sense. Maybe during the pandemic it made sense when daycares were closed down and people were worried about the health risks. But now, there is no way you can tend to a kid and be a productive remote employee at the same time. reply vladslav 11 hours agorootparentprevCan&#x27;t agree more. I don&#x27;t care about a personal cubicle with a door. But I care how much time I spend in traffic on my way to and back from the office. reply WirelessGigabit 11 hours agorootparentprevEven if you pay me 2.5x. I don&#x27;t want to. I like living out there. No traffic, no people around me. I walk outside an I&#x27;m in the desert. Solitude. reply ChuckMcM 10 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a great comment.> I care about commute - time and money, especially time.I&#x27;m assuming you have done the whole draw a circle around where you live that represents your maximum willingness to commute and then apply for jobs in that circle thing? It was very popular in silicon valley during the dot com boom. When the commute circle comes up empty though, what do you do?Not snark, 100% serious. Hired a consultant who was fairly specialized and she spent 6 months working for me and at the end quit but offered to come back in 6 months. Her solution was she would live in the Bay area for 6 months, renting an apartment, save her money and then fly back to Hawaii and live there for 6 months on the money she had saved. She had worked out what was, to me, an ingenious solution to the conundrum that there isn&#x27;t anywhere near where you want to live that you would like to work.There are a lot of reasons why people won&#x27;t work in the office, and I get it, working from home is way better for the employee. One of the more interesting things COVID did was switch the \"balance of power\" from employers back to employees and so far it has been pretty awesome. In my lunch discussion my message was more \"You are gonna have to make people be willing to work in your office if you want to compete for the best ones.\" The unemployment rate is low, but employees are a population, not a single type, their effectiveness falls along a standard distribution like most things. To compete for the talent you want is making management \"cave\" to things like offices. It has been relatively minor so far, but as work actions go the whole \"I don&#x27;t wanna go back\" movement has certainly been felt in the Bay Area.Organizational dynamics is a really well studied topic and co-located organizations are able to respond faster, and more effectively, to changing conditions. Consider firefighters who used to respond to a call from home, get to the station, and then head out. Versus ones that are living in the station and can start out immediately. It is a dramatic illustration of the principle but one worth considering if you are managing a large organization.Reading the comments (which are great btw!) I have observed that a number of people haven&#x27;t contextualized work yet. Specifically, an employer is an enterprise that employs people to achieve its goals. The employer has factors they can change and factors they cannot when creating an attractive place to work for people who can (in theory) choose to work anywhere. Some of those employers will say \"work at the office or quit, your choice.\" with the expectation that some will quit but presumably most will stay (change is really hard after all and it&#x27;s scary to jump into the abyss). They want you to stay of course, it is better for them, and this is a rare opportunity to suggest&#x2F;demand they revert some of the things that made working in the office so awful. Yes, making such demands forces them to decide, and their decision might be one you don&#x27;t like, but if you are true to your goals and needs you will be happier with either decision. It is just harder to recognize that future happiness in the moment when you&#x27;re crushed by them saying, \"Okay then, we will call Friday your last day then.\" reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparent>Her solution was she would live in the Bay area for 6 months, renting an apartment, save her money and then fly back to Hawaii and live there for 6 months on the money she had saved.so her solution was a gamble? get a job and hope they care enough to compromise in 6 months when she tries to move back? It&#x27;s an interesting strategy, but not an ironclad one without a lot of street smarts. stuff that&#x27;s hard to research when you&#x27;re not a local.>he employer has factors they can change and factors they cannot when creating an attractive place to work for people who can (in theory) choose to work anywhere. Some of those employers will say \"work at the office or quit, your choice.\" with the expectation that some will quit but presumably most will stay (change is really hard after all and it&#x27;s scary to jump into the abyss).but it sounds like the executive of interest more or less lost this gamble as well. they hoped most people would stay, and they either didn&#x27;t or it fell below expectations, perhaps lofty ones. I feel it&#x27;s a two way road here: employers won&#x27;t sympathize with an employee who wants to WFH when the company doesn&#x27;t, why shouold it work the other way around? reply paulmd 3 hours agorootparentprev> Some of those employers will say \"work at the office or quit, your choice.\"Haha, god no, that’s constructive dismissal. “Quit or I make your working conditions worse, require relocation to a new area, or reduce your salary” is not something the law or the courts treat as a voluntary choice, they’re not quitting, you’re laying them off not-for-cause due to a shift in organizational strategy. You’ll be paying these people to go away.The whole “RTO as a backdoor headcount reduction” has sort of been sold as this whole thing where it’s do or die, and the proper response is “well, if I choose not to do it, what does the severance package look like”?The fact that you are making this offer org-wide and you don’t know who’s going to take it is your problem, it’s still a layoff like any other change in strategy. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agorootparentprev> Whencomes up empty though, what do you do?As for anything, we settle.Now, the physical circle example feels weird to me as we&#x27;re talking about remote work. Sure no one is guaranteed to find a good remote work opportunity when looking for a job, but there is enough of choice for someone who was successfully employed for a while to find a decent remote position with reasonable trade-offs. It&#x27;s at least a lot easier than finding employment at 200m of one&#x27;s home.> Consider firefightersI&#x27;m not sure how relevant it is to our field, where very few people still have to physically move to a common place to do their job. Data center maintainers still have to go to the server racks to actually plug&#x2F;unplug machines, but for most other roles we kinda see the reverse, where people can react to a crisis way faster from home than when having to go to an office in the middle of the night.> this is a rare opportunity to suggest&#x2F;demand they revert some of the things that made working in the office so awfulWhat&#x27;s lost on me is this tireless search for a middle ground, when we have better options all-around. To get back to your firefighters example, there was a time they had contracts for specific buildings and wouldn&#x27;t extinguish fires on places out of contract. Should we try to find a middle ground to bring back these contract systems in some way, removing some of the most awful parts ? Or are we ok to move on to a completely different system that better benefits the city as a whole ? reply samstave 11 hours agorootparentprevI am 1,000% with Chuck...My best, most productives were in offices with doors and one other space-mate and we both liked the door closed and the light off.

The only thing I looked forward to while I was commuting was trying out a new restaurant in the big city for lunch.

If you want people to return to the office, use carrots not sticks.I personally can&#x27;t stand virtual meetings with more than 2 or 3 people. They are wildly more inefficient then in person. Add on top a meeting focused on brainstorms or discuss and it&#x27;s a shit show.Give people a reason to return, and have it actually be true, and people won&#x27;t complain about being asked.But just saying \"you need to be back in the office just because\" is just going to breed resentment. reply globular-toast 2 hours agorootparentThe worst is \"hybrid\" meetings where some are in the same room and some are remote. It just doesn&#x27;t work.Fully remote meetings work for routine stuff like regular team planning etc. Where they fail is what I call the \"magic meeting\" where management types seem to think if they get the right people in a room together things will just magically happen. But those meetings never achieve much anyway apart from making people feel good for a while. A remote meeting just removes any illusion. reply paulcole 11 hours agoparentprev> And I told them I actually knew of a way to get 100% of their employees to return to the office happilyI guarantee this isn’t true.

Your goal isn&#x27;t to convince people who are deadset on never stepping foot in an office again. The cost to try and change that mind is so extreme that you&#x27;re only reserving that value to executive or fellows anyway. Who already have that flexibility.But if they really do care about RTO and they want to incentivize people with a modest commute to come back... make the office better. reply MBCook 8 hours agorootparentprevIt’s something. It would fix a large complaint with most offices, and it shows that you’re really trying. You know what else would be trying? Offering other other incentives. Like increased pay to compensate for the commute time and cost.Bringing in cupcakes once a month it’s not trying. Simply threatening layoffs is not trying. Saying the word culture 30 times is not trying.The pandemic proved work from home works for a large number of people and many of them found at a serious quality of life improvement. trying to take that away and asking people to pretend it didn’t exist in exchange for some stupid token like adding a couple extra plants to the office so it feels more “homey“ shows employees that you don’t care about them AT ALL. Just like it did when you tried to force them back into the office during the initial height of a deadly pandemic. reply doitLP 10 hours agorootparentprevThey’re not bad. I would welcome the idea.

Products Solutions Ecosystem Success Stories Learn Company Try It Now HomeBlogBlog Detail Fine-Tuning Llama-2: A Comprehensive Case Study for Tailoring Models to Unique Applications By Kourosh Hakhamaneshi and Rehaan AhmadAugust 11, 2023 In this blog, we provide a thorough analysis and a practical guide for fine-tuning. We examine the Llama-2 models under three real-world use cases, and show that fine-tuning yields significant accuracy improvements across the board (in some niche cases, better than GPT-4). Experiments were carried out with this script. Large open language models have made significant progress in recent months, paving the way for commercially viable solutions that are suitable for enterprise applications. Notable among these are the Llama-2 and Falcon models. While powerful generalist language models like GPT-4 and Claude-2 provide quick access and rapid turnaround for projects, they often end up being an overkill for the requirements of many applications. As an example, if the goal is to summarize support tickets and categorize issues into predetermined buckets, there's no need for a model capable of generating prose in the style of Shakespeare. Setting security concerns aside, employing GPT-4 for such tasks is akin to using a space shuttle for a cross-town commute. To support this claim, we study fine-tuning the Llama-2 model of various sizes on three tasks: Functional representations extracted from unstructured text (ViGGO) SQL generation (SQL-create-context) Grade-school math question-answering (GSM8k) We specifically show how on some tasks (e.g. SQL Gen or Functional Representation) we can fine-tune small Llama-2 models to become even better than GPT-4. At the same time, there are tasks like math reasoning and understanding that OSS models are just behind even after significant gains obtained by fine-tuning. The performance gain of Llama-2 models obtained via fine-tuning on each task. The darker shade for each of the colors indicate the performance of the Llama-2-chat models with a baseline prompt. The purple shows the performance of GPT-4 with the same prompt. The stacked bar plots show the performance gain from fine-tuning the Llama-2 base models. In Functional representation and SQL gen tasks with fine-tuning we can achieve better performance than GPT-4 while on some other task like math reasoning, fine-tuned models, while improving over the base models, are still not able to reach GPT-4’s performance levels. In particular we show that with the Llama-13b variant we observed an increase in accuracy from, 58% to 98% on functional representations, 42% to 89% on SQL generation, and 28% to 47% on GSM. All of these experiments are done using Anyscale fine-tuning and serving platforms as offered as part of Anyscale Endpoints. In addition to providing more quantitative results, this blog post will present a technical deep-dive into how you can leverage Llama-2 models for specialized tasks. We will discuss the correct problem formulation, the setup of evaluation pipelines, and much more. We will compare methods such as prompt-engineering & few-shot prompting with fine-tuning, providing concrete pros and cons of each method along the way. Fine-tuning these models is not a straightforward task. However, Ray and Anyscale offer unique capabilities that make this process faster, cheaper, and more manageable. Our mission is to enable enterprises to harness the latest advancements in AI as swiftly as possible. We hope that the details covered in this post can help others elicit more value from their LLMs through an emphasis on data quality and evaluation procedures. Fine-Tuning Basics For all three tasks, we use standard full parameter fine-tuning techniques. Models are fine-tuned for next-token prediction, and all parameters in the model are subject to gradient updates. While there certainly are other techniques to train LLMs, such as freezing select transformer blocks and LoRA, to keep a narrow scope we keep the training technique itself constant from task to task. Performing full parameter fine-tuning on models of this scale is no easy task. However, our lives can be made easier if we use the right combination of libraries. The script we used to produce the results in this blog post can be found here. Built on top of Ray Train, Ray Data, Deepspeed, and Accelerate, this script allows you to easily run any of the Llama-2 7B, 13B, or 70B models. We will go over a couple high-level details about the script in the following subsections, but we suggest you checkout the script itself for details on how to run it. General Training Flow Training these large scale models is very difficult without scaling your workload across multiple nodes. Our script centers around a singular training function in which gradient updates on the model actually occur: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 def training_function(kwargs: dict): print(\"training_function called\") … for epoch in range(num_epochs): … model.train() … The key here is that this training function is run on each of the individual worker processes, possibly distributed across multiple machines. Within Ray Train, we use the TorchTrainer class which acts as a process dispatcher and scales this training loop across our cluster. We can let TorchTrainer know how many worker processes we want to use and how many resources would each process need: 1 2 3 4 5 6 scaling_config=air.ScalingConfig( ... num_workers=args.num_devices, use_gpu=True, resources_per_worker={\"GPU\": 1}, ), From here, the main challenge is figuring out how to split the work across our individual training functions. Intuitively, there are two ways to \"split\" the work when training a model: one could shard the model, gradients, and optimizer states across workers, and also shard the data across them. On the data side, Ray Train helps us manage the data ingestion and dataset sharding across the training loops. At the top of training loop, a worker can access the shard of the dataset delegated to it via: 1 2 train_ds = session.get_dataset_shard(\"train\") valid_ds = session.get_dataset_shard(\"valid\") Model sharding is done through DeepSpeed. DeepSpeed defines a strategy for how to split the model across nodes and when to offload compute and memory from GPU to CPU (we use ZeRO stage 3 with optimizer state offloading). Note that because different chunks of the model are delegated to different workers, if we want to access the model in its entirety on any one node (for example, if we want to checkpoint it), we would need to “unwrap” the model: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 unwrapped_model = accelerator.unwrap_model(model) unwrapped_model.save_pretrained( ckpt_path_epoch, is_main_process=accelerator.is_main_process, save_function=accelerator.save, safe_serialization=True, state_dict=accelerator.get_state_dict(model), ) Special Tokens To perform fine-tuning effectively, data needs to be structured appropriately. Rather than having to prompt a task by describing it as instructions to the LLM, we can simply encode this in plain text by utilizing “special tokens”: Before: 1 2 {\"text\": \"You are to solve the following math question. Please write out your reasoning ... etc ... {question}\\n{answer}\"} After: 1 {\"text\": \"{question}{answer}} The special tokens allow us to easily encode the structure of our task, as well as providing a signal for when a model should stop producing output. With the example above, we can define “” to be the stopping token. This will guarantee that the model will stop producing output when it is done with the task as opposed to waiting for it to output an end-of-sentence token. The Llama tokenizer by default outputs 32000 unique token IDs. After adding the four special tokens above to the tokenizer, it will instead output 32004 unique IDs – “” will have an ID of 32000, “” will have an ID of 32001, and so forth. In our script, these special tokens are added like so: 1 2 3 4 tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_path, ...) tokenizer.add_tokens(special_tokens, special_tokens=True) # this will make new learnable parameters for specialized tokens model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer)) Compute Details For the 7B and 13B models, we used 16xA10Gs, and for the 70B model, we used 32xA10Gs (across 4x g5.48xlarge instances). When using Ray, there's no need to secure A100s to perform full-parameter fine-tuning on these models! The process is simply repeated for each task. Figures below show an example run based on a context length of 512, with a total of 3.7M effective tokens per epoch on GSM8k dataset. We ran the training for a maximum of 10 epochs and selected the best checkpoint according to the minimum perplexity score on the validation set. The learning curves obtained from a full-parameter fine-tuning Llama-2 model of different sizes. From these plots you can clearly see when the training starts to overfit the data. Perplexity graphs are good indicators of when to stop the training. Functional Representation of Unstructured Text (ViGGO) The first task we examine is based on the ViGGO dataset. It is an English data-to-text generation dataset with the data centering around video game opinions. The original task involves converting a “functional representation” (a set of attribute-values) into coherent text that incorporates those attributes. However, we will reverse this task: transforming unstructured text into a structured and parsable “functional representation”. This representation condenses the information present in the text and can be used for indexing and other downstream applications. While the domain is just video games, this general problem is one that many enterprises are keen to solve. Example Data Point Let's examine an example from this task to understand the level of difficulty it can present for an LLM: Given a target sentence the model has to construct the underlying meaning representation of the input sentence as a single function with attributes and attribute values. This function should describe the target string accurately and must be one of the following: 1 2 ['inform', 'request', 'give_opinion', 'confirm', 'verify_attribute', 'suggest', 'request_explanation', 'recommend', 'request_attribute'] The attributes must be one of the following: 1 2 3 ['name', 'release_year', 'esrb', 'genres', 'platforms', 'available_on_steam', 'has_linux_release', 'has_mac_release', 'specifier', 'rating', 'player_perspective', 'has_multiplayer', 'developer', 'exp_release_date'] Let's prompt a few models to see if they can get anywhere close to our intention. Here is the prompt we used: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 Given a target sentence construct the underlying meaning representation of the input sentence as a single function with attributes and attribute values. This function should describe the target string accurately and the function must be one of the following ['inform', 'request', 'give_opinion', 'confirm', 'verify_attribute', 'suggest', 'request_explanation', 'recommend', 'request_attribute'] . The attributes must be one of the following: ['name', 'exp_release_date', 'release_year', 'developer', 'esrb', 'rating', 'genres', 'player_perspective', 'has_multiplayer', 'platforms', 'available_on_steam', 'has_linux_release', 'has_mac_release', 'specifier'] The order your list the attributes within the function must follow the order listed above. For example the 'name' attribute must always come before the 'exp_release_date' attribute, and so forth. For each attribute, fill in the corresponding value of the attribute within brackets. A couple of examples are below. Note: you are to output the string after \"Output: \". Do not include \"Output: \" in your answer. Example 1) Sentence: Dirt: Showdown from 2012 is a sport racing game for the PlayStation, Xbox, PC rated E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older). It's not available on Steam, Linux, or Mac. Output: inform(name[Dirt: Showdown], release_year[2012], esrb[E 10+ (for Everyone 10 and Older)], genres[driving/racing, sport], platforms[PlayStation, Xbox, PC], available_on_steam[no], has_linux_release[no], has_mac_release[no]) Example 2) Sentence: Were there even any terrible games in 2014? Output: request(release_year[2014], specifier[terrible]) Example 3) Sentence: Adventure games that combine platforming and puzzles can be frustrating to play, but the side view perspective is perfect for them. That's why I enjoyed playing Little Nightmares. Output: give_opinion(name[Little Nightmares], rating[good], genres[adventure, platformer, puzzle], player_perspective[side view]) Example 4) Sentence: Since we're on the subject of games developed by Telltale Games, I'm wondering, have you played The Wolf Among Us? Output: recommend(name[The Wolf Among Us], developer[Telltale Games]) Example 5) Sentence: Layers of Fear, the indie first person point-and-click adventure game? Output: confirm(name[Layers of Fear], genres[adventure, indie, point-and-click], player_perspective[first person])Example 6) Sentence: I bet you like it when you can play games on Steam, like Worms: Reloaded, right?Output: suggest(name[Worms: Reloaded], available_on_steam[yes]) Example 7) Sentence: I recall you saying that you really enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Are you typically a big fan of games on Nintendo rated E (for Everyone)?Output: verify_attribute(name[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time], esrb[E (for Everyone)], rating[excellent], platforms[Nintendo]) Example 8) Sentence: So what is it about the games that were released in 2005 that you find so excellent?Output: request_explanation(release_year[2005], rating[excellent]) Example 9) Sentence: Do you think Mac is a better gaming platform than others? Output: request_attribute(has_mac_release[]) Give the output for the following sentence: {input} Input Query: What's a really fast-paced game with multiplayer that you like to play? Expected Output: request(has_multiplayer[yes], specifier[fast-paced]) As observed, these models do not align well with our intended output. This particular task is not one that can be easily accomplished through prompt-engineering alone. Also notice the length of the input context being passed in for these models – this large input makes inference time for producing an output significantly longer than the input text itself. With all this in mind, we are interested in exploring how far we can push the limits of fine-tuning on this task. Why Might Fine-Tuning Be Promising? In one of our previous blog posts, we discussed the idea that \"fine-tuning is for form, not facts\". So, does it make sense to expect fine-tuned models to outperform other methods such as prompt engineering or few-shot prompting on this particular task? The answer to this question isn't straightforward and requires experimentation. However, there are a couple of key insightful questions that can guide you in formulating a hypothesis on whether fine-tuning could add substantial value for your specific use case: New Concepts: Can we assume that the base model has encountered the concepts within this task (concepts related to video games, etc) in its pre-training data, or is this an entirely new concept? If it is a completely new concept (or fact), the chances of the model learning it through small-scale fine-tuning are quite low. Promising few-shot: Do you observe improvements when you employ few-shot prompting? This technique involves showing the model a few examples of inputs and outputs, then asking it to complete the answer following the same pattern. If you notice significant improvements, fine-tuning could potentially offer even better results. This is because fine-tuning allows you to incorporate far more examples into the model's internal neural network weights, rather than being constrained by context length and consuming tokens for the prompt prefix. Token budget: Even if prompt-engineering is working for you, you must provide the usually lengthy prompts as input for every request. This approach can quickly consume your token budget. In the long run, it might be more cost-effective to fine-tune a niche model specifically for that task, thereby saving money. This particular task revolves around pattern recognition, necessitating a basic grasp of language and underlying concepts but not demanding intricate logical reasoning. More importantly, this task is grounded, meaning all required \"facts\" for its output are already embedded in the input. It is evident that a lengthier input prompt incorporating examples aids the model's comprehension of our intent, and that's a good indicator that even fine-tuning smaller Llama-2 models could significantly enhance performance in addressing this task. Evaluation Evaluating this task can be done from a few angles. While this task is deterministic enough to warrant checking for an exact character match, this would not be a fair metric for the non-fine-tuned models. Instead, we first check if the output function is predicted correctly. From there, we also check if the attribute types are correct. The attribute types within the function follow a strict precedence and so we check that the model output adheres to this ordering. This is mentioned in the prompt for instruction-following models (i.e. GPT, llama-2-chat), so these models are expected to output attributes following this rule. This is a hard guideline to pick up from just a few examples and the model has to pay attention to the specific rule and understand the meaning behind it. To speed up evaluation, we utilized Ray's batch inference API for scaling up inference in conjunction with Anyscale's Aviary for serving our customized LLMs. Utilizing these two components allowed us to chain LLM generation with postprocessing and distribute it across many machines. Investing time in a robust evaluation framework is extremely important, as it forms the foundation of any model development process. Results Dark colors present chat model performance using the mentioned prompt. For GPT-4, we report both evaluations numbers: with and without attribute order importance. Fine-tuned models consistently achieve >90% success rate in both evaluations methods, never diverging from the precedence rule. Both the 7b and 13b models significantly improve in accuracy with fine-tuning. While GPT-4’s accuracy significantly drops when attribute precedence is considered, the outputs of the fine-tuned models always follow precedence and accuracy remains unchanged with this added evaluation constraint. Takeaways The ViGGO dataset highlights the strongest aspects of fine-tuning, and the results clearly back it up. When requiring structured form, fine-tuning can provide reliable and efficient means to accomplish your task. This task also shows that requiring a “structured form” does not just mean matching a simple regex or JSON format, tasks that perhaps can be accomplished with libraries like guidance. With ViGGO, an LLM needs to determine whether an argument should be included or not, as well as ensuring that the order of the included arguments follows precedence. There is also the argument of efficiency. Besides the fact that significantly more input tokens were required for the general models, the fine-tuned results were achieved with only the 7b & 13b models. Serving a Llama 7b model is significantly cheaper than footing the bill for GPT-4 endpoint calls, especially as your service grows. SQL Generation with Llama-2 fine-tuned models The next task we examine is SQL generation. The goal is to convert natural language queries to a functional SQL query that can then be executed on your database. For this task we examine the b-mc2/sql-create-context dataset from Hugging Face, which is a combination of the WikiSQL and Spider datasets. Each of the 78,577 data points consists of a natural language query, corresponding SQL CREATE TABLE statements, and then the SQL query corresponding to the natural language question. The goal of the LLM is to take in the natural language query and SQL CREATE TABLE statements as context, and produce a SQL output that can query the given SQL tables and produce an output that answers the natural language query. Example Data Point One issue specific to this dataset was incorrect ground truth SQL outputs that had to be filtered out. In many data points, attributes that were integers were labeled as VARCHARs in the CREATE TABLE statements: Note that the attribute “week” is defined as a string in the CREATE TABLE statement, however, is treated like an integer in the SQL query. To avoid resulting issues when testing, we filtered out all SQL queries that assumed an attribute was an integer, cutting the dataset from 70k data points to 45k data points. While this is a strong constraint on the dataset, the python SQL engine we were using did not have an easy way to type check between the CREATE TABLE and SQL query statements – unless we wanted to write an algorithm to parse through the AST and type check ourselves. Nonetheless, the resulting dataset was still challenging with plenty of tricky data points like the following: Why Might Fine-Tuning Be Promising? This task shares some similarities to ViGGO – the LLM is trying to output a structured representation of natural language, which in this case is SQL. Unlike ViGGO, this task is slightly more ambiguous as there can be several SQL queries that could output the correct answer when executed on a data table. Nonetheless, this task is a great fit for fine-tuning as success hinges on an LLM’s ability to learn the “structure” of SQL and convert natural language to this structure. Evaluation A major challenge with a SQL task like this is evaluation. Once the model has outputted a SQL query, how do we check if it is correct? One naive way would be to check character by character equivalence between the generated SQL code and the ground truth query provided by the dataset. This approach is sensitive to a lot of factors that can raise the number of false negatives. Another way is to check the equivalence of the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the two queries. However, this is also susceptible to things like order of variable names, etc. The last approach that would be the most reliable is to run the code on a fake dataset and check the equivalence of the outputs. What we decided to do for this task is to use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 endpoint to generate unit tests for a few hundreds of these examples. GPT-3.5 is prompted to look at the question, the table schema, and the answer and generate a fake table with ten data points. This small data table can be used to compare and test the validity of an SQL query: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 from sqlglot.executor import execute gpt_data_table = { \"table_name_64\": [ { \"position\": \"mayor\", \"first_election\": \"1988 as vice mayor 2009\" }, ... { \"position\": \"mayor\", \"first_election\": \"2007 as councilor 2014\" } ] } model_sql = get_llama_response(sql_prompt.format(create_table=..., query=...)) model_sql = model_sql[model_sql.find(\"\")+len(\"\"):model_sql.find(\"\")] model_sql = model_sql.lower() try: queryresult = execute(sql_query, tables=table) modelresult = execute(model_sql, tables=table) if str(queryresult) == str(modelresult):# output is correct except Exception as e: print(e) To ensure the quality of the GPT-3.5 generated data tables, we first executed the ground truth SQL query against it. If the resulting table was either empty, or the same length as the initial table, the example was discarded. This resulted in filtering out roughly 50% of the GPT produced data tables. Results Both the Llama-7b and 13b fine-tuned models outperform the 70b-chat and GPT-4 models. One common source of error for the Llama chat models was that it would not consistently put its output SQL withintags as instructed by the prompt – this was more common in the 7b and 13b chat models than the 70b one. Dark colors present chat model performance. Fine-tuned models achieve ~90% success rate. Note that some of the natural language queries in that SQL dataset were not perfect English. This noise from the dataset is likely to have slightly affected the GPT-4 results. It nonetheless highlights an important point about fine-tuning – that these models will quickly adapt to the quirks of a dataset, whatever those quirks may be. Takeaways In this example, both the 7b and 13b fine-tuned models outperformed GPT-4 as well as the 70b chat model. Also keep in mind that for every call to GPT and the Llama base chat models, a lengthy prompt needed to be fed in. Additionally, while this wasn’t an issue for GPT, the Llama chat models would often output hundreds of miscellaneous tokens that were unnecessary for the task, further slowing down their inference time (e.g. “Sure! Happy to help…”). Grade School Math reasoning (GSM8k) The final task we consider is GSM8k. This task is a standard academic benchmark for evaluating LLMs on math reasoning and understanding. The challenge of fine-tuning on this dataset differs from the previous two. As opposed to just learning structure, we wanted to see how much an LLM could improve its ability to reason on math problems. Example data point Question Answer Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May. \\n Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May. \\n#### 72 While it would be impressive for an LLM to immediately produce the answer of 72, current LLMs are incapable of internalizing their \"thought\" process leading to the final answer. Instead, they must generate their \"thought\" process as part of the output, ensuring that the generation of each subsequent word is based on a solid reasoning process. The target answers in this dataset are formatted to outline the thought process, concluding with the final answer in the #### {answer} format for easy parsing. This task necessitates that the language models not only understand simple calculations, but also know how to progress from the given assumptions to intermediate conclusions, and ultimately to a final answer. Thus, LLMs need a solid grasp of language (including the understanding of concepts and their interrelationships), as well as the ability to lay out a logical chain of thought. The interesting question here is how well do the chat-tuned models do on this task and how much can we gain with fine-tuning? Evaluation To effectively evaluate an LLM on this task, you need a reliable method to extract the final answer generated by the language model and compare it to the ground truth. While this isn’t an issue with fine-tuned models, a common challenge with general language models is their inability to consistently adhere to a desired output format, making it tricky to evaluate. There are various proposed solutions for constrained generation, such as guidance, hinting at the constraints in the prompt, or providing few-shot examples. However, for the sake of simplicity and to ensure a specific output format for automating the evaluation process, we utilized OpenAI's function calling API. The idea is to employ a gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo model to process the generated response for LLMs that lack a predetermined output structure. Given the question, these models can extract the final answer without correcting it (if there are any errors). The following code demonstrates the extraction procedure: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 def extract_number_from_text(question: str, text: str) -> int: ## Use GPT-3.5-turbo's functional API to extract the number from the text functions = [ { \"name\": \"report_answer\", \"description\": \"Reports the final answer from the text.\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"number\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": ... }, }, \"required\": [\"number\"], }, } ] resp = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\", messages=[...], functions=functions, function_call={\"name\": \"report_answer\"}, ) resp_msg = resp[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] function_args = json.loads(resp_msg[\"function_call\"][\"arguments\"]) return function_args[\"number\"] We instruct the gpt-3.5 model to read the question and utilize a function named report_answer, which accepts an integer number as its input. This approach ensures that the model will consistently output the final integer number found within the content generated by another model. For example if the model answers that “The answer is four” we can still parse the answer as answer = 4. We've tested this on the provided answers in the dataset to confirm its efficacy and ensure that it doesn't present any edge cases. The downside of this approach is that we need to pay for OpenAI tokens for evaluation. It's worth noting that the fine-tuned models quickly learn to adhere to the pattern exhibited in the target answers and rarely deviate from it – even if the answer itself is incorrect, the output structure is very predictable. Therefore, when evaluating fine-tuned models, we simply apply the regex pattern of #### {answer} to the output generated by these models, eliminating the need for post processing with OpenAI endpoints saving money during evaluation. Why Might Fine-Tuning Be Promising? For this task, we believe that the model has been exposed to sufficient mathematical concepts during its pre-training phase. As such, it should be able to generalize from there, and fine-tuning should help in activating the appropriate mode of its internal knowledge. Additionally, if we examine the published benchmarks on Llama-2, it performs notably well on the GSM8k dataset with 8 few-shot examples, outperforming other models. This underscores the importance of extensive pre-training data. The question then becomes: Can we further improve these numbers through fine-tuning? Baselines Establishing the correct baselines is crucial for methodically measuring progress and the effectiveness of different approaches. For this test, we considered the following baselines: The reported 8-shot prompting approach using the base pre-trained models (note that we did not re-run these experiments ourselves; we are simply quoting the published results). Several prompt-engineered templates for the chat-tuned Llama variants. These “chat-tuned” models were trained by Meta using RLHF to function as general-purpose assistant models. If the RLHF training is conducted as rigorously as OpenAI's approach, we should expect high-quality results from these models as well. The following table presents a view of the prompt templates we used and illustrates how they differ from each other. Results The fine-tuned 7b and 13b models have an improved accuracy by 10% when compared to their base counterparts. The margin is less when compared to the chat-tuned baselines, as these were likely trained with math examples in the chat-tuning process. There a couple takeaways from these results: Fine-tuning the base model consistently enhances its performance on this specific task. However, it may not necessarily yield results significantly better than those of the chat-tuned models. Keep in mind that the chat models were fine-tuned to be versatile, so determining whether they are sufficient for your task requires experimenting with different prompts. Prompting the fine-tuned model does not always lead to better performance than the base model. For instance, Llama-2-70B-chat could actually underperform relative to the base model with an 8-shot example prompt, while the fine-tuned model consistently does better than the 8-shot prompted base model. Fine-tuned models for this task demonstrate superior performance across all model sizes, while potentially costing significantly less than the other baselines during serving. For this task, you will be charged for all the tokens in the prompt for each request, but for fine-tuned models, you would effectively only pay for the number of tokens in the question. Depending on the serving traffic you are targeting, your overall cost could be lower while using a more performant, customized model. Chat-tuned models performed better than the non-fine-tuned base model. It is important to make the distinction between the chat-tuned model and the base pre-trained model. The chat-tuned models were likely trained with math examples in the chat-tuning process, resulting in better accuracy than the base model. Further Improving Fine-Tuning Results While we do see improvements from fine-tuning across the board, we wanted to focus on Llama-13b and see if results could be further improved with standard fine-tuning techniques. The GSM8k training dataset is relatively small, with only 8k data points. Since learning to solve math problems is less straightforward than just learning to output answers in a specific format, we figured it was unlikely that just 8k data points would be sufficient in unlocking the full-potential of a Llama-13b model on this dataset. With this in mind, we took the base Llama-13b model and first fine-tuned it on the MathQA dataset, before subsequently fine-tuning the model on the original GSM8k dataset. This extra round of fine-tuning resulted in a further 10% increase from the initial fine-tuned model results, adding up to a 20% increase from the base model. Fine-tuning with just the GSM8k data yields a 10% improvement. Fine-tuning in two stages with both the MathQA and GSM8k datasets result in a cumulative 10% improvement. While one might expect this to align with the classic “more data, better model” paradigm within machine learning, we found these results to be surprising given the nature of the MathQA dataset. MathQA is a collection of 30,000 question/answer pairs that are much noisier and of different structure than the GSM8K dataset. The answers are of poorer quality, and unlike GSM8k, the final answers in MathQA are multiple choice. As an example: Question Answer Options Answer the banker ' s gain of a certain sum due 3 years hence at 10 % per annum is rs . 36 . what is the present worth ? a ) rs . 400 , b ) rs . 300 , c ) rs . 500 , d ) rs . 350 , e ) none of these explanation : t = 3 years r = 10 % td = ( bg × 100 ) / tr = ( 36 × 100 ) / ( 3 × 10 ) = 12 × 10 = rs . 120 td = ( pw × tr ) / 100 ⇒ 120 = ( pw × 3 × 10 ) / 100 ⇒ 1200 = pw × 3 pw = 1200 / 3 = rs . 400 answer : option a Notice the odd spacing and compare the quality of this datapoint to the GSM8k question/answer pair from earlier: Question Answer Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May. \\n Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May. \\n#### 72 Stratifying the fine-tuning into two rounds was an effective way to leverage this MathQA dataset and yield a much better final result for the GSM8k dataset. Conclusion Hopefully going through these three examples should have convinced you that while closed-source models like GPT-4, Claude-2, etc. are strong enablers for prototyping and proving the initial value, they are not sufficient for running performant LLM apps in production. Fine-tuning LLMs for niche tasks is one of the promising solutions to elicit value out of LLMs for your business, not just because of privacy, but also latency, cost, and sometimes quality (e.g. in ViGGO and SQL examples). For fine-tuning your focus should be on collecting data and setting up evaluation pipelines that help you understand trade-offs between different solutions tied to your business, and not think about the infrastructure and intricacies of fine-tuning.

All on Colab single GPUFine-tuning Llama stream: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TYgtG2Th6fI&t=2282sI have a couple more one where I do a QLoRa fine tuning session and explain the concepts as a personally self taught engineer (software engineer of 8 years moving into ML recently)QloRa fine-tuning stream: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LitybCiLhSc&t=4584sOverall I&#x27;m trying to breakdown how I&#x27;m approaching a lot of my personal projects and my current AI driven startup. Want to make this information as accessible as possible. Also have a series where I&#x27;m fine-tuning a model to be the smallest webdev llm as possible which seems like people are liking. Only been streaming for about a month and plenty more to come.Ask me any question about the stream and fine-tuning llama! reply SOLAR_FIELDS 16 hours agoparentWhat is the general thought process on when it makes sense to use RAG vs fine tuning?How does segmenting fine tuning models make sense? Do I need a terraform LLM, a SQL LLM, and a python LLM, or can I just use a “code” LLM? reply DebtDeflation 16 hours agorootparentFine tuning for training the model to perform a new task, RAG for adding knowledge.In your example, you would fine tune the model to train it to code in a language it hasn&#x27;t seen before, RAG will not really help with that. reply zby 14 hours agorootparentprevThere is an article at the original site about that: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anyscale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fine-tuning-is-for-form-not-fa...Everybody new to this field thinks that he needs finetuning to teach the LLM of new facts. I made the same mistake initially, later I published a slightly ranty post on that: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zzbbyy.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;why-you-need-rag-not-finetunin... reply sandGorgon 14 hours agorootparentQuick question - Gorilla paper talks about finetuning for RAG. Do you see this in practice ? can you do finetuning that specifically affects RAG ? reply jawerty 16 hours agorootparentprevI have an RAG video (my \"make a ChatGPT with podcasts\" video) you might be interested in. Semantic search is increddible and you might be surprised how good a Q&#x2F;A solution is by just extracting passages that answer the question.Overall it depends on whether or not you can turn your data into a fine-tuning data and if you can find a low parameter (enough) model that can use your found contexts as input to host yourself of use inference endpoints. Hosting an LLM is actually not easy and I&#x27;m finding in the field working an information retrieval business OpenAI isn&#x27;t terrible compared to costs of having a GPUs for your users across the world. reply purplecats 12 hours agoparentprevreally need a simple \"put your source stuff in this directory, then press this button, then chat with your contents\" type app&#x2F;module&#x2F;library.too much implementation detail required make it inaccessible for any non-significant use case. i imagine privateGpt will get there slowly reply zora_goron 11 hours agorootparentI wrote a simple implementation to do this in ChatGPT via local plugin [0]. Obviously it doesn’t hit the “fully private” requirement but I imagine it would be relatively straightforward to integrate into a local LLM. The question is whether a local LLM would be as good at grabbing enough context and nuance from the project to answer meaningfully as GPT-4 is able to do with plugins.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samrawal&#x2F;chatgpt-localfiles reply jawerty 11 hours agorootparentprevOne of my streams I essentially build this from scratch https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kBB1A2ot-Bw&t=236s.

Especially for different goals - like safety, accuracy, etc. reply jawerty 13 hours agorootparentOf course I have a few where I web scrape and build a dataset for myself with prefix tokens. I can break that down more on a specific stream about it. reply sandGorgon 1 hour agorootparentwell not so much as the raw data acquisition (scraping and stuff), but really data prep for finetuning. I&#x27;m hearing that each model needs it in a different format - chat finetuning data is different from instruct, etc etc reply SubiculumCode 16 hours agoparentprevone gpu? feasible with one 3060? reply nacs 16 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. For QLORA &#x2F; 4bit &#x2F; GPTQ finetuning, you can train a 7B easily on an RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM).If you have a 24GB VRAM GPU like a RTX 3090&#x2F;4090, you can Qlora finetune a 13B or even a 30B model (in a few hours). reply kouroshh 16 hours agorootparentWould be good to see a rigorous analysis of these PEFT methods on quality. There still seems to be a debate on whether these methods sacrifice quality or not. reply jawerty 16 hours agorootparentprev+1 this reply behnamoh 16 hours agoprev> Additionally, while this wasn’t an issue for GPT, the Llama chat models would often output hundreds of miscellaneous tokens that were unnecessary for the task, further slowing down their inference time (e.g. “Sure! Happy to help…”).That&#x27;s the problem I&#x27;ve been facing with Llama 2 as well. It&#x27;s almost impossible to have it just output the desired text. It will always add something before and after its response. Does anyone know if there&#x27;s any prompt technique to fix this problem? reply redox99 16 hours agoparentUse a better model.airoboros supports the PLAINFORMAT token \"to avoid backticks, explanations, etc. and just print the code\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;TheBloke&#x2F;airoboros-l2-70B-GPT4-2.0-GG... reply crooked-v 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not useful for code, but you can see the difference of approach with NovelAI&#x27;s homegrown Kayra model, which is set up to handle a mix of text completion and instruct functionality. It never includes extraneous prefix&#x2F;suffix text and will smoothly follow instructions embedded in text without interrupting the text. reply mikeravkine 14 hours agorootparentprevThe model card also has prompt formats for context aware document Q&#x2F;A and multi-CoT, using those correctly improves performance at such tasks significantly. reply behnamoh 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks, I&#x27;ll give this a try.I wonder if LLMs will have less reasoning power if they simply return the output. AFAIK, they think by writing their thoughts. So forcing an LLM to just return the goddamn code might limit its reasoning skills, leading to poor code. Is that true? reply redox99 15 hours agorootparentPotentially it could have an impact if it omits a high level description before writing the code, although obviously things like \"Sure! Happy to help\" do not help.In practice I haven&#x27;t seen it make too much of a difference with GPT. The model can still use comments to express itself.For non coding tasks, adding \"Think step by step\" makes a huge difference (versus YOLOing a single word reply). reply behnamoh 15 hours agorootparent> although obviously things like \"Sure! Happy to help\" do not help.Yes you&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m mostly concerned with the text that actually \"computes\" something before the actual code begins. Niceties like \"sure! happy to help\" don&#x27;t compute anything.CoT indeed works. Now I&#x27;ve seem people take it to the extreme by having tree of thoughts, forest of thoughts, etc. but I&#x27;m not sure how much \"reasoning\" we can extract from a model that is obviously limited in terms of knowledge and intelligence. CoT already gets us to 80% of the way. With some tweaks it can get even better.I&#x27;ve also seen simulation methods where GPT \"agents\" talk to each other to form better ideas about a subject. But then again, it&#x27;s like trying to achieve perpetual motion in physics. One can&#x27;t get more intelligence from a system than one puts in the system. reply kaibee 15 hours agorootparent> But then again, it&#x27;s like trying to achieve perpetual motion in physics. One can&#x27;t get more intelligence from a system than one puts in the system.Not necessarily the same thing, as you&#x27;re still putting in more processing power&#x2F;checking more possible paths. Its kinda like simulated annealing, sure the system is dumb, but as long as checking if you have a correct answer is cheap, it still narrows down the search space a lot. reply behnamoh 14 hours agorootparent> Its kinda like simulated annealing.Yeah I get that. We assume there&#x27;s X amount of intelligence in the LLM and try different paths to tap on that potential. The more paths are simulated, the closer we get to the LLM&#x27;s intelligence asymptote. But then that&#x27;s it—we can&#x27;t go any further. reply dontupvoteme 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can also just parse the text for all valid code blocks and combine them. I have a script which automatically check the clipboard for thisThere&#x27;s no reason to handle the LLM side of things, unless you want to try and optimize the amount of tokens which are code vs comments vs explanations and such. (Though you could also just start a new context window with only your code or such) reply kouroshh 16 hours agoparentprevLlama-2-chat models have been overly fine-tuned to be like this. You can give a few-shot prompting a try, but they still don&#x27;t gurantee a desired output. The best way to guarantee is to fine-tune on small (~1k) data points and go from there. reply jauntbox 6 hours agoparentprevIt depends on what your goal is, but I&#x27;ve had success reproducing specific output formatting by fine-tuning the base LLaMA2 models instead of the RLHF&#x27;d models. My use cases were simpler - information extraction&#x2F;synthesis from text rather than creative writing. The base models might not be good fits for your task. reply richardliaw 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;m really glad to see a post like this come out. I&#x27;ve seen so many discussions online about customizing models -- this post really does cut through the noise.Really like the evaluation methodology, and seems well-written as well. reply yousif_123123 16 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s weird that Lora and training with quantization is not being taken more seriously. It&#x27;s way cheaper, takes less time, and a lot of evidence shows it&#x27;s pretty good.I don&#x27;t think it should be something brushed on the side to be tried out later.. reply perplexitywiz 16 hours agoparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Tim_Dettmers&#x2F;status&#x2F;1689375417189412864 reply DebtDeflation 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure to whom he is responding, since no one is claiming LoRA performs as well as traditional fine tuning. If you click through to the original Tweet he shared, it says \"when you have a lot of data and limited compute go for LoRA, while with limited data and ample compute go for full finetuning\" which I think is absolutely correct and few would disagree. As these models get bigger and bigger though, fewer and fewer people are going to have the \"ample compute\" required for full fine tuning. reply yousif_123123 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure less data should require full fine-tuning. If I had 5 pages of text, I don&#x27;t see why I need to train billions of parameters that are already trained pretty well on general internet knowledge, and already know how to chat..From a practical perspective, unless cost is really immaterial, I think most will end up starting with Lora, especially for 13b or 70b models.. you could do 10 fine-tuning runs for the cost of a few full fine-tunings.But it&#x27;s still all witchcraft to me to some degree, and I&#x27;d probably try full and Lora. reply scv119 15 hours agorootparentprevThe tweet is referring to a paper that fine tunes Chinese dataset on english base model. I&#x27;m not surprised with LoRA&#x27;s poor result in this setup. reply spdustin 16 hours agoprevSeeing NER examples pop up more frequently now, and wondering why folks don’t use spacy for those sorts of tasks. reply binarymax 16 hours agoparentMy line of thinking is using the more expensive model to label data, then use a teacher&#x2F;student methodology to train the smaller model (SpaCy or BERT) for cost & speed. reply techwizrd 16 hours agoparentprevI use a fine-tuned BERT-like model for NER, but I&#x27;d be interested to compare how it performs. reply bugglebeetle 16 hours agoparentprevSpacy doesn’t work well for multilingual training data and I’ve found it barfs in more and somehow even odder ways than stuff in transformers. reply zhz_ray 5 hours agoprevDisclaimer: I work for AnyscaleThis blog seems to got good attention :) So we definitely plan to add it to Ray Summit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raysummit.anyscale.com&#x2F;agendaPlease comment on this thread if you have ideas of what kind of content you want to see more at Ray Summit reply ilaksh 16 hours agoprevOne challenge is that to get large enough custom datasets you either need a small army or a very strong existing model. Which means that you probably have to use OpenAI. And using OpenAI to generate training material for another model violates their terms.Has anyone taken them to court about this?

Any idea about the training costs for this task? reply kouroshh 14 hours agoparentHey, I am one of the co-authors of the post. So the training data for ViGGO has about 5.1k rows which we trained with a block size of 512 (you can lower the block size if you want but we didn&#x27;t do so because it was just easier to not change code :)). On 16xA10Gs for 7B it took ~15 min per epoch and on 13B it took ~25 min per epoch. So the on-demand cost per epoch is ~$7.2 for 7B and ~$12 for 13B. This is based on the time only spent on the training part and does not take into account the cluster startup time and shutdown time. reply bugglebeetle 13 hours agorootparentGreat! Thank you! reply binarymax 16 hours agoparentprevGreat question. I wish they said how long the 10 epochs took, so we could figure out the cost (or better, just posted the time and cost together):\"For the 7B and 13B models, we used 16xA10Gs, and for the 70B model, we used 32xA10Gs (across 4x g5.48xlarge instances). When using Ray, there&#x27;s no need to secure A100s to perform full-parameter fine-tuning on these models! The process is simply repeated for each task.

It&#x27;s marketing, for sure, but you can&#x27;t make money solely by giving away your product.Every single open source company eventually learns this when they have a strong competitor. Eventually you are forced to stop being open source, because no business wants to compete solely on the strength of their service quality.Moreover: a community is antithetical to a corporation&#x27;s interest in the software. Corporations don&#x27;t give a shit what people want changed in the code, for good reason: their purpose is to make money, not make good software. So business source always ends up annoying and limited while community open source provides the functions the users need, in the way they want them.So, yeah, you can make money while letting people read your source code.

Same for most other Open Source companies with business licenses. Because they set themselves up as an \"open source\" company, all the villagers revolt when you finally ask to get paid, or stop allowing competitors to steal your lunch. You can survive, but it&#x27;s very hard, and eventually they die away. (But that&#x27;s also because most software gets replaced after a decade)You have to treat your business as a business first and foremost if you want to remain profitable and competitive.

That is always worse for them.Either that or they have to go at least semi-proprietary. reply ritesofbryan 11 hours agorootparentI agree with this.TBH my view is that the frustration towards open source companies around changing their licenses is sort of misguided. If there&#x27;s a bad guy in the room, it&#x27;s AWS. AWS is very good at commercializing open source -- they make literally billions of dollars doing so: Elasticache (Redis), AWS Managed Elastic, RDS etc. Changing the license becomes one of the only ways to hold them off, and the companies that have done so more proactively have fared much better. I think everyone agrees that in an ideal world this wouldn&#x27;t have to happen, and indeed it didn&#x27;t really happen until recently when the AWS thing started to become an issue.Ultimately, SOMEONE is going to leverage the open source for financial gain. So, the question becomes which would you rather have:- The company commercializing the open source (which is in almost every successful case includes the original creator(s) as a founder, CEO, or employee) benefit from the projects success, which in turn allows them to make further investment in the project.- AWS benefit from the projects success and (generally speaking) contribute very little back.Of course, there are plenty of projects that are NOT venture funded that see great success through purely community development. That&#x27;s great! I just think commercial open source is beneficial as well, especially for larger more complex projects (databases, etc.) that need the funding. The two are not mutually exclusive.I am also of the belief that the additional funding (both from revenue and from venture investment) that goes into these projects gives them the ability to hire more people, which in turn makes the software better for everyone.Disclaimer: I am investor that invests predominantly in commercial open source companies. Previously I was developer who used a lot of open source, which is what led me here. reply Znafon 15 hours agorootparentprev> What&#x27;s wrong with monetization?

There&#x27;s just something wrong with making parts of the code proprietary. There&#x27;d be nothing wrong with monetizing by picking a copyleft license and selling exceptions, selling hosting, or selling support, for example. reply fiddlerwoaroof 8 hours agorootparentI tend to trust “side project” OSS software more than OSS software that is some company’s main product. Something like Apache Samza that a company builds for some aspect of its operations and then opens seems to be more trustworthy long-term because the commercial backer doesn’t have to compete with *aaS providers for their main source of revenue. Such projects obviously have their own problems (neglect, deprioritization of features the maker doesn’t need now), but otoh, the maintainers are more likely to accept contributions adding features because they have to think less about market segmentation and such. reply nine_k 14 hours agorootparentprevDual licensing (copyleft + commercial) has been a thing for a long time.Open Core is also a thing, and I think it&#x27;s better than BSL because at least the core part is truly open. reply josephcsible 14 hours agorootparentI have nothing against dual licensing, but that&#x27;s not what \"enterprise features\" are.As for Open Core, there is one case in which I think that&#x27;s fine: when none of the proprietary parts would be useful at all in an otherwise 100% FOSS environment. For example, if Linux support were FOSS but all the Windows- and macOS-specific code were proprietary, or if a plugin to talk to Bugzilla were FOSS but a plugin to talk to JIRA were proprietary, I wouldn&#x27;t see a problem. reply vmatsiiako 14 hours agorootparentprevCurious why you think it&#x27;s the wrong way to do it? reply josephcsible 14 hours agorootparentBecause then you&#x27;re making and monetizing a proprietary product rather than actually monetizing FOSS. reply vmatsiiako 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure if I understand your point.OSS != FOSShttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencoreventures.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023-07-open-core-is-misun... reply josephcsible 14 hours agorootparent> OSS != FOSSWhile this statement is technically true, I don&#x27;t think it has any relevance to the topic at hand.

So it has been released to open source... just that source hasn&#x27;t been released to the public. (BSL triggers after a max of 4 years into irrevocable OSS).I think the real issue is that people want more community driven OSS. Stuff that is collaboratively built and not built for a commercial purpose.

It&#x27;s the fine line between balancing profitability and openness vs deception and exploitation. Open source with community governance is clearly better at upholding ideals, but honestly, other models can work, too. As I see it today, the CLA is a major issue: it can be seen as insurance against existential threats for open source projects, but it&#x27;s being used to make pulling the FOSS rug legal 99% of the time its ever exercised, it seems.Only solution I can see is to stigmatize the CLA. reply vmatsiiako 17 hours agoprevHashiCorp switched Vault from MPL to BSL license yesterday. The terms of how they define \"competitive\" products are pretty vague, which means that any commercial product that uses Vault under the hood is at risk of violating the terms of the new license. Moreover, even if it&#x27;s not violating the terms of license now, it doesn&#x27;t mean that HashiCorp will not change its mind in future.Ultimately, it just means that HashiCorp is not an open source company anymore. One of the biggest benefits of open source is building on top of open source software to create even better software. HashiCorp&#x27;s move makes it impossible and simply slows down innovation. In fact, in their blog post, they say that they will start referring to their previously-open-source product as \"community\".Infisical is an open source alternative to HashiCorp Vault. The main difference is that it provides more tools in one platform. Some examples of these are automatic secret scanning and leak prevention, CLI for local development, integrations with services like GitHub Actions, Circle CI, etc.The core of Infisical is available under the MIT license with only very few features being enterprise-licensed – some will say it&#x27;s not ideal but at least this type of license does not impose legal risks on our users while gives us the ability to monetize the product efficiently and support the open source (MIT-based) part of the product.Over the last year, lots of developers and companies of all sizes (from tiny startups to Fortune 10 companies) have partially or fully switched to Infisical. For them, we now process over 300 million secrets per month.Check out our git repo here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Infisical&#x2F;infisical reply JonChesterfield 14 hours agoparentRegarding the open core and proprietary extensions model.

End-to-end encryption in a web browser offers minimal security benefit for reasons discussed in this thread: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21838795 (the discussion is from 2019 and the original NCCGroup link from 2011 is now dead, but all the same issues still apply).Also, I&#x27;m not sure if this has been addressed yet, but it has previously been noted that Infisical was completely lacking in automated tests. EnvKey has an extensive test suite ( core tests here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;envkey&#x2F;envkey&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;public&#x2F;app&#x2F;tests and tests for all our sdks are included in each: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;envkey&#x2F;envkey&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;public&#x2F;sdks). reply 3np 1 hour agoparentA major use-case for Vault is dynamic generation of secrets, like rotating roles in a Postgres DB or acting as CA (issuing&#x2F;revoking certs) in a PKI infra. Some, like the former, needs to hold secrets for and communicate with external services.How easy is this to achieve using EnvKey? Only allusion I see on the comparison page is \"Easy Integration: Vault=Poor, EnvKey=Strong\" but I have a feeling something else was in mind there. reply vmatsiiako 14 hours agoparentprevIn my opinion, \"having no opt-outs\" is not a benefit. It&#x27;s by definition having less functionality. Infisical offers native SDKs, API, and CLI too + many other features (such as native integrations, webhooks, dashboard, etc). reply nine_k 14 hours agorootparentIn the security domain, you often want fewer features, because every feature is another thing to audit, and another chance to introduce a vulnerability.But, of course, too few features can be just impractical. reply danenania 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s an inherent tradeoff for sure. In my opinion, I wouldn&#x27;t say that any added functionality a secrets management service can offer is worth trusting all that service&#x27;s servers, all its backend dependencies, all its employees and contractors, all its third party sub-processors, etc. with plaintext secrets.I&#x27;d also note that we are able to offer all the features you list without requiring users to opt-out of end-to-end encryption. reply vmatsiiako 14 hours agorootparentInteresting.

Unnecessarily rushing yourself to meet an arbitrary deadline helps nobody and hurts the product.

My understanding is that if someone ever gets a root access to a machine running Vault, the game is over.

This is unless you opt out of E2EE (secrets remain encrypted at rest) to use select features like native integrations - this is, however, not necessary to use the platform. In your case, you might wish to run Infisical in E2EE mode for maximum security.That said, it’s always important for you to keep your instance of Infisical secure that is ideally to not allow bad actors to gain root access to the machine. reply ksajadi 10 hours agoprevInfisical 3rd party integrations are one of the best things about it.

There are four perspectives: that of someone who was involved with sifting through the information to responsibly inform the public, that of a security area director of the IETF, that of a human rights expert, and that of a computer science and affiliate law professor. The purpose of this memo is to provide some historical perspective, while at the same time offering a view as to what security and privacy challenges the technical community should consider. These essays do not represent a consensus view, but that of the individual authors.

Introduction On June 6th, 2013, an article appeared in The Guardian [Guard2013] that was the beginning of a series of what have come to be known as the Snowden revelations, describing certain activities of the United States National Security Agency (NSA). These activities included, amongst others: secret court orders; secret agreements for the receipt of so-called \"meta-information\" that includes source, destination, and timing of communications; and tapping of communications lines. The breathtaking scope of the operations shocked the Internet technical community and resulted in a sea change within the IETF, IAB, and other standards organizations. Now that some years have passed, it seems appropriate to reflect on that period of time and to consider what effect the community's actions had, where security has improved, how the threat surface has evolved, what areas haven't improved, and where the community might invest future efforts. Bruce Schneier begins this compendium of individual essays by bringing us back to 2013, recalling how it was for him and others to report what was happening, and the mindset of those involved. Next, Stephen Farrell reviews the technical community's reactions and in particular the reactions of the IETF community, technical advances, and where threats remain. Then Farzaneh Badii discusses the impact of those advances -- or lack thereof -- on human rights. Finally Steven M. Bellovin puts the Snowden revelations into an ever-evolving historical context of secrets and secret stealing that spans centuries, closing with some suggestions for IETF. Readers are invited to consider what impact we as a community have had, what challenges remain, and what positive contribution the technical community can and should make to address security and privacy of citizens of the world. -- Eliot Lear, Independent Submissions Editor for the RFC Series 2. Bruce Schneier: Snowden Ten Years Later In 2013 and 2014, I wrote extensively about new revelations regarding NSA surveillance based on the documents provided by Edward Snowden. But I had a more personal involvement as well. I wrote the essay below in September 2013. The New Yorker agreed to publish it, but The Guardian asked me not to. It was scared of UK law enforcement and worried that this essay would reflect badly on it. And given that the UK police would raid its offices in July 2014, it had legitimate cause to be worried. Now, ten years later, I offer this as a time capsule of what those early months of Snowden were like. It's a surreal experience, paging through hundreds of top-secret NSA documents. You're peering into a forbidden world: strange, confusing, and fascinating all at the same time. I had flown down to Rio de Janeiro in late August at the request of Glenn Greenwald. He had been working on the Edward Snowden archive for a couple of months, and had a pile of more technical documents that he wanted help interpreting. According to Greenwald, Snowden also thought that bringing me down was a good idea. It made sense. I didn't know either of them, but I have been writing about cryptography, security, and privacy for decades. I could decipher some of the technical language that Greenwald had difficulty with, and understand the context and importance of various document. And I have long been publicly critical of the NSA's eavesdropping capabilities. My knowledge and expertise could help figure out which stories needed to be reported. I thought about it a lot before agreeing. This was before David Miranda, Greenwald's partner, was detained at Heathrow airport by the UK authorities; but even without that, I knew there was a risk. I fly a lot -- a quarter of a million miles per year -- and being put on a TSA list, or being detained at the US border and having my electronics confiscated, would be a major problem. So would the FBI breaking into my home and seizing my personal electronics. But in the end, that made me more determined to do it. I did spend some time on the phone with the attorneys recommended to me by the ACLU and the EFF. And I talked about it with my partner, especially when Miranda was detained three days before my departure. Both Greenwald and his employer, The Guardian, are careful about whom they show the documents to. They publish only those portions essential to getting the story out. It was important to them that I be a co-author, not a source. I didn't follow the legal reasoning, but the point is that The Guardian doesn't want to leak the documents to random people. It will, however, write stories in the public interest, and I would be allowed to review the documents as part of that process. So after a Skype conversation with someone at The Guardian, I signed a letter of engagement. And then I flew to Brazil. I saw only a tiny slice of the documents, and most of what I saw was surprisingly banal. The concerns of the top-secret world are largely tactical: system upgrades, operational problems owing to weather, delays because of work backlogs, and so on. I paged through weekly reports, presentation slides from status meetings, and general briefings to educate visitors. Management is management, even inside the NSA. Reading the documents, I felt as though I were sitting through some of those endless meetings. The meeting presenters try to spice things up. Presentations regularly include intelligence success stories. There were details -- what had been found, and how, and where it helped -- and sometimes there were attaboys from \"customers\" who used the intelligence. I'm sure these are intended to remind NSA employees that they're doing good. It definitely had an effect on me. Those were all things I want the NSA to be doing. There were so many code names. Everything has one: every program, every piece of equipment, every piece of software. Sometimes code names had their own code names. The biggest secrets seem to be the underlying real-world information: which particular company MONEYROCKET is; what software vulnerability EGOTISTICALGIRAFFE -- really, I am not making that one up -- is; how TURBINE works. Those secrets collectively have a code name -- ECI, for exceptionally compartmented information -- and almost never appear in the documents. Chatting with Snowden on an encrypted IM connection, I joked that the NSA cafeteria menu probably has code names for menu items. His response: \"Trust me when I say you have no idea.\" Those code names all come with logos, most of them amateurish and a lot of them dumb. Note to the NSA: take some of that more than ten-billion-dollar annual budget and hire yourself a design firm. Really; it'll pay off in morale. Once in a while, though, I would see something that made me stop, stand up, and pace around in circles. It wasn't that what I read was particularly exciting, or important. It was just that it was startling. It changed -- ever so slightly -- how I thought about the world. Greenwald said that that reaction was normal when people started reading through the documents. Intelligence professionals talk about how disorienting it is living on the inside. You read so much classified information about the world's geopolitical events that you start seeing the world differently. You become convinced that only the insiders know what's really going on, because the news media is so often wrong. Your family is ignorant. Your friends are ignorant. The world is ignorant. The only thing keeping you from ignorance is that constant stream of classified knowledge. It's hard not to feel superior, not to say things like \"If you only knew what we know\" all the time. I can understand how General Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, comes across as so supercilious; I only saw a minute fraction of that secret world, and I started feeling it. It turned out to be a terrible week to visit Greenwald, as he was still dealing with the fallout from Miranda's detention. Two other journalists, one from The Nation and the other from The Hindu, were also in town working with him. A lot of my week involved Greenwald rushing into my hotel room, giving me a thumb drive of new stuff to look through, and rushing out again. A technician from The Guardian got a search capability working while I was there, and I spent some time with it. Question: when you're given the capability to search through a database of NSA secrets, what's the first thing you look for? Answer: your name. It wasn't there. Neither were any of the algorithm names I knew, not even algorithms I knew that the US government used. I tried to talk to Greenwald about his own operational security. It had been incredibly stupid for Miranda to be traveling with NSA documents on the thumb drive. Transferring files electronically is what encryption is for. I told Greenwald that he and Laura Poitras should be sending large encrypted files of dummy documents back and forth every day. Once, at Greenwald's home, I walked into the backyard and looked for TEMPEST receivers hiding in the trees. I didn't find any, but that doesn't mean they weren't there. Greenwald has a lot of dogs, but I don't think that would hinder professionals. I'm sure that a bunch of major governments have a complete copy of everything Greenwald has. Maybe the black bag teams bumped into each other in those early weeks. I started doubting my own security procedures. Reading about the NSA's hacking abilities will do that to you. Can it break the encryption on my hard drive? Probably not. Has the company that makes my encryption software deliberately weakened the implementation for it? Probably. Are NSA agents listening in on my calls back to the US? Very probably. Could agents take control of my computer over the Internet if they wanted to? Definitely. In the end, I decided to do my best and stop worrying about it. It was the agency's documents, after all. And what I was working on would become public in a few weeks. I wasn't sleeping well, either. A lot of it was the sheer magnitude of what I saw. It's not that any of it was a real surprise. Those of us in the information security community had long assumed that the NSA was doing things like this. But we never really sat down and figured out the details, and to have the details confirmed made a big difference. Maybe I can make it clearer with an analogy. Everyone knows that death is inevitable; there's absolutely no surprise about that. Yet it arrives as a surprise, because we spend most of our lives refusing to think about it. The NSA documents were a bit like that. Knowing that it is surely true that the NSA is eavesdropping on the world, and doing it in such a methodical and robust manner, is very different from coming face-to-face with the reality that it is and the details of how it is doing it. I also found it incredibly difficult to keep the secrets. The Guardian's process is slow and methodical. I move much faster. I drafted stories based on what I found. Then I wrote essays about those stories, and essays about the essays. Writing was therapy; I would wake up in the wee hours of the morning, and write an essay. But that put me at least three levels beyond what was published. Now that my involvement is out, and my first essays are out, I feel a lot better. I'm sure it will get worse again when I find another monumental revelation; there are still more documents to go through. I've heard it said that Snowden wants to damage America. I can say with certainty that he does not. So far, everyone involved in this incident has been incredibly careful about what is released to the public. There are many documents that could be immensely harmful to the US, and no one has any intention of releasing them. The documents the reporters release are carefully redacted. Greenwald and I repeatedly debated with The Guardian editors the newsworthiness of story ideas, stressing that we would not expose government secrets simply because they're interesting. The NSA got incredibly lucky; this could have ended with a massive public dump like Chelsea Manning's State Department cables. I suppose it still could. Despite that, I can imagine how this feels to the NSA. It's used to keeping this stuff behind multiple levels of security: gates with alarms, armed guards, safe doors, and military-grade cryptography. It's not supposed to be on a bunch of thumb drives in Brazil, Germany, the UK, the US, and who knows where else, protected largely by some random people's opinions about what should or should not remain secret. This is easily the greatest intelligence failure in the history of ever. It's amazing that one person could have had so much access with so little accountability, and could sneak all of this data out without raising any alarms. The odds are close to zero that Snowden is the first person to do this; he's just the first person to make public that he did. It's a testament to General Alexander's power that he hasn't been forced to resign. It's not that we weren't being careful about security, it's that our standards of care are so different. From the NSA's point of view, we're all major security risks, myself included. I was taking notes about classified material, crumpling them up, and throwing them into the wastebasket. I was printing documents marked \"TOP SECRET/COMINT/NOFORN\" in a hotel lobby. And once, I took the wrong thumb drive with me to dinner, accidentally leaving the unencrypted one filled with top-secret documents in my hotel room. It was an honest mistake; they were both blue. If I were an NSA employee, the policy would be to fire me for that alone. Many have written about how being under constant surveillance changes a person. When you know you're being watched, you censor yourself. You become less open, less spontaneous. You look at what you write on your computer and dwell on what you've said on the telephone, wonder how it would sound taken out of context, from the perspective of a hypothetical observer. You're more likely to conform. You suppress your individuality. Even though I have worked in privacy for decades, and already knew a lot about the NSA and what it does, the change was palpable. That feeling hasn't faded. I am now more careful about what I say and write. I am less trusting of communications technology. I am less trusting of the computer industry. After much discussion, Greenwald and I agreed to write three stories together to start. All of those are still in progress. In addition, I wrote two commentaries on the Snowden documents that were recently made public. There's a lot more to come; even Greenwald hasn't looked through everything. Since my trip to Brazil (one month before), I've flown back to the US once and domestically seven times -- all without incident. I'm not on any list yet. At least, none that I know about. As it happened, I didn't write much more with Greenwald or The Guardian. Those two had a falling out, and by the time everything settled and both began writing about the documents independently -- Greenwald at the newly formed website The Intercept -- I got cut out of the process somehow. I remember hearing that Greenwald was annoyed with me, but I never learned the reason. We haven't spoken since. Still, I was happy with the one story I was part of: how the NSA hacks Tor. I consider it a personal success that I pushed The Guardian to publish NSA documents detailing QUANTUM. I don't think that would have gotten out any other way. And I still use those pages today when I teach cybersecurity to policymakers at the Harvard Kennedy School. Other people wrote about the Snowden files, and wrote a lot. It was a slow trickle at first, and then a more consistent flow. Between Greenwald, Bart Gellman, and The Guardian reporters, there ended up being steady stream of news. (Bart brought in Ashkan Soltani to help him with the technical aspects, which was a great move on his part, even if it cost Ashkan a government job later.) More stories were covered by other publications. It started getting weird. Both Greenwald and Gellman held documents back so they could publish them in their books. Jake Appelbaum, who had not yet been accused of sexual assault by multiple women, was working with Poitras. He partnered with Der Spiegel to release an implant catalog from the NSA's Tailored Access Operations group. To this day, I am convinced that the document was not in the Snowden archives: that Jake got it somehow, and it was released with the implication that it was from Edward Snowden. I thought it was important enough that I started writing about each item in that document in my blog: \"NSA Exploit of the Week.\" That got my website blocked by the DoD: I keep a framed print of the censor's message on my wall. Perhaps the most surreal document disclosures were when artists started writing fiction based on the documents. This was in 2016, when Laura Poitras built a secure room in New York to house the documents. By then, the documents were years out of date. And now they're over a decade out of date. (They were leaked in 2013, but most of them were from 2012 or before.) I ended up being something of a public ambassador for the documents. When I got back from Rio, I gave talks at a private conference in Woods Hole, the Berkman Center at Harvard, something called the Congress on Privacy and Surveillance in Geneva, events at both CATO and New America in DC, an event at the University of Pennsylvania, an event at EPIC, a \"Stop Watching Us\" rally in DC, the RISCS conference in London, the ISF in Paris, and...then...at the IETF meeting in Vancouver in November 2013. (I remember little of this; I am reconstructing it all from my calendar.) What struck me at the IETF was the indignation in the room, and the calls to action. And there was action, across many fronts. We technologists did a lot to help secure the Internet, for example. The government didn't do its part, though. Despite the public outcry, investigations by Congress, pronouncements by President Obama, and federal court rulings, I don't think much has changed. The NSA canceled a program here and a program there, and it is now more public about defense. But I don't think it is any less aggressive about either bulk or targeted surveillance. Certainly its government authorities haven't been restricted in any way. And surveillance capitalism is still the business model of the Internet. And Edward Snowden? We were in contact for a while on Signal. I visited him once in Moscow, in 2016. And I had him do a guest lecture to my class at Harvard for a few years, remotely by Jitsi. Afterwards, I would hold a session where I promised to answer every question he would evade or not answer, explain every response he did give, and be candid in a way that someone with an outstanding arrest warrant simply cannot. Sometimes I thought I could channel Snowden better than he could. But now it's been a decade. Everything he knows is old and out of date. Everything we know is old and out of date. The NSA suffered an even worse leak of its secrets by the Russians, under the guise of the Shadow Brokers, in 2016 and 2017. The NSA has rebuilt. It again has capabilities we can only surmise. 3. Stephen Farrell: IETF and Internet Technical Community Reaction In 2013, the IETF and, more broadly, the Internet technical, security, and privacy research communities, were surprised by the surveillance and attack efforts exposed by the Snowden revelations [Timeline]. While the potential for such was known, it was the scale and pervasiveness of the activities disclosed that was alarming and, I think it fair to say, quite annoying, for very many Internet engineers. As for the IETF's reaction, informal meetings during the July 2013 IETF meeting in Berlin indicated that IETF participants considered that these revelations showed that we needed to do more to improve the security and privacy properties of IETF protocols, and to help ensure deployments made better use of the security and privacy mechanisms that already existed. In August, the IETF set up a new mailing list [Perpass], which became a useful venue for triaging proposals for work on these topics. At the November 2013 IETF meeting, there was a lively and very well attended plenary session [Plenary-video] on \"hardening the Internet\" against such attacks, followed by a \"birds of a feather\" session [Perpass-BoF] devoted to more detailed discussion of possible actions in terms of new working groups, protocols, and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents that could help improve matters. This was followed in February/March 2014 by a joint IAB/W3C workshop on \"strengthening the Internet against pervasive monitoring\" [STRINT] held in London and attended by 150 engineers (still the only IAB workshop in my experience where we needed a waiting list for people after capacity for the venue was reached!). The STRINT workshop report was eventually published as [RFC7687] in 2015, but in the meantime, work proceeded on a BCP document codifying that the IETF community considered that \"pervasive monitoring is an attack\" [RFC7258] (aka BCP 188). The IETF Last Call discussion for that short document included more than 1000 emails -- while there was broad agreement on the overall message, a number of IETF participants considered enshrining that message in the RFC Series and IETF processes controversial. In any case, the BCP was published in May 2014. The key statement on which rough consensus was reached is in the abstract of RFC 7258 and says \"Pervasive monitoring is a technical attack that should be mitigated in the design of IETF protocols, where possible.\" That document has since been referenced [Refs-to-7258] by many IETF working groups and RFCs as justifying additional work on security and privacy. Throughout that period and beyond, the repercussions of the Snowden revelations remained a major and ongoing agenda item for both of the IETF's main technical management bodies, the IAB and the IESG (on which I served at the time). So far, I've only described the processes with which the IETF dealt with the attacks, but there was, of course, also much technical work started by IETF participants that was at least partly motivated by the Snowden revelations. In November 2013, a working group was established to document better practices for using TLS in applications [UTA] so that deployments would be less at risk in the face of some of the attacks related to stripping TLS or having applications misuse TLS APIs or parameters. Similar work was done later to update recommendations for use of cryptography in other protocols in the CURDLE Working Group [CURDLE]. The CURDLE Working Group was, to an extent, created to enable use of a set of new elliptic curves that had been documented by the IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group [CFRG]. That work in turn had been partly motivated by (perhaps ultimately unfounded) concerns about elliptic curves defined in NIST standards, following the DUAL_EC_DRBG debacle [Dual-EC] (described further below) where a NIST random number generator had been deliberately engineered to produce output that could be vulnerable to NSA attack. Work to develop a new version of TLS was started in 2014, mainly due to concerns that TLS 1.2 and earlier version implementations had been shown to be vulnerable to a range of attacks over the years. The work to develop TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] also aimed to encrypt more of the handshake so as to expose less information to network observers -- a fairly direct result of the Snowden revelations. Work to further improve TLS in this respect continues today using the so-called Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) mechanism [TLS-ECH] to remove one of the last privacy leaks present in current TLS. Work on ECH was enabled by significant developments to encrypt DNS traffic, using DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], which also started as a result of the Snowden revelations. Prior to that, privacy hadn't really been considered when it came to DNS data or (more importantly) the act of accessing DNS data. The trend towards encrypting DNS traffic represents a significant change for the Internet, both in terms of reducing cleartext, but also in terms of moving points-of-control. The latter aspect was, and remains, controversial, but the IETF did its job of defining new protocols that can enable better DNS privacy. Work on HTTP version 2 [RFC9113] and QUIC [RFC9000] further demonstrates the trend in the IETF towards always encrypting protocols as the new norm, at least at and above the transport layer. Of course, not all such initiatives bore fruit; for example, attempts to define a new MPLS encryption mechanism [MPLS-OPPORTUNISTIC-ENCRYPT] foundered due to a lack of interest and the existence of the already deployed IEEE Media Access Control Security (MACsec) scheme. But there has been a fairly clear trend towards trying to remove cleartext from the Internet as a precursor to provide improved privacy when considering network observers as attackers. The IETF, of course, forms only one part of the broader Internet technical community, and there were many non-IETF activities triggered by the Snowden revelations, a number of which also eventually resulted in new IETF work to standardise better security and privacy mechanisms developed elsewhere. In 2013, the web was largely unencrypted despite HTTPS being relatively usable, and that was partly due to problems using the Web PKI at scale. The Let's Encrypt initiative [LE] issued its first certificates in 2015 as part of its aim to try to move the web towards being fully encrypted, and it has been extremely successful in helping achieve that goal. Subsequently, the automation protocols developed for Let's Encrypt were standardised in the IETF's ACME Working Group [ACME]. In 2013, most email transport between mail servers was cleartext, directly enabling some of the attacks documented in the Snowden documents. Significant effort by major mail services and MTA software developers since then have resulted in more than 90% of email being encrypted between mail servers, and various IETF protocols have been defined in order to improve that situation, e.g., SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) [RFC8461]. Lastly, MAC addresses have historically been long-term fixed values visible to local networks (and beyond), which enabled some tracking attacks that were documented in the Snowden documents [Toronto]. Implementers, vendors, and the IEEE 802 standards group recognised this weakness and started work on MAC address randomisation that in turn led to the IETF's MADINAS Working Group [MADINAS], which aims to ensure randomised MAC addresses can be used on the Internet without causing unintentional harm. There is also a history of IETF work on deprecating MAC-address-based IPv6 interface identifiers and advocating pseudorandom identifiers and temporary addresses, some of which pre-dates Snowden [RFC7217] [RFC8064] [RFC8981]. In summary, the significantly large volume of technical work pursued in the IETF and elsewhere as a result of the Snowden revelations has focussed on two main things: decreasing the amount of plaintext that remains visible to network observers and secondly reducing the number of long-term identifiers that enable unexpected identification or re-identification of devices or users. This work is not by any means complete, nor is deployment universal, but significant progress has been made, and the work continues even if the level of annoyance at the attack has faded somewhat over time. One should also note that there has been pushback against these improvements in security and privacy and the changes they cause for deployments. That has come from more or less two camps: those on whom these improvements force change tend to react badly, but later figure out how to adjust, and those who seemingly prefer not to strengthen security so as to, for example, continue to achieve what they call \"visibility\" even in the face of the many engineers who correctly argue that such an anti-encryption approach inevitably leads to worse security overall. The recurring nature of this kind of pushback is nicely illustrated by [RFC1984]. That informational document was published in 1996 as an IETF response to an early iteration of the perennial \"encryption is bad\" argument. In 2015, the unmodified 1996 text was upgraded to a BCP (BCP 200) as the underlying arguments have not changed, and will not change. Looking back on all the above from a 2023 vantage point, I think that, as a community of Internet engineers, we got a lot right, but that today there's way more that needs to be done to better protect the security and privacy of people who use the Internet. In particular, we (the technical community) haven't done nearly as good a job at countering surveillance capitalism [Zubhoff2019], which has exploded in the last decade. In part, that's because many of the problems are outside of the scope of bodies such as the IETF. For example, intrusive backend sharing of people's data for advertising purposes can't really be mitigated via Internet protocols. However, I also think that the real annoyance felt with respect to the Snowden revelations is (in general) not felt nearly as much when it comes to the legal but hugely privacy-invasive activities of major employers of Internet engineers. It's noteworthy that RFC 7258 doesn't consider that bad actors are limited to governments, and personally, I think many advertising industry schemes for collecting data are egregious examples of pervasive monitoring and hence ought also be considered an attack on the Internet that ought be mitigated where possible. However, the Internet technical community clearly hasn't acted in that way over the last decade. Perhaps that indicates that Internet engineers and the bodies in which they congregate need to place much more emphasis on standards for ethical behaviour than has been the case for the first half-century of the Internet. And while it would be good to see the current leaders of Internet bodies work to make progress in that regard, at the time of writing, it sadly seems more likely that government regulators will be the ones to try force better behaviour. That of course comes with a significant risk of having regulations that stymie the kind of permissionless innovation that characterised many earlier Internet successes. So while we got a lot right in our reaction to Snowden's revelations, currently, we have a \"worse\" Internet. Nonetheless, I do still hope to see a sea change there, as the importance of real Internet security and privacy for people becomes utterly obvious to all, even the most hard-core capitalists and government signals intelligence agencies. That may seem naive, but I remain optimistic that, as a fact-based community, we (and eventually our employers) will recognise that the lesser risk is to honestly aim to provide the best security and privacy practically possible. 4. Farzaneh Badii: Did Snowden's Revelations Help with Protecting Human Rights on the Internet? It is very difficult to empirically measure the effect of Snowden's revelations on human rights and the Internet. Anecdotally, we have been witnessing dominant regulatory and policy approaches that impact technologies and services that are at the core of protecting human rights on the Internet. (A range of European Union laws aims to address online safety or concentration of data. There are many more regulations that have an impact on the Internet [Masnick2023].) There has been little progress in fixing technical and policy issues that help enable human rights. The Snowden revelations did not revolutionize the Internet governance and technical approaches to support human rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly, and privacy. It did not decrease the number of Internet shutdowns nor the eagerness of authoritarian (and even to some extent democratic) countries to territorialize the Internet. In some cases, the governments argued that they should have more data sovereignty or Internet sovereignty. Perhaps the revelations helped with the evolution of some technical and policy aspects. After Snowden's revelations 10 years ago, engineers and advocates at the IETF responded in a few ways. One prominent response was the issuance of a BCP document, \"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack\" [RFC7258] by Farrell and Tschofenig. The responses to the Snowden revelations did not mean that IETF had lost sight of issues such as privacy and surveillance. There were instances of resistance to surveillance in the past by engineers (we do not delve into how successful that was in protecting human rights). However, historically, many engineers believed that widespread and habitual surveillance was too expensive to be practical. The revelations proved them wrong. Rights-centered activists were also involved with the IETF before the revelations. For example, staff from Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) was undertaking work at the IETF (and was a member of the Internet Architecture Board) and held workshops about the challenges of creating privacy-protective protocols and systems. The technical shortcomings that were exploited by the National Security Agency to carry out mass-scale surveillance were recognized by the IETF before the Snowden revelations [Garfinkel1995] [RFC6462]. In 2012, Joy Liddicoat and Avri Doria wrote a report for the Internet Society that extensively discussed the processes and principles of human rights and Internet protocols [Doria2012]. Perhaps the Snowden revelations brought more attention to the IETF and its work as it related to important issues, such as privacy and freedom of expression. It might have also expedited and helped with more easily convening the Human Rights Protocol Considerations Research Group (HRPC) in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) in July 2015. The HRPC RG was originally co-chaired by Niels ten Oever (who worked at Article 19 at the time) and Internet governance activist Avri Doria. The charter of the HRPC RG states that the group was established: \"to research whether standards and protocols can enable, strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\" During the past decade, a few successful strides were made to create protocols that, when and if implemented, aim at protecting privacy of the users, as well as help with reducing pervasive surveillance. These efforts were in keeping with the consensus of the IETF found in RFC 7258. Sometimes these protocols have anti-censorship qualities as well. A few examples immediately come to mind: 1) the encryption of DNS queries (for example, DNS over HTTPS), 2) ACME protocol underpinning the Let's Encrypt initiative, and 3) Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [RFC7480] [RFC7481] [RFC8056] [RFC9082] [RFC9083] [RFC9224]. (It is debatable that RDAP had anything to do with the Snowden revelations, but it is still a good example and is finally being implemented.) The DNS Queries over HTTPS protocol aimed to encrypt DNS queries. Four years after RFC 7258, DoH was developed to tackle both active and passive monitoring of DNS queries. It is also a tool that can help with combatting censorship. Before the revelations, DNS query privacy would have been controversial due to being expensive or unnecessary, but the Snowden revelations made it more plausible. Let's Encrypt was not an Internet protocol, but it was an initiative that aimed to encrypt the web, and later on some of the automation protocols were standardized in the IETF ACME Working Group. RDAP could solve a long-term problem: redacting the domain name registrants' (and IP address holders') sensitive, personal data but at the same time enabling legitimate access to the information. As to the work of HRPC Research Group, it has so far issued [RFC8280] by ten Oever and Cath and a number of informational Internet-Drafts. While we cannot really argue that all the movements and privacy-preserving protocols and initiatives that enable protecting human rights at the infrastructure layer solely or directly result from the Snowden revelations, I think it is safe to say that the revelations helped with expediting the resolution of some of the \"technical\" hesitations that had an effect on fixing Internet protocols that enabled protection of human rights. Unfortunately, the Snowden revelations have not yet helped us meaningfully with adopting a human rights approach. We can't agree on prioritizing human rights in our Internet communities for a host of reasons. This could be due to: 1) human rights are sometimes in conflict with each other; 2) it is simply not possible to mitigate the human right violation through the Internet protocol; 3) it is not obvious for the engineers in advance how the Internet protocol contributes to enabling human rights protections, or precisely what they ought to do; 4) the protocol is already there, but market, law, and a host of other societal and political issues do not allow for widespread implementation. IETF did not purposefully take a long time to adopt and implement protocols that enabled human rights. There were technical and political issues that created barriers. For example, as WHOIS was not capable of accommodating a tiered-access option, the IETF community attempted a few times before to create a protocol that would disclose the necessary information of IP holders and domain name registrants while at the same time protecting their data (Cross Registry Internet Service Protocol (CRISP) and later on Internet Registry Information Service (IRIS) are the examples). However, IRIS was technically very difficult to implement. It was not until RDAP was developed and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted that Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers had to consider instructing registries and registrars to implement RDAP and its community had to come up with a privacy-compliant policy. Overall, a host of regulatory and market incentives can halt or slow down the implementation of human-rights-enabling protocols and implementation could depend on other organizations with their own political and stakeholder conflicts. Sometimes the protocol is available, but the regulatory framework and the market do not allow for implementation. Sometimes the surrounding context includes practical dimensions that are easy to overlook in a purely engineering-focused argument. A curious example of this is sanctions regimes that target transactions involving economically valuable assets. As a result, sanctions might limit sanctioned nations' and entities' access to IPv4 resources (because the existence of a resale market for these addresses causes acquiring them to be interpreted as buying something of value), though the same consideration may not apply to IPv6 address resources. But IPv6 adoption itself depends on a host of complex factors that are by no means limited to technical comparisons of the properties of IPv4 and IPv6. Someone focused only on technical features of protocols may devise an elegant solution but be surprised both by deployment challenges and unintended downstream effects. Sometimes there are arguments over implementation of a protocol because as it is perceived, while it can protect freedom of expression and reduce surveillance, it can hamper other human rights. For instance, the technical community and some network operators still have doubts about the implementation of DNS over HTTPS, despite its potential to circumvent censorship and its ability to encrypt DNS queries. The arguments against implementation of DoH include protection of children online and lack of law enforcement access to data. We must acknowledge that sometimes the technical solutions that we use that protect one right (for example, encryption to protect the right to privacy or to prevent surveillance) could potentially affect technical and policy solutions that try to protect other human rights (for example, encryption could prevent financial institutions from monitoring employees' network activities to detect fraudulent behavior). Acknowledging and identifying these conflicts can help us come up with alternative techniques that could protect human rights while not hampering other technical solutions such as encryption. Where such alternative techniques are not possible, acknowledging the shortcoming could clarify and bring to light the trade-offs that we have accepted in our Internet system. Ironically, we advocate for connectivity and believe expressing oneself on the Internet is a human right, but when a war erupts, we resort to tools that impact that very concept. For example, some believe that, by imposing sanctions on critical properties of the Internet, we can punish the perpetrators of a war. The Regional Internet Registries that are in charge of registration of IP addresses have shown resilience to these requests. However, some tech companies (for example, Cogent [Roth2022]) decided not to serve sanctioned countries and overcomplied with sanctions. Overcompliance with sanctions could hamper ordinary people's access to the Internet [Badii2023]. Perhaps we can solve some of these problems by undertaking a thorough impact assessment and contextualization to reveal how and why Internet protocols affect human rights (something Fidler and I argued for [Badii2021]). Contextualization and impact assessment can reveal how each Internet protocol or each line of code, in which systems, have an impact on which and whose human rights. The HRPC RG (which I am a part of) and the larger human rights and policy analyst communities are still struggling to analyze legal, social, and market factors alongside the protocols to have a good understanding of what has an impact and what has to be changed. It is hard, but it is not impossible. If we thoroughly document and research the lifecycle of an Internet protocol and contextualize it, we might have a better understanding of which parts of the protocol to fix and how to fix them in order to protect human rights. Overall, the revelations did, to some extent, contribute to the evolution of our ideas and perspectives. Our next step should be to undertake research on the impact of Internet systems (including Internet protocols) on human rights, promote the implementation of protocols good for human rights through policy and advocacy, and focus on which technical parts we can standardize to help with more widespread implementation of human-rights-enabling Internet protocols. 5. Steven M. Bellovin: Governments and Cryptography: The Crypto Wars 5.1. Historical Background It's not a secret: many governments in the world don't like it when people encrypt their traffic. More precisely, they like strong cryptography for themselves but not for others, whether those others are private citizens or other countries. But the history is longer and more complex than that. For much of written history, both governments and individuals used cryptography to protect their messages. To cite just one famous example, Julius Caesar is said to have encrypted messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by 3 [Kahn1996]. In modern parlance, 3 was the key, and each letter was encrypted with C[i] = (P[i] + 3) mod 23 (The Latin alphabet of his time had only 23 letters.) Known Arabic writings on cryptanalysis go back to at least the 8th century; their sophistication shows that encryption was reasonably commonly used. In the 9th century, Abū Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindī developed and wrote about frequency analysis as a way to crack ciphers [Borda2011] [Kahn1996]. In an era of minimal literacy, though, there wasn't that much use of encryption, simply because most people could neither read nor write. Governments used encryption for diplomatic messages, and cryptanalysts followed close behind. The famed Black Chambers of the Renaissance era read messages from many different governments, while early cryptographers devised stronger and stronger ciphers [Kahn1996]. In Elizabethan times in England, Sir Francis Walsingham's intelligence agency intercepted and decrypted messages from Mary, Queen of Scots; these messages formed some of the strongest evidence against her and eventually led to her execution [Kahn1996]. This pattern continued for centuries. In the United States, Thomas Jefferson invented the so-called wheel cipher in the late 18th century; it was reinvented about 100 years later by Étienne Bazeries and used as a standard American military cipher well into World War II [Kahn1996]. Jefferson and other statesmen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries regularly used cryptography when communicating with each other. An encrypted message was even part of the evidence introduced in Aaron Burr's 1807 trial for treason [Kerr2020] [Kahn1996]. Edgar Allan Poe claimed that he could cryptanalyze any message sent to him [Kahn1996]. The telegraph era upped the ante. In the US, just a year after Samuel Morse deployed his first telegraph line between Baltimore and Washington, his business partner, Francis Smith, published a codebook to help customers protect their traffic from prying eyes [Smith1845]. In 1870, Britain nationalized its domestic telegraph network; in response, Robert Slater published a more sophisticated codebook [Slater1870]. On the government side, Britain took advantage of its position as the central node in the world's international telegraphic networks to read a great deal of traffic passing through the country [Headrick1991] [Kennedy1971]. They used this ability strategically, too -- when war broke out in 1914, the British Navy cut Germany's undersea telegraph cables, forcing them to use radio; an intercept of the so-called Zimmermann telegram, when cryptanalyzed, arguably led to American entry into the war and thence to Germany's defeat. Once the US entered the war, it required users of international telegraph lines to deposit copies of the codebooks they used for compression, so that censors could check messages for prohibited content [Kahn1996]. In Victorian Britain, private citizens, often lovers, used encryption in newspapers' personal columns to communicate without their parents' knowledge. Charles Wheatstone and Charles Babbage used to solve these elementary ciphers routinely for their own amusement [Kahn1996]. This pattern continued for many years. Governments regularly used ciphers and codes, while other countries tried to break them; private individuals would sometimes use encryption but not often, and rarely well. But the two World Wars marked a sea change, one that would soon reverberate into the civilian world. The first World War featured vast troop movements by all parties; this in turn required a lot of encrypted communications, often by telegraph or radio. These messages were often easily intercepted in bulk. Furthermore, the difficulty of encrypting large volumes of plaintext led to the development of a variety of mechanical encryption devices, including Germany's famed Enigma machine. World War II amplified both trends. It also gave rise to machine-assisted cryptanalysis, such as the United Kingdom's bombes (derived from an earlier Polish design) and Colossus machine, and the American's device for cracking Japan's PURPLE system. The US also used punch card-based tabulators to assist in breaking other Japanese codes, such as the Japanese Imperial Navy's JN-25 [Kahn1996] [Rowlett1998]. These developments set the stage for the postwar SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) environment. Many intragovernmental messages were sent by radio, making them easy to intercept; advanced cryptanalytic machines made cryptanalysis easier. Ciphers were getting stronger, though, and government SIGINT agencies did not want to give up their access to data. While there were undoubtedly many developments, two are well known. The first involved CryptoAG, a Swedish (and later Swiss) manufacturer of encryption devices. The head of that company, Boris Hagelin, was a friend of William F. Friedman, a pioneering American cryptologist. During the 1950s, CryptoAG sold its devices to other governments; apparently at Friedman's behest, Hagelin weakened the encryption in a way that let the NSA read the traffic [Miller2020]. The story involving the British is less well-documented and less clear. When some of Britain's former colonies gained their independence, the British government gave them captured, war-surplus Enigma machines to protect their own traffic. Some authors contend that this was deceptive, in that these former colonies did not realize that the British could read Enigma-protected traffic; others claim that this was obvious but that these countries didn't care: Britain was no longer their enemy; it was neighboring countries they were worried about. Again, though, this concerned governmental use of encryption [Kahn1996] [Baldwin2022]. There was still little private use. 5.2. The Crypto Wars Begin The modern era of conflict between an individual's desire for privacy and the government desires to read traffic began around 1972. The grain harvest in the USSR had failed; since relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were temporarily comparatively warm, the Soviet grain company -- an arm of the Soviet government, of course -- entered into negotiations with private American companies. Unknown to Americans at the time, Soviet intelligence was intercepting the phone calls of the American negotiating teams. In other words, private companies had to deal with state actors as a threat. Eventually, US intelligence learned of this and came to a realization: the private sector needed strong cryptography, too, to protect American national interests [Broad1982] [Johnson1998]. This underscored the need for strong cryptography to protect American civilian traffic -- but the SIGINT people were unhappy at the thought of more encryption that they couldn't break. Meanwhile, the US was concerned about protecting unclassified data [Landau2014]. In 1973 and again in 1974, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) put out a call for a strong, modern encryption algorithm. IBM submitted Lucifer, an internally developed algorithm based on what has become known as a 16-round Feistel network. The original version used a long key. It seemed quite strong, so NBS sent it off to the NSA to get their take. The eventual design, which was adopted in 1976 as the Data Encryption Standard (DES), differed in some important ways from Lucifer. First, the so-called S-boxes, the source of the cryptologic strength of DES, were changed, and were now demonstrably not composed of random integers. Many researchers alleged that the S-boxes contained an NSA back door. It took nearly 20 years for the truth to come out: the S-boxes were in fact strengthened, not weakened. Most likely, IBM independently discovered the attack now known as differential cryptanalysis, though some scholars suspect that the NSA told them about it. The nonrandom S-boxes protected against this attack. The second change, though, was clearly insisted on by the NSA: the key size was shortened, from Lucifer's 112 bits to DES's 56 bits. We now know that the NSA wanted a 48-bit key size, while IBM wanted 64 bits; they compromised at 56 bits. Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, at Stanford University, wondered about the 56-bit keys. In 1979, they published a paper demonstrating that the US government, but few others, could afford to build a brute-force cracking machine, one that could try all 256 possible keys to crack a message. NSA denied tampering with the design; a Senate investigating committee found that assertion to be correct, but did not discuss the shortened key length issue. This, however, was not Diffie and Hellman's greatest contribution to cryptology. A few years earlier, they had published a paper inventing what is now known as public key cryptography. (In fact, public key encryption had been invented a few years earlier at UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), but they kept their discovery classified until 1997.) In 1978, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman devised the RSA algorithm, which made it usable. (An NSA employee, acting on his own, sent a letter warning that academic conferences on cryptology might violate US export laws.) Around the same time, George Davida at the University of Wisconsin applied for a patent on a stream cipher; the NSA slapped a secrecy order on the application. This barred him from even talking about his invention. The publicity was devastating; the NSA had to back down. The Crypto Wars had thus begun: civilians were inventing strong encryption systems, and the NSA was tampering with them or trying to suppress them. Bobby Inman, the then-director of the NSA, tried creating a voluntary review process for academic papers, but very few researchers were interested in participating [Landau1988]. There were few major public battles during the 1980s because there were few new major use cases for civilian cryptography during that time. There was one notable incident, though: Shamir, Amos Fiat, and Uriel Feige invented zero-knowledge proofs and applied for a US patent. In response, the US Army slapped a secrecy order on the patent. After a great deal of public outrage and intervention by, of all organizations, the NSA, the order was lifted on very narrow grounds: the inventors were not American, and they had been discussing their work all over the world [Landau1988]. In the 1990s, though, everything changed. 5.3. The Battle Is Joined There were three major developments in cryptography in the early 1990s. First, Phil Zimmermann released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a package to encrypt email messages. In 1993, AT&T planned to release the TSD-3600, an easy-to-use phone encryptor aimed at business travelers. Shortly after that, the Netscape Communications Corporation released SSL (Secure Socket Layer) as a way to enable web-based commerce using their browser and web server. All of these were seen as threats by the NSA and the FBI. PGP was, at least arguably, covered by what was known as ITAR, the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations -- under American law, encryption software was regarded as a weapon, so exports required a license. It was also alleged to infringe the patents on the RSA algorithm. Needless to say, both issues were problematic for what was intended to be open source software. Eventually, the criminal investigation into Zimmermann's role in the spread of PGP overseas was dropped, but the threat of such investigations remained to deter others [Levy2001]. The TSD-3600 was another matter. AT&T was a major corporation that did not want to pick a fight with the US government, but international business travelers were seen as a major market for the device. At the government's \"request\", the DES chip was replaced with what was known as the Clipper chip. The Clipper chip used Skipjack, a cipher with 80-bit keys; it was thus much stronger against brute-force attacks than DES. However, it provided \"key escrow\". Without going into any details, the key escrow mechanism allowed US government eavesdroppers to consult a pair of (presumably secure) internal databases and decrypt all communications protected by the chip. The Clipper chip proved to be extremely unpopular with industry; that AT&T Bell Labs' Matt Blaze found a weakness in the design [Blaze1994], one that let you use Skipjack without the key escrow feature, didn't help its reputation. The third major development, SSL, was even trickier. SSL was aimed at e-commerce, and of course Netscape wanted to be able to sell its products outside the US. That would require an export license, so they made a deal with the government: non-American users would receive a version that used 40-bit keys, a key length far shorter than what the NSA had agreed to 20 years earlier. (To get ahead of the story: there was a compromise mode of operation, wherein an export-grade browser could use strong encryption when talking to a financial institution. This hybrid mode led to cryptographic weaknesses discovered some 20 years later [Adrian2015].) Technologists and American industry pushed back. The IETF adopted the Danvers Doctrine, described in [RFC3365]: At the 32cd [sic] IETF held in Danvers, Massachusetts during April of 1995 the IESG asked the plenary for a consensus on the strength of security that should be provided by IETF standards. Although the immediate issue before the IETF was whether or not to support \"export\" grade security (which is to say weak security) in standards the question raised the generic issue of security in general. The overwhelming consensus was that the IETF should standardize on the use of the best security available, regardless of national policies. This consensus is often referred to as the \"Danvers Doctrine\". Then American companies started losing business to their overseas competitors, who did not have to comply with US export laws. All of this led to what seemed like a happy conclusion: the US government drastically loosened its export rules for cryptographic software. All was well -- or so it seemed... 5.4. The Hidden Battle Strong cryptography was here to stay, and it was no longer an American monopoly, if indeed it ever was. The Information Assurance Directorate of the NSA, the part of the agency that is supposed to protect US data, was pleased by the spread of strong cryptography. When the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition was held, there were no allegations of malign NSA interference; in fact, the winning entry was devised by two Europeans, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. But the NSA and its SIGINT needs did not go away -- the agency merely adopted other techniques. I have often noted that one doesn't go through strong security, one goes around it. When strong encryption became more common and much more necessary, the NSA started going around it, by targeting computers and the software that they run. And it seems clear that they believe that AES is quite strong; they've even endorsed its use for protecting TOP SECRET information. But there was an asterisk attached to that endorsement: AES is suitable if and only if properly used and implemented. Therein lies the rub. The first apparent attempt to tamper with outside cryptographic mechanisms was discovered in 2007, when two Microsoft researchers, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson, noted an odd property of a NIST-standardized random number generator, DUAL_EC_DRBG. (The NBS had been renamed to NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.) Random numbers are vital for cryptography, but Shumow and Ferguson showed that if certain constants in DUAL_EC_DRBG were chosen in a particular way with a known-but-hidden other number, whoever knew that number could predict all future random numbers from a system given a few sample bytes to start from [Kostyuk2022]. These sample bytes could come from known keys, nonces, or anything else. Where did the constants in DUAL_EC_DRBG come from and how were they chosen or generated? No one who knows is talking. But although cryptographers and security specialists were very suspicious -- Bruce Schneier wrote in 2007, before more facts came out, that \"both NIST and the NSA have some explaining to do\"; I assigned my students reading on the topic -- the issue didn't really get any traction until six years later, when among the papers that Edward Snowden disclosed was the information that the NSA had indeed tampered with a major cryptographic standard, though published reports did not specifically name DUAL_EC_DRBG or explain what the purpose was. The revelations didn't stop there. There have been allegations that the NSA paid some companies to use DUAL_EC_DRBG in their products. Some people have claimed that there were attempts to modify some IETF standards to make enough random bytes visible, to aid in exploiting the random number generator. A major vendor of networking gear, Juniper, did use DUAL_EC_DRBG in some of its products, but with different constants [Checkoway2016]. Where did these come from? Were they from the NSA or some other government? Could their source tree have been hacked by an intelligence agency? There was a different hack of their code at around the same time [Moore2015]. No one is talking. The Snowden revelations also included data suggesting that the NSA had a worldwide eavesdropping network and a group that tried very specific, targeted hacks on very specific targets' systems. In retrospect, neither is surprising: \"spies gonna spy\". The NSA's business is signals intelligence; of course they're going to try to intercept traffic. Indeed, the DUAL_EC_DRBG tampering is useless to anyone who has not collected messages to decrypt. And targeted hacks are a natural way around strong encryption: collect the data before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted, and don't worry about the strength of the algorithms. The privacy community, worldwide, was appalled, though perhaps they shouldn't have been. It calls to mind the line that Claude Rains' character uttered in the movie Casablanca [Curtiz]: \"I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.\" The immediate and continuing reaction was to deploy more encryption. The standards have long existed; what was missing was adoption. One barrier was the difficulty and expense of getting certificates to use with TLS, the successor to SSL; that void was filled by Let's Encrypt [LE], which made free certificates easy to get online. Today, most HTTP traffic is encrypted, so much so that Google's search engine down-ranks sites that do not use it. Major email providers uniformly use TLS to protect all traffic. Wi-Fi, though a local area issue, now uses much stronger encryption. (It's important to remember that security and insecurity have economic components. Security doesn't have to be perfect to be very useful, if it raises the attackers' costs by enough.) The news on the software side is less good. Not a day goes by when one does not read of organizations being hit by ransomware. It goes without saying that any threat actor capable of encrypting disks is also capable of stealing the information on them; indeed, that is a frequent accompanying activity, since the threat of disclosure is another incentive to pay for those sites that do have good enough backups. Major vendors have put a lot of effort into securing their software, but bugs and operational errors by end-user sites persist. 5.5. Whither the IETF? Signal intelligence agencies, not just the NSA, but its peers around the globe -- most major countries have their own -- are not going to go away. The challenges that have beset the NSA are common to all such agencies, and their solutions are likely the same. The question is what should be done to protect individual privacy. A number of strong democracies, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, are, in a resumption of the Crypto Wars, moving to restrict encryption. Spurred on by complaints from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, the US Congress frequently considers bills to do the same. The IETF has long had a commitment to strong, ubiquitous encryption. This is a good thing. It needs to continue, with cryptography and other security features designed into protocols from the beginning. But there is also a need for maintenance. Parameters such as key lengths and modulus sizes age; a value that is acceptable today may not be 10 years hence. (We've already seen apparent problems from 1024-bit moduli specified in an RFC, an RFC that was not modified when technology improved enough that attacking encryption based on them had become feasible [Adrian2015].) The IETF can do nothing about the code that vendors ship or that sites use, but it can alert the world that it thinks things have changed. Cryptoagility is of increasing importance. In the next very few years, we will have so-called post-quantum algorithms. Both protocols and key lengths will need to change, perhaps drastically. Is the IETF ready? What will happen to, say, DNSSEC if key lengths become drastically longer? Backwards compatibility will remain important, but that, of course, opens the door to other attacks. We've long thought about them; we need to be sure that our mechanisms work -- we've been surprised in the past [BellovinRescorla2006]. We also need to worry more about metadata. General Michael Hayden, former director of both the NSA and the CIA, once remarked, \"We kill people based on metadata\" [Ferran2014]. But caution is necessary; attempts to hide metadata can have side effects. To give a trivial example, Tor is quite strong, but if your exit node is in a different country than you are in, web sites that use IP geolocation may present their content in a language foreign to you. Some sites even block connections from known Tor exit nodes. More generally, many attempts to hide metadata involve trusting a different party; that party may turn out to be untrustworthy or it may itself become a target of attack. As another prominent IETFer has remarked, \"Insecurity is like entropy; you can't destroy it, but you can move it around.\" The IETF has done a lot; it needs to do more. And remember that the risk here is not just governments acting directly, it's also private companies that collect the data and sell it to all comers. Finally, the IETF must remember that its middle name is \"Engineering\". To me, one of the attributes of engineering is the art of picking the right solution in an over-constrained environment. Intelligence agencies won't go away, nor will national restrictions on cryptography. We have to pick the right path while staying true to our principles. 6. Security Considerations Each or any of the authors may have forgotten or omitted things or gotten things wrong. We're sorry if that's the case, but that's in the nature of a look-back such as this. Such flaws almost certainly won't worsen security or privacy, though. 7. IANA Considerations This document has no IANA actions. 8.

    "commentBody": "RFC 9446 Reflections on Ten Years Past the Snowden RevelationsHacker NewspastloginRFC 9446 Reflections on Ten Years Past the Snowden Revelations (rfc-editor.org) 245 points by PaulHoule 15 hours ago| hidepastfavorite169 comments dijit 15 hours agoI havent read the full transcript, but I find it terrifyingly fascinating how the US has managed to turn Snowden into a pariah, owing in part to its own revoking of his passport while in transit through Russia.Anybody who saw him speak knows he was doing everything possible to make it about the content, and not him as a person- only putting his name to the light to prove it wasn&#x27;t false or the result of some disgruntled employee trying to stick it to his manager.Yet the narrative very quickly focused on him; the content of his character, his upbringing, his connection to the government, the fact that he is in Russia and decidedly not on the content of the leaks which quickly got glossed over and to date I am unaware of single arrest due to it- despite clear evidence of lawbreaking (including but not limited to: deliberately lying to the Senate).Lets not forget that diplomatic plane that was downed across international territories because they suspected Snowden was inside.Despite posing no continued threat to the US, they sure spent a lot of effort making him as uncredible as possible yet anyone who has eyes sees it as completely transparent.The scariest part of it all is that people actually are falling for that narrative, do not look at the leaks for what they are (proof of unconstitutional behaviour by a branch of government) and call Snowden a plant or a terrorist- ironically the kinds of people who would otherwise argue against government interference. Boggles my mind, and scares me to death how clearly susceptible the population is to disinformation. reply Terr_ 14 hours agoparentNot to wander too far off topic, but it also frustrates me when I encounter people who somehow rate Edward Snowden behind (in favorability) figures like Julian Assange.Edit: To clarify my own frustration, I see Snowden as more of a true whistleblower, and Assange as more of a fame-seeking middleman willing to promise or withhold information based on his own self-interest. reply dijit 14 hours agorootparentthe Assange thing also reeks of US&#x2F;UK joint government interference.Its totally possible that he’s a massive rapist, and its a great cover to be a known enemy to governments with your journalistic endeavours.But its terribly convenient for the US government that the circumstances landed where they did, and it was even told to us that it would land this way and those saying it were branded as conspiracy theorists.One might consider that Snowden went in knowing exactly what was possible, came prepared was completely “clean”, additionally he has not had a particularly difficult living situation. Yet even he is able to get massacred by certain sections of the media. Assange is living in (self-imposed, sure) exile and doesnt have the luxury of maintaining a lifestyle that promotes mental well-being, and the media are very quick to jump on his transgressions and blow them to insane proportions. Please keep that in mind when talking about him. reply toyg 12 hours agorootparent> Assange is living in (self-imposed, sure) exile This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone defining \"being in prison\" as \"self-imposed exile\".Assange has been in an English prison for 4 years now. The only thing for which he was actually convicted (skipping bail during extradition proceedings) accounts for only 1 of those. reply cdchn 11 hours agorootparentPeople who are awaiting trail or extradition are typically held during that process if they&#x27;re considered a flight risk, which I think that&#x27;s been shown to be a real risk since he was convicted for that. reply roenxi 9 hours agorootparent> People who are awaiting trail or extradition...My information is a few years out of date but I&#x27;ve been assured that at least he is only being extradited to Sweden for wild sex crimes and not the United States! Now let me check the Wikipedia arti... oh, turns out he is being extradited to the United States. A lot of people didn&#x27;t see that coming (never really understood why not, but that is people for you).The situation is in this awkward position where there was an obvious conspiracy to get Assange and making predictions on the assumption of a conspiracy has had great predictive power. The only change is it is isn&#x27;t a conspiracy any more because everything is playing out publicly in British courts.So while Assange is certainly being subjected to a lot of usual processes, the usual processes are being turned on him because he embarrassed the US government by bringing its activities to light. I have no doubt that is illegal. If I was a government, I too would want to criminalise people trying to hold me accountable. The issue is that punishing people for encouraging transparency is an inescapably political act.And Assange is on the right side of history on this one. It is easy to see him as a footnote in every textbook one day as \"and this was the moment when people started to find out what was going on\". reply stephen_g 7 hours agorootparentIn fact, people said at the time that it was ridiculous to believe that the Sweden case (where charges were never laid, and the whole case was dropped due to lack of evidence, picked up by another prosecutor, run with for several years with all sorts of procedural irregularities, and then dropped again for lack of evidence before the statute of limitations expired) might just be a ruse to make it easier to extradite him to the States.Because people very strongly said this was only about accusations of sex crimes and the US would never lay charges for publishing - because that would mean what the New York Times does is illegal, we were told. reply wddkcs 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s insane to see the level of malice directed at Passage and say anything being done to him is justified. I can only see the mottled opinion of him here as the effect of successful smearing. reply bawolff 1 hour agorootparentprev> Its totally possible that he’s a massive rapist, and its a great cover to be a known enemy to governments with your journalistic endeavours.> But its terribly convenient for the US government that the circumstances landed where they did, and it was even told to us that it would land this way and those saying it were branded as conspiracy theorists.I wonder if its both. He could be a massive rapist who would have gone unnoticed without us gov involvement. I imagine if you want to discredit someone it is much easier to find their real sins than to make something up wholesale.Of course if that&#x27;s true it still doesn&#x27;t really matter how it was dragged to the light, he would still be a dirt bag. reply mcculley 13 hours agorootparentprev> Its totally possible that he’s a massive rapistI do not remember him being alleged to be a massive rapist. Certainly, one charge of any kind of rape should be enough to have him brought to the jurisdiction where the charge is made. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 12 hours agorootparentThe person who approached Swedish police never claimed rape. She was worried that he may have had HIV and didn&#x27;t use a condom and wanted to know if she had any legal recourse to force him to undergo an HIV test. Her testimony was changed after the fact by Swedish police without her knowledge or consent. reply atlantic 11 hours agorootparentprevHe&#x27;s not even accused of rape. Once he was safely in jail awaiting extradition, Swedish prosecutors dropped all charges. reply willcipriano 12 hours agorootparentprev> Certainly, one charge of any kind of rape should be enough to have him brought to the jurisdiction where the charge is made.It wasn&#x27;t for any of Epsteins clients. reply zirgs 14 hours agorootparentprevAssange is incoherent. Why would Sweden frame him for a rape that he didn&#x27;t commit? Why would the USA need to get him extradited through Sweden if the UK can extradite him to the USA directly without any sort of fake criminal charges?Also why the hell did he go to the Ecuadorian embassy without an exit plan?He has spent more than 10 years in prison and self-imprisonment. And for what? That helicopter combat footage? Is that it? Sure - it doesn&#x27;t look good, but...that&#x27;s Tuesday for the Russians in Ukraine. reply boomboomsubban 10 hours agorootparent>Why would the USA need to get him extradited through Sweden if the UK can extradite him to the USA directly without any sort of fake criminal charges?Currently the extradition of Assange has been refused on humanitarian grounds, as the US can&#x27;t guarantee that they won&#x27;t stick him in an ultramax facility and&#x2F;or drive him to suicide. It&#x27;s still facing appeal, but it&#x27;s entirely possible the UK refuses to extradite.I believe historically Sweden has been more willing to ignore such concerns when dealing with the US, which is why there would have been an incentive to fake charges that could get him moved to Swedish custody. reply toyg 7 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s still facing appeal, but it&#x27;s entirely possible the UK refuses to extradite.Extradition has actually been approved by all relevant UK authorities, after formal reassurance from the US about his treatment. Assange is appealing that decision, arguing then-Home Secretary Priti Patel was an id-- could not seriously accept some meaningless words that they can renege a minute after getting him.Meanwhile, the Australian government is trying to vaguely save face by making some noise, probably to extract some extra money from Biden to just shut up. reply boomboomsubban 6 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m shockingly behind on the case. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 7 hours agorootparentprevThe US has even said if convicted he can serve in Australia. Australia could probably release or pardon him if they wanted to. I don&#x27;t understand why people are so against him seeing a court room. reply dijit 7 hours agorootparentit&#x27;s a little more nuanced than that, but for starters Assange already held the right to apply to serve any sentence in Australia.What is crucial to understand is that prisoner transfers (IE; to Australia in this case) are eligible only after all appeals have been exhausted. For the case to reach the US supreme court it could easily take a decade, even two. What the US has proposed is a formula to keep Assange in prison effectively for the rest of his life, and in a US prison. reply zirgs 4 hours agorootparentRoss Ulbricht - the infamous Silk Road guy: 1. Arrested in 2013. 2. Sentenced in 2015. 3. First unsuccessful appeal in 2017. 4. The case reached the Supreme Court and was denied in 2018.So - 5 years. Fewer than Assange spent in the embassy. reply toyg 6 minutes agorootparentNowhere near the level of complexity and political visibility as Assange&#x27;s. DiogenesKynikos 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause he&#x27;s a journalist who&#x27;s being unjustly pursued for revealing the US government&#x27;s dirty secrets. Secrets such as: American helicopter pilots gunned down two Reuters journalists in Iraq, and then killed a random civilian who came across and tried to rescue one of the wounded journalists. The pilots shot up a van with kids in the process (thank God the kids survived, though they lost their father), and then joked and laughed about it. The military covered it up.The US is trying to set the precedent that if you air our dirty laundry, we can go after you, wherever you are in the world. Not in the US? No problem. Not an American? No problem. reply zirgs 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not nearly the worst thing the US military has done. Collateral damage happens in every war. reply vasac 2 hours agorootparentCollateral damage is one thing, brutal execution is something else. replyatlantic 11 hours agorootparentprevAt the time, the UK couldn&#x27;t just arrest him at the behest of the US, for exposing state crimes such as torture and extra-judicial killing. He was a popular and respected figure, so public opinion wouldn&#x27;t allow it. The rape charges served to smear his reputation and erode public support. Now they can do what they want with him. reply cbsmith 13 hours agorootparentprev> Assange is incoherent. Why would Sweden frame him for a rape that he didn&#x27;t commit?He wasn&#x27;t incoherent when the charges were filed. reply ben_w 14 hours agorootparentprevGiven what happened in Sweden when he was kicked out of the Ecuadorian embassy and the UK arrested him for extradition to the US, I believe the Swedish accusations were made, and the prosecutions were done, in good faith.Assange&#x27;s argument against going to Sweden should&#x27;ve logically also applied to the UK, where he physically was while trying to make the argument to avoid extradition to Sweden, as demonstrated by the UK not even bothering to inform the Swedish authorities when they finally did arrest Assange. reply nobody9999 13 hours agorootparent>Given what happened in Sweden when he was kicked out of the Ecuadorian embassy and the UK arrested him for extradition to the US, I believe the Swedish accusations were made, and the prosecutions were done, in good faith.Just picking a nit here, but IIRC Assange was not arrested by UK authorities to be extradited to the US (that&#x27;s just a \"bonus\" for the US), but because he broke UK law by \"jumping bail,\"[0] which is a crime in the UK.There are a raft of other details&#x2F;issues around Assange and his Swedish&#x2F;British&#x2F;Ecuadorian odyssey, and those have been endlessly discusssed&#x2F;litigated in the press.I won&#x27;t address those issues, as I don&#x27;t think it would add productively to this discussion.Assange did violate the terms of his bail in the UK and was convicted and sentenced accordingly, regardless of other issues.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bail_in_the_United_KingdomEdit: Clarified my thoughts. reply ben_w 12 hours agorootparent> Just picking a nit here, but IIRC Assange was not arrested by UK authorities to be extradited to the USOk, fair. My recollection was that they did both at about the same time, though subsequent focus on the (clearly motivated) US extradition rather overshadow the Swedish issues (which don&#x27;t look politically motivated to me; though obviously that&#x27;s what they want me to think :P).That the UK didn&#x27;t bother to tell Sweden is even more egregious given what you say. reply depressedpanda 52 minutes agorootparentWhy would the UK inform Sweden?The suspiciously flimsy case had been dropped already. replycolordrops 11 hours agorootparentprevI hope you are aware of the multi-pronged smear campaign against Assange. The US government hired Palantir and HB Gary to infiltrate WikiLeaks and cause rifts, and put out negative press about him. This is just what leaked, let alone their entire strategy.Even if he were guilty of some information crime, the level of persecution against him by the US government is way overboard and not in proportion to the supposed offense.But it is clear to me and many others that what he was doing was journalism, even if you don&#x27;t like his message and methods. He should be protected at all costs. reply kome 12 hours agorootparentprevyou just did this mindless form of character assassination...let&#x27;s focus on the crimes they both uncovered. please. reply Terr_ 9 hours agorootparent> let&#x27;s focus on the crimes they both uncovered. please.Well, since you phrase it that way, sure:* Snowden uncovered mass-surveillance programs and intelligence agencies lying to congress.* Manning uncovered Iraq War records, such as a helicopter attacking civilians.* Assange uncovered... What? What pieces of information do you specifically credit to Assange which puts him in the same position as those first two whistleblowers? reply DiogenesKynikos 5 hours agorootparentYour question makes no sense. Assange is the one who published Manning&#x27;s leaks. That&#x27;s precisely why the US is trying to put him behind bars for 175 years. reply zirgs 3 hours agorootparentManning has already been released from prison. reply celtoid 8 hours agorootparentprev> \"Assange uncovered... What?\"According to The New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, El Pais and DER SPIEGEL, Assange exposed the corruption of the US State Department. This is apart from his exposing the war crimes committed by the US military in Iraq [1].\"Cable gate”, a set of 251,000 confidential cables from the US State Department disclosed corruption, diplomatic scandals and spy affairs on an international scale.\" [0][0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytco.com&#x2F;press&#x2F;an-open-letter-from-editors-and-...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HfvFpT-iypw reply Terr_ 8 hours agorootparentWhy are you taking credit from Chelsea Manning and giving it to Julian Assange?Maybe I wasn&#x27;t explicit enough: Assange is categorically not a whistleblower, but rather a publicist at best, figurehead at worst. Other people did the important uncovering, putting themselves in far more legal jeopardy. reply celtoid 7 hours agorootparent> \"putting themselves in far more legal jeopardy.\"I have to disagree. The US govt and its national security state have done a pretty good job of persecuting Manning, Assange and Snowden alike albeit in differing ways. reply zirgs 3 hours agorootparent1. Manning is already free. 2. Snowden fled to Russia 3. Assange hasn&#x27;t even been to the USA yet and he imprisoned himself for almost a decade in that embassy. reply tmoehle 3 hours agorootparentSnowden did not flee to Russia. He was on his way to Berlin with a stop in Moscow, but before he was able to board the plane (if I remember correctly even before his plane landed in Moscow) the US revoked his passport so he couldn’t get on the plane to Berlin. It was not his choice to be stranded there. reply zirgs 2 hours agorootparentI think that those stories about him \"being stranded\" are bullshit and he always intended to flee to Russia.Flying to Berlin doesn&#x27;t make sense. Germany is a NATO member and a US ally. He&#x27;d be extradited ASAP. reply knorker 6 minutes agorootparentThe US really did revoke his passport.You&#x27;re saying the US government helped Snowden cover up his plans?That&#x27;s some lizard people level conspiracy theory you got there. DiogenesKynikos 1 hour agorootparentprevAssange didn&#x27;t \"imprison himself.\" He had asylum, because the world&#x27;s most powerful state was out to get him. It has even come out that the Trump administration seriously considered kidnapping or assassinating Assange. As it turns out, Assange&#x27;s fears of being handed over to the US were 100% justified. replyzlg_codes 14 hours agoparentprevGreat points. I too saw it as very sus that, instead of addressing the content of leaks from WikiLeaks and Snowden, et al, the United States went on an offensive, because apparently it&#x27;s more important to cover up embarrassing things than it is to get one&#x27;s ship in proper working order.I have nothing but respect for individuals that put countries on blast. We all know they are corrupt in their dealings. You don&#x27;t seize control of a territory and 300 million people by dotting your i&#x27;s and crossing your Ts.Like it or not, every sovereign government had to engage in terrorism and one-sided treaties against natives to \"build its country\". They are not moral actors. reply LapsangGuzzler 13 hours agorootparentIt also makes very clear the fact that pro-US propaganda exists, it’s not just Russia and other quasi fascist states that engage in propaganda against their people.What Snowden did was very damaging to the Obama admin’s “hope and change” brand. Of course they were gonna go after him with everything they had. reply throwaway2990 8 hours agorootparentEvery country has some form of propaganda. I’m not sure anyone has denied that US propaganda exists.But the US isn’t invading a country to wipe it off the planet nor is it committing genocide to an ethnic minority within its own borders. reply squeaky-clean 7 hours agorootparent> I’m not sure anyone has denied that US propaganda exists.I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve spoken to a very diverse number of Americans then. reply zlg_codes 4 hours agorootparentprev> nor is it committing genocide to an ethnic minority within its own borders.America&#x27;s treatment of Native Americans in general was extremely dehumanizing and brutal, but it was especially so under the command of Andrew Jackson, who enacted the Trail of Tears. (NB: And then we put his damn face on the twenty dollar bill... smh) Could you say the Natives of today are of the same health and status they were 300-400 years ago? We made that happen, as part of building up America. Most reservations now have high alcoholism, poverty, and some rely on fringe businesses like casinos or firework stands, etc. Those conditions aren&#x27;t natural or endemic to their cultures. Our country is squarely responsible for the downfall of Native cultures.That&#x27;s not even touching what we did with African slave trade.One could also argue that the concentration camps America had during the World War eras were only a few steps away from genocide. There was no legitimate reason to round people up the way they did.There are also other events where American interests have disrupted activities, like in Panama, Haiti, Cuba, etc. Meddling with other countries trying to influence their leadership isn&#x27;t just a Russian thing. America has thrown its weight around in many places it had no business in.Maybe we could tweak our discourse into a more concrete direction? Pointing out some American propaganda might be a good start for us.My go-to for this stuff is the way bills are named in Congress. There&#x27;s bullshit like the CARES Act, EARN It Act, No Child Left Behind, Patriot Act, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more obvious ones I&#x27;m missing, but it&#x27;s deliberately named to pre-load bias on the legislation, and to use as petty political weapons (\"Wow, you voted against CARES? Why don&#x27;t you care?\").The Patriot Act might be the most relevant, in the modern age. It gave so much to the government and nothing to the people.

Snowden likely committed acts of treason for which the govt will pursue him. Snowden did pose a threat to US national security interests. If you look at the Schneier essay, he shared privileged info with journalists with poor operational security experience, one of whom crossed borders with a USB thumb drive full of docs. As a whistleblower, he might have enjoyed some legal protections if he had stayed within the lines, which would&#x27;ve at last implied staying in the US and dealing with the possibility of being tried. By fleeing abroad (to the PRC no less, then Russia), he made it easy to write him off as a traitor.At the same time, he exposed behaviors that were clearly wrong in both government and industry, and spurred a number of people into actions that would not have been undertaken otherwise. For this he should be thanked. That doesn&#x27;t erase everything. reply _rm 8 hours agorootparentIt does erase it. If you (Snowden in this case) take an unlawful action out of reasonable necessity to defend yourself and others from the criminal acts of another (the US gov in this case), the latter is responsible for it, not the former (subject to certain limits like murder https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens). reply yafbum 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s pretty debatable whether the entirety of Snowden&#x27;s actions can be attributed to \"reasonable necessity to defend from criminal acts\". He could, and did, encrypt his own comms, by which point it looks like he was pretty shielded. Dropping a lode of secret docs with journalists that seemed to have barely a grasp of security, that doesn&#x27;t seem to have been the only reasonable action strictly to protect himself or even others against govt action. reply _rm 6 hours agorootparentIt was a very reasonable decision.He was under great personal pressure as a result of the actions of the original criminal (US gov pursuing him and canceling passport etc), and had very limited time and resources of his own.He could have dumped it all on the net, but instead handed it to big name highly resourced journalists, who were definitely aware of the seriousness of what they&#x27;d received.There&#x27;s two ways people try to discredit Snowden. The first is the government absolutist way, that no-one can wrong the government even to remedy its own far superior wrongs. The second is the backdoor version of the same: to say yes we get why he did it, but to impose a burden of performance that only a superman could attain in the reality of that situation, falling short of which: \"he caused more harm than he prevented\". reply yafbum 3 hours agorootparentHe wasn&#x27;t under strong direct pressure from govt until after fleeing with secret docs. The actions he took after that can&#x27;t justify his theft and flight abroad. The theft and flight abroad, however, were disproportionate relative to the harm that he was suffering from personally (metadata collection, eavesdropping, both of which he had the technical knowledge to protect himself from).I&#x27;m not trying to balance actions against one another in some form of equation to see what the net good is. That doesn&#x27;t make sense. It reminds me of Dave Chappelle&#x27;s skit about trying to process rape allegations against Bill Crosby. He was a great comedian. And probably a rapist.

I was (especially as a native New Yorker who worked across the street[0] from the World Trade Center for several years prior to 9&#x2F;11, and provided IT support and services to several companies impacted by the events of 9&#x2F;11) appalled and angry at the death and destruction wrought by those bloodthirsty scum.However, I applauded the decision to not only rebuild WTC, but to build an even bigger building than the ones that came down. When challenged on that opinion (with the idea that it was just painting an even bigger target on a new building), my thought was that &#x27;freedom isn&#x27;t safe, and to ensure liberty risks are necessary.&#x27;As such, I was disgusted with the Patriot Act[1] and the various other surveillance mechanisms and security theater (cf. the TSA[2]) implemented after 9&#x2F;11.I think that many folks felt a loss of control (control which they never actually had) and sought out means to regain that feeling of control. One friend refused to fly after 9&#x2F;11, not because she believed that driving 1000 or 1500 miles rather than flying was actually safer (she knew the statistics as well as I did), but because she felt more in control in doing so.And that&#x27;s dumb, especially when it comes to making laws. I wish more of my fellow Americans understood that.As traumatic as 9&#x2F;11 was for me (I still avoid the WTC whenever possible, not because I&#x27;m afraid, but because it&#x27;s still painful to think about 22 years later), I believe that a free and open society is important enough to accept some risk to preserve it.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;200_Vesey_Street[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Patriot_Act[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transportation_Security_Admini... reply cbsmith 13 hours agorootparentprevOver 30 years, and you could name five things.

Now, there&#x27;s a law that protects your kids scans from being sent anywhere (like HIPPA for doctors!), but incidentally it&#x27;s a government institution and thus, according to themselves they do not need to follow the law. - despite that law existing for the only purpose of protecting your kids from the government.When the information gets out that this is happening (this part happened before Snowden btw), everyone involved, including the head of the organisation, knowingly lies to the \"Oversight committee\" which is democratically elected, is transparent and wants to protect your kids. The \"Oversight Committee\" have no choice than to just trust airport security at their word, for \"security\" reasons. (this was one of the things proven to have happened in the Snowden leaks: IE; General Alexander knowingly lied to the US Senate).Lying to the \"Oversight committe\" in this case is also a crime, but such flagrant disregard for the law has become pretty standard.This is what we&#x27;re discussing here, not just that there was laws being broken, not that there was surveillance after all: their job is surveillance.The fact is here: that you, dear citizen have a right to privacy enshrined in the constitution. The reason that protection exists at all is to protect the very democracy that you uphold: freedom of expression.A rogue government agency that lies to your democratically elected leaders, that breaks laws indiscriminately and does so under a thick blanket of secrecy -- while wielding a very powerful hammer to discredit and chase people to the ends of the earth -- that&#x27;s what was exposed.Not \"the good guys\". If they were \"good\" they wouldn&#x27;t be lying to the US Senate. They wouldn&#x27;t be assassinating the character of the people that expose them- these things would have clear answers and when exposed people would shrug.Remember: people are using tools like XKeyscore to spy on people they personally know (ex-lovers, spouses etc; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-surveillance-watchdog... )You can&#x27;t defend it by saying \"it&#x27;s national secrecy\".

And never ever transit through Russia! If Snowden had given 1% as much thought to factors like that as he had to stealing and disseminating classified information, maybe it would be easier for me to believe that his motives were completely pure and&#x2F;or he hadn’t fallen under the sway of foreign intelligence services.Instead, the most charitable assessment I can give him is that he’s a guy who’s not nearly as bright as he thinks he is who got in way, way over his head. I have a hell of a lot more respect for Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner than I do Snowden. reply dijit 11 hours agorootparentFirstly; I want to mention how extremely difficult it is to admit that you&#x27;ve been misled. It requires basically removing all stigma from being conceivably wrong then coldly looking at the facts. Most people simply cannot not do this as it triggers the same sections in the brain as a pain response; they will instead simply pick a side (usually the first one they hear) and not alter their opinion much. So if you are able to coldly assess the facts and you come up to the same conclusion - then I applaud you, that&#x27;s more than most can do.However, some minor facts:1) He was in Hong Kong when he blew the whistle, which as much China as Puerto Rico is the USA - its a special administrative region, there is a strict border when travelling to Szhenzen.2) Whats your transit strategy if the US is trying to get you?Finally; that something is nice for an enemy doesn&#x27;t mean that it shouldn&#x27;t see the light of day, for example if your favourite fast food owner rapes a bunch of women but the company he represents is basically the only thing standing up to a big chain, well, unfortunately, you have to own up to it; not doing so is worse for everyone, including you as you are now complicit.Frankly: Laws were broken and the governments of the allied countries (colloquially: 5Eyes) should petition the law to be changed if that&#x27;s what they require and it should go through our democratic system.You cant claim to be a democracy and then not permit your democratically elected leaders oversight or intentionally mislead them under oath, as General Alexander has knowingly proven to have done in the leaks. reply throwaway2990 8 hours agorootparent> its a special administrative region, there is a strict border when travelling to Szhenzen.It &#x2F;was&#x2F; a special… reply mjan22640 2 hours agorootparentprevWhen the gang you uncovered is going to prosecute you, you take measures to protect yourself. reply 0xDEF 11 hours agorootparentprev>Reality WinnerInteresting how few of Snowden&#x27;s and Assange&#x27;s fanboys care about RW.

The data he revealed changed the direction of the evolution of the internet rapidly and completely. HTTPS websites, E2E encrypted communications, VPN providers, metadata reduction, etc. All of these things gained traction because of Snowden and are integral to the modern internet.Aside from the very real gains in privacy and security, I would also like to make the argument that we would currently be living in a fragmented hellscape of an internet if the net had not turned (mostly) opaque after 2013. Imagine the same AI spam filters currently operating on your email but for all network traffic.

It is easy for me to forget that most people in tech never heard of the Clipper chip. This is a simple summary that history, and the implications for the RFC process. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc9446.html#name-steven-m-bellovin-governmen reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 12 hours agoprev\"Work to develop a new version of TLS was started in 2014, mainly due to concerns that TLS 1.2 and earlier version implementations had been shown to be vulnerable to a range of attacks over the years. The work to develop TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] also aimed to encrypt more of the handshake so as to expose less information to network observers -- a fairly direct result of the Snowden revelations. Work to further improve TLS in this respect continues today using the so-called Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) mechanism [TLS-ECH] to remove one of the last privacy leaks present in current TLS.P:Work on ECH was enabled by significant developments to encrypt DNS traffic, using DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], which also started as a result of the Snowden revelations. Prior to that, privacy hadn&#x27;t really been considered when it came to DNS data or (more importantly) the act of accessing DNS data. The trend towards encrypting DNS traffic represents a significant change for the Internet, both in terms of reducing cleartext, but also in terms of moving points-of-control. The latter aspect was, and remains, controversial, but the IETF did its job of defining new protocols that can enable better DNS privacy. Work on HTTP version 2 [RFC9113] and QUIC [RFC9000] further demonstrates the trend in the IETF towards always encrypting protocols as the new norm, at least at and above the transport layer.P:Of course, not all such initiatives bore fruit;\"Indeed. People are still sending cleartext domain names in SNI. Are the alleged privacy gains of encrypting DNS traffic meaningful when anyone can see the domain names in SNI, when the user makes a TLS connection. Arguably cleartext SNI is even worse for privacy than cleartext DNS because with SNI anyone can see when the person is connecting to a website whereas DNS only tells them when the person looked up a name. Concluding that a person accessed a website from a DNS lookup alone requires some assumptions. Cleartext SNI requires no such assumptions. reply varjag 13 hours agoprevThe R in RFC is supposed to stand for Request, not a Rant. reply placesalt 6 hours agoprev\"We kill people based on metadata\"- General Hayden reply sph 2 hours agoprev> \"Looking back on all the above from a 2023 vantage point, I think that, as a community of Internet engineers, we got a lot right, but that today there&#x27;s way more that needs to be done to better protect the security and privacy of people who use the Internet. In particular, we (the technical community) haven&#x27;t done nearly as good a job at countering surveillance capitalism, which has exploded in the last decade. In part, that&#x27;s because many of the problems are outside of the scope of bodies such as the IETF. For example, intrusive backend sharing of people&#x27;s data for advertising purposes can&#x27;t really be mitigated via Internet protocols.However, I also think that the real annoyance felt with respect to the Snowden revelations is (in general) not felt nearly as much when it comes to the legal but hugely privacy-invasive activities of major employers of Internet engineers.It&#x27;s noteworthy that RFC 7258 doesn&#x27;t consider that bad actors are limited to governments, and personally, I think many advertising industry schemes for collecting data are egregious examples of pervasive monitoring and hence ought also be considered an attack on the Internet that ought be mitigated where possible. However, the Internet technical community clearly hasn&#x27;t acted in that way over the last decade.\"--We are all very aware of Snowden&#x27;s revelations and call him a hero, but we also routinely ignore, if not get paid by, major tech corporations that make tracking and advertising, a form of surveillance, their main source of income.I guess it&#x27;s easy not to care when you&#x27;re paid $250,000&#x2F;yr and have a nice cafeteria to get unlimited free snacks. reply mjan22640 1 hour agoparentImagine being served ads so good that you would install a contentblocker to not be distracted from the ads.

ECDO (the Enterprise Data Centre Operators, mostly big banks and similar outfits) wanted to use the obsolete RSA key exchange method in TLS 1.3, and sent somebody to argue for this right at the end of the process, years after it was removed - because otherwise they&#x27;d have to do a bunch of work, and who wants to do work?

They got caught because they had been demoralized from within, and there were dozens of other Snowdens waiting in line because the agency had obviously and demonstrably lost its way. If NSA thought they were keeping the world safe from totalitarian communism, they had one job, and the leadership of each of those countries and in europe today suggests that America actually lost the cold war and is collectively too stupid to know it.I suspect the IC has been seduced by the conceit that they are essential to the movement whose activists have infiltrated it and is using the agencies to ratchet its people into government. The IC people just don&#x27;t get that this movement won&#x27;t need the NSA when it has Google and Apple. It doesn&#x27;t need the FBI when it has digital currencies. It doesn&#x27;t need any of them when it has snitch networks and legions of the mentally ill denouncing people for counter revolutionary thoughts. The last thing on earth it needs is professional bureaucrats with networks of relationships, let alone sentimental beliefs about nationhood and freedom, and who know where its blind spots are. The simple reason behind 20th century atrocities is they were all committed by people who thought they would be the exceptions, and it was accepting the exceptions that enforced the rule.Snowden showed us that we were all the suckers at the table with NSA, but I would observe a decade later that now the IC as a whole doesn&#x27;t know who the sucker at the table is anymore.

If you drive from BMI airport to Washington DC at the wrong time of the day you might encounter one of America&#x27;s worst traffic jams when everybody gets off work at the NSA headquarters.I remember reading a non-fiction account of certain intrigues from the early 1970s where a private eye says: \"If I know something there is 1 chance it leaks out, if two people know it is more like 11, if it is three people, like 111, etc\" and given that increasing difficulty of keeping secrets, if you really want to keep something a secret you really have to keep it a secret.The author of this bookhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Inside-Company-Diary-Philip-Agee&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0...was faulted for revealing specific names, dates, etc. of CIA personnel that directly put them in danger. I wasn&#x27;t surprised at all that the NSA was doing the stuff that Snowden \"revealed\", in fact it would have been a scandal if they weren&#x27;t doing that because the whole reason the NSA exists to do exactly that. Snowden can be faulted not so much for revealing the big picture, but revealing lots of details that affected specific activities and programs.Of course, without all those details people wouldn&#x27;t realize what a house of cards a non-encrypted internet is. Back around 2005 I turned on a Wi-Fi packet sniffer on an academic network and immediately saw email passwords for about 15 people (I deleted them right away) It is not just the NSA hoovering up data but governments like France, Israel, Iran, Russia, China not to mention high school hackers, organized crime organizations, etc. People never seem to take security seriously enough and unfortunately it took Snowden to wake up to the possibility that the NSA can do that but so can everybody else. reply CafeRacer 14 hours agorootparentprevI sort of agree with op.

It&#x27;s pointless to be protected from the government, because I want real criminals to get caught. The chilling effect is real, but I still don&#x27;t want criminals to hack me, and so far it seems things are okay, and online ads are more worrying than the NSA.What&#x27;s worrying with this NSA story, is how politics can influence with justice, when agencies use their powers for political gain but it doesn&#x27;t seem the NSA is really using it on the US political scene.However, the US abuse its power on the international scene, so it spies on its allies or even work with large US corporation to loot other countries. That&#x27;s a real problem.At the end of the day, lay people will just argue that what the NSA does is to preserve American dominance, so it must be good.So in the end, the NSA and digital surveillance is never the problem, the problem has not changed, the problem is how the US behaves on the planet.But ask yourself this question: do you trust your government? I&#x27;m not american, the US scares me, and I trust the US government. Even Trump could not do all the damage he wanted.So in the end, the Snowden story only resonates with libertarians who fears that the US government will turn into a fascist soviet empire.

While Bankman-Fried had a First Amendment right to proclaim his innocence, the judge said, free speech protections do not cover communications intended to intimidate or tamper with witnesses, a felony. Sam Bankman-Fried is going back to jail after leaking former girlfriend Caroline Ellison's personal diary pages to the New York Times.Michael M.

He removed his shoelaces, tie and jacket and handed them to his defense lawyer before being escorted from the courtroom. His lawyers asked the judge to suspend the ruling pending appeal, but their request was denied. They declined to comment as they left court. The one-time Crypto King, Bankman-Fried had previously been allowed to remain free pending trial, confined to home detention at his parents' house in Palo Alto, California on $250 million bond. The trial is scheduled to begin in October and expected to last at least a month. The personal notes by Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and the chief executive of Alameda Research, a hedge fund affiliated with FTX that traded on the crypto exchange, were written in the months before it collapsed last fall. They described how her fizzled romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried left her unhappy and disengaged from her job. They were featured in an article in July in the New York Times. Kaplan said he found the writings \"extremely personal and intimate\" and that they \"portrayed Ms. Ellison in an unfavorable light.\" By leaking them, he concluded, Bankman-Fried \"intended at least in part to harass Ellison and influence her testimony.\" Read More Sam Bankman-Fried Could Be Sent Back to Jail After Feds Accuse Him of Trying to Intimidate Ex-Lover Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Federal Judge Over Allegations He Leaked His Ex-Girlfriend’s Letters DOJ Agrees to Only Try Sam Bankman-Fried on Original Charges – For Now Ex-Crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried Loses Bid to Dismiss Criminal Charges in FTX Collapse Sam Bankman-Fried gave millions to effective altruism. What happens now that the money is gone? Judge Skeptical of Sam Bankman-Fried Request to Dismiss Some Charges in FTX Collapse Ellison pleaded guilty in December to charges stemming from her role in FTX’s collapse. She has agreed to testify against Bankman-Fried during his trial in a bid for a more lenient sentence, and prosecutors have said in court filings that she is an important witness for their case. Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research and the star witness at the U.S. trial against Sam Bankman-Fried.Caroline Ellison/Twitter/X Lawyers for Bankman-Fried did not deny that he shared the writings with the Times, but maintain he had a right to do so and that the article was already in progress and informed by other sources. Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's attorney, said during the hearing that prosecutors lacked evidence of intent to intimidate Ellison, and said their claim was based on a \"thin record with a lot of spin.\" After the writings appeared in the Times, Kaplan signed a gag order barring Bankman-Fried from speaking to the news media. But prosecutors sought the additional step of having Bankman-Fried jailed pending his trial, saying his sharing of Ellison’s musings amounted to intimidating a witness and tampering with the jury pool. Prosecutor Danielle Sassoon said his actions amounted to a \"deliberate evasion of his bail conditions.\" In court filings, prosecutors have noted Bankman-Fried was already warned by the judge for contacting a different prosecution witness on an encrypted messaging service early in the case and saying he hoped they could have a “constructive relationship.” During the hearing, Kaplan also concluded that the earlier contact amounted to an attempt to influence a witness. FTX imploded amid disclosures that Alameda had borrowed $10 billion in customer funds on deposit at FTX and used the money to back high-risk trading positions that ultimately turned against it. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November and Bankman-Fried resigned as chief executive. Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried, 31, of cheating investors and stealing deposits from customers of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges before its collapse in November. He is accused of squandering the money backing the risky trades placed by Alameda, as well as on political contributions and a lavish lifestyle. Bankman-Fried has been in prolific contact with journalists covering the collapse of FTX and his criminal case, according to court filings. Over a period of serval months, he logged more than 1,000 calls with reporters, and has also been in frequent contact with the author Michael Lewis, who is writing a book about the matter. It was not immediately clear where Bankman-Fried would be held in custody pending trial. Prosecutors said they had looked into arrangements with the Putnam County jail in upstate New York where he would have better access to trial preparation materials via computer, but Judge Kaplan said he believed there would be similar access at the federal jail in Brooklyn. The issue was not resolved during the hearing. Kaplan noted the Brooklyn lock-up is \"not on anybody's list of five-star facilities.\" Read nextHurricane Dora to Become Typhoon As It Crosses International Dateline After Fanning Maui Fires Sponsored Content Recommended by Start your day with the biggest stories and exclusive reporting from The Messenger Morning, our weekday newsletter.
