The data is unencrypted, and Qualcomm circumvents Android's protective mechanisms. Affected devices include Sony Xperia XA2 and the Fairphone. To avoid tracking and surveillance, some users install a de-Googled Android phone lacking Google's proprietary apps or services. In a test of such a phone, researchers found the phone's first connection was to google.com, and it communicated with izatcloud.net, which belongs to Qualcomm, sending data including unique ID and IP address.- The AMSS operating system has full control over microphone and camera hardware in smartphones, causing privacy concerns.\n- Even popular privacy-focused phones like Fairphone contain the AMSS blobware, which shares personal data with Qualcomm XTRA Service.\n- Nitrokey's NitroPhone uses GrapheneOS to prevent Google from obtaining and storing IP addresses and does not share personal information with GrapheneOS proxy servers or Qualcomm.\n- Qualcomm's proprietary firmware transmits users' personal data and unique signature, enabling behavioral tracking and decreasing privacy.\n- Affected users can try blocking Qualcomm XTRA Service using a DNS-over-TLS cloud-based block service or re-route traffic to GrapheneOS proxy server, but technical expertise is required.\n- Paul Privacy is an independent security researcher with a focus on privacy, offering consultations for anyone interested.",

        "hn_content": "Smartphones with Qualcomm chips are allegedly sending personal data to Qualcomm. The article claims that the issue exists in Android Open Source Project and even on custom ROMs. Qualcomm chips apparently manage to send personal data to Qualcomm, including location data and metadata about apps installed on the device. NitroPads are promoted as a solution to this issue, but the article has been criticized for its lack of conclusive evidence and biased tone. GrapheneOS is a privacy-focused alternative for Google Pixel users that ensures that even A-GPS URLs are \"de-Googled\" on the latest models.Qualcomm admits to exfiltrating data through its iZat chipsets; privacy advocates argue that iZat shares more data than necessary; data shared allegedly includes geolocation, Wi-fi network name, and a list of installed apps; Qualcomm has stated that the data is used for ad targeting and unspecified security objectives. Snapdragon-powered NitroPhone claims to provide a Qualcomm-free alternative for users concerned about privacy. Privacy organizations like NOYB are advocating against tech giants infringing on GDPR compliances.- Firewall devices such as pfsense/firewalla can be used to monitor and control web traffic\n- Removing the SIM card may be necessary to prevent device connection through cellular network\n- OEMs/ODMs can bypass on-device firewall apps as they control the software and hardware\n- Tracking technologies can be used for good but are often used for nefarious purposes\n- Users can view XHR's and network calls in browser dev tools to better understand how they're being tracked\n- Qualcomm's indoor positioning iZat has been implemented for at least 6 years with user consent options\n- Though not sinister, data tracking features such as those by Intel and Qualcomm could be made optional for users\n- Custom ROMs can proxy requests to mask IP for GPS services\n- Accusations that the baseband processor was accessing Wifi without kernel knowledge are unfounded\n- Traffic that is unencrypted and sends personal data may be illegal under GDPR laws\n- Article on data tracking by Qualcomm lacked evidence and plugged the author's phone without a Qualcomm chipQualcomm's 5G chips have a covert operating system, AMSS, which has complete control over the hardware, microphone, and camera, sending telemetry back without user permission. This has caused concern that user privacy is being disrespected, and people don't own their devices. Users express frustration that products must respect ownership and protect privacy but aren't receiving needed attention. Many suggest that RISC-V needs to create competition to provide solid open-source options. While there are already options for running FOSS on smartphones, Qualcomm's wireless patents and chip lead are hard to overcome.Readers are discussing the battery life of phones using /e/OS Fairphone 4, with the consensus being that battery life is pretty good. There is a conversation about the role of an ISA in improving efficiency, and what really gives Qualcomm an advantage. Meanwhile, there is some hype around a cheap, open-source, and fully documented Linux processor, which commenters say is a rarity. A discussion about electronic surveillance arises, with some people expressing concern over the data that car manufacturers may collect remotely. Finally, there is a discussion about a Tesla car as a surveillance platform and a debate about how much trust to invest in tech companies.The conversation revolves around the trustworthiness of Tesla and other car companies to handle user data. The original poster suggests that he doesn't trust any company with data collection by default due to past industry abuses, but specific companies can earn his trust. Other posters argue that the digitization of cars is inevitable and that people want the convenience of connected cars. While there are concerns about data privacy, Tesla and other companies work with whitehat hackers to improve security measures, and some argue that remote unlocking and updating cars can be done responsibly. The overarching theme is balancing convenience and privacy concerns in the digital age.An opinion piece argues for a balance between consumer ownership of IoT devices and companies' responsibility for custody/access to such hardware. The author suggests that legislation and ground rules should be put in place to establish responsible shared custody. The article also highlights the importance of making decisions based on facts and evidence and not unfounded claims or speculation. A debate ensues in the comments section, with some arguing for a presumption of guilt when it comes to companies and their privacy policies. Others suggest that any potential breaches of privacy should be backed by credible evidence and facts.This text exchange in a forum discusses data collection in Tesla cars and the potential abuse of that data. Some users express concerns about the constant data connection to the car being problematic, while others argue that the features are advertised and for a consumer's benefit. It is also noted that Tesla cars can work offline and be disconnected from the LTE antenna. Overall, the discussion revolves around the trustworthiness of companies collecting user data and the potential misuse of that data.Qualcomm's integration of the IZat location platform in their chips has been known for over a decade, and other chip manufacturers do similar things. An argument against blanket assessments of companies like Tesla lacking security and privacy measures is made, as Tesla has security measures in place and anonymous data collection is necessary for user support. There are concerns about ownership of modern electronic devices and loss of privacy through embedded 5G chips, but this is not a new development. The RISC-V processor architecture is suggested as a possible solution to ownership issues, but it is not a guarantee of total ownership.A discussion on Android security mentions the closed-source stuff Android OEMs run, which renders Google's grand ceremony around Android security nearly pointless. The issue turns out to be who private data is being sent to, with most people sending their private data to Google. The discussion covers the topic of encryption and whether or not users should control who their data is sent to by making small changes to their settings. The conversation delves into many related issues, including Qualcomm\u2019s privacy policy, which is controversial. Finally, various users suggest different solutions, ranging from using a modified Android with GPS disabled to buying\u00a0devices that are owned by the user.The article discusses how smartphone manufacturers like Qualcomm are secretly keeping a backdoor open through their chipsets to remotely collect data from devices. Commenters are skeptical about the news being novel or surprising, and the responsibility of trust lies on either the government or consumers. However, alternative systems like RISC-V may provide more transparent options for users. Some commenters express nostalgia for \"dumb\" devices that could not track their every move. Ultimately, the issue leads to discussions about how tech companies should be more accountable to the public.Qualcomm's firmware sends geolocation data in plain text to izatcloud.net, which other manufacturers may be using as well. This was discovered to be a problem for privacy, but the AGPS system is essential for GPS accuracy, as GPS receivers take time to find satellites. While Apple may also be doing this, the article is criticized for scare-quoting normal terms to promote emotional appeal instead of logic. One suggestion to improve privacy is to pressure the government to provide GPS that is accurate enough to eliminate the need for independent systems.Researchers have\u00a0discovered that smartphones using Qualcomm chips send data to servers without the users' knowledge, including geolocation data, and that data could potentially be collected and analyzed.\u00a0Qualcomm suggests that this is for location-based services, such as GPS or triangulation,\u00a0however, researchers suggest that there are risks associated with transmitting users' locations to unknown servers, highlighting that\u00a0users have no way of blocking telemetry at this time. It is currently unclear if Apple devices are affected by the issue, but a thorough audit would be required. Some operating systems, such as GrapheneOS,\u00a0keep transmitted telemetry to the bare minimum required.- Personal data is being shared with Qualcomm's Xtra service by many smartphone devices\n- Data shared includes the mobile network code, type of operating system and version, device make and model, time since the last boot of the application processor and modem, list of software on the device, and IP address\n- A-GPS (Assisted GPS) system downloads current satellite orbits from Qualcomm to reduce the time it takes to fix a location\n- Different opinions on the severity of the issue exist, with some suggesting it is cause for concern while others downplay it as a common practice\n- There is criticism of the article for promoting a specific \"secure\" phone without adequate data to back up its claims",

But the EU never shared the report\u2014possibly because it determined that there is no evidence that piracy is a major problem.The Dutch firm Ecory was commissioned to research the impact of piracy for several months, eventually submitting a 304-page report to the EU in May 2015. The report concluded that: \u201cIn general, the results do not show robust statistical evidence of displacement of sales by online copyright infringements. That does not necessarily mean that piracy has no effect but only that the statistical analysis does not prove with sufficient reliability that there is an effect.\u201dThe report found that illegal downloads and streams can actually boost legal sales of games, according to the report. The only negative link the report found was with major blockbuster films:\u201cThe results show a displacement rate of 40 percent which means that for every ten recent top films watched illegally, four fewer films are consumed legally.\u201dThe study has only come to light now because Julia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament representing the German Pirate Party, posted the report on her personal blog after she got ahold of a copy through an EU Freedom of Information access to document request.The European Digital Rights organization suggested in a blog post that the full contents of this report was intentionally suppressed, pointing to a 2016 academic paper by two Commission officials. The paper, \u201cMovie Piracy and Displaced Sales in Europe,\u201d only mentioned the part of the Ecory report that highlights the relationship between piracy and blockbuster film lost sales, and excluded the other findings of the report. Additionally, the paper didn\u2019t even disclose that the cited information came from Ecory\u2019s study.[JuliaReda.eu, European Digital Rights, TechDirt]",

Commenters on Hacker News suggest reducing copyright period by 75%, comparable to lifetime of technical patents, would deter piracy while still allowing for revenue collection to finance new works. Some argue for even shorter copyright periods or abolishing it entirely, though this would have other implications, such as potentially abolishing the GPL. Many commenters criticize copyright monopolies and the perpetual extension of copyright duration, seeing it as squandering culture that ought to belong to the public domain.- Copyright is a contentious issue, with some arguing that the public domain is the natural state of information and copyright holders being monopolists.\n- Preservation of information and culture is hindered by copyright holders who can be hostile to sharing and preservation efforts.\n- The argument for copyright should be based on how it improves society as a whole, rather than any individual or business.\n- Copyright infringement is a widespread and normal occurrence in the 21st century, with many people not realizing they are infringing.\n- There are differing opinions on the existence and enforcement of licenses like the GPL, with some arguing that they depend on copyright and should not exist.- The discussion revolves around the controversial nature of copyright laws and their impact on the availability of content to the masses.\n- Some argue that content would be more accessible and efficient without copyright laws, but others argue that without it, creators would be unable to make a living from their work.\n- Some suggest alternatives like crowdfunding and patronage for funding creative works.\n- Others argue that a better solution would be to have a unified online interface for purchasing and accessing content to reduce piracy.\n- There is some consensus that the lobbying power of large corporations poses a significant challenge in reforming copyright laws.According to a report, illegal downloads and streams can actually boost legal sales of games, but this isn't necessarily true for major blockbuster films. To prevent piracy, some people overwhelm pirate platforms with the first chapter of a book and a discount code. DRM may work best when paired with convenience and there are modest to high levels of inelastic demand. Piracy and uncompensated acquisition invite us to think about segments where the price point is vanishing. In some cases, piracy can produce future sales. Free versions that become disabled after several months of use based on utilization are a possible solution to piracy for niche industries.A discussion thread about the impact of piracy on sales reveals that a study found no statistically relevant evidence that piracy harms sales, except for major blockbuster films. The study used unit sales rather than revenue, and some users criticize the study's methodology. The thread also has comments about the convenience of piracy compared to buying physical media, the ease of use of streaming services, and the belief that piracy can actually promote sales by increasing exposure. The conversation touches on DRM, Steam, and GOG platforms. Overall, the thread provides a snapshot of opinions about the ongoing debate surrounding piracy's economic effects.A report commissioned by the EU found that piracy does not harm sales, but the results were suppressed. Several commenters mention their experience with piracy, citing it as a way to access cultural products that they could not afford to purchase legally. Piracy is viewed as a service problem, with consumers often turning to torrents due to more restrictive distribution technologies and issues with pricing and quality. Services like Netflix are criticized for having limited catalogs and technical issues, driving some users back to piracy. The global reach of content producers is enabled by technology but piracy is viewed as an acceptable loss.- The comments section discusses the issue of copyrights and piracy in the digital age.\n- Some argue that owning \"intellectual property\" is unrealistic in a world where copying costs are nearly zero.\n- Others believe that piracy without compensation is morally wrong and harms creators.\n- The discussion mentions alternative ways to make a living from creating content, such as crowdfunding or subscription models.\n- A study on piracy and sales is referenced, which has not concluded that piracy harms sales, but rather that there is no conclusive evidence either way.",

Reddit users first spotted the privacy issues with Edge last week, noticing that the latest version of Microsoft Edge sends a request to bingapis.com with the full URL of nearly every page you navigate to. Microsoft tells The Verge it\u2019s investigating the reports.\u201cSearching for references to this URL give very few results, no documentation on this feature at all,\u201d said hackermchackface, the Reddit user who first discovered the issue. While Reddit users weren\u2019t able to uncover why Microsoft Edge is sending the URLs you visit to its Bing API site, we asked Rafael Rivera, a software engineer and one of the developers behind EarTrumpet, to investigate, and he discovered it\u2019s part of a poorly implemented new feature in Edge.\u201cMicrosoft Edge now has a creator follow feature that is enabled by default,\u201d says Rivera in a conversation with The Verge. \u201cIt appears the intent was to notify Bing when you\u2019re on certain pages, such as YouTube, The Verge, and Reddit. But it doesn\u2019t appear to be working correctly, instead sending nearly every domain you visit to Bing.\u201dMicrosoft first started testing this new creator follow feature in Edge last year before rolling it out more broadly in recent months. It\u2019s designed to let you follow your favorite content creators on YouTube and across the web. If you disable the feature, URLs are no longer sent to bingapis.com.Microsoft Edge\u2019s follow creator feature. Image: Reddit (Leopeva64)Microsoft has a master filter (available here) for this creator follow feature, which includes domains like Pornhub where URLs are blocked from being sent to the Bing API site. It looks like, for every previously unchecked URL you visit, it passes it to bingapis.com, which has huge privacy implications, especially when this functionality is enabled by default.\u201cWe\u2019re aware of reports, are investigating and will take appropriate action to address any issues,\u201d says Caitlin Roulston, director of communications at Microsoft, in a statement to The Verge. Microsoft hasn\u2019t yet explained why URLs are being sent to this bingapis.com service or how Edge has been configured to send nearly all of the sites you visit over to Bing.Until Microsoft completes its investigation and presumably patches this problem, we\u2019d highly recommend turning off the \u201cfollow creators\u201d feature in Microsoft Edge. Chances are you never knew it existed and will never use it, so it\u2019s not a function you\u2019re likely to miss. To do so, navigate to Settings, choose the Privacy, Search and Services tab, and scroll down to Services.

Moreover, the web developers' practice of capturing the search phrase in your browser sent to a competing search engine and noting the next visited page on your browser has led to legal challenges about search copying. Many ads and trackers were detected on the page; thus, ad-blockers like uBlock Origin or switching to paid models like OnlyFans are encouraged. Microsoft has pushed Bing onto Edge, making it challenging to remove, adding a large B button, and ignoring significant bugs, causing users to switch back to Chrome.- Edge now runs as a minimal background process on login to reduce startup lag or resource usage for gaming\n- Edge is using new APIs in Windows 11 to suspend tabs without killing them, allowing more tabs to be open on low RAM devices\n- Discussion on privacy concerns with browsers and the need for honest, paid software solutions\n- User experiences with the new browser called Arc, which has unique features for organizing tabs and efficient navigation\n- Discussion on Microsoft Edge's \"follow creator\" feature that is enabled by default but may send too much data to Bing, with recommendations to turn off the feature or use a different browser.Google and Bing use duration of stay data from Chrome and Google Analytics to rank search results. There are concerns about user-hostile practices by search engines, including advertising and SEO. Privacy-conscious users may be interested in alternatives like Firefox, which allows for disabling search suggestions and offers more user-friendly design. The default search engine in Firefox is Google, but the browser also allows for selecting other search providers.Microsoft Edge's 'follow creator' feature sends browsing data to a Bing API endpoint, even with Microsoft diagnostic data collection toggled off. The creator feature is used to follow social media influencers, and anyone on the app can choose their own list of creators. Although the hashed URL is sent, Google may obtain it under the Safe Browsing initiative. Mozilla Firefox asks users about the feature on first use while Microsoft Edge enables it by default. Microsoft's privacy policy says browsing history is used for bug fixes and to improve services for all users.Bing and Google are compared in terms of search result clarity, ad placements, and UI design. Microsoft's Bing seems to have a cluttered and confusing layout. While Google is no longer the clean design it once was, it still has a more straightforward approach to search results. Both Bing and Google have issues with ad placements on their search result pages. Bing was created to compete with Google in a crowded search market in the year 2000, but its design is no longer competitive according to some users. DuckDuckGo aggregates search results from Bing and other sources, but it's unclear whether this affects the results.Microsoft's Edge browser reportedly sends user data to Bing, including URLs and search terms. A bug initially caused concern but Microsoft confirmed the issue is intentional as it helps to improve search results. However, critics argue this represents a breach of privacy, while others note that Google Chrome likely exists for the same reasons. Opinions are split on alternative browsers, with some praising Firefox and others preferring Safari or Edge. Many users appear unconcerned by the data sharing, although some have switched to privacy-focused alternatives like Brave.Microsoft's new 'Follow Creator' feature in its Edge browser is sending users' site data to bingapis.com, even when disabled,\u00a0leading to accusations of 'leaking' and poor judgement. Similar concerns were raised about Google Chrome previously. The issue was discovered by a user on Twitter, who found numerous calls being made from their computer to the Microsoft-hosted domain. Microsoft responded to the reports by stating that the feature behaves as designed, and that it respects user privacy by limiting collection to several hundred sites without including users' browsing history or search queries.Some people in the tech industry advocate for paying for browsers. However, the general consensus is that companies will still collect user data regardless because \"it's too tempting\" not to. Some users are willing to pay for software, but others prefer free, open-source software like the variety of FOSS browsers bundled with many Linux distros. One user praises Safari's built-in ad-blocker but notes that Safari also hides the full path of the URL and doesn't give previews when hovering over a link. Another user suggests implementing tiered browser security levels.The comment thread mostly discusses the placement of options to prevent phishing in Safari. Users debate whether or not these options should be the default and accessible from more visible locations. Some users also discuss alternative browser options, such as Chromium, Brave, Firefox, and Opera. Additionally, users debate the usefulness of the padlock icon for indicating secure connections, with some arguing that the icon is outdated and that browsers should automatically upgrade all connections to HTTPS. Finally, one user makes an unsubstantiated claim that Safari sends user data to Apple.- Chromium sets the standard for the \"correct\" way to render web content according to a user\n- Users report not noticing many/any bugs on Firefox during web development\n- Brave's main feature is aggressive blocking of tracking but has privacy concerns of its own\n- Firefox users must opt-out of the built-in telemetry enabled by default\n- Bitwarden Firefox extension bugs have been recently fixed after 4+ years\n- Edge's vertical tabs are well-executed and exceptionally useful\n- Modern Edge is merely a fork of Chromium with Microsoft branding\n- Users recommend Lynx and Gemini as an alternative to traditional browsersThere is no meaningful content in this raw text.",

        "content": "- Transformers are a tool for sequence transduction in natural language processing.\n- They were introduced in a 2017 paper and have become an indispensable tool for research and product development.\n- One-hot encoding, dot product, and matrix multiplication are foundational concepts in understanding transformers.\n- Matrix multiplication acts as a lookup table and is used to pull out specific rows from a matrix.\n- Markov chains can be used to create transition models that predict the likelihood of the next word in a sequence.\n- Using matrix multiplication with a one-hot vector can pull out the transition probabilities associated with a given word.- Predicting the next word based solely on the current word is challenging\n- A second-order Markov chain model that considers the two most recent words has more context for better predictions\n- A second-order model with skips can capture long-range dependencies, but a naive implementation of higher-order models is impractical\n- A transition matrix with feature rows, rather than state rows, can represent word dependencies for more accurate predictions\n- Masking uninformative features using a vector can improve predictions through selective attention \n- The described model is a simplified approximation of the attention mechanism used in transformers technologyThe article explores how the concept of matrix multiplication is at the core of developing transformers, a type of neural network used in natural language processing. Matrix multiplication allows for efficient computation and backpropagation, which is essential for training the model. The use of attention masks involves matrix multiplication and adds to the efficiency of the algorithm. Multiword feature building is also explained through matrix multiplication and neural network layers. The decoder uses matrix multiplication for sequence completion, which involves generating a long sequence by predicting the next word with the highest probability. The article also briefly touches on embeddings to make transformer models more efficient.The use of embeddings allows for the reduction of parameters needed for training language models, by rearranging words in a lower-dimensional space. This reduces the amount of training data needed and allows for patterns in the embedded space such that what is learned about one word is applied to all the words nearby. Positional embeddings add positional information to the embedded represetation of words through circular wiggles. De-embeddings convert the embedded vectors back to words from the original vocabulary through a matrix multiplication, and softmax allows for soft maximum function which enables the consideration of several possibilities at once.The post discusses how the transformer model uses the softmax function and multi-head attention in its architecture. Softmax helps preserve results with high probability, while multi-head attention allows the transformer to consider several previous words simultaneously. The model also uses matrix multiplication to project everything into a lower-dimensional embedding space to reduce computational load. The attention mechanism maps query words to points in the embedded space and filters out irrelevant information in the sequence. Overall, the post provides insights into some of the core principles of the transformer architecture.The Mask block enforces constraints in the sequence completion task by preventing the model from looking ahead. The block uses an [n x n] matrix to manually set attention paid to past words to negative infinity, avoiding artifacts from imaginary future words. Attention maps each element of the sequence to other elements of the sequence to enable interpretation in the embedding space. Skip connections aid in backpropagation by preserving the original input sequence and avoiding dead spots in the gradient. Layer normalization maintains consistent distribution of signal values throughout neural networks to encourage parameter convergence.

Photograph: Science Photo Library/AlamyAntibioticsUse of antibiotics in farming \u2018endangering human immune system\u2019Study suggests antimicrobial used to promote livestock growth breeds bacteria more resistant to our natural defencesHannah Devlin Science correspondent@hannahdevMon 24 Apr 2023 19.01 EDTThe blanket use of antibiotics in farming has led to the emergence of bacteria that are more resistant to the human immune system, scientists have warned.The research suggests that the antimicrobial colistin, which was used for decades as a growth promoter on pig and chicken farms in China, resulted in the emergence of E coli strains that are more likely to evade our immune system\u2019s first line of defence.Although colistin is now banned as a livestock food additive in China and many other countries, the findings sound an alarm over a new and significant threat posed by the overuse of antibiotic drugs.\u201cThis is potentially much more dangerous than resistance to antibiotics,\u201d said Prof Craig MacLean, who led the research at the University of Oxford. \u201cIt highlights the danger of indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in agriculture. We\u2019ve accidentally ended up compromising our own immune system to get fatter chickens.\u201dThe findings could also have significant implications for the development of new antibiotic medicines in the same class as colistin, known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which the scientists suggest could pose a particular risk of compromising innate immunity.AMPs are compounds produced by most living organisms in their innate immune response, which is the first line of defence against infection. Colistin is based on a bacterial AMP \u2013 microbes use the compounds to shield themselves against competitors \u2013 but is chemically similar to some AMPs produced in the human immune system.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the latest study suggests the same genes also allow pathogens to more readily evade AMPs that form a cornerstone of our own immune response.In the study, E coli carrying a resistance gene, called MCR-1, were exposed to AMPs known to play important roles in innate immunity in chickens, pigs, and humans. The bacteria were also tested for their susceptibility to human blood serum.The scientists found that E coli carrying the MCR-1 gene were at least twice as resistant to being killed by human serum. On average, the gene increased resistance to human and animal AMPs by 62% compared with bacteria that lacked the gene. The study, published in the journal eLife, also showed that the resistant E coli was twice as likely to kill moth larvae that were injected with the infection, compared with the control E coli strain.Antibiotic resistance: where do we go next?Read moreMacLean said it was not possible to estimate how this might translate into real-world consequences, such as the risk of an E coli infection leading to sepsis and death. And the prevalence of these strains of E coli have dropped steeply since China banned the use of colistin as a growth promoter, suggesting that these genes carry other \u201cfitness disadvantages\u201d for the pathogens. However, the findings highlight a fundamental risk that has not yet been extensively considered.\u201cThe danger is that if bacteria evolve resistance to [AMP-based drugs], it could also make bacteria resistant to one of the pillars of our immune system,\u201d said MacLean.Antimicrobial resistance poses a dire global threat \u2013 the UN has warned that as many as 10 million people a year could be dying by 2050 as a result of superbugs \u2013 and so the need for new antibiotics is pressing. There is growing interest in the potential of AMPs as drugs, and some of those in development include drugs based on human AMPs.MacLean and colleagues are not calling for the development of such drugs to be put on hold, but say extremely careful risk assessments of the likelihood of resistance emerging and the potential consequences are required. \u201cFor AMPs, there are potentially very serious negative consequences,\u201d he said.Dr Jessica Blair, of the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cAntimicrobial peptides, including colistin, have been heralded as a potential part of the solution to the rise of multidrug-resistant infections. This study, however, suggests that resistance to these antimicrobials may have unintended consequences on the ability of pathogens to cause infection and survive within the host.\u201dDr George Tegos, of Mohawk Valley Health System in New York, said that broad conclusions about the potential risks of AMPs could not be drawn from a single study, but added that the findings \u201craise concerns that are reasonable and make sense\u201d.C\u00f3il\u00edn Nunan, an adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cThis new study shows that colistin resistance is probably even more dangerous than previously thought \u2026 It is also remarkable that the British government is still opposed to banning preventative mass medication of intensively farmed animals with antibiotics, even though the EU banned such use over a year ago.\u201d\u2026 we have a small favour to ask.

        "hn_content": "The widespread use of antibiotics in farming is endangering human immune systems because some antibiotics are similar to chemicals produced within our bodies, producing bacteria that our bodies are less effective at fighting on their own. This is not just about drug-resistant bacteria. The issue has been allowed to go on because every irreplaceable natural resource is somebody's profit waiting to be taken unless stopped. Antibiotic overuse is common across many countries, creating a global issue of antibiotic resistance and ruinous effects on the immune system. The United States is not immune from overuse or underprescription of antibiotics.South Korea, a high-income and well-educated country, is facing high rates of antibiotic resistance due to the overuse of antibiotics in human medicine. According to a commenter, this is partly influenced by local ajummas (middle-aged women) who push for antibiotics from doctors in private clinics, who, in turn, hand them out to earn better businesses. Although antibiotics resistance may not be a sustainable effective trait for bacteria to survive in an ecosystem that is not constantly under antibiotics, unsustainable practices in agriculture, including feeding cattle antibiotics, create environments that select for resistant bacteria. Furthermore, animal agriculture has an array of negative effects beyond antibiotic resistance, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and waste management problems.- Land degradation, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and chemical runoff from pesticides and fertilizers are some of the negative impacts of animal agriculture.\n- Most land used for grazing in the US is insufficient for farming most crops, making it almost useless if cows and other livestock are taken off.\n- Some argue that it's better to find ways to make meat production more efficient than to ban it completely.\n- Attacking end-consumers does not solve the issue but going after subsidies for farmers may bring a change in diets.\n- Necessary overproduction of food is done to avoid starvation in times of war and conflicts.\n- Stability is more important than efficiency in essential matters like food production.\n- Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are responsible for a major portion of meat and eggs produced in the US.\n- Permaculture setups that integrate animals and food forest are a sustainable approach to animal agriculture.- Animal product processing and packaging consume a lot of energy.\n- Storing animal products requires energy to maintain refrigeration units.\n- Adopting a plant-based diet can reduce global agricultural land use drastically.\n- Traditional farming techniques may not be viable on a large scale.\n- Overconsumption and capitalist governments contribute to unsustainable levels of meat consumption.\n- The use of permaculture could lead to mass starvation if implemented globally.\n- Human population growth is a significant contributor to environmental issues.\n- Demographic cliffs and dwindling birth rates pose challenges to developed countries.\n- Russia's pension system is one example of this, with an aging population putting a strain on the government.The $3600 spent on candles in the Russian budget led to massive protests, which reliably causes Putin's popularity numbers to fall. The issue of population growth and decline is discussed, with declining fertility rates posing challenges for an aged world. Antibiotic resistance can be reduced through better animal care and management practices. The use of antibiotics to increase weight gain in animals is a controversial off-label use. A personal anecdote is shared regarding the difficulty of replacing nutrition from meat, and the potential impact of increased awareness of animal consciousness on dietary choices.A discussion on the use of antibiotics in animal agriculture and its impact on human health. Some commenters suggest limiting or eliminating meat consumption due to concerns about antibiotic resistance and increased risk of colon cancer. Others point out that not all meats are equal and note the Inuit diet as an example. The conversation includes a mention of the RethinkX prediction that most farmed meat will be replaced by cheaper precision fermentation proteins by 2030. A commenter notes that the deaths attributed to antimicrobial resistance are occurring in regions with inadequate healthcare, where antibiotics are often overused.- Commenter dismisses article as an \"anti-farm hitpiece\"\n- Emphasis that the food is not from \"factory farms\" in developed nations\n- Preference for locally grown food over outsourcing to countries with animal cruelty issues\n- Y Combinator is currently accepting applications for Summer 2023",

Many users find it\u2019s just as useful for managing their free time.By Rhiannon Williamsarchive pageApril 25, 2023STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTRJoshua Bergen is a very productive person. His secret is the workspace app Notion. Bergen, a product manager living in Vancouver, uses it to plan trips abroad in meticulous detail, with notes and timelines. He uses it to curate lists of the movies and TV shows he\u2019s watched, and records what he thought of them. It\u2019s also a handy way to keep tabs on his 3D-printing projects, map snowboarding runs, and quickly update his cute list of the funny things his kid has said. It might sound strange, but Bergen is one of a growing number of people using Notion, software intended for work, to organize their personal lives. They\u2019re using it in a myriad of different ways, from tracking their meditation habits and weekly schedules to logging their water intake and sharing grocery lists. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed my productivity with my own projects has exploded since I started using it,\u201d Bergen says. \u201cI\u2019ve done more projects since I started using Notion in the last two years than probably the previous 10 years. Maybe it\u2019s obsessive, maybe it\u2019s too much, but it\u2019s everything, and I love it.\u201d Related StoryChore apps were meant to make mothers\u2019 lives easier. They often don\u2019t.Rather than reducing the burden of housework, they tend to become yet another thing to worry aboutSo why has a platform built to accommodate \u201cbetter, faster work\u201d struck such a chord when there are countless other planning apps out there? Part of the reason Notion has such a devoted fan base is its flexibility. At its heart, Notion is designed to combine the various programs a business might use for functions like HR, sales, and product planning in a single hub. It uses simple templates that let users add or remove features, and remote workers can easily collaborate on notes, databases, calendars, and project boards.This high level of customizability sets Notion apart from other work apps. It\u2019s also what\u2019s made it so popular among people looking to map out their free time. It started to gain traction around 2018 in YouTube\u2019s thriving productivity subculture, where videos of fans swapping time management tips and guides to organizing their lives regularly rack up millions of views.Since then, its following has snowballed. More than 275,000 people have joined a dedicated subreddit, tens of thousands of users share free page templates in private Facebook groups, and TikTok videos advising viewers on how to make their Notion pages look pretty have been watched hundreds of millions of times.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to change your habits to how rigid software is. The software will change how your mind works,\u201d says Akshay Kothari, Notion\u2019s cofounder and chief operating officer. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually been a big reason why you see so much love in the community: because people feel like the things they build are theirs.\u201dThat ability to customize has meant that Bergen can use Notion to store the serial numbers of his newly purchased products in case they get stolen, alongside a detailed inventory of the contents of every single numbered box he packed during a house move.Wesley Anna Tiner, a product designer and content creator in New York, has also found Notion indispensable for planning her impending house move, as well as her meals for the week. \u201cI have a lot of \u2018just for fun\u2019 pages as well,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor example, I received a Sephora perfume sampler for Christmas, so I created a database with the different products and logged my thoughts as I tried a new one each day. I also have a daily mood tracker, wish list, self-care toolkit, and many more.\u201dTommy Meyer, a web developer from Phoenix, Arizona, started using Notion around 2018 after realizing he was carrying around three different notebooks at all times in a bid to stay organized. \u201cI haven\u2019t written a paper grocery list in years,\u201d he says. He also uses it to help him plan fantasy novels he wants to write.While Notion lends itself to note-taking and journaling, Adam Warren, a voice actor and voiceover artist from the UK, also uses it for managing his YouTube channel projects. \u201cI earn something equivalent to the wage of a good full-time job from Youtube and Patreon now, and all management for that business is done in Notion,\u201d he explains. \u201cI have all my video projects in a database, and use the kanban view to track their status. I also write the scripts for my videos right in those database pages.\u201dFor people who enjoy feeling organized, these kinds of platforms make a lot of sense. Apps like Notion can help us structure and simplify our lives so they feel less overwhelming and chaotic, says consultant psychologist Elena Touroni. However, spending too much time optimizing and organizing our lives can be counterproductive when we prioritize creating to-do lists over completing the actual tasks on them, a phenomenon known as the planning fallacy, says Gabriele Oettingen, a psychology professor at New York University.Using Notion to track whether you\u2019re drinking enough water or going jogging, or using it to plan assignments, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re actually getting those things done. \u201cIn a way, Notion might help me to get structure, but it might not work to get me going,\u201d she says.For people like Bergen who use the same app to map both their personal and work lives, there can be downsides, Touroni adds. \"The obvious benefit is that your work and personal life are likely to intersect and using the same app will take account of this for more efficient time scheduling,\u201d she says. \u201cThe disadvantages are that it will become more difficult to create boundaries between work and home life, as you\u2019ll be having to navigate both parts of your life whenever you use the app.\u201dDespite the wealth of options at their disposal, Notion\u2019s most devoted fans say they\u2019re unlikely to jump ship to any other promising platforms anytime soon\u2014Tiner reckons she uses it to run \u201c95% of my life.\u201d The company recently launched its own AI bot to automate tedious tasks and summarize large documents, and will be keeping close tabs on the community\u2019s reaction to it on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s unique for a business-to-business software company that makes money from business to have that kind of love,\u201d says Kothari. \u201cWe definitely do not take that for granted.\u201dby Rhiannon Williamslinkedinlink opens in a new windowtwitterlink opens in a new windowfacebooklink opens in a new windowemaillink opens in a new windowPOPULARThe inside story of how ChatGPT was built from the people who made itWill Douglas HeavenChatGPT is about to revolutionize the economy.

Users have reported lagging and latency. Although there are alternatives such as Obsidian and Airtable, Notion remains a popular choice because it offers global search, structured data, templates, and plugins out of the box. It has been described as a step up from spreadsheets and a simple, one-stop-shop for everything, even if its promises are vacuous. Notion uses mini-relational databases rather than tables.Notion and Airtable offer user-friendly interfaces for creating semi-primitive relational databases that are more accessible than most other database tools. Obsidian lacks the structure and organization of Notion and can be difficult to use for querying data. Atlassian's Confluence is launching databases as a feature, and FileMaker is underrated for its structured relational database. Notion's data model is based on an infinitely nested hierarchical tree of lists. Its UX allows for flexibility, including kanban boards, and collaborates on unstructured rich text, as well as having good mobile support.The comment thread discusses the pros and cons of using Notion, a versatile productivity tool, compared to Trello. Users note that while Notion has a cleaner representation, it can be slow and not ideal for active updating. Some find it works well as a \"second brain\" for long-term storage, others note that it struggles with interactive content. The post generates interest among entry-level software engineers and university students looking for new productivity tools that replace Trello-like lists.

Users experiment with Apple Notes, Syncthing, Logseq, and Obsidian for note-taking and productivity. Obsidian, with its graph view and linking features, proves to be a popular app for organizing notes. Some users prefer simpler tools with easy search capabilities, like Apple Notes and Logseq. Overall, users emphasize the importance of finding the right tool that works for their needs, rather than getting caught up in the latest trends or features.Obsidian's extensions are deeper than Notion's.\nThe rabbit hole in Obsidian is graph-based organization and volume.\nIt's essential to keep things simple initially and add complexity where it's needed in Notion.\nFlexible tools like Notion can lead people astray to the wrong roads.\nStructured and configurable tools can lead people to spend all their time configuring them instead of using them.\nSearch engines are stuffed with right keywords to get maximum clicks on affiliate links.Minimal.app is a notes and productivity app that focuses on simplicity and avoiding the trap of over-planning and over-organizing. Its feature of 'Note Lifetime' ensures that notes are deleted when not engaged with, although there is an option to pin them. While some users question the usefulness of this feature, it could work well for a to-do list. Minimal.app is currently in beta and offers free access to premium features. As with other note-taking apps, there is a discussion around the importance of self-hosting and avoiding subscription fees.Users of new-gen apps, including Notion and Joplin, have been discussing the virtues of different organizing systems, including zettelkasten and book-format. BookStack's \"book > [chapter >] page setup\" has won over users who found infinitely nestable pages confusing. Notion's success is partly attributed to its great versatility and the range of templates and example projects available within the platform. Other users prefer offline, open-source solutions such as Tiddlywiki, Dokuwiki, and Org Mode. Many prefer paper-based planners or diaries; however, they concede that search functions on software-based systems are often lacking.Some HN comments discuss alternatives to SaaS note-taking apps like Notion, such as local markdown-based solutions like Obsidian and Logseq, which offer advanced features like complex search and smart references. Some users prefer low-tech solutions like paper diaries or sticky notes. Some users argue that the file system and desktop metaphor are supposed to be used to store and manage documents, but some feel these systems are too complex or underspecified. Some users find tracking everything helpful to manage anxiety, but others warn of the dangers of becoming too obsessive. Ultimately, the tool used should work for the user, not against them.Individuals discuss their passion for tracking various aspects of their lives, including behaviors such as food intake, time usage, and work-life balance. Life logging, or the quantified life, is becoming more popular as people desire to track and organize their habits and goals on a deeper level. One individual even developed an application to help with life tracking, which includes tracking over 200 actions per day, and provides structure for those who need it. Different applications such as Obsidian and Notion, while useful in organizing data, have their strengths and limitations. Collaborative versions of these applications, however, still need to evolve to effectively support team usage.Users on Hacker News discuss their preferences for note-taking and to-do lists, with many users preferring simplistic approaches like Notepad or Vim for storing their notes. However, others advocate for newer tools like Obsidian, Logseq, or Notion, which offer more advanced features like syntax highlighting, embed images, and more. Several users express concern about the proprietary formats that many of these tools use, though most offer export or backup options to mitigate these concerns. Notion is noted as having a large student user base due in part to its similarity to Google Docs. Ultimately, the thread serves as a comparison of the relative merits of various tools for note-taking and to-do lists, with users expressing preferences for simpler, stripped-down tools, or more advanced options with additional features.- Notion, the popular productivity tool, has an export feature to back up user content.\n- Users are encouraged to back up their data to avoid losing information.\n- Notion states that the feature exists in response to GDPR legislation requirements.\n- Y Combinator (YC) has opened applications for its Summer 2023 cohort.",

        "hn_content": "A non-technical article about deep learning was shared on Hacker News, with mixed reception from readers. Some found it helpful for children or as a supplement to video explanations, while others criticized it for not being informative enough. The conversation steered towards broader topics such as education, automation and unemployment.HN users share tips on how to learn technical topics, including building a simplified version of the thing, looking up concepts you don't understand, and reading accessible yet informative books. Metaphors and analogies are acknowledged to be a double-edged sword; while they can aid understanding, relying solely on them can lead to incorrect conclusions. Users also discuss the use of jargon in certain fields, including the deep learning and AI sector. One user points to research claiming the entire universe is a neural network, which sparks humor and skepticism from others.The comments section is discussing various debates around deep learning and neural networks.\nThere is skepticism and humor around the comparison between artificial intelligence systems and corporations.\nThe interdisciplinary nature of this research is highlighted.\nSome commenters express that advanced math is required to fully understand deep learning models, while others argue that high school math is enough.\nOverall, the post serves as a conversation starter and raises some interesting points around the field of machine learning.A discussion thread on neural networks and deep learning has various comments offering critiques and clarifications. Some commenters highlight the inaccuracies in the metaphors used in the article, such as comparing gradient descent to reward and punishment. Others question why the article only mentions RGB values when discussing image data. Some highlight the limitations and challenges of neural network optimization. One commenter mentions the Chinese Room argument and how the article may or may not refute it. There is no new or exciting development or release in this post.This post includes a conversation about deep learning, specifically neural networks, and how they work to model complex functions. One analogy involves mixing paint colors to create more complex hues, where each layer in a neural network can be likened to a different color mixed with the previous layer's color. The backpropagation process, enabled by the composability and differentiability of neural networks, allows for learning and training of parameters to minimize error. Debate surrounds the explanation of neural networks in terms of polynomial regression and their efficacy in modeling non-linear relationships.The post discusses the use of circles in the real world and how they are not functions. However, a circle can be associated with the image of a function rather than being the image of a function. The previous methods allowed modeling of non-linear relationships, and gradient descent is not brute force. No new or exciting tech developments are mentioned in the post.",

Although Deming's data tools and statistical methods have led to operational rigor, many Western companies with such processes are not very pleasant places to work. Deming's overall business approach is deeply humanistic, and he believed that many business myths, such as the belief that grading and rating improves education or work, are counterproductive. The article discusses how Koch Industries has implemented Deming's philosophy, but it remains unclear if any company has successfully implemented all aspects of it.Koch Industries founder Charles Koch was deeply influenced by the ideas of W. Edwards Deming, an \"obscure\" business consultant who advocated for mathematics-based quality control and continuous improvement. Koch adopted Deming's principles and applied them across the entirety of Koch Industries, with dramatic results. The run chart, a simple form of process behavior charting, proved to be one of the most useful tools in this regard, helping Phil Dubose, an oil gauger in Louisiana, turn his fleet of barges into a profitable small business. Koch's dedication to Deming's methods would eventually lead the company into sticky situations but also solidify its business processes.",

        "hn_content": "The article on the commoncog.com focuses on the Deming Paradox, which states that operationally rigorous companies are not the nicest places to work in. The paradox implies that if corporations optimize their system without considering employee satisfaction, retention or wellness, they will lose their talented employees over time. This is due to pushing people too far and too often when they have their limits. Organizations that operate as if heads to fill headcount slots are an interchangeable commodity will face headcount retention, hiring issues, or other severe roadblocks. The article delves into how we must extend our understanding beyond P&L and create a healthy work environment where people feel comfortable in their roles. Organizations that believe humans are interchangeable will have difficulty succeeding in the long run.The comments in this thread discuss the nature of startups and corporations in relation to employee treatment and advancing humanity. The discussion touches on the idea that most startups are not particularly human in nature and don't necessarily advance humanity. The conversation also highlights how companies might treat employees as expendable assets and ignore employee satisfaction, wellness, and retention. The comments further argue that companies should design processes that can tolerate human needs, and not treat employees as consumables that can be easily replaced. Finally, the comments touch on the role of government regulations and laws in shaping market rules.Amazon's workplace conditions and practices have been subject to criticism and controversy, including workplace bullying, harassment, retaliation, and unlawful surveillance. Managers are accused of making things up and falsely reporting employee status to HR, while warehouse workers are injured more frequently than other warehouse workers. Amazon has received numerous OSHA citations for reasons including incident underreporting and withholding information. Shareholders have pushed for change. In 2016, a suicide attempt by an Amazon employee triggered discussions about Amazon's rough culture needing to change. In a recent case, Amazon is being sued for failing to warn employees of a dangerous weather event that killed six workers, and critics argue that Amazon's practices led to these deaths.There is no meaningful content in this text to provide a summary.The post is an investigative note reflecting on Deming's ideas, which go beyond the data tools and statistical methods of Statistical Process Control he helped introduce to the practice of business. The article raises concerns about finding a balance between operational rigor and creating a pleasant workplace environment. The power relationships involved in setting targets and the need to take other factors beyond profit and loss into account when making decisions are crucial. The author argues that although operational rigor helps achieve benchmarks, it must not come at the cost of jeopardizing employees' mental, physical health, or safety.1. Goodhart's Law is not as useful as previously thought, Statistical Process Control has methods to combat it, specifically in the context of Amazon.\n2. To be data-driven, practitioners argue that understanding variation is necessary, which is the central idea of SPC.\n3. Operational excellence stems from pursuing knowledge which requires a deep understanding of variation.\n4. Pursuing knowledge over truth is a good hack in business, as there are no stable truths.\n\nThe article discusses the importance of documentation and process improvement when dealing with organizational dynamics. It also touches on Deming's philosophy on performance evaluation and the companies that follow it.The post discusses Deming's philosophy about quality management in businesses. Deming argues that measuring and monitoring alone does not improve quality of work, but rather holistic approach and understanding the system is needed. He believes that blaming individuals for mistakes is counterproductive and instead, processes and systems should be adjusted. Deming's ideas parallel those of Agile software development methodology, but their implementation can sometimes lose the original spirit. Data-driven managers often focus on data that matches their intended actions, and companies need to prioritize process improvement. Successful companies prioritize employee morale and camaraderie.The post discusses flaws in management models and measurements leading to poor work environments. There is a misreading of Deming's philosophy, which focuses on gaining profound knowledge about a process rather than calling it profound. The flawed thinking in management involves enforcing a perfect system of people management and measurement and not listening to experienced employees. The post also touches on the issues of Japanese company work culture and peer pressure. The flawed assumptions of the evaluators maintain power dynamics in the organization, leading to wrong models of the world. Deming was all for optimizing processes but not using the same methods on people. There is a sweet spot in providing some level of rigor for people to move autonomously in the right direction, preventing micro-management.- Autonomy is key to a positive working environment\n- Firms with an extractive relationship with employees struggle to adopt methodologies like Deming loop\n- Operational rigour must have some flexibility and \"waste\" to respond to unforeseen circumstances\n- Measuring employees affects their behaviour\n- Rigorous systems with built-in Slack are resilient, adapting to unexpected events\n- Amazon is deified by software management despite its flaws\n- Amazon has a moat around its products in retail and AWS\n- Applications are open for YC Summer 2023",

The change in its \"Energy Security Scenarios\" is attributed to much slower growth in global energy demand, which was previously thought to be all-but unchangeable. However, the new 1.5C pathway still contains relatively high levels of ongoing fossil fuel use that would overshoot the limit for decades. Shell's new scenarios are not intended as forecasts, projections or business plans, but as pushing the upper limits of feasibility.Oil and gas company Shell has released a new climate scenario that outlines future energy projections should governments move to limit global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. The Sky 2050 scenario includes \u201csubstantial\u201d increases in carbon capture use, while reducing energy demands and the company\u2019s reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.

        "hn_content": "Shell's CEO has admitted that the company's previously stated goal to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require an immediate end to fossil fuel growth. However, some critics argue that setting arbitrary goals is not helpful and that the focus should be on achievable reductions in carbon emissions, including through government policies like tax breaks for solar projects and energy storage subsidies. Additionally, some suggest that the global community must cooperate to achieve meaningful change, but that this may be difficult to achieve in practice.There is a 50% chance that the world will experience a year where the global temperature is over 1.5\u00b0C in the next five years. Carbon emissions are still increasing, and climate policies are not being enforced. While human extinction is unlikely, climate change will result in significant social disruptions, destabilizations, mass migrations, and possible wars. The world has failed to prevent this phenomenon from becoming a disaster on the scale of decades instead of millennia. Even so, there is still an opportunity to limit the worst of it. The conversation includes a discussion of the possibility of damming the Netherlands and the contentious issue of setting a climate goal of 1.5\u00b0C.The comments section discusses the impact of climate change and the reluctance of society to make meaningful changes to reduce carbon emissions even in light of a global pandemic. The conversation includes debates about the feasibility of working from home, the positive growth of solar energy, the tradeoffs of technological advancement, and the urgency of immediate action to control climate change. The commenters acknowledge that future generations are inheriting a dire environmental situation, and the importance of a political solution that holds corporate interests accountable while prioritizing sustainability.The comments section of this post discusses the pros and cons of nuclear energy as a solution to climate change. Some argue that nuclear power is the only viable non-fossil fueled option to service the base load in most areas, while others suggest that we can meet our needs with other clean energy sources. The post also mentions a policy simulator called En-ROADS, created by MIT, that allows users to estimate the impacts of applying various policies at various levels. Overall, the comments suggest that there is no silver bullet solution to solving climate change and that multiple policy interventions will likely be necessary.The post is a discussion on various solutions to stop climate change, ranging from carbon sequestration to changes in the political system to increase regulations on industry. The commenters express frustration that politicians are not taking more significant measures, such as capital expenditure in lower CO2 emitting public transit, reforestation or nationalizing oil companies. One commenter argues that tree planting has a negligible impact on carbon sequestration, and instead, focus should be on dense cities, remote work, and nuclear/renewable energy. Another commenter suggests that investing in mass transit, walking, and cycling infrastructure also reduces health costs.Discussions on mitigating climate change, with a focus on reducing CO2 emissions and increasing carbon sequestration, such as through afforestation, ecosystem restoration, and rewilding. China is mentioned as a country doing the most to combat global warming due to its investment in renewable power and technology, but still has an issue with burning significant amounts of coal. The importance of protecting the biosphere and its ecosystems is emphasized, along with the need for global carbon tax/credit systems to hold countries accountable for environmental externalities. There is also mention of the challenges of implementing renewable energy projects in Western countries.China is investing heavily in renewable energy, but due to economic self-interest, they still lean on coal heavily. The world is on a dire trajectory towards a 3-4\u00b0C increase in temperature by the end of the century, raising concerns of an end-of-the-world scenario. The optimal climate target should maximize embarrassment as the primary mechanism for democratic feedback. Humanity needs to appreciate that we are accelerating the end of the Holocene and slow down the process to maintain civilization and set life on an escape trajectory. Humans have stumbled upon a viable exit strategy for life on Earth, which we need to acknowledge and take responsibility for.Some eco-advocates are advocating for humans to stop living, while others urge humans to tackle issues that have negatively contributed to the earth's ecosystem. The eco-movement has recently been split, with one side proposing to restore ecosystems impacted by humans, even bringing back extinct species, and the other side insisting that humans and what they have done are bad. While the habitable zone is shifting, humans are in grave danger of an ultimate extinction event as a result of their current use of non-renewable resources.Oil and gas companies are willing to transition to green energy, but it must be more profitable. The lobbying budget is a two-way street and a drop in the bucket compared to actual production investments. The reduction in production was due to profitability, but it became a national political issue, and there is still plenty of carbon left to extract, which makes peak oil irrelevant. The power of the oil industry comes from the fact that expensive gas will get politicians voted out of office. Peak oil was never a prediction and more of a statement used to delay climate actions.The discussion revolves around the issue of peak oil and the role of fossil fuels in climate change. While there is no agreed-upon timeline for a peak in oil extraction, the finite nature of fossil fuels makes it a matter of time. Both difficult extractions and the rise of green energy affect the viability of the oil economy. Political pressure for pipeline expansion and domestic production growth exists in Canada and the US. CO2 emissions continue to rise as developing countries desire the same standard of living afforded by fossil fuels. Mitigating climate change requires a policy to deal with externalities, and a shift from the private sector cost trillions.A discussion on climate change, access to clean energy, and the implications of growth in fossil fuel use. The shift to clean energy has been slow, and the consequences of burning fossil fuels are affecting communities in the global south disproportionately. The government's extensive funding of car-only infrastructure instead of public transportation has led to a situation where the use of cars is mandatory in most of America, which makes implementing more sustainable modes of transportation difficult. City planning, economic benefits of urban design, transport budget, government policies and zoning that maintain the status quo and support unsustainable environment are key players.The Tech Times article lacks meaningful content. It is a section of comments exchanging opinions about the challenges surrounding suburbia, infrastructure maintenance, sustainable living, and climate change, with no groundbreaking insights or solutions provided. However, some suggestions are made, such as the installation of bike lanes and bus systems, the reduction of car travel, or the improvement of public transport. The commenters present different views, but most agree that sustainable living solutions must be developed for various living arrangements to address climate change's existential threat.The post discusses various issues related to climate change, the impact of EVs, and the need for sustainable housing. It argues that humanity has overcome similar problems in the past and expects a new innovation to emerge. EVs are more cost-effective in the long run but come with significant carbon emissions during production. Public transportation is not feasible in most US cities due to low population density and lack of infrastructure. Sustainable housing is critical to reducing carbon emissions, but affordability remains a significant challenge for most people. Overall, the emphasis is on finding innovative solutions to climate change and promoting sustainable living worldwide.- Free bus service is available in a small suburban city of 15k along the main street, but it is aimed mostly at school kids with limited hours during certain times of the day.\n- The cultural norm of driving rather than walking or biking is pervasive, as seen in personal anecdotes.\n- No significant new technology or release is mentioned in the text.\n- Applications for Y Combinator's Summer 2023 program are currently open.",

Millions of US taxpayers file their taxes using proprietary software such as TurboTax. Many feel they have no other option than to use nonfree software or a Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS), giving up their freedom as well as their most private financial information to a third-party company, in order to file taxes. Fortunately, upcoming legislation gives us a chance to change this. The Inflation Reduction Act requires the IRS to research a government-operated gratis tax return system. $15 million of the $80 billion that was approved for the tax agency by the Act is allocated for this. On April 5, the IRS released a plan for how it intends to improve the tax system. This plan includes the promise to further explore an \"electronic service to prepare and file tax returns directly with the IRS.\" To do so, the IRS intends to \"study taxpayer preferences for products. The results of the study will inform if and how the IRS should design such a service.\"This is an invitation to tell the IRS about the importance of free (as in freedom) software. The Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund launched a petition calling for a gratis, \"simple tax filing system that saves taxpayers time and money.\" This is not enough! We need a tax filing system in which every taxpayer can file their taxes entirely with free software. There are already some providers who allow eligible people to file their taxes free of charge, but none of the software offered is free as in freedom.Take ActionLet's call on the IRS to make a website for filing your tax return which respects your freedom. This is your chance. Write to the new IRS commissioner Daniel Werfel with your message. It can be as simple as:Dear Commissioner Werfel,Thank you for exploring an electronic service for preparing and filing returns directly with the IRS. Your Internal Revenue Service Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan states that you intend to \"study taxpayer preferences for products.\" I would like to share my strong preference for a software that respects the taxpayer's freedom, i.e. free (as in freedom) software.

People with a simple tax situation should be able to pay their tax bill if the government provides a form to input basic data about donors, marital status, and dependents. The need for a FOSS tax prep software is not the problem, but the cause is Intuit bribing politicians to keep it complicated. A FOSS alternative to paid software might break companies' stranglehold on lobbyists. Taxes were complicated before Intuit, but computers could simplify the process in other countries.Experts discuss ways to simplify the US tax code, with some suggesting the use of an email system from the IRS that allows taxpayers to view a list of their incomes and deductions. The callout for tax return preparation companies lobbying against simplification are still valid, but some believe that complexity arises from different carved out exceptions, which\u00a0being 'cut' will ultimately hurt some tax payers and create an opportunity to pay less. In general, personal taxes are not complicated, though\u00a0specialised interests combined with partisans suppose an advantage to making filing\u00a0aggravating.The post discusses the ease of doing taxes and the idea that taxes are not as complicated as one might think. Many people believe taxes are difficult because the rich, who need accountants to navigate their numerous deductions, spread the idea that taxes were hard for most people. Tax software, while helpful, adds artificial waits to make it seem like the process is more complex than it is. The IRS could send most taxpayers a bill based on the information they already have, and free software could help the minority with more complicated taxes. The discussion also includes alternatives to income tax, such as a higher consumption tax.The post discusses whether or not professional help is necessary for filing taxes, with varying opinions from commenters. Most agree that those with simple tax situations, such as those with just a W2 or 1099, can likely file on their own without issue. However, there are concerns about mistakes and the potential consequences, as well as the stress and time involved with preparing taxes. The Netherlands is mentioned as an example of a country with a simpler tax filing process. Some commenters suggest that the Free Software Foundation should develop a tax software alternative, but others argue that the perceived value in commercial tax filing software, such as fast refunds and protection against mistakes, make it difficult to compete.The discussion revolves around the complexity of tax filing in the US and the lack of reliable open-source software. Many users prefer to continue using excel spreadsheets to file their taxes. A Github repo and a third-party site called ustaxes.org have been created for this purpose, but there are still no official open-source solutions. Some users express frustration at the current tax-filing system, which they believe is a result of government agencies' lobbying efforts and tax professionals. The benefits of open-sourcing tax rules are explored, and the German government's adoption of Elster Online is cited as an example.The conversation revolves around the benefits of open-source software over closed-source or proprietary alternatives, with comments emphasizing that open-source allows for continual improvement, verification, and bug-fixing by anyone who understands code. There is also debate about the US government buying out major tax providers like Intuit in favor of providing free tax estimates to a larger percentage of filers or pre-filled tax forms. Ideas such as graduated taxation with 1000 brackets and no tax withholding are also discussed, with comments highlighting potential complications with implementation. Overall, the conversation showcases a variety of ideas about taxation and software development.A proposal to align capital gains taxes with income taxes to make it more equitable, to allow advance recognition and deferment of income spikes, and to cut taxes on wealthy people. The proposal, however, is criticized as it would cut US Government revenue by over 70%, preferring a simpler tax system instead that takes power away from those currently in charge. Recently, news related to overhauling the tax system is a hot topic, with Intuit lobbying against free tax filing and the IRS building a task force to explore running its own free e-file system.TurboTax, a popular tax-filing software, has long faced criticism for its predatory practices and lobbying efforts against free and simple tax filing measures. The company has been accused of tricking users into paying fees for services that should be free and hiding its free file page from search engines. Proponents have pushed for measures like IRS Free File and automatic tax filing to combat these issues. A recent development is the creation of open-source tax filing web application called UsTaxes. Despite TurboTax's efforts to maintain a monopoly, it's possible that change is on the horizon.",
