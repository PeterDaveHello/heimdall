The authenticity of some sources is questioned, with users pointing out that the last lake in the list no longer exists. Some users diverge into discussing the possibility of moons having moons, with differing opinions on its plausibility. One user shares a humorous mnemonic for remembering that small islands don't have rivers, while others question its veracity. Some users engage in friendly banter about finding the smallest island with a river.HN users discuss lakes on islands within lakes on islands, with examples from around the world. Lake Matano in Sulawesi, Indonesia, is said to contain an island called Pulo Mahamba, with a lake called Lake Towuti, and finally a crater lake which is considered the largest lake on an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island. ChatGPT offers information on other nested lakes and islands, but it's unclear if the largest island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island exists. Other users discuss fun computer science challenges and other interesting locations around the world.In a Hacker News post, users discuss \"islands in lakes on islands in lakes on islands in lakes.\" The article points to two separate examples, but is now outdated due to a 2020 volcanic eruption. Several users remark on the beauty of the geography and offer related linguistic and cultural commentary. The debate over whether Australia is an island or a continent is also discussed, highlighting different perspectives and definitions.People in non-English-speaking countries disagree on what constitutes a continent, with Oceania sometimes considered one. The word \"continent\" does not have a strict definition; according to some, it refers to regions rather than landmass. Cultural definitions and political boundaries also come into play. The presence of a canal between two land masses does not mean they are separate continents. There is no clear definition of what constitutes a continent, with different countries and regions having their own interpretations.Users on Hacker News debate the classification of New Zealand as either a continent or a region, with some expressing confusion about categorization based on cultural preferences. Some users highlight the variation in content taught in US schools, while others point out the arbitrary nature of categorization. The discussion includes commentary on using \"America\" as a term to refer to the whole continent versus its usage to refer solely to the United States of America. One user comments on a remark about the term \"Oceania\" being old-fashioned, pointing out that such tips could be useful to help writers avoid unintended impressions.Language is only useful if there is a common meaning agreed upon. Using old-fashioned language or uncommonly agreed language isn't wrong, and language can still be useful when there is no agreement on common meaning. It is said that Australia is the continent and not Oceania, which comprises Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. However, some geographers group the Australian continental landmass with other islands in the Pacific Ocean into one 'quasi-continent' called Oceania. Australians consider it a continent, while in Belgium, for instance, learners are to be taught that Oceania is a continent.A discussion on Hacker News debates the flawed concept of continents and their definition, with some arguing for a more inclusive definition that includes all mass of land surrounded by water, while others argue for more definitive criteria. Some suggest that the definition is arbitrary and man-made while others claim it is based on geology and history. One commenter suggests that the definition of an island should be based on the ability to acquire a Mai Tai, while another proposes that all landmasses be considered islands. The debate promotes critical thinking regarding established concepts and definitions in a professional and neutral tone.Users on Hacker News debate the definition of \"continent\" after a user argues that Central America cannot be considered a continent. Some users reference the geological basis for determining continents, while others debate the cultural and political factors that impact definitions. Overall, there is no clear consensus on how to define a continent.",

There is a discussion on eligibility for convicts' parole, no matter their age, because some scandals cannot be forgotten. The post includes some graphic descriptions of disturbing events, caution is advised; however, members of the community point out that such cases can be used as examples for deterrence, prevention, and punishment, sometimes even to balance the wrongdoings of society creatively.A woman spent 500 days alone inside a cave for an experiment while recovery in the P\u0159iklopil case was complicated due to the computer being a Commodore 64. Users discussed the Buddhist practice of self-mummification and whether it is a form of mental illness or higher enlightenment, and questioned why society views suicide as inherently bad. The article reminds readers to assess whether their actions align with a basic, moral view of right and wrong, and to avoid making political or religious statements. Experts explore the concept of gut-checking and the universality of cultural practices.An NGO volunteer sought out an elder who decided to die on their terms, comforted and guided the volunteer in their final moments, passing on wisdom about life and death. In contrast, a young family visited their sick grandmother, who stated she didn't know how much longer she could live. The grandmother stated that she would live to see the next grandchild, and ultimately saw two more after that.

One user mentions the idea of \"surface-level\" evaluation of actions on a kindergarten level, which leads to a humorous exchange about vegetarianism, but the topic is ultimately deemed too simplistic to apply universally to morality. Lastly, the morality of religious suicide is briefly debated, with some users arguing that it is a form of mental illness while others argue for self-determination.A woman spent 100 days alone in a cave without access to natural light, and had cameras as her only form of monitoring. Dialogue on the post revolves around mental soundness, examples of isolation endurance and discussions on the difficulty of lone survival, even in small amounts of time.

Other comments mention groups who practice solitary confinement as a means of implementing spiritual or cultural traditions. The accessibility and functionality of instant apps for reading articles is questioned. One user recounts his experience of serving on a submarine for months at a time, which he found entirely comfortable due to his love of reading. Psychological differences between isolation and knowing you are being watched 24/7 are also discussed.Beatriz Flamini has broken the world record for being alone in a cave without human contact for 500 days. Although she was infested with flies, it seemed manageable, according to readers' comments. Some readers discuss isolation\u2019s effects and potential for insight. Readers also recommend watching itstermer, dodyk, and wexler, a documentary film about 38 Jewish families that survived the holocaust by hiding in Ozerna caves for 344 days.

    "content": "MIT, Harvard, and University of Monterrey study shows that 91% of machine learning models degrade over time due to drift in data distribution, which the authors refer to as \"AI aging.\" The study developed a framework to identify temporal model degradation and observed the most significant degradation patterns: gradual or no degradation, explosive degradation, and an increase in error variability. The researchers concluded that temporal model quality depends on the choice of the ML model and the stability of the data set. To mitigate this phenomenon, continuous monitoring of model performance is necessary.Over time, machine learning (ML) model performance can degrade due to multiple reasons, making automatic fixes challenging. An academic paper proposes retraining the model by having access to newly labeled data, assuming no data quality issues or concept drift. To make this solution applicable, the paper suggests developing an efficient and robust mechanism for automatic model retraining, having constant access to the latest ground truth, and alerting when the model must be retrained. The study concludes that every production ML model must be monitored, and tools like NannyML are critical to prevent failures without alerting businesses.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post discusses how AI models may suffer from temporal quality degradation, as they can be inclined to reproduce finished solutions from the past, potentially leading to the risk of oversaturated content. The sentiment calls for a reevaluation of the narrative surrounding the way these systems work to prevent real downsides from being overlooked. Comments debate whether it is possible for AI models to come up with genuinely new concepts or whether it is limited to existing data, as users provide evidence supporting both views. The discussion brings to light the conservative bias of current training data and the absence of a clear understanding of the dimensions in the transformed space.Deep learning models are considered \"universal approximators\" that can learn any relationship with arbitrary accuracy, beyond just regurgitating existing data. They learn to model functional relationships and can combine previously unrelated concepts in surprising ways, making them creative within their limits. People find these models fascinating due to the interesting and often creative results they produce when interacting with them. These models can perform far more complex behaviors, acting as any agent we describe including computer systems, responding quickly to feedback, forming plans, and summarizing artificial languages from examples. The Hessian-score likelihood ratio is a potentially powerful and efficient test statistic that can be used to test hypotheses about model parameters. There is still debate over whether deep learning models can come up with novel concepts that they have not been trained on before.An article on ChatGPT4's ability to invent language generates a discussion among HN users regarding its capacity to produce outputs that are novel to experts. Commenters debate whether or not the AI model can invent reversi/othello without prior knowledge, while others share their experiences getting it to discuss novel concepts. HN users also argue that AI models can't create causal models of reality, but only approximate associative models based on statistical correlations, and debate the philosophical implications of causation, explanation, and mechanistic levels. Meanwhile, the article shows that ChatGPT4 can infer models to predict the grammar and generate legal Othello moves with high accuracy without prior knowledge.The article discusses the limited model provided by P(A|B) versus the causal cases that scientists and athletes are interested in. The HN comments introduce the possibility of a good algorithm that deduces B->A and uses it to predict A, using self-attention through every pair of symbols in the context window. The LLM's models get closer to a genuine explanation and eliminate wrong possibilities from consideration, but it's essentially one big Eliza effect. P(A|B -> A) notation is used, and the problem of induction is discussed. The idea of statistics being informative is challenged as we have bodies, and statistical AI has the problem of induction.While statistical models can capture explanatory relations, the data scientist using the model provides the explanation; there's debate about whether statistical models can use explanations to build new ones. However, autoregressive training rewards models for capturing and using explanatory relations for predictions. Language models are predictive models that don't necessarily explain anything. How can one identify a good model in a search space amidst several models that can generate the same sequence? The argument is that humans learn statistical recognition through a complex of interactions with their environment, while language models learn just through written internet data. There are more general ways to recognize patterns than what Language Models do.A new model can replicate the appearances of handwritten digits by finding regularities and similarities in the shapes of digits and expressing them as combinations of primitive shapes, to generate new hybrids. While the interpolation in the latent space is not exactly the same as averaging pixels of an image, it can produce results that are deemed useful. However, many people still struggle to grasp this concept, refusing to move away from parametric representations of reality. The usefulness of the models is dependent on its ability to be useful, rather than being meaningful or accurate. The accuracy of such models is dependent on experiments and the quality of data acquired.Experts discuss the limitations of machine learning models and the challenges of finding the \"right theory\" in science. Some express concern about getting stuck with models that are only good at prediction, while others argue that creativity in AI is comparable to human creativity. Users also share prompts to generate novel words and quotes to test the AI's ability to be creative. The discussion touches on historical examples of scientific models and theories that were later disproven but provided accurate predictions for a long time.Philosopher Byung-Chul Han discusses social networks, loss of privacy, and the decline of self in modern society in a creative synthesis with existentialist and societal perspectives. Comments on GPT-4's capabilities generating profound quotes, word creation, and problem-solving, although a simple Python script could also suffice. AI has the potential to make better connections than humans and may replace humans in creative work in the near future. However, humans seek optimal experiences to foster self-directed interaction and may create entirely original concepts rather than rely on pattern recognition.An HN discussion is underway regarding the limitations of AI and machines (specifically, ChatGPT) concerning creativity, primarily because machines, even at their most complex, cannot inherently have experiences. Furthermore, humans, unlike machines, have the ability to create or discover those experiences in their mind's eye or abstractly. It is clear that current AI models lack the system architecture to apply real-life-world experiences to its responses, with its lack of understanding of human experience being a notable limitation. Unlike LLMs, humans can create and understand patterns without needing to having seen them anywhere.Experts on Hacker News discuss the limitations of machine learning models like ChatGPT and how they differ from human reasoning. While machine learning models can generate output based on training data, they lack the ability to extrapolate or combine ideas in the same way humans can. However, OpenAI is working to address this issue by updating their reinforcement learning practices to involve a wider range of input from various professions. The unique feature of machine learning models is their ability to explore latent spaces, which can yield novel ideas and creativity.Experts comment on the limitations of AI in recognizing specific patterns beyond its optimizing objectives, while offering some praise for its creative problem-solving potential. However, the capacity of AI to \"create new idiom[s], a new thinking, a new language\" is heavily debated due to its inability to imitate the process of making oneself an idiot, as Deleuze characterizes thinking. Some argue that those calling on AI to solve large-scale issues are 'moving the goalposts'. Regardless, the question remains on whether AI's ability to mimic language is truly creative or merely a product of diverse data points.The article discusses the limitations of language models and their creativity compared to human creativity, emphasizing the role of discovery in creativity. HN users point out the inherent limitations of language models, which may miss or produce different results with varying variables, and raise concerns about the degradation of work due to humans' reduced creativity. Some users argue that language models can be creative to some extent, especially when given oddly specific inputs. The discussion also touches on the correlation between reading and creativity, noting that while learning more can lead to new ideas, it can also bias one towards specific ways of thinking.Experts' opinions vary on whether ChatGPT is truly creative, with one user suggesting that only humans are creative but ChatGPT can be seen as a tool used by humans to be creative with language use. Others pointed out that ChatGPT may not be creative with ideas and fails to reason about less well-established research. One user suggested that ChatGPT can be useful for cranking out text where quantity matters more than quality. Another user mentioned that original creative thought will become even more valued in a world where Large Language Models are widely influential. The deployment of LM-reliant technology adds challenges as it may run the risk of 'value-lock'.ChatGPT and similar models can learn through their plugin system by running scripts in a terminal, webcrawl documents or querying APIs. An HN user argues that ChatGPT is a multiplier of one's knowledge rather than an addition. Another user brings up the point that recognizing cats after a single photograph is not necessarily true for all. However, one-shot learning like HDC shows promise. Context drift is a phenomenon observed in older AI uploads. A story from 2020 about the dangers of AI has resurfaced, garnering reader interest.Researchers at Northwestern University have conducted a study on the degradation patterns of machine learning models over time, using datasets from industries including finance, weather, healthcare, and transportation. The study found models degrade over time and should be retrained on new data, with models in \u201cstable\u201d industries among the hardest hit. The research highlights the need to monitor models in production and create a \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d system to handle errors. The paper is published in a Nature-affiliated journal and has faced criticism for misusing notation and being biased toward superficial associations.",

Now, the only constraints to launch are technical issues with the rocket or its ground systems. SpaceX is expected to hold a final readiness review this weekend before deciding to proceed with a launch attempt.This could occur as soon as Monday. The company has a slew of road closures, temporary flight restrictions, and notices to mariners set up for April 17. The launch window is expected to open at 7 am local time in Texas (12:00 UTC). Backup launch opportunities are available on Tuesday and Wednesday.SpaceX has been seeking federal approval to launch the massive Super Heavy rocket, with its Starship upper stage, for several years from Texas. The launch site is located near the Gulf of Mexico, just north of the Rio Grande River, and surrounded by wetlands. After completing an environmental assessment in June 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration said the company must undertake more than 75 actions to protect the lands and wildlife around the Boca Chica facility.This week an official at the FAA, speaking on background, said SpaceX has been cooperative on those measures. \"So far, they\u2019ve done what they need to do with regard to environmental impact,\" the official said. The FAA has responsibility for safety around the launch site and during a vehicle's flight. It has worked through its procedures carefully and accommodated SpaceX as the technical design of the Starship launch system has changed.AdvertisementSpaceX is calling this Starship launch an \"integrated flight test.\" It is the first time that the massive Super Heavy rocket will have taken off and the first time both vehicles will fly together. Under the nominal flight plan, the Super Heavy rocket will boost Starship toward space and, after separation, attempt to make a controlled splash down into the Gulf of Mexico about 30 to 35 km off the coast of Texas. SpaceX will not attempt to recover the booster on this flight.In the meantime, the Starship vehicle will attempt to ascend to an altitude of 235 km and become \"nearly orbital.\" Starship's engines will shut down at 9 minutes and 20 seconds into the flight, after which the vehicle will coast for more than an hour before entering Earth's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. It will not complete a full orbit and is expected to make a high-velocity splash down about 225 km north of the Hawaiian island of Oahu. On the nominal timeline, this will occur 90 minutes after liftoff.Enlarge / Overview of SpaceX's flight plan for Starship's integrated flight test.SpaceXBecause this is the first spaceflight for both vehicles, SpaceX is keeping the overall flight plan relatively simple. For example, Starship will not reignite its engines upon atmospheric reentry, nor attempt to make a controlled reentry into the ocean. Essentially, the goal for this flight is to gather data about the performance of both the first-stage booster and Starship upper stage in order to begin recovery attempts on future flights.Super Heavy will be the largest and most powerful rocket to ever launch from Earth. However, SpaceX has taken an experimental approach toward developing this booster and Starship, so it is very far from a certainty that this flight will proceed without incident.ARS VIDEOHow Scientists Respond to Science DeniersREADER COMMENTS157WITHSHARE THIS STORYSHARE ON FACEBOOKSHARE ON TWITTERSHARE ON REDDITERIC BERGEREric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA, and author of the book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.

Just not having to bother with (filling) header tanks?I figured the flip would be easy to have as a step, given the previous suborbital campaign, even if the odds of getting to that point or succeeding completing it were small.So excited for this flight!The odds of success for all the steps leading up to the flip were small enough that SpaceX decided not to waste any effort on it, focusing all their effort on the earlier flight stages. Especially since B7/S24 will be flying with technology that is already obsolete and will be different on later flights (e.g., hydraulic controls to thrust vector the nozzles vs electric.) They already proved out the flip with SN15, but they would have had to rewrite the software given the hardware changes between 15 and 24.(edit to clarify)April 14, 2023 at 10:17 pmKen the BinSpaceX - Starship Flight Test - SH/SS from Starbase TX:Primary Day = Monday, April 17 at 12:00-14:30 UTC (07:00-09:30 CDT) (convert time).Backup Day #1 = Tuesday, April 18 at ~12:00-14:30 UTC (~07:00-09:30 CDT) (convert time).Backup Day #2 = Wednesday, April 19 at ~12:00-14:30 UTC (~07:00-09:30 CDT) (convert time).Hosted webcast:Spoiler content hidden.April 14, 2023 at 10:30 pmChannel Ars TechnicaBiomarkers, from diagnosis to treatmentTo find cancer before it strikes, look for the molecular cluesBiomarkers, from diagnosis to treatmentScott Manley Reacts To His Top 1000 YouTube CommentsTeach the Controversy: DowsingTeach the Conspiracy: GMOsHow Does That Work?: Rising sea levelsTeach the Controversy: Flat EarthersHow Does That Work?: Radiometric DatingHow Does That Work?: The Large Hadron ColliderWhat \"First Man\" tells you about Neil Armstrong, and what it doesn'tDelta V: The Burgeoning World of Small Rockets, Paul Allen's Huge Plane, and SpaceX Gets a Crucial Green-lightInside the International Space Station with Scott KellyChris Hadfield explains his 'Space Oddity' videoAstronaut Scott Kelly teaches orbital mechanics with Kerbal Space ProgramGo Inside the Aerodrome, Where the Future of Flight Takes ShapeThe soft future of roboticsSee the Gear the CDC's Disease Detectives Use in the FieldArs Technica interviews Peggy WhitsonThe Ice Age Secrets of White Sands National MonumentInSight Landing On MarsTalking Space and Robots with NASA's Terry FongMore videos\u2190 PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORY \u2192Related Storiesby TaboolaSponsored LinksElectric Companies Will Hate You for Doing This, but They Can't Stop YouLower BillSee Cheap Cars Near Phoenix Almost Being Given Away (See Prices)Cheap Cars | Search AdsWhy people are so passionate about Ka\u2019ChavaKachavaCardiologists: Burn Unwanted Calories?

SpaceX fans are excited about the company's recent FAA clearance as it marks the beginning of a new era in space exploration. However, discussions mostly centered around Apollo 13 mission, sharing cool websites and personal experiences.SpaceX is set to perform a Starship test launch today with the hopes of it surviving the water landing. Despite the waves being remarkable, aerial exclusion zones from the FAA could cause problems for the launch. The FAA regulations also mean that SpaceX has to limit the extent of what they test during the launch, and any potential crash could set back the company's entire schedule. SpaceX is putting on the brakes compared to its previous fast-paced launch schedule as it moves from a hardware-rich to a more traditional process, with heat tile iterations, launch tower refinement, and bureaucracy all causing delays.The comments section of the post discusses Elon Musk's Starship Rocket, with insights into its development, testing, and potential impact. An expert user explains that testing has slowed due to flaws in the Raptor engine that necessitated a redesign. Additionally, the government is not against SpaceX, despite confusion on the matter. The post does not cover a new technology but provides a behind-the-scenes view of the creation of an advanced transportation system. Testing must proceed with utmost caution due to environmental concerns and prohibitive costs of repairing damages to ground equipment, while a potential long-term benefit is landing and launching from the same point.SpaceX's Starship vehicle attempts to reach an altitude of 235 km for a nearly orbital flight but will not complete a full orbit and will splash down over the Pacific Ocean; comments discuss potential launch delays and a SpaceX sticker pack that features cats sleeping on Starlink antennas.",

    "content": "Tech experts are expressing growing concerns about the potentially disastrous effects of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3/4/ChatGPT, which is a vulnerability that runs applications based on LLMs with user input. While some argue that certain applications don't matter, vulnerabilities pose a problem for more advanced LLM applications, such as ChatGPT Plugins and ReAct pattern, which run API requests or execute generated code, among other things. Despite ongoing discussions about how to protect against prompt injection, no one has found a solution that guarantees 100% protection against this vulnerability. The possibility of data exfiltration, and concerns about SEO optimization hacking, similarly poses a risk to the development of LLMs.Prompt injection attacks can trick users into compromising their private data with creative tactics, but educating developers is the best protection against the issue. Simon Willison wrote about prompt injection to help developers understand the problem and encourage more discussion of the issue. OpenAI's GPT-4 provides a \"system prompt\" feature to prevent prompt injection, which can be tested with API access and OpenAI Playground. However, prompt injection remains unsolved, and recent developments in LLMs may increase the risk of attacks.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post discusses prompt injection attacks and how to prevent them in language models, which can be vulnerable due to unclear distinctions between data and instructions. Users suggest using out-of-band means, such as explicit special tokens or a one-bit neuron, to enforce a distinction between data and instructions. However, some argue that the problem is more complex and even seemingly restricted tasks like translation can embody a lot of computational tasks that induce capabilities in a model. Users suggest creating a honeypot and increasing security with additional honeypots or rotating prompts to protect against prompt injection attacks. There is still much to be discovered about how LLMs work, which makes it difficult to distinguish between instructions and non-instructions.An HN user shared their experience on how the Chat GPT handled a programming problem and produced python code with the data in dictionaries. It was able to adapt to the facts on the ground and tell that the instructions didn't quite match the data. However, an HN user pointed out that it might be challenging to add the ability to adapt without getting misled by an adversary. The conversation also touched on the difficulty of truly understanding LLMs and if a higher-level functional unit within the weights exists. Finally, the impossibility of using natural language instructions to LLMs could demonstrate that no true understanding is happening.HN users discuss the limitations of using natural language as a means to codify boundaries for language models like GPT-3, particularly with regards to prompt injection attacks. Some users suggest the need for annual security training for language models, while others propose the development of an ACL-aware model that would keep track of privileged vs. regular data during training and also track privileged vs. regular data in a prompt. The discussion also touches on the potential for humans to be talked out of following strict orders, particularly in high-stakes situations, and the possibility of eventually developing programming languages for language models.OpenAI's language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, according to Hacker News comments. One suggested solution, a stateless or immutable censor instance with an interactive instance, would not help. LLMs struggle to isolate input from prompts and users, with mapping choices providing the greatest potential solution. Despite the problem remaining a security hole and requiring further research, users also proposed the problem of achieving AI alignment more broadly, as high-intelligence models may become autonomous and damaging without proper development.AI safety and security concerns, especially around language models (LLMs), are gaining attention among tech experts. Some worry about the potential of bad actors exploiting poorly secured LLMs for malicious purposes. Developers are found to be inexplicably using AI in securing data, which could increase vulnerability. However, LLM prompt injection attacks, where users can introduce text that contradicts system commands or prompts, have been challenging to solve. OpenAI's upcoming model, GPT-4, supposedly has increased resistance to the prompt injection attacks. Still, some experts believe a 100% secure solution should be in place to address this issue.OpenAI's GPT-4 is capable of tasks that GPT-3.5 cannot perform due to better functionality whereas ParetoOptimal points out that GPT-3.5 is not reliable enough for work purposes. The article discusses potential vulnerabilities and prompts injection in LLM, where jmugan questions the logic of giving a random person access to an agent that reads emails, and tedunangst proposes a solution through checkpointing models. The comments explore other possibilities, including simonw's explanation of the challenge to detect prompt injection, and a specific example discussed by shagie. The post concludes with Eduard's confusion over the motivational example of prompt injection vulnerability.Researchers have warned that the latest advances in machine learning models have created new vulnerability points, such as the \"Prompt Injection\" attack, which manipulates AI outputs by injecting additional, unexpected instructions. Such attacks exploit AI models' lack of understanding and separation between context and data, and can trick downstream systems relying on the model's output. While techniques to prevent prompt injection exist, they require a combination of training data sanitization, de-obfuscation of injection, and code generalization, which commonly remain black boxes. Researchers urge users to treat prompt injection attacks as inevitable and treat the owners' internal prompts as effectively public data.Experts discuss the difficulties of prompt injection attacks on Language Model Machine systems. Suggestions, such as a second LLM, AI detection, or validating user input, were made. However, some believe that these solutions are inadequate, and the problem remains relatively unsolved. Some suggest building an AGI system or implementing a human prompt as a countermeasure, but their practicality is uncertain. Separating user data and system data on an LLM remains an unresolved challenge.",

The successful launch marks the beginning of an ambitious voyage to uncover the secrets of the ocean worlds around giant planet Jupiter.Following launch and separation from the rocket, ESA\u2019s European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, confirmed acquisition of signal via the New Norcia ground station in Australia at 15:04 CEST. The spacecraft\u2019s vast 27 m long solar arrays unfurled into their distinctive cross shapes at 15:33 CEST, ensuring Juice can travel to the outer Solar System. The completion of this critical operation marked the launch a success.\u201cESA, with its international partners, is on its way to Jupiter,\u201d says ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher. \u201cJuice\u2019s spectacular launch carries with it the vision and ambition of those who conceived the mission decades ago, the skill and passion of everyone who has built this incredible machine, the drive of our flight operations team, and the curiosity of the global science community.

Astronomer Galileo Galilei brought Jupiter into focus in 1610, observing the planet through a telescope for the first time and discovering its orbiting moons. His observations overturned the long-held idea that everything in the heavens revolved around Earth. Centuries later, Juice \u2013 which carries a commemorative plaque in honour of Galileo\u2019s discoveries \u2013 will see Jupiter and its moons in a way that Galileo couldn\u2019t even have dreamt of.Thanks to the legacy of previous Jupiter missions we know that three of the planet\u2019s largest moons \u2013 Europa, Ganymede and Callisto \u2013 hold quantities of water buried under their surfaces in volumes far greater than in Earth\u2019s oceans. These planet-sized moons offer us tantalising hints that conditions for life could exist other than here on our \u2018pale blue dot\u2019, and Juice is equipped to bring us one step closer to answering this alluring question.Exploring Jupiter and Ganymede (artist\u2019s impression)\u201cOver 400 years ago, Galileo discovered moons orbiting Jupiter \u2013 news that shocked the renaissance world and revolutionised humankind\u2019s understanding of our place in the Universe,\u201d says Carole Mundell, ESA\u2019s Director of Science. \u201cToday, we have sent a suite of ground-breaking science instruments on a journey to those moons that will give us an exquisite close-up view that would have been unimaginable to previous generations. Juice carries the dreams of anyone who\u2019s ever gazed up at Jupiter shining brightly in the night sky and wondered about our origins.\u201cThe treasure trove of data that ESA Juice will provide will enable the science community worldwide to dig in and uncover the mysteries of the jovian system, explore the nature and habitability of oceans on other worlds and answer questions yet unasked by future generations of scientists.\u201dThe Juice missionAccess the videoJourney to JupiterJuice is the last ESA space science mission to launch on an Ariane 5, in a long legacy dating back to 1999 with the launch of XMM-Newton, which is still in operation today, and most recently, the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope in 2021.\u201cWhat a magnificent demonstration of Europe\u2019s capacity to dream big and deliver results to match,\u201d says Daniel Neuenschwander, ESA\u2019s Director of Space Transportation. \u201cWe can all be proud of Ariane 5 for making possible missions like Juice and setting such a high standard for our new generation of launch systems.\u201dOver the next two-and-half weeks Juice will deploy its various antennas and instrument booms, including the 16 m long radar antenna, 10.6 m long magnetometer boom, and various other instruments that will study the environment of Jupiter and the subsurface of the icy moons.An eight-year cruise with four gravity-assist flybys at Earth and Venus will slingshot the spacecraft towards the outer Solar System. The first flyby in April 2024 will mark a space exploration first: Juice will perform a lunar-Earth gravity-assist \u2013 a flyby of the Moon followed 1.5 days later by one of Earth.Juice\u2019s journey to JupiterESA\u2019s spacecraft operators, technology engineers and mission analysts have worked exhaustively to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead on this adventurous mission.Shields will protect the spacecraft\u2019s sensitive electronics from the monstrous levels of radiation in the Jupiter system. Multi-layered insulation will keep internal temperatures stable while externally they may reach more than 250\u00baC during the Venus flyby and -230\u00baC at Jupiter.\u201cHundreds of millions of kilometres from Earth and powered by just a sliver of sunlight, we will guide Juice through 35 flybys of Jupiter\u2019s ocean moons in order to gather the data needed to bring scientists closer than ever to these compelling destinations,\u201d says Ignacio Tanco, ESA\u2019s Juice spacecraft operations manager.Operating in an extreme environment\u201cTo fly such a complex path from such an enormous distance \u2013 and vitally, to get Juice\u2019s valuable data home to Earth \u2013 will require precise navigation techniques, reliant on ESA\u2019s deep space antennas in Spain, Argentina and Australia, all controlled remotely from ESOC.\u201d\u201cWe are ready to steer one of the most complex missions ESA has ever flown to adventures in the jovian system,\u201d says Angela Dietz, deputy spacecraft operations manager. \u201cFrom flybys of Jupiter\u2019s moons over a period of two-and-a-half years, to the immense challenge of switching orbits from massive Jupiter to orbiting Ganymede, we\u2019ll be solving challenges at mission control that have never been done before.\"The secrets of JupiterAccess the videoExplore fartherGanymede, which is larger than the planet Mercury, is Juice\u2019s primary scientific target; it will spend around nine months observing the moon closely from orbit. Ganymede has a particularly intriguing characteristic in addition to its hidden ocean: it is the only moon in the Solar System to generate its own magnetic field. Only two other solid bodies generate a field like Ganymede\u2019s \u2013 Mercury and Earth.The effect is a mini \u2018magnetic bubble\u2019 sitting within Jupiter\u2019s larger one, and the two interact in highly complex ways. Juice will reveal more about the interior structure of Ganymede and in doing so will be able to determine how its core is able to generate and maintain a magnetic field. This will be key to understanding how the moon evolved, and the consequences for habitability.Inside GanymedeGanymede also displays a wide range of surface ages and features, offering a geological record spanning several billion years. This complements its \u2018siblings\u2019 \u2013 ancient Callisto, which may hold clues to early conditions in the jovian system, and young and active Europa, which vents water into space.\u201cThe scientific treasure that will be returned will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications on how we understand our Solar System and if there are potentially habitable locations beyond Earth \u2013 not just in our own cosmic neighbourhood but also well beyond in the vast number of exoplanet systems populating our Universe,\u201d says Olivier Witasse, ESA\u2019s Juice project scientist. \u201cIn turn, this knowledge will make us richer beings, learning more about ourselves, our origins, and our place in the Universe.\u201dAbout JuiceESA\u2019s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, \u2018Juice\u2019, is humankind\u2019s next bold mission to the outer Solar System. It will make detailed observations of gas giant Jupiter and its three large ocean-bearing moons \u2013 Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. This ambitious mission will characterise these moons with a powerful suite of remote sensing, geophysical and in situ instruments to discover more about these compelling destinations as potential habitats for past or present life. Juice will monitor Jupiter\u2019s complex magnetic, radiation and plasma environment in depth and its interplay with the moons, studying the Jupiter system as an archetype for gas giant systems across the Universe. Juice launches on an Ariane 5 from Europe\u2019s Spaceport in Kourou in April 2023. It has an eight-year cruise with flybys of Earth and Venus to slingshot it to Jupiter. It will make 35 flybys of the three large moons while orbiting Jupiter, before changing orbits to Ganymede.Juice is a mission under ESA leadership with contributions from NASA, JAXA and the Israel Space Agency. It is the first Large-class mission in ESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme.Exploring JupiterFor more information, please contact ESA Media Relations:media@esa.intLIKE",

HN users in the comments point out that a better propulsion system could have made the journey faster, but energy management was a constraint for the mission. One user points out that a slow journey means more science can be done at the destination, while others discuss the benefits of a larger payload and nuclear propulsion for interplanetary travel. An international agreement restricts nuclear reactors in space, but they aren't completely banned.The ESA's Juice spacecraft is set to launch in April 2023 to study Jupiter's moons, but previous failures remind us that space missions are not always successful. The discussion covers past mission failures due to issues such as engine separation and technological limitations. Readers also raised questions about the viability of direct solar energy collection on Jupiter, fuel stores in space, and the possibility of exploring Uranus and Neptune. Finally, some users jokingly suggest that the difficulty of space missions may help explain the Fermi Paradox.",

    "content": "Building production-ready large language model (LLM) applications is challenging due to limitations exacerbated by the lack of engineering rigor in prompt engineering. The ambiguity of natural languages could lead to silent failures and inconsistency in LLMs' outputs. Engineering rigor can mitigate ambiguity, and prompt versioning and optimization are essential to performance tracking. Cost and latency are also significant challenges in LLM productionization. Task composability that consists of multiple tasks and promising use cases such as AI assistants, chatbots, and search and recommendation are discussed. OpenAI is actively mitigating ambiguity, and fewshot learning is a common technique for prompt engineering.An article discusses the challenges of productionizing LLM applications using APIs like OpenAI, including cost and latency analysis. Latency is affected by output length, while the model's architecture may also impact performance, and APIs are unreliable. The article explores the benefits and considerations of prompting, finetuning, and prompt tuning in LLM optimization. Forward and backward compatibility are also discussed, as using a newer model may require prompt rewriting, and there is a lack of centralized knowledge in MLOps. Finally, utilizing LLMs for generating embeddings for search and recsys shows promise, with affordable cost and real-time generation of embeddings.The challenges with using OpenAI models such as non-robust prompt patterns and the need to update prompts as the model changes. Complex applications and control flows with examples of various tools and types of control flows. The need for unit testing and testing each task separately before combining them. Promising use cases of LLMs such as AI assistants, chatbots, programming and gaming, and talk-to-your-data applications for the enterprise.Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing various aspects of tech applications; for example, converting natural language input into queries and querying databases, synthesizing information, and generating SEO-optimized content. LLMs are also revolutionizing search and recommendation functions, allowing for the extraction of lists of relevant items and products for user needs. While LLMs possess a promising potential for a range of applications, some issues remain, such as ethical considerations and SEO algorithms unable to detect AI-generated content. Keeping up with the rapidly evolving field of LLMs can be challenging, but strategies like ignoring the hype, reading only summaries, and keeping up to date with the latest tools can help.",
