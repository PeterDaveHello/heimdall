Dan Garisto Twitter Facebook Email Pure crystals of LK-99, synthesized by a team at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany.Credit: Pascal Puphal Researchers seem to have solved the puzzle of LK-99. Scientific detective work has unearthed evidence that the material is not a superconductor, and clarified its actual properties. The conclusion dashes hopes that LK-99 — a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen — marked the discovery of the first superconductor that works at room temperature and ambient pressure. Instead, studies have shown that impurities in the material — in particular, copper sulfide — were responsible for the sharp drops in electrical resistivity and partial levitation over a magnet, which looked similar to properties exhibited by superconductors. “I think things are pretty decisively settled at this point,” says Inna Vishik, a condensed-matter experimentalist at the University of California, Davis. Claimed superconductor LK-99 is an online sensation — but replication efforts fall short The LK-99 saga began in late July, when a team led by Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim at the Quantum Energy Research Centre, a start-up firm in Seoul, published preprints1,2 claiming that LK-99 is a superconductor at normal pressure and temperatures up to at least 127 ºC (400 kelvin). All previously confirmed superconductors function only at extreme temperatures and pressures. The extraordinary claim quickly grabbed the attention of the science-interested public and researchers, some of whom tried to replicate LK-99. Initial attempts did not see signs of room-temperature superconductivity, but were not conclusive. Now, after dozens of replication efforts, many experts are confidently saying that the evidence shows LK-99 is not a room-temperature superconductor. (Lee and Kim’s team did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.) Accumulating evidence The South Korean team based its claim on two of LK-99’s properties: levitation above a magnet and abrupt drops in resistivity. But separate teams in Beijing, at Peking University3 and the Chinese Academy of Sciences4 (CAS), found mundane explanations for these phenomena. Another study5, by US and European researchers, combined experimental and theoretical evidence to demonstrate how LK-99’s structure made superconductivity infeasible. And other experimenters synthesized and studied pure samples6 of LK-99, erasing doubts about the material’s structure and confirming that it is not a superconductor, but an insulator. The only further confirmation would come from the Korean team sharing their samples, says Michael Fuhrer, a physicist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “The burden’s on them to convince everybody else,” he says. Perhaps the most striking evidence for LK-99’s superconductivity was a video taken by the Korean team that showed a coin-shaped sample of silvery material wobbling over a magnet. The team said the sample was levitating because of the Meissner effect — a hallmark of superconductivity in which a material expels magnetic fields. Multiple unverified videos of LK-99 levitating subsequently circulated on social media, but none of the researchers who initially tried to replicate the findings observed any levitation. Half-baked levitation Several red flags popped out to Derrick van Gennep, a former condensed-matter researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who now works in finance but was intrigued by LK-99. In the video, the same edge of the sample seemed to stick to the magnet, and it seemed delicately balanced. By contrast, superconductors that levitate over magnets can be spun and even held upside-down. “None of those behaviors look like what we see in the LK-99 videos,” van Gennep says. He thought LK-99’s properties were more likely the result of ferromagnetism. So he constructed a pellet of compressed graphite shavings with iron filings glued to it. A video made by Van Gennep shows that his disc — made of non-superconducting, ferromagnetic materials — mimicked LK-99’s behaviour. On 7 August, the Peking University team reported that this “half-levitation” appeared in their LK-99 samples because of ferromagnetism. “It’s exactly like an iron-filing experiment,” says Yuan Li, a condensed-matter physicist and study co-author. The pellet experiences a lifting force but it’s not enough to levitate — only enough to balance on one end. Li and his colleagues measured their sample’s resistivity, and found no sign of superconductivity. But they couldn’t explain the sharp resistivity drop seen by the Korean team. Impure samples In their preprint, the Korean authors note one particular temperature at which LK-99 showed a tenfold drop in resistivity, from about 0.02 ohm-centimetres to 0.002 ohm-cm. “They were very precise about it. 104.8ºC,” says Prashant Jain, a chemist at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. “I was like, wait a minute, I know this temperature.” The reaction that synthesizes LK-99 uses an unbalanced recipe: for every 1 part it makes of copper-doped lead phosphate crystal — pure LK-99 — it produces 17 parts copper and 5 parts sulfur. These leftovers lead to numerous impurities — especially copper sulfide, which the Korean team reported in its sample. Jain, a copper-sulfide expert, remembered 104ºC as the temperature at which Cu2S undergoes a phase transition. Below that temperature, the resistivity of air-exposed Cu2S drops dramatically — a signal almost identical to LK-99’s purported superconducting phase transition. “I was almost in disbelief that they missed it.” Jain published a preprint7 on the important confounding effect. On 8 August, the CAS team reported on the effects of Cu2S impurities in LK-99. “Different contents of Cu2S can be synthesized using different processes,” says Jianlin Luo, a CAS physicist. The researchers tested two samples — the first heated in a vacuum, which resulted in 5% Cu2S content, and the second in air, which gave 70% Cu2S content. The first sample’s resistivity increased relatively smoothly as it cooled, and appeared similar to samples from other replication attempts. But the second sample’s resistivity plunged near 112 ºC (385K) — closely matching the Korean team’s observations. “That was the moment where I said, ‘Well, obviously, that’s what made them think this was a superconductor,’” says Fuhrer. “The nail in the coffin was this copper sulfide thing.” Making conclusive statements about LK-99’s properties is difficult, because the material is finicky and samples contain varying impurities. “Even from our own growth, different batches will be slightly different,” says Li. But Li argues that samples that are close enough to the original are sufficient for checking whether LK-99 is a superconductor in ambient conditions. Crystal clear With strong explanations for the resistivity drop and the half-levitation, many in the community were convinced that LK-99 was not a room-temperature superconductor. But mysteries lingered — namely, what were the material’s actual properties? Initial theoretical attempts using an approach called density functional theory (DFT) to predict LK-99’s structure had hinted at interesting electronic signatures called ‘flat bands’. These are areas where the electrons move slowly and can be strongly correlated. In some cases, this behavior leads to superconductivity. But these calculations were based on unverified assumptions about LK-99’s structure. To better understand the material, the US–European group5 performed precision X-ray imaging of their samples to calculate LK-99’s structure. Crucially, the imaging allowed them to make rigorous calculations that clarified the situation of the flat bands: they were not conducive to superconductivity. Instead, the flat bands in LK-99 came from strongly localized electrons, which cannot ‘hop’ in the way a superconductor requires. On 14 August, a separate team, at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, reported6 synthesizing pure, single crystals of LK-99. Unlike previous synthesis attempts that relied on crucibles, the researchers used a technique called floating zone crystal growth that allowed them to avoid introducing sulfur into the reaction, eliminating the Cu2S impurities. The result was a transparent purple crystal — pure LK-99, or Pb8.8Cu1.2P6O25. Separated from impurities, LK-99 is not a superconductor, but an insulator with a resistance in the millions of ohms — too high to run a standard conductivity test. It shows minor ferromagnetism and diamagnetism, but not enough for even partial levitation. “We therefore rule out the presence of superconductivity,” the team concluded. The team suggests that the hints of superconductivity seen in LK-99 were attributable to Cu2S impurities, which are absent from their crystal. “This story is exactly showing why we need single crystals,” says Pascal Puphal, a specialist in crystal growth and the Max Planck physicist who led the study. “When we have single crystals, we can clearly study the intrinsic properties of a system.” Lessons learned Many researchers are reflecting on what they’ve learned from the summer’s superconductivity sensation. For Leslie Schoop, a solid-state chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey, who co-authored the flat-bands study, the lesson about premature calculations is clear. “Even before LK-99, I have been giving talks about how you need to be careful with DFT, and now I have the best story ever for my next summer school,” she says. Jain points to the importance of old, often overlooked data — the crucial measurements that he relied on for the resistivity of Cu2S were published in 1951. While some commentators have pointed to the LK-99 saga as a model for reproducibility in science, others say that it’s an unusually swift resolution of a high-profile puzzle. “Often these things die this very slow death, where it’s just the rumors and nobody can reproduce it,” says Fuhrer. When copper oxide superconductors were discovered in 1986, researchers leapt to probe their properties. But nearly four decades later, there is still debate over the material’s superconducting mechanism, says Vishik. Efforts to explain LK-99 came readily. “The detective work that wraps up all of the pieces of the original observation — I think that’s really fantastic,” she says. “And it’s relatively rare.” doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02585-7 References Lee, S. et al.

Pumps, MRIs, power grids, chips, etc. Great reminder what materials science can do to some underlying economics. reply hunson_abadeer 12 hours agoparentThis is precisely what put me off in these discussions. Not the idea that we might have found a room-temperature superconductor - that part was exciting. It&#x27;s the part where people confidently talked about its applications without realizing that they probably wouldn&#x27;t revolutionize CPU performance (Josephson junctions don&#x27;t seem to work well as non-cryogenic temperatures for reasons unrelated to superconductivity), power grid transmission (transmission lines are already pretty efficient and we already choose less efficient materials for cost), or energy storage (LK-99 would likely have a fairly modest current limit before it stops superconducting).LK-99 would have interesting applications, known and unknown, but we have a pretty good understanding of superconductors based on 100 years of practical research, and I find this kind of instant punditry pretty tiresome. reply raphlinus 12 hours agorootparentAmen. When someone does the math and adds up the winners and losers in all this, one clear winner will be this video from Asianometry, entitled The History of Superconductors (Before LK-99)[1]. It only lightly touched on LK-99 itself, but did an excellent job going through the actual science-based history of superconductors, covering in particular detail previous hype waves. A major point is that the YBCO superconductors, while an amazing scientific discovery, haven&#x27;t had revolutionary applications, and have only lightly displaced lower temperature (niobium-titanium metal alloy) superconductors in applications requiring generating strong magnetic fields, including MRI machines. For the curious, [2] goes into considerable detail on potential applications and challenges for HTSC in MRI.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wUczYHyOhLM[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5472374&#x2F; reply DennisP 9 hours agorootparentREBCO is revolutionizing fusion reactors. Several companies are using it to build tokamaks with the same performance as ITER, but in a tenth the size.REBCO supports stronger magnetic fields, and conveniently, tokamak output scales with the fourth power of magnetic field strength. reply kerkeslager 7 hours agorootparentprev> transmission lines are already pretty efficient and we already choose less efficient materials for costYou&#x27;re correct, and this highlights a problem I often see in discussions: \"efficiency\" just is a measure of benefit&#x2F;cost. Without knowing the units of benefit and cost, people aren&#x27;t making meaningful statements when they say \"efficient\". The important efficiency of transmission lines is capacity per dollar, not capacity per material, and no material requiring lab crystallization is going to be remotely competitive in capacity per dollar. reply trzy 11 hours agorootparentprevAccelerationism has become a religion for many people working in tech. Social media is teaming with John the Baptists heralding the next messiah. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is the curse of popular science websites hyping things up; most people, present company included, have no idea what the scientific language means - be it superconductivity, LHC results, or astronomic spectrography.So popular science wraps it in a \"what you could do with it. maybe. possibly.\" Or what it means. And commenters have latched onto it, but a lot is said with an air of confidence, of just-so. \"Oh uh, superconductors, conducting is passing electricity from one end to the next, super is like really good, uuh uh uh... I know, what about power lines from the Sahara to Europe so they can build solar collectors down there!\"Same with exoplanets, the actual science is \"yeah the luminosity of this star drops by 0.0003% at a cycle of 300 days and we&#x27;re getting some photons that indicate there may be hydrogen molecules\", pop sci turns that into \"EARTH-2 TEEMING WITH LIFE DISCOVERED, GENERATION SHIP WHEN?\" reply hardlianotion 32 minutes agorootparentFunny you should mention the solar connectors and electricity interconnections. There is a Morocco -> UK interconnector project that is underway right now.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xlinks.co&#x2F;morocco-uk-power-project&#x2F; reply drdeca 12 hours agorootparentprevI had heard the parts about \"probably wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal for CPU performance\" and \"probably wouldn&#x27;t be great for energy storage\", but I hadn&#x27;t heard the point about \"we use less efficient materials for power grid transmission than we could, because of costs\".I suppose I didn&#x27;t expect that we necessarily had like, the \"absolute most efficient that could be made\" (if that is something substantially more complicated at a materials-science level than \"some simple-to-make-alloy\"), but I hadn&#x27;t imagined that it was a substantial difference. (I think I had imagined that they were... copper wires with like, surrounding metal tubes, or something? I hadn&#x27;t thought much about it.)Could you either say, or give my a search term I should look up in order to read, a little more about the trade-off being made between materials cost and efficiency of transmission lines? reply svetb 12 hours agorootparentAm not the author of that comment, but the fact that comes to mind is that aluminum is used for virtually all transmission and distribution lines - for price reasons - even though copper has better conductivity.If we did discover a room-temperature superconductor, I suspect it would be a while before the cost to produce it in the bulk quantities required for electrical transmission are economically attractive compared to what’s already available. reply tsimionescu 11 hours agorootparent> it would be a while before the cost to produce it in the bulk quantities required for electrical transmission are economically attractive compared to what’s already available.Note that there is no guarantee that that would ever happen. Electrical resistance is not the only thing you need for something to be an economically efficient power line. While superconductors are by definition excellent in terms of electrical resistance, there is nothing to guarantee that they wouldn&#x27;t be too brittle, or too heavy, or too hard to mould into the required shape, or simply require materials that are too rare on Earth. And all of these would not be things that can just be worked around with better production processes or smart engineering - they would be fundamental limitations of the specific material, just like the low temperature requirements of currently known superconductors will never be improved with more research.So this isn&#x27;t a matter of when they would reach the point of being better economically, it&#x27;s also very much a matter of if they would ever reach that point. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll get lucky one day and find a material that is superconducting at room temperature and above, that is study and light and easy to make into wires and made out of abundantly available elements. LK-99 certainly wasn&#x27;t most of these things. Even if it had been superconducting, it wasn&#x27;t a good candidate for any of the other properties we want anyway, so it likely wouldn&#x27;t have been much better than other known materials for most applications. reply pclmulqdq 9 hours agorootparentThe pace of development of computing seems to have trained people to think in terms of \"when\" for science and engineering problems. The normal paradigm is to think in terms of \"if,\" and that aligns well with most non-computing inventions.There is a good chance that they never reach the exponential breakpoints that everyone likes to fantasize about. reply jonathankoren 6 hours agorootparentYeah. There’s a lot of wishful thinking about science and sciencing up solutions to the world’s problems — especially here. The fact is, most progress is slow, and even if there is progress, it’s not necessarily economical in either financial or energy perspective. reply Tuna-Fish 10 hours agorootparentprevAluminum vs Copper is not that simple. Aluminum has worse conductivity for the same area, but area is in no way fixed. And aluminum has actually better conductivity than copper for the same weight. You just have to make the cables a bit thicker. reply anamexis 9 hours agorootparentI think the relevant metric here is conductivity for the same cost. reply II2II 7 hours agorootparentIt may come down to cost, but other physical properties enter the picture. For example: thermal expansion is an issue for overhead power lines, along with how ductile it is.In other cases it is more important to reduce resistance, not so much because of the power loss but because of what the power loss means: the generation of heat that may be difficult to remove.Of course you can get around those problems at extra cost, but it is more than a straight up comparison of the material cost of the conductor. reply Joker_vD 11 hours agorootparentprevIn some desperate places, people would cut down aluminum power lines and sell them to scrapyards for some quick buck. But copper power lines? Those would be in a similar danger in many more places. reply pbhjpbhj 1 hour agorootparentThey steal buried copper cables in rural locations (UK) by attaching one end to a truck and driving off. Mostly seems to be communication lines. reply Roark66 4 hours agorootparentprevNot only in desperate places. I heard last year (or the year before) someone stole few km of train wire in Germany. Although to this day some people think it was a Russian sabotage rather than genuine theft. Previously (for example in Poland) I used to hear about things like this all the time until maybe a decade ago. reply elihu 11 hours agorootparentprevAluminum vs copper is a good example. Another is that we already do use superconducting transmission lines in a few places. We could do more of that, but presumably it&#x27;s expensive to install and&#x2F;or maintain otherwise we&#x27;d be using it everywhere. I&#x27;m not sure what the longest or highest capacity superconducting links currently in existence are. reply SamBam 8 hours agorootparentThat have to be kept cool with liquid nitrogen, so it would have to be pretty darn short. reply nathan_f77 4 hours agorootparentI wonder if we can use these superconducters on spacecraft and probes. Maybe we can place superconducting links on the outer hull of a spacecraft heading to Mars, or a probe heading into outer space. reply krisoft 1 hour agorootparentBut why? What is the problem you are trying to solve by placing superconducting links on the outer hull of spacecraft? reply RF_Savage 4 hours agorootparentprevCooling them would still be a problem. The sunny side might not be the best place for them.They might find a niche in some instruments in probes, but for wiring it does not make sense. The rest of the probe electronics don&#x27;t like being that cold. reply klempner 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re dealing with usecases that need to be cooled anyway, you may well be better off with the tradeoff of needing liquid nitrogen cooling and better insulation in exchange for entirely eliminating resistive heat. reply XorNot 8 hours agorootparentprevActually no: they have to be insulated well. People forget that it doesn&#x27;t actually take energy to stay cool, just to remove the heat. The issue is what&#x27;s your heat gain from insulation inefficiency per length - and it does get better then thicker your cable gets, because volume increases more rapidly then surface area. reply chias 8 hours agorootparentprevSilver is even more conductive than copper! reply dgoldstein0 7 hours agorootparentAnd gold too.Very expensive to build anything sizable out of it reply RF_Savage 3 hours agorootparentGold (2.44x10-8 Ω•m) is worse than copper (1.68x10-8 Ω•m), but better than aluminium (2.82x10-8 Ω•m).It does have excellent anti-corrosion properties.I wonder what kinds of alloys we will see in the potential future with asteroid mining and thus comparatively cheap gold. Imagine replacing lead with gold in industrial applications. Or the stainless steels with a gold component in them. reply yetihehe 41 minutes agorootparentProbably the most useful mtal from asteroid mining will be platinum for use in catalysts. replyMobiusHorizons 12 hours agorootparentprevWe frequently use aluminum wires with a higher thickness to make up for the lower conductivity as compared to copper. It’s not as simple as cost vs performance though, as aluminum is substantially less dense than copper. Gold and silver are also better conductors than copper, but of course are very expensive, and still have resistance. Zero resistance may be with it on some cases. For instance in projects that currently use high voltage dc it may be worth it due to safety and complexity wins, but that all would depend on how hard (expense and complexity) the superconductor is to deploy. reply cogman10 12 hours agorootparentprevThe crux of the problem for superconductors used as power delivery is the \"critical field\" problem. [1]Super conductors are superconductive to a point. Once that point is crossed they turn into regular conductors. (I&#x27;ve seen ~1A cited. For context, EVs charge at around 500A).To make them useful for power transmission, you&#x27;d have to up the voltage to insane levels to avoid collapsing the field.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Critical_field reply floxy 11 hours agorootparentSuperconductors have a critical current density (Ampere&#x2F;m^2) that varies with temperature and external magnetic field[0].

Those sites are like 99% trash that train their readers to distrust science when their clickbate articles don&#x27;t pan out. If I were conspiracy minded, I&#x27;d swear they exist to build out a mistrust in institutions. reply KSteffensen 2 hours agorootparentprevA large part of the energy loss in electronics happens in switch-mode Buck-Boost DC-DC converters, as I understand it mainly due to internal resistance in the components used and due to the magnetic field not being directed enough to transfer 100% power between two inductors.Would a cheap room temperature superconductor bring any benefits here? reply magicalhippo 19 minutes agorootparentFor \"normal\" DC-DC converters it&#x27;s the losses in the semiconductor switches and diodes that dominate[1], unless cheap inductors or capacitors are used.High-efficiency DC-DC converters often use a resonant tank circuit[1], which supports high-frequency operation and zero-current or zero-volt switching, which together significantly reduces switching losses.In such a circuit I imagine superconducting inductors&#x2F;transformers and superconducting capacitors could be beneficial to improving efficiency further.Keep in mind though that resonant DC-DC converters can reach 98% (or higher) efficiency already[3] with current tech.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.analog.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;technical-articles&#x2F;an-efficiency-p...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monolithicpower.com&#x2F;understanding-llc-operation-...[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1049&#x2F;iet-...

The amount of interest and excitement gave us the ideal amount of peer review&#x2F;reproduction. For the vast majority of things nobody even tries to reproduce it, and many of the publishers don&#x27;t even provide the tools needed to do so. reply godelski 15 hours agorootparentYeah, I agree that for the vast majority of things most people don&#x27;t try. Or at least publicly demonstrate that they tried (key phrasing). But it is also silly to think that 3-5 people sitting at a desk reading a summary of work can validate said work. Really they can only invalidate or specify that it is indeterminate, but neither of these are validation. Which that&#x27;s a key difference from the general public understanding of \"peer review\" (meaning journal publication).But it might also be worth noting that often reproduction happens behind the scene. People point to big works like that which comes out of CERN, LIGO, or other massive projects and state that such works cannot be replicated. But actually those have high rates of replication, which is why there are hundreds of authors on the work.For LK-99, people got to see a lot of what is typically done by grad students who never tell the public what they did (or even their community). That the communication between scientists is happening through preprints, email, twitter, and other methods that are not journal publications. Because science happens faster than the journal cycle. Most scientists are reading preprints, and letting the work dictate the signal of validity long before a journal can.But what I was alluding to, which you might have picked up on, is that the reward system we have in place (\"publish or perish\", h-index, journals, etc) are misaligned as they do not reward this cornerstone of science -- replication -- (typically discourages is) unless there are credible claims of breakthroughs of the highest kind. Maybe we should rethink this system, and I hope that the timing of this along with the other discussions of academic fraud can help people to question the system and metrics that we use to evaluate, and ask if they are actually aligned with the original goals. reply doctorpangloss 11 hours agorootparentprev> Because the truth is that our academic incentive structure has generally fallen out of alignment with the actual goals of science.Did it though?

A lot more.> Nobody published this, which is good, right?People did publish it, and many responses. They published on Arxiv. I think you are misunderstanding what papers are. Papers are simply a communication method between domain experts. The purpose of journals is to improve distribution and to provide a signal to help experts sift through the (possibly) large number of work. But you need question if they are accomplishing the goals. Do they provide more access than arxiv? Certainly no, arxiv is about as accessible as it comes. Do they provide better distribution than other modes? (colleagues, google scholar, semantic scholar, Twitter, etc) This is debatable and likely depends on your domain. Do they provide a useful signal to other experts? Also arguable and depends on your field. I&#x27;d say that the more papers&#x2F;yr in your field, the weaker the signal. THEN you need to ask if these benefits outweigh the costs. That&#x27;s both monetary costs from governments, corporations, and universities as well as the time costs to format the papers for the specified venue, deal with the back and forth with reviewers, and being a reviewer yourself. After you have considered the costs and benefits you can answer if these venues are good for science.> Max Planck Institute gave the most conclusive answer,Via \"preprint\"> And now, Mr. L and Mr. K will not receive funding for this material, because it decisively failed to publish, which is also good?Indeterminate.

When folks are saying \"believe in the science\", it also means to believe in the scientific method, which does include challenging observations and independently validating conclusions. A proper challenge requires coming up to the plate, proposing a challenging hypothesis to a given conclusion, and then going through the work required to test your hypothesis, documenting the inputs, the variables, and showcasing your outputs.What this doesn&#x27;t mean is the average human who does not like the conclusion producing a statement saying \"I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s real\", or even going so far as to cite data which could appear to refute the conclusion, are producing a challenge to the conclusion. They&#x27;re just stating an opinion. This isn&#x27;t designed to be exclusionary, but to ensure that challengers are going through the effort that the producer of the conclusion did.

I followed along on HN and there were plenty of posts by people who were giving LK-99 crazy odds of success, fueled in no small part by viral videos of outright hoaxes from pseudonymous \"researchers.\"It&#x27;s fun, in a science fiction-y way, to speculate on what a material with the supposed properties might have meant for the world, but the degree of skepticism that should have been applied was lacking for many.There&#x27;s a tendency on HN and similar forums to devour new developments - almost a fanaticism about learning the newest&#x2F;latest&#x2F;best before the general public.

But despite there being ~a week of LK-99 stories permanently on the front page, there wasn&#x27;t much of that (a little on the initial thread, and virtually nothing for the next several days)--and it&#x27;s not for lack of physicists commenting on the topic (in other forums)![1] I saw someone point out that, when you translate the units on the resistivity&#x2F;temperature graph, it is a worse conductor than copper at room temperature, below its claimed critical temperature. reply chefandy 15 hours agorootparent> One of the things I look forward to in an HN discussion is the comments of people who can collate expert opinions on the subject and surface these kinds of points in a more ELI15 kind of way.HN is full of subject matter experts on computing-- that is, software, and to a lesser extent, hardware-- beyond that it&#x27;s a mixed bag at best. Even as an interface designer, I see so much confidently presented and totally bogus pseudo-expertise on art and design here that it&#x27;s actually kind of funny, and that&#x27;s much more closely related to software development than physics is.

They often sound very highly biased, but there&#x27;s usually very good reason for that. Once in a lifetime there&#x27;s the event where some paradigm is overthrown and all the old scientists look a bit foolish because their instincts were to be skeptical -- but those instincts came through a lifetime of correctly being skeptical 999 times out of 1000 about wild claims in their field.This could be a teachable moment that could inform people about climate change, coronavirus and other scientific claims. If you want to disagree with experts in the field you really need to get off your ass, get off twitter and the blogs, and go do the hard work of understanding what the scientists actually know by reading the articles that they publish. They&#x27;re very often correct and their opinions hold more weight because they&#x27;ve literally spent their lifetime learning and thinking about this one thing. They didn&#x27;t start learning about superconductivity &#x2F; viruses &#x2F; climate last week and you need to do better than some showerthought or wishful thinking that you think proves your viewpoint.But we&#x27;re not going to do that because its only been a few days and we&#x27;ve literally forgotten about how much flak scientists were getting on here over skepticism towards the initial claims.And I had some of the most positively stupid arguments on here where people were trying to assert that scientific experts needed to express exactly zero bias because they were experts and held to a higher standard than the average moron with no experience who could argue whatever they liked.

You also really, really don’t want to have to retract a paper because you’ve missed something obvious. Retraction is a traumatic process even if you are in good faith.

And even if we found a way to do so, it might not have mattered at all if it only worked for the very low currents&#x2F;voltages in the original tests. reply dekhn 13 hours agorootparentI was talking about a hypothetical RTSC that was amenable to industrial scale, not LK-99. Even so, merely knowing that RTSC with poor properties existed, would lead to massive search of the nearby (and other) spaces for better properties.See the history of glass optimization- hundreds of years of poking around with terrible quality glass, then a revolution during the Schott era, to modern day Gorilla Glass. Or silicon- the initial transistor (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Replica-of-first-transist...) was not something you could shove into a missile, that took 15 years to develop. To today&#x27;s modern ICs which approach the atomic limits of semiconductor manufacturing.The hope is that the initial RTSCs will follow a similar path, obvious there no guarantee reply tsimionescu 11 hours agorootparentStill, if LK-99 had turned out to be an RTSC, that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily take us any closer to an industrial-grade RTSC. It could just as well be a false lead, an interesting material with some niche applications that would remain more of a curiosity than anything.RTSCs are not like cold fusion - as far as we know, they should be possible, so finding one would not upend science in some huge way. If the ones we find don&#x27;t also happen to have all the other interesting properties we need, then they may never have any significant impact at all. This is what seems to be missed.If LK-99 had been an RTSC, it should still not have been major news outside materials science research, since it wouldn&#x27;t have had any direct impact on the economy, nor any predictable pathway to one. Some other future discovery, if it ever happened, would have been the one that actually mattered. That potential future discovery may have built on the current work, but whether it would be 1 year down the line or 10 or 100 or never would not be knowable. reply dekhn 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s like you&#x27;re arguing with somebody different from me, who said something entirely different from what I said, while also agreeing with my unstated premise, and conditional language. reply tsimionescu 11 hours agorootparentMy point, which I believe contradicts yours, is that it&#x27;s perfectly plausible that 1000 years from now humanity knows about plenty of RTSCs and still chooses copper and aluminum for power transmission and sillicon for transistors etc, because none of the RTSCs are actually useful on an industrial scale - so RTSCs would not have any significant effect on the economy. Of course, the opposite is also perfectly plausible.I take your other comments to imply that finding one RTSC would prove or at least suggest that a path exists to some significant industrial usage of RTSCs down the line. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct, and I&#x27;m arguing about why I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct. Of course, I may have misunderstood your comments. reply dekhn 10 hours agorootparentI fully agree that finding an existence proof of RTSC could also fail to achieve anything, and even not affect rent at all- absolutely zero change in the two world lines.Let me rewrite my original sentence that bothered people, so it&#x27;s a bit clearer. Here&#x27;s the original:\"\"\"Room temp Superconductors, along with fusion, would affect the economy profoundly. What the exact effect on rent would be is hard to predict but under the \"post-scarcity society\" mental construct, having infinite energy at zero cost (amortized) would presumably make the price of housing change.\"\"\"Change \"would\" to \"could\" in the first sentence to make it conditional. Add an additional sentence at the end pointing out that house prices are complex and many factors influence them, and another pointing out that while sometimes we can achieve a property in a material, but fail to realize its industrial potential\".It does seem reasonable to posit that RTSCs, even if they failed to realize their industrial potential- could have an affect on rent. Rent is (to a zeroth order approximation) determined by a wide range of macroeconomic activities, and if we reordered our entire society around improving RTSCs, that could have indirect effect on the cost of housing.All of that was implicit in my original text- and I had hoped to make that clear- rather than making a strong statement like \"rent will go down if RTSCs exist\". reply tsimionescu 3 hours agorootparentSure, if you change \" RTSCs would change economy forever\" to \"RTSCs could change economy forever\", we are entirely in agreement. replymaleldil 14 hours agorootparentprevHow would room temperature superconductors lead to a post-scarcity society? reply dekhn 13 hours agorootparentmakes it easy to deliver power from huge centralized fusion reactors to the edge.

We barely understand what makes a material a superconductor. This understanding will improve, and we will do some more systematic studies. Or it might show up in some completely unrelated project, just by chance. It is very difficult to say when this might happen. All we can say is that so far we don’t think that room-temperature superconductors are a physical impossibility. So at least there is hope. reply jodrellblank 13 hours agorootparentprev> \"Now I have to walk back explanations I gave to various people and explain LK-99 actually isn’t special at all.

Much of it is either early (partial, erroneous, speculative) accounts of something that&#x27;s just occurred, speculation about something that might occur, or blather about an event that&#x27;s scheduled and programmed and has little opportunity for real surprise (though of course that slim chance is played for all it&#x27;s worth).If you step back and scan headlines a few days, or weeks, or years, after, you find that almost all of it comes to naught. (Not absolutely all of it, there is some real news, and occasionally a story grips and&#x2F;or surprises.)You can spare yourself a tremendous amount of cognitive and emotional strain and whiplash by waiting for the dust to settle. And possibly, cultivating a sense for what might actually be significant. (Early stories of a virus in a city I&#x27;d never heard of in China growing at 10x a week caught my attention quickly, as one reasonably recent example.) It&#x27;s possible to get caught with a normalcy bias, though being prepared to quickly revise your priors helps here.The LK-99 story reminded me a lot news that broke shortly after I&#x27;d first come online via the campus Unix network at uni: the Fleischmann–Pons cold fusion paper. There was a lot of excited discussion, and within a few days I had (courtesy of an FTP server --- this was not only pre-World Wide Web, but pre-Gopher, though we had Usenet) an ASCII-text version of the paper, something I excitedly wrote (via snail mail) home about. And ... after a few weeks ... it turned out to be nothing.Science, mostly, progresses relatively slowly. Big upsets are rare. Extravagent claims (in a hype-driven and grant-driven world) are increasingly prevalent (it was bad enough 35 years ago, it&#x27;s worse now).So this time &#x27;round, I scanned the headlines and some of the discussion, but mostly sat the story out.The generative-AI story (as another recent example) seems more substantial but still somewhat frothy. Though I strongly do expect that far more capable AI techniques could well emerge quite suddenly and to profound effect.But when you recognise that a story is largely speculation, especially if it&#x27;s defending a point of view (Business As Usual &#x2F; status quo or New World Order &#x2F; this changes everything, or many views lying betwixt and beyond) recongise many of them as strongly motivated and quite often weakly informed. reply havnagiggle 9 hours agorootparentprevHopefully your explanation gave others reason to want to fund more material science research. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting something to succeed, and understanding the potential impacts is good motivation to keep going (while following the science process). reply imchillyb 15 hours agorootparentprev> I will look like a god damn idiot.Pride isn’t a good look or smell.Try humility instead. You may not like to eat humble pie, but others love to watch that.Also, perhaps some introspection would give nuance to why being wrong bothers you so much. reply amelius 15 hours agoparentprevThis invention almost saved our generation.

If science focused on EXPERIMENTING instead of trying to be the arbiter of truth on how the world is, we&#x27;d progress much farther. Maybe there is a reason why it seems physics has been stuck for the past 50+ years... maybe it is a shift in culture, driven social media, the fear of being wrong, of being shamed by the collective, of using the improper labels, etc. that is holding everyone back. reply sorenjan 15 hours agoprevSixty Symbols released a video about this yesterday, and in it professor Philip Moriarty is less than impressed with the whole ordeal.

If anything, this whole episode (debacle?) reinforced the fact that science works and the process played out exactly how the scientific process should work:1. First, the paper was originally posted on arxiv, meaning it was a pre-print and didn&#x27;t go through any peer review. So the vast majority of comments I saw on it was \"Wow, this would be really cool, if it turns out to be true.\"2. Immediately many labs around the world started trying to replicate the results. And very quickly there were some negative results that came back.3. The thing that I think is so cool is not only did negative results come back, but from TFA people now have a very good understanding of why the initial analysis was incorrect. That&#x27;s great science.One may argue that this was really a failure in media communication vs. the actual underlying science, but if anything it teaches appropriate skepticism, especially when a report is initially published, without peer review, without yet being replicated, that ends with the sentence \"We believe that our new development will be a brand-new historical event that opens a new era for humankind.\" reply penjelly 12 hours agorootparentgood points.

Using htmx to effectively retrieve pushed content from the server is impeded a little by this, but I slotted in a tiny go app between nginx and gunicorn and avoided needing async he&#x27;ll without running out of threads. reply eddd-ddde 18 hours agorootparentprevThe other day I wrote an htmx extension for aws api.

It _does_ feel like a natural extension of html.To me, the only \"missing\" piece of htmx is a component model, but for anyone looking for that, htmx would pair amazingly well with Astro[1] which allows you to define and use html components without the runtime overhead of say Vue or React.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;astro.build reply toddmorey 19 hours agorootparentAlso: I think every project &#x2F; saas service should be required to have a footer haiku: javascript fatigue: longing for a hypertext already in hand reply fshr 9 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what you mean by html components. That&#x27;s kind of missing the point of HTMX, no? Most backend frameworks like Django or templating engines like Jinja2 have the concept of blocks or fragments so its easy to render out component pieces to send back to the frontend. If you combine that with the OOB options in HTMX and&#x2F;or the Hyperscript or Alpine libraries, then I&#x27;m not sure what you would gain by using Astro. reply pragma_x 19 hours agoparentprevThis is a great project, and reminds me a lot of where folks saw hypertext going many years ago.I have read a little of the website and picked through many of the online examples. One thing I did notice is the preference to update client state (DOM rewrites) based on server HTTP request responses containing full-blown markup. Does the HTMX framework provide concessions for client-side-only triggers and client generated content?The reason why I ask is that an advantage of the current crop of JS heavy-client frameworks is they offload as much work to the browser as possible. This can result in less resource use on the server end (e.g. data, CPU), which is a big deal for web-scale apps. Is HTMX able to meet these kinds of engineering goals or is the project intended to do something different entirely? I totally get that something like a Facebook client is not at all hypermedia oriented, but folks are going to draw the comparison anyway. reply recursivedoubts 18 hours agorootparentwe do have a client-side template extension:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;client-side-templates&#x2F;however, I would encourage most folks to use HTML as the network format: it typically isn&#x27;t much more CPU to generate the equivalent HTML string that corresponds to a JSON string (sometimes even less, as with tables)for pure client-side, htmx is largely hands off. We support an `hx-on` attribute to address the fact that HTML doesn&#x27;t support general `on*` attributes, but that&#x27;s itit does, however, emit a large number of events that you can hook into to extend things:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;reference&#x2F;#eventsAnd it plays well w&#x2F; scripting solutions like Alpine.js or, our our own scripting solution, _hyperscript: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperscript.org reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 17 hours agorootparentAnother benefit of using HTML is ease of progressive enhancement. If the default behavior of the server is to render a full HTML page, anyone hitting that URL directly will get the full HTML from the server with no additional back-end work. Additionally, if JS is disabled in the browser, links still work as traditional links. reply the_gipsy 18 hours agorootparentprevGenerating some HTML instead of JSON isn&#x27;t that much data&#x2F;CPU.

So instead of writing some JavaScript that looks for a specific element to attach an `onclick` event and subsequently makes an AJAX call then again searches for an element on the page to update with the result you can put some (very simple) HTMX code in the HTML directly and it&#x27;ll handle that sort of thing automatically; \"without having to think.\"It&#x27;s just a nice, convenient way of handling such things. The argument in the article is that \"this is how HTML should&#x27;ve been from the start\" because it lets you do some pretty sophisticated stuff just by adding some simple&#x2F;intuitive attributes to the HTML. reply nonethewiser 13 hours agorootparentSo my apis need to return html specific to the page its called from with the data embedded? I guess my apis would need different endpoints that return json for other clients. And different endpoints for the exact same data if they need to be displayed differently?

Would be great if all projects had such a thing! Htmx reminds me of tailwind in that you&#x27;ve created a set of attribute names and values that are picked up at runtime by a singular library. There&#x27;s no front-end build required, which is a Very Big Deal for most devs who don&#x27;t want (and shouldn&#x27;t have to) to mess with npm and webpack. It looks like the \"breaking point\" for page size is something like a small SPA - when it gets to big, make another SPA.Particularly for react&#x2F;vue devs I think the thing they&#x27;ll miss is the idea of a uniform, singular object representing global state that is rendered by a single function (defined hierarchically in your component codebase) into the UI. However, it must be accepted that this idea is very demanding in itself, resulting in lots of opinions and hurt feelings, and in addition comes with the weight of a front-end build (and all the confusing variation there).I don&#x27;t use it but I&#x27;m already a big fan.

You have every right to be skeptical or to avoid \"bleeding edge\" but to assume the whole thing is just a front to raise someone&#x27;s speaking&#x2F;blogging&#x2F;social media profile, to buzz in from nowhere and start off by declaring that it&#x27;s going to \"die\" is not the way to act if you \"genuinely want to know.\"Recursivedoubts has legitimately demonstrated he&#x27;s not a one-trick pony (previously built intercooler, concurrently building hyperscript) and he deals with skeptics like yourself dozens of times every time an HTMX article gets posted on this site (which all seem to go to #1, if that serves as an indicator of the library&#x27;s popularity). He handles himself with grace and patience and humor, far better than most of us would do.You don&#x27;t even state what your \"current approach\" happens to be in order for him, or anyone else, to provide you with a satisfactory answer. reply recursivedoubts 12 hours agorootparentprevno problem, i try not to take things personally online: i&#x27;ve said plenty of things that either were mean or came across as mean in my life, especially when I was youngeri think one of the strengths of htmx is that it isn&#x27;t really trying to change the paradigm to something brand new, it is instead going back to the original web paradigm of hypermedia and asking how HTML could have advanced within that paradigm, in contrast with the SPA paradigm that replaced itso less of a wild bet, with more known advantages and disadvantages replysilver-arrow 21 hours agoprevGreat news.I have had good success and a rewarding experience using htmx the past year. It has been so great in tandem with Clojure using hiccup for SSR.Once htmx clicks for you, you are almost left stunned by how simple and flexible it is. You can&#x27;t believe that this isn&#x27;t how HTML evolved to as a hypermedia. It becomes very obvious that this is how web development should have evolved. I hope someday that what htmx is doing through javascript becomes baked right into HTML and the browser clients.If you are mistakenly believing it is just some derivative of Angular or you are not grasping the significance of its advancement of the architecture of hypermedia, please do yourself a favor and read the excellent essays on their site; you will then truly understand what REST is and what the importance of real HATEOAS means: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;essays&#x2F;They also have a free book here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F;We made a costly wrong turn 10 -15 years ago by attempting to rebuild thick clients on the web with a JSON API architecture instead of expanding and enriching the new and powerful idea of the early web: hypermedia. reply afavour 20 hours agoparent> It becomes very obvious that this is how web development should have evolved.I have to disagree with that. I’m happy htmx exists and that it works for many but in my professional life I&#x27;ve found few cases where it&#x27;s the best choice. And that’s fine! It’s a wonderful thing that the web has been able to grow in so many diverse ways, there should be no one way it “should have evolved”.IMO this is the biggest mistake in web dev in the last decade or so: that there should be One Right Way. No matter if you’re making the next Gmail or if you’re making a static blog the cargo cult of an industry tells you it should all be done the same way when common sense would tell you that’s not the case at all. reply dgb23 19 hours agorootparentI fully agree with you. I&#x27;m a fan of htmx, can recommend it and have used it in some projects by now. But...For one, htmx is not a full solution to avoid JS. It&#x27;s excellent for the parts that are AJAX&#x2F;CRUD, which certainly covers a lot of ground. You still need something more if you&#x27;re doing stuff that doesn&#x27;t fit here like interactive visualizations and many other use cases. However, it integrates very well with other lightweight libraries.Secondly, htmx is great if you&#x27;re developing full-stack (like GP). Meaning you touch every part of a site from the data model to coordinating messages to the frontend etc. If you want a much clearer separation between frontend and backend of a site, especially in terms of contributors&#x2F;teams, then it might not be the right tool. IMO there are plenty of good reasons to do either.Third, and this is a bit of a combination of the first two points, if you directly fetch data from a third party, say a JSON API, then htmx doesn&#x27;t help you at all.So really as you said, there is no one right way. For me it has been working very well though. People should look into it for sure though. There&#x27;s an opportunity to combine htmx with orthogonal libraries that do the dynamic parts like lit etc. reply silver-arrow 20 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s fair. I agree - that type of blanket statement is not helpful in the technical realm. I should have kept it at just: HTML should have continued to be expanded into what htmx is doing. reply Spivak 19 hours agorootparentI would have love to see rather than JS evolving to include HTML and CSS, HTML should have evolved to include JS and CSS as more first-class.Being able to write components in a single HTML file would be wonderful. reply grncdr 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve mentioned it here on HN before, but I&#x27;ve been using https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jhuddle.github.io&#x2F;ponys&#x2F; for this and I still think it&#x27;s pretty great. reply Spivak 19 hours agorootparentWoah woah woah. This is a game changer. reply giraffe_lady 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m kind of guessing &#x2F; reading into their comment here but. Using htmx doesn&#x27;t give me the feeling of \"this is the only way I ever want to do this\" but more \"if html worked like this I wouldn&#x27;t use js most of the time.\" The sense that an opportunity was missed and now we&#x27;re paying for it in complexity. reply gochi 20 hours agorootparentThe complexity is just shifted around from JS to HTMX (or hypothetically, html). Not a noticeable improvement. reply spinningslate 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not my experience based on two scenarios:1. Server-side rendered sites in Python using either Django or FastAPI&#x2F;Jinja2 and htmx;2. Dotnet back end with Angular front end.In practice - for the apps I&#x27;ve been involved with - option (1) provides a more than acceptable user experience. There&#x27;s no doubt Angular can go beyond the capabilities of SSR+htmx. But, in practice, it&#x27;s in the long tail. Throw in the odd js lib, e.g. for charting, and option (1) is good enough for the vast majority of things.The complexity is not comparable: (1) is much simpler. For a start, all logic is in one language. There&#x27;s no separate build for the front end and back end; no need to reconcile state in a front end cache with the back end. There&#x27;s no need to export every view as a REST API; it&#x27;s a native function that gets called from the view handling function.Others will have different experience: I&#x27;m not saying this is universal. But in my experience, objectively, it&#x27;s not true that the complexity moves from js to htmx. At least, not if that implies the complexity is equivalent. It&#x27;s just not the case. reply gochi 19 hours agorootparentNot sure you&#x27;ve solved the complexity when you&#x27;ve just slotted in another front to a general solution that is over-engineered. You could have replaced either scenarios with a single NextJS or SvelteKit solution. Go above and beyond in \"complexity\", write your Node backend (keeping it one language, JavaScript), and use vanilla HTML and JS to consume that.To me, htmx isn&#x27;t as revolutionary as people make it out to be, and possibly that&#x27;s due to the fact I&#x27;m just not burdened by the old days of gigantic Angular apps and massive ASP.Net stacks. My history was mostly JQuery where needed (which was all the time before JS got its act together). reply adamckay 15 hours agorootparent> My history was mostly JQuery where needed (which was all the time before JS got its act together).htmx should remind you of those times.I certainly has for me - it&#x27;s just (fundamentally) a fancy and clever wrapper around jQuery ajax requests made via HTML attributes. reply sznio 2 hours agorootparentprev> You could have replaced either scenarios with a single NextJS or SvelteKit solution.But then I would be using only JS.

Client-side state management. Client-side input validation. Fallbacks for when data hasn&#x27;t been loaded yet. Less async-based code, less coordination-required and event-driven code (this stuff happens but much easier and often code-free with HTMX).Its not a fit for every site or use case but more than any other front-end tool or library or framework, it has enabled me to actually realize the UI concepts in my head to the actual screen, and usually a lot quicker than I&#x27;d expect. reply rakoo 19 hours agorootparentprevWith JS you must use JS or TS and the steam factory that comes with it.

The idea is to generate HTML on the backend, instead of using a front-end framework to generate HTML on the client from an API call.You can also do the same in Node if you want to, I currently have a TS website that is mostly templated HTML in production (without htmx). Htmx would be perfect for that site. reply CharlesW 16 hours agorootparent> Much of your business logic can live in the backend, and it keeps your frontend really tiny.Ah, so \"with htmx you can use any language\" is true because its users are no longer using a programming language per se for the front-end, but instead are defining logic with htmx&#x27;s DSL? reply rakoo 15 hours agorootparenthtmx extends html to generalize a behaviour that already exists, so it&#x27;s as much a DSL as html itself is a DSL reply CharlesW 13 hours agorootparentOr Vue, yes! (\"DSL\" wasn&#x27;t meant as a negative, I just didn&#x27;t know what else one would call htmx additions.) reply rakoo 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, but you still need to write the frontend code in JS&#x2F;TS reply wrapperup 17 hours agorootparentYep, indeed. But htmx can reduce that a lot (to 0 even, in some instances), which is why it&#x27;s really nice.There&#x27;s also WASM, which is slowly gaining steam, but it still isn&#x27;t a first class citizen like JS is. reply unshavedyak 19 hours agorootparentprevThe difference is those were already tools we were using. You _(hypothetically?)_ can&#x27;t eliminate the complexity of dynamic apps without limiting flexibility. However you can move the complexity in-band, to a domain you are already using and preferring.Plus, if it&#x27;s done right, you can get a lot of functionality while remaining No-JS friendly. reply Xeamek 19 hours agorootparentprevI mean, that literally the core concept entire field of programming: making abstractions to shift complexity around (else where) reply giraffe_lady 20 hours agorootparentprevFor many basic & routine web page interactions, I have not found that to be true. reply gochi 19 hours agorootparentI can only see that experience being true if you&#x27;ve never used jquery (aka the same shorthands you&#x27;re relying on within htmx and likely hyperscript). reply giraffe_lady 19 hours agorootparentMy frontend experience predates the rise of react etc. I have used jquery.The advantage of htmx over jquery is declaring the replace condition & behavior inline as part of the component. Conceptually this is easy to reckon with as a separation of concerns thing as well as a sandi metz-ish \"when would this code need to be changed\" thing. The html tag is responsible for its own update, and so its update is part of the html tag.Jquery does the same things but requires you to declare the behavior separately from the component, decide on & maintain abstractions and reuse patterns. And manage code organization so that for any updatable template code you can find the corresponding behavior declarations and understand their scope w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t other template code. reply thom 1 hour agorootparentMost of my experience using jQuery was on sites that required progressive enhancement, and the easiest way to do that was to create an htmx-style framework anyway. reply Spivak 19 hours agorootparentprevI think the biggest change from jQuery flows is that the behavior is attached to the elements themselves instead of a script over here poking at the dom from the outside. replyksec 20 hours agoparentprev>You can&#x27;t believe that this isn&#x27;t how HTML evolved to as a hypermedia.That is why I wish HTMX to be merged into HTML5 spec.

It has the same idea of sprinkling some attributes over HTML to make it dynamic for easy cases. There were many frameworks that started like this (Angular 1, Vue, etc), and after getting some traction they grew into full-blown SPA frameworks, because there is a real need for more difficult cases.If I had to pick an “Angular-1-like” framework, I would pick the one that clearly documents it’s boundaries and provides a clear way to use a mature SPA framework when there is a need to cross those boundaries. If anyone is aware of such framework, please share. reply recursivedoubts 16 hours agorootparenthtmx uses hypermedia, rather than client-side managed stateas much as possible, htmx tries to take HTML to its logical conclusion (from my perspective) as a hypermedia, rather than imposing other ideas on top of it reply criddell 14 hours agorootparentYou keep using the term hypermedia and I&#x27;m not certain what is meant by that term (I was thinking it referred to linked media). Hyper means over, right? So is hypermedia more about the environment media is in than it is about links? reply recursivedoubts 12 hours agorootparentyes, I prefer the term hypermedia over hypertext because it stresses the systemic nature of a hypermedia system: a hypermedia (e.g. HTML, a hypertext), a hypermedia client (e.g. a web browser), a hypermedia protocol (e.g. HTTP) and hypermedia servers.we have written a book on the topic here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F;you can read chapters 1 & 2 for an overview of what hypermedia is at a systems level:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F;hypermedia-reintroduction&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F;hypermedia-components&#x2F;As far as what the term _hypermedia_ means: it is a media, such as a text, that includes within it _hypermedia controls_. Those hypermedia controls allow non-linear branching and interactions with the media, hence the term _hyper_, that is, above, \"normal\" media, which is consumed passively.The hypermedia controls we are all most familiar with are anchors&#x2F;links & and form tags. htmx attempts to generalize the concept of a hypermedia control.The book goes into gory detail if you are interested in further exploring the idea. reply beders 13 hours agorootparentprevI think he meant just hypertext reply sesm 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes this ideology lead to significant technical differences from early versions of Angular 1 and early versions of Vue? reply sesm 14 hours agorootparentOk, I see, the idea is to render parts of the page on server and swap those parts on the client with things like: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;attributes&#x2F;hx-swap&#x2F;So it&#x27;s not really an \"Angular-1-like\", but more like Vaadin in JS. reply uxns 19 hours agoparentprevOut of curiosity, I presume you were working on the frontend part using Clojurescript? Have you used some kind of wrappers around htmx or just a simple js interop was enough? reply silver-arrow 18 hours agorootparentWe moved away from ClojureScript entirely. We just run a plain ole java uberjar with the Clojure&#x2F;ring&#x2F;hiccup&#x2F;Compojure spitting out the HTML with whatever htmx attributes and response headers we need. There are instances where we may need to sprinkle in some javascript for some extra dynamic things - which turns out to be very infrequent. Instead of sprinkling in the javascript, we have been using _hyperscript instead - love _hyperscript.Yeah, so moving to htmx has allowed us to jettison ClojureScript which just entailed too many parts. As a matter of fact, before going more htmx with our projects, we had moved away from ClojureScript to React directly. reply PaulHoule 19 hours agoparentprevI am happy with HTMX for my RSS reader. The issue with front end apps is, and always has been, the complexity of updating the UI after a user makes a change.For instance, inside an HTMX application, I just coded up a plain ordinary (no framework, no build system) that displays a count of how many characters are in a text field and also disables or enables a submit button according to that size. It&#x27;s 9 lines of code plus an attribute on the input. It might be less if I did it inhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperscript.org&#x2F;Immediately it faces the problem that there are two paths: (1) the initial setting of the length display (the field is pre-populated with text, I ended up setting it in the SSR) and (2) what happens when the text content changes.If you use signals or hooks or useEvent or lifecycle methods or whatever you always see a certain amount of awkwardness that stems from the above.Note I could have done the above with \"pure HTMX\" in that I could have had the event handler trigger a server round trip that repaints the text field and the submit button, it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as it sounds in performance, but boy it seems like a waste.I&#x27;ve built applications that were a lot like Figma, Photoshop, or Eclipse, where the user could update some data and it could have very arbitrary effects on the UI because the user is able to add and remove many different UI elements and in a case like that you need some system that can manage dependencies at runtime.React has revolutionized how people build widget-based frameworks, there is never going to be anything like Tk, Cocoa, GTK, WPF, Spring, JavaFX ever again, or if it is it is going to be influenced by React. There&#x27;s the awkward fact that React is overkill for the typical form processing and e-Publishing applications people write with it but it is not up to the task (without an additional state management frameworm) of applications like Figma.Personally I&#x27;d like to see a mostly declarative form processing framework with a sprinkle of scripting: before there was the iPhone there was WAPhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wireless_Application_Protocolwhich had a way to send multipart forms to the client. Something like that designed to work with a software factoryhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Software-Factories-Assembling-Applica...(one of the most visionary books of all time... the authors built an enterprise software development framework for Microsoft that was nowhere near as cool as their vision)or a \"no-code\" app builder could be great.I&#x27;m still trying to get my head around websockets. I&#x27;ve built some small demos that are awesome, like a program that controls the volume of my smart speakers and has the sliders move when I change the volume with the remote control. I really wish my RSS reader could update my \"favorites\" window as soon as I add a favorite in another window, but doing that efficiently requires answering questions all the way from the front end to the back end to the database. I&#x27;ll probably find a half-baked way to do it but it&#x27;s sad that I&#x27;m settling on a web application to have the limitations web applications had 15 years ago. reply PedroBatista 22 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been a HTMX fan \"since before was cool\"..Very happy for the recent attention and \"success\". Also enjoying the shitposting and backlash mostly from the front-end crowd who believe the Web was invented in 2013 and they \"made that city\". :)I&#x27;m biased since the time Backbone.js came around, I understood part of the pain but was moderately skeptical, fast forward to React with the young energetic bros building dead simple 5 page websites with a Rube Goldberg setup of front-end frameworks, I&#x27;ve cashed out my tech chips and never touched those things. reply mstade 21 hours agoparentMany of the ideas and concepts in htmx are things we worked on starting around 2012 at a top tier investment bank. Implementation details differ quite significantly, but the idea of hypermedia driven applications was core to everything we did.We unfortunately weren&#x27;t able to win hearts and minds around these concepts in the long run, and blog driven development (a.k.a. cargo culting) replaced our efforts. I feel somewhat redeemed now that HTMX seems to increase in popularity, it&#x27;s nice to see that we weren&#x27;t alone in thinking along these concepts.Of course, if the concepts were strong that implies my execution wasn&#x27;t, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t feel so good about it after all... :o) reply sodapopcan 21 hours agorootparentThis was a time when people were shouting \"separation of concerns\" without really understanding what that meant.

TheOneTrueWay! reply gedy 18 hours agorootparentI remember the issue to be also that managing UI state on the server side was a load issue that many places didn’t want to deal with (e.g. Wicket, etc). The vibe at the time JS client apps came out in my circles was \"thank God we can get rid of this UI stuff.\"That’s still an issue I have with HTMX, but I understand for simple use cases it’s fine.

A lot of the criticism to our approach was typically not so much that the ideas were bad, but that they were \"different from how everyone else does it\" and by everyone else they typically meant Facebook and Google.For example, global state management approaches like Redux were more or less incompatible with how we approached state management. We thought it was insane to build apps around the idea of global state stores (and I still do) but Redux became all the rage and eventually won the day. There was a lot of collateral damage as people then tried to shoehorn Redux everywhere. I left around that time, but hear that the cycle have repeated a few times since. Redux (and other tooling) didn&#x27;t work out as expected so wheels have been invented again over and over. It&#x27;s the way things go I guess, I don&#x27;t dwell too much on it.We probably could&#x27;ve done a better job at communicating why our approach was better, but ultimately we had limited ability to force anyone to use our tooling. There&#x27;s also a hiring aspect in there. As Redux and other libraries that were \"the thing\" started to make their way into job descriptions it became harder and harder to convince talent that they should join us, because we didn&#x27;t have that brand recognition and used in-house tooling. At some point you have to make trade offs and sadly top tier financial institutions aren&#x27;t necessarily known for leading the pack in terms of innovation. It&#x27;s kind of sad really.Anyway I&#x27;m not particularly hard on myself or bitter about it at all actually. The self deprecating jab about poor execution should be read as tounge-in-cheek really, I&#x27;m very proud of the work we did back then. reply SmellTheGlove 14 hours agorootparentprevNah, look at it this way:A good idea or a good product are never enough. You have to sell the product in order to have it be successful.In your situation, you were at a bank, so your TAM was roughly 1 enterprise (or maybe a dozen, tops, if divisions had federated or siloed tech). And your 1-to-a-handful of potential customers were probably of the large and difficult to change variety. That&#x27;s a huge constraint, and not landing it there doesn&#x27;t mean your idea was bad, it just means you weren&#x27;t successful in selling it and I&#x27;m going to tell you that you probably _couldn&#x27;t_ have been successful in selling it where you were, when you were there. I worked for your lazy cousins at the same time - big insurance - and had the same issues selling my own ideas internally, if that makes you feel any better.HTMX has no such constraints. It&#x27;s a decade later and the TAM is more or less everyone doing or preferring to do SSR.

It was a clean separation between front- and back-end.But Backbone was a bit sloppy, not very enterprisey, until Angular came around.Anyway, this string of web applications became popular (in my world) because it meant that we could separate back-end from front-end, and have one back-end (usually REST&#x2F;JSON) fueling mobile and web clients separately. That was it, that was why we built SPA&#x27;s, but by now that has been forgotten again.And in my world, it made sense because the apps were behind a login. But then They wanted to make SPA&#x27;s facing the internet, for things like webshops.

It&#x27;s still a thing and will probably never go away, regardless of which frameworks we have. I think it stems from people fundamentally misunderstanding our core web technologies and not realizing how easy it is to do what they&#x27;re doing without React or Next or Nuxt or what have you.In many cases I&#x27;ve worked with people who wanted to do the most trivial things in their UIs and they worked tirelessly and earnestly to implement it with React or Vue, but it was something that already exists in the Web API or HTML elements. Basic stuff like reinventing checkboxes. Or reinventing the button element by styling an anchor and altering its behaviour with JavaScript to submit a form.

I use Tailwind in my side project, and it is exactly as convenient as it sounds to write my styles directly into HTML rather than think of a class name, add it in HTML, switch to the proper CSS file (or create it if it doesn&#x27;t exist and make sure it&#x27;s part of the build step), forget what name I had decided on, check the original HTML to remember the name, then go back to the CSS file and write the class name and then finally within that block add my style. reply graypegg 16 hours agorootparentI’ve messed around with tailwind a bit now, and honestly I could never use it in even a moderately complex site without some sort of “component” framework.I think you’re talking about just serving a .html file for every page in a site right? Having all of your styles duplicated everywhere would be much more confusing than writing CSS (and having to invent one name per groups of common things.)IMO it’s only viable if you can create your own components. Which you will also have to give a name. reply tomnipotent 10 hours agorootparent> some sort of “component” frameworkIt&#x27;s implicitly expected you&#x27;re already doing so, such as web components or whatever your selected framework uses to abstract components.> Having all of your styles duplicated everywhereLocality is a feature. It&#x27;s much easier to jump into any random bit of HTML and understand what&#x27;s going on and confidently make changes without having to pull up multiple other files to grok the classes involved.Compression is going to solve most of the issues with repeating classes everywhere, and while not recommend you can still use something like Sass&#x2F;SCSS and Tailwind directives like @apply to separate classes into their own files. .my-class { @apply p2 mr-4 mb-2; } reply 3cats-in-a-coat 2 hours agorootparent\"Compression\" doesn&#x27;t solve change management, where you need to consistently change together things that are meant to change together. Intead of letting them fragment, diverge in millions of tiny ways until entropy takes over your project and kills it.Copy&#x2F;pasting, which Tailwind is so proud of, is to fork, and never merge. Let&#x27;s fork all the things. We end up with a bazillion little things and no coherence&#x2F;alignment between them. Hello, second law of thermodynamics.Quick detour: our universe is so organized, that inanimate matters forks, and animate matters looks at the forks and is trying to find ways to solve these pieces together into coherent systems by merging putting together, deduplicating, generalizing. Inanimate and animate are two opposing forces, increasing entropy requires no intelligence, decreasing it does. It&#x27;s no surprise Tailwind promotes lack of intelligence by saying \"copy paste bro, it&#x27;s good, turns out\". Because that&#x27;s who they target. People afraid of thinking. \"Oh no you gonna like have to name a class, that&#x27;s terrible\". Woah woah... rocket engineering territory here!For those starting to get back to their senses... they added @apply. But @apply is by Tailwind&#x27;s own admission \"like using CSS\". I&#x27;d add it&#x27;s like using CSS but with 1&#x2F;1000 the capability, unclear&#x2F;surprising precedence, and tons of extra steps&#x2F;indirection, because... you could&#x27;ve been using CSS, simply.And one more word about \"compression\". Do you know what you&#x27;re doing when you name a reusable case and put it behind a class, function, package, module, library? You&#x27;re compressing. So yes compression does solve issue of repetition, but intelligent compression (YOUR BRAIN) does this in a much better way aligned to your project&#x27;s needs, compared to, say, GZip. GZip can&#x27;t think for you. It can shrink things for transmission, but its only job is to shrink transmission. Your project still needs to evolve in time, and when you look at it... you&#x27;re looking at the repetition, not at the GZip.Or maybe I&#x27;m wrong, do you edit the .gz directly? Heheh. If so, I take all I said back.But compression, in the context of broader space (your project, your industry, your target audience, coworkers, customers) and broader time (project evolution, change management, new requirements adaptation, changing platforms) is your job. The job of intelligence. The moment a computer compresses better than you, is the moment you become useless. LLM is a form of compression, because compression relies on prediction of what&#x27;s next, whether it be what we desire is next (needs, desires, goals) or what is next regardless (outcomes, events, probabilities). When I tell an LLM \"code me a modern site\" and it does better than you (i.e. not using Tailwind, but with proper minimal CSS with well named classes), compression replaced you.^_O reply sedatk 10 hours agorootparentprev> think of a class name> forget what name I had decided onI think that&#x27;s not the problem with CSS, but with how you approach design. If you treat your design process as editing a document, and just want to \"Ctrl+B\" to bold necessary parts, yes, I&#x27;m sure Tailwind&#x27;s better. But, I can see how it could be a problem with maintenance and collaboration as there isn&#x27;t an agreed upon design language or a document structure.I understand that managing multiple files and going back and forth can be considered an overhead, but that&#x27;s a componentization problem, not a problem with CSS per se, and you expect to recuperate your losses with the time you gained when finding and fixing bugs. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no point in componentization. You&#x27;d have the same tradeoff when writing JavaScript code, for example.You&#x27;d encounter the same set of problems the moment you start refactoring your styles into Tailwind components. reply teaearlgraycold 9 hours agorootparentTailwind is meant for a workflow that uses components.

(e.g. you fill out a form and if you mad a mistake it redraws the form with an error message, otherwise it might render one of several different forms depending on what you filled out on the first form.)He thing about HTMX is that it really wants support on the server side. For instance, you might have athat gets drawn as part of an HTML page or that gets updated with new (s) via HTMX when you push a button. Similarly you might have a form that can be rendered as the only form on a page or that can be rendered as a modal dialog that is pulled from the server when you open the modal (as opposed to unhiding it.). Either way the code that draws the HTML fragment (both the template and any database fetching&#x2F;thinking) has to be runnable in more than one context. (Modal dialogs are so fun to implement with HTMX.)It’s something you can do in a situational way or that you could have a framework to help with, but it is part of the HTMX puzzle. reply matwood 21 hours agorootparentI wrote ASP then, and it worked fine. We also wrote our own htmx like handlers. The main reason that people forget is that js was just too slow on the client to really do anything. The only way to get performance was render pieces on the server and replace the client html.I remember having the server render js multi-dimensional arrays consisting of key and html snippet that client js could reference to do html manipulation more quickly.Good times. reply 3cats-in-a-coat 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure JS being slow was the reason. It&#x27;s rather lack of trust that JS can and should be used for such things, and the difficulty of mixing client and server logic together. You kinda want to simplify things and relegate JS simply the role of detecting an event and delegating it to the server for processing and injecting the result back.But JS, from the moment it was introduced, was quite capable of carrying out a great number of interactions. We tend to project our subjective beliefs on the objective world. We don&#x27;t see potential in JS and so we didn&#x27;t use it up to its potential.I recall working on a webshop back in the day that opened in an embedded IE in the app for a popular music company (so I had also full control over the browser engine and could rely on JS), and there was a complex system of discounts as you add plugins to your cart and so on, and I thought: I&#x27;ll use JS for this. And despite the discounts were verified on the server side, all my coworkers and my boss were intensely worried about me using JS for this, because I&#x27;ll make the store insecure, and this is a very noob thing to do and I shouldn&#x27;t be using JS for this. And... it worked fine. The tech was always capable of this, but none of then would&#x27;ve even TRIED, because they \"KNEW\" it&#x27;s not supposed to be done.Eventually the tide turned, but it turned to another extreme, that is even more BS now. Many websites load more JS code than they load images. Why? Because we subjectively believe the server is not capable of all the richness that JS can deliver. Basically we didn&#x27;t get smarter about any of this.We&#x27;re stupid and led by superstitition about the tech we use, we don&#x27;t really understand it, we don&#x27;t grok it. We go by fashion and trends. Most do. And that&#x27;s the danger of starting a stupid trend.

I knew what to do.Having had that experiment I tend to laugh at today&#x27;s Javascript frameworks because they work really hard but aren&#x27;t suitable for the kind of apps I built back then.Sometimes it seems there is a lot of \"lost\" technology in software like the production rules systems of the 1980s, CASE systems and Lotus notes from the 1990s, Google docs in the 2000s that are like Stonehenge or the Egyptian Pyramids seen from the state of programming in 2023. reply 3cats-in-a-coat 18 hours agorootparentEntropy creeps into everything, unstoppably, masked under the pretense of a sequence of individually logical choices.

Fermi paradox resolved.Sorry, poetic diversion. reply tracker1 14 hours agorootparentprevMost C#, .Net devs and even VBScript devs had very little desire to learn JS. Not to mention that prior to IE6 becoming dominant there was a lot of very painful variance between browsers. JQuery helped to normalize this a lot. Part of why the ASP.Net (and others) were modeled with a full server postback. It worked fine when the server was in a server room in the corner of the building you were in, over the internet on dialup, not so much. reply tracker1 14 hours agorootparentprevASP.Net is different than Classic ASP... ASP.Net had a \"WebForms\" model, where the default behavior was a postback with a rerender on a lot of handler actions. That also included a ViewState input attached to your page&#x2F;forms that was used for (re)hydration to handle change and other event detection. The use of viewstate with a lot of the component libraries at the time was pretty aweful. Not to mention feature&#x2F;browser detection was just plain wrong as Firefox started to gain traction, before Chrome.I can say I migrated away and mostly separated render&#x2F;js&#x2F;backend with ASHX handlers until MVC took hold. These days, I tend to prefer the modern SPA models for browser applications.

Doing that shared library approach seemed like a good way to scale out development across teams. It seems like it&#x27;s still alive and well over there. (also used at ING, Comcast, Vercel, and others)I still have hope that frontend will eventually turn back to web components now that HTML templates, Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and ES Modules are fully adopted. One of the problems is that this stack is foreign even to professional web devs that hail from React land. It&#x27;s weird because it&#x27;s native browser tech adopted by the W3C and painstakingly built into the browsers. Maybe it picks up after someone rewrites the react-dom internals to support web components and adds a new tooling layer over it?It&#x27;s not bad tech and web components are built into the platform of the web now so they&#x27;re not really going anywhere... reply peebeebee 21 hours agorootparentprevWebComponents are still very much alive. :) And LitHtml is a very nice wrapper around them. reply strangescript 13 hours agoparentprev\"The fact your HTML barely reads like HTML after Tailwind, and reads more like your file is corrupted is I guess not mentioned in the tagline.\"There are a ton of ways to solve this issue but most people just look at tailwind on the surface and go shitpost about it on social media.Its the equivalent of saying \"I wrote this 2k line program in one file, its so bad and disorganizedis bad!\" reply 3cats-in-a-coat 4 hours agorootparentYeah, ok.

It probably concerns other areas more than web dev by the way, but I would like to see more projects that not only build on top of the past experiences, but also remove the complexity from the solutions, instead of adding the features to deal with it. Achieve the same result with fewer layers, less code, less \"stuff\". For what it’s worth, HTMX looks exactly like the latter kind. reply nonethewiser 12 hours agoparentprevStyle attributes’ values being long doesnt make it any less html-like. reply AtlasBarfed 17 hours agoparentprevColdfusion may have been one of the granddaddies, which java&#x27;s JSP copied shamelessly.So many web revolutions touted as \"don&#x27;t use Java and all that big stack, instead use our SUPER SIMPLE stack called:\"Rails: wow did rails eventually encompass a massive stack of dizzying extensions options and frameworks.React: I laughed when I saw basically a full rewrite of various Java unit testing frameworks in javascript.But HTMX seems to get love that angular&#x2F;react&#x2F;etc never got from a HN front page perspective.I take a dim view of AI so far, but one thing it could be fantastic for is \"take this basic HTML application and write it in framework X\" so I can finally see a good comparision.The web framework landscape has needed a \"reference web app\" since the year 2000 where frameworks could demonstrate their way of doing rendering, layout, validation, forms, routing, error handling, data binding &#x2F; data retrieval, tables&#x2F;grids, media.

I understand amusement in people moving from one server language to another, only to recreate the same things they already had, because they could have just stuck with the original. But you can&#x27;t just stick with a server language when you&#x27;re writing an interactive web page.

Htmx feels like a divergence from the trend, and is worth thinking about.Htmx asks us a good question: “does the complexity of your work reside essentially on the server or essentially on the client?”The complexity for the vast majority of websites resides essentially on the server. Most of us are not building Figmas and Google Sheets. Most websites, even if heavily interactive, are just CRUD apps with pleasant interfaces. Frameworks like NextJS attempt to rectify the problem of overly complex clients by moving React to the server, but this often magnifies complexity rather than minimizing it.Wouldn’t it make sense to remove React from the stack? For complex clients, skip the DOM and JS with canvas and compiled web assembly. For complex servers, use some form of server-driven granular updates to the DOM.The problem I see with this approach is that although most complexity reside on the server for most websites, there are almost always a few high-complexity task that needs to reside on the client — image editing, real-time sorting&#x2F;filtering&#x2F;calculation, drag-touch gestures, etc.A hybrid approach is necessary. It isn’t good enough to allow compatibility. Although htmx and React can be used on the same web page, they need to be kept in isolation. But I’m not looking for isolation; I’m looking for fundamental integration.My ideal framework would allow for reactive granular updates to the DOM while also being tightly integrated with compiled web assembly powering complex client operations. I’d write all my code in a powerful language rather than JavaScript. My debugger would operate on both server and client because the difference between the two has disappeared. It would be true full-stack development — a single-stack application (SSA)Clojure + ClojureScript comes close to being an SSA, but only superficially.If ever there was a killer framework for Common Lisp, I think an SSA fits the bill. reply jonahx 17 hours agoparentAgree with your take.> A hybrid approach is necessary.This is \"the islands\" approach, as advocated by Astro, for example:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.astro.build&#x2F;en&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;islands&#x2F;This approach is consistent with htmx and friends, and we&#x27;re using it on an htmx project with simple vanilla JS for the pieces of interactivity.

Instead, it was... JACKIE SINGH AUG 16, 2023 1 Share When China's prodigious tech influencer, Naomi Wu, found herself silenced, it wasn't just the machinery of a surveillance state at play. Instead, it was a confluence of state repression and the sometimes capricious attention of a Western audience that, as she asserts, often views Chinese activists more as ideological tokens than as genuine human beings. Scroll down for my interview notes with Naomi Wu. From the bustling technological hub of Shenzhen, the pseudonymous Naomi Wu, who is also widely known as \"Sexy Cyborg\", emerged as a striking embodiment of DIY tech prowess and authenticity. Her presence graced my Twitter feed for many years as an avatar of idealized femininity who proffered creative technical innovations, typically of her own creation, to a delighted Western audience, myself included. Wu, 29, is unquestionably an expert, despite frequent public suggestions from anonymous cowards suggesting her particular physical form disqualifies her from being one. In fact, I would personally classify her as a modern version of a Renaissance woman given her unconventional style, lack of formal training, unique personality, and unusually wide range of interests and capabilities. Source: Naomi Wu/YouTube 💡 Curious about Wu's look? Watch this. As an example, here she is comprehensively breaking down the capabilities (or lack thereof) of a high-tech filtration mask in a manner which is likely to be beyond your understanding: Source: Naomi Wu/YouTube Wu's above video forced the mask's seller, computer hardware manufacturer Razer, to issue a public response to her findings and to \"remove all references\" to \"N95 Grade Filter\" from their marketing material. ...and here is a 2017 video in which she develops a custom hacking drone called \"Screaming Fist\": Source: Naomi Wu/YouTube Though Wu's technical acumen has always set her apart, and while yes, she also happens to be a beautiful woman, it was always her audacious authenticity alongside that unconventional cyberpunk aesthetic which garnered immense respect. Through her creative content and generous engagement with followers across various social media platforms (YouTube: 1.61m subscribers/295m views, Twitter: 248K, Instagram: 175K), she regularly shared glimpses of her life with her dogs and partner, all slipstreamed alongside deeply technical DIY content; her hallmark. Naomi's partner, Kaidi, belongs to the Uyghur minority, further heightening the vulnerability of their situation. I'm Ok!

But it is precisely her open embrace of the world, facilitated by global social media, that appears to have ultimately made Wu more vulnerable to state pressures. The way she managed the balance of championing her personal beliefs while circumventing overt criticism of her home country was nothing short of an art form. Wu's role in the hardware hacking scene has been pivotal in challenging stereotypes about who belongs in the tech world. Her presence confidently occupies the space she's carved out, one where authenticity and expertise are the primary criteria for recognition. However, her relatability might have exposed her to additional risks. Despite the challenges she faces at home, her success as a major tech influencer on the global stage seems to have placed her within her government's sights. Despite her primarily Western audience, Wu has consistently encountered unfavorable treatment from Western media, often tinged with misogyny. Notably, a VICE Magazine reporter appeared to consider outing Wu without her consent, potentially jeopardizing her safety by revealing personal information. In a separate troubling incident, the founder of Make Magazine was compelled to issue a public apology after insinuating that Wu wasn't a \"real\" human, a baffling assertion considering her substantial and well-documented contributions on YouTube. Naomi Wu's devastating July 7th tweet alluded to a pressure that had long been feared by many, yet optimistically hoped she could manage to avoid indefinitely.

Subscribe Now Conversely, a recent hoax originating from a social media account belonging to child influencer Lil Tay claimed she and her brother had died, and generated a rapid flurry of coverage. Source: Google News Could these be geopolitical hesitations standing in the way? Or merely some unfortunate oversight amidst the relentless news churn on the part of those outlets who previously covered her? The tech media's relative silence in the face of Wu's abrupt disconnection illuminates a disconcerting landscape of media acquiescence. The omission of her predicament by the media isn't just an oversight—it's a signal suggesting that a significant portion of western media may be increasingly compromised by Beijing's influence, finding themselves unable to criticize foreign policy, lest they rile the tiger and negatively impact their business. A key reason influencers like Wu are able to gain traction is because of the validation they receive from the public and media alike. Silence in such distressing situations can easily be misinterpreted as indifference. Furthermore, when cultural ambassadors like Wu find themselves precipitously exiled from public life, it sends a cautionary tale to those who might have once been emboldened to share their own stories. These conditions are exacerbated by an apparent and ever-tightening grip on information from inside China, and amidst these macro concerns lies an added poignant truth about representation and freedom of expression: Naomi Wu is not just a tech virtuoso; she is a living embodiment of resilience for a global LGBTQ community which is navigating increasingly restrictive terrains. Wu's pullback from the public gaze not only deprives the tech world of an icon, it also robs Wu's wider community of a valuable symbol of tenacity, hope, and self-love in the face of repressive state control. The relentless surveillance and censorship tactics utilized by the Chinese Communist Party are not unfamiliar to the global audience. The tragic predicament of the Uyghurs, a cultural and ethnic Chinese minority subjected to what many have called genocide, stands testament to the CCP's intent to tightly control the cultural viewpoints of its population by any means they consider necessary, even if brutal. Given these precedents, there is a growing apprehension that Wu's digital silence signals a new chapter in China's human rights transgressions–one in which the LGBTQ community potentially emerges as the newest target of state-led oppression, in keeping with global trends. Ying Xin, Beijing's LGBT Center's Executive Director, provided the statistic that only 5% of Chinese people identifying as LGBTIQ are \"out\" to their families, with an added 0.1% reporting being out in their professional lives as well. As described by Outright International: The LGBT community in China has experienced a period of tremendous change. Over the course of the past several decades, LGBT people have gone from being nearly invisible in Chinese society, to forming a vibrant social movement. Progress has been promising, but remains precarious. Discrimination and state repression are still pervasive, and advocates must navigate treacherous and ever-changing political waters. Strings of news celebrating progress – a court ruling against a clinic offering so-called conversion therapy, a campaign going viral, are punctuated by setbacks — the police detaining activists and shutting down events, censors removing online content, and policymakers snubbing calls for equality. Developments have been rapid, and full of twists and turns. In fact, one of the latest turns is the Beijing LGBT Center's closure by the Chinese government in May of this year. This move came even after the Center took the preemptive step of changing its name to minimize its association with sexual minorities, underscoring the length to which such organizations must go to adapt to an increasingly restrictive environment: total shutdown. The Beijing LGBT Center announced its closure today. Founded in 2008, the Center was a vibrant community space & a groundbreaking advocacy organization. Their team spearheaded pioneering research, and built networks of LGBTQ-affirming health & business professionals. 1/5 pic.twitter.com/mfZlpLrKSD — Darius Longarino 龙大瑞 (@DariusLongarino) May 15, 2023 Source: @DariusLongarino/Twitter Below is a rough translation of the Center's above statement, originally posted on their WeChat. Note the Center's use of a term, \"不可抗力\", which Google translates to \"force majeure\"; both an umbrella term and oblique manner with which to refer to a forcible circumstance outside one's control. Source: Google Translate What did the Center mean by \"force majeure\"? The reported reality is that nonprofit organizations supporting LGBTQ in China are unable to function without fear, as members often face police interrogations, personal property inspections, and intimidation, even if they leave the country. The government has increasingly accused such groups of collusion with \"foreign forces,\" emphasizing connections with countries like the U.S. and members of the Five Eyes alliance. As a result, many activists face demands like the prohibition of events, social media account closures, and bans on regular social and dating activities. The public space for the LGBTQ community in China has been steadily shrinking. Beijing LGBT Center shuttered as crackdown grows in China An advocacy group that served as a safe space for the LGBTQ community in Beijing has been shut down as part of a government pressure campaign against gay rights groups. AP Newstwitter As noted by the Associated Press: Police pressure on rights groups increased in the past few years, the activist said. Police often invited LGBTQ+ groups to “drink tea” — a euphemism for unofficial meetings that police use to keep track of certain targets. That used to happen in public spaces, but started taking place in private spaces, such as directly in front of activists’ homes. Police also started taking activists to the police station for these “teas,” the activist said. When I was able to speak to Ms. Wu about the \"tea drinking\" session (euphemism for police harassment), she sharply conveyed her sense of vulnerability due to the lack of interest in her stepping away from her popular Twitter account, stating, Literally the only thing that was keeping me online for the past few years was they were worried it would make China look bad if they cracked down on me. Now that they know that I could be dead in a ditch tomorrow and no one would give a shit or say a word I’m 1000x less safe here. Further emphasizing the complexities of her identity and the West's interpretation of it, she said, Having a real-life Chinese person posting here who does not 100% endorse every part of their China good/bad narrative makes it harder for them [the media]. Through Wu's lens, the nuances of her experiences become inconvenient wrinkles in a narrative Western media wishes to smooth out, one in which we prefer our subjects to be neatly framed, silent victims whose stories can be manipulated without pushback. Wu added, After years of doing this without anyone saying anything, on June 30th, out of the blue, they send plainclothes thugs to my house. Surprise! They were real cops. This event on June 30th was timed closely with events associated with a cybersecurity vulnerability report delivered to Tencent by researchers based at The Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto. This recent reporting, authored by Jeffrey Knockel, Zoë Reichert, and Mona Wang, addressed a serious, encryption-related vulnerability in Tencent's popular Sogou keyboard software, affecting 455m monthly users. data leakage from keyboard apps sounds like something @RealSexyCyborg was trying to raise awareness of for some years, especially as it relates to their usage alongside secure messaging apps — nobody (@imaguid) August 9, 2023 Source: @imaguid/Twitter While Citizen Lab's report was published on August 9th, the vulnerability itself was initially reported back on May 31st per the disclosure timeline. A presumed lack of response led the researchers to attempt another disclosure method. A month later, on June 25th, Tencent dismissed the report as a \"low security risk\" and mocked it as not \"exciting\". Source: “Please do not make it public” Vulnerabilities in Sogou Keyboard encryption expose keypresses to network eavesdropping/Citizen Lab According to Citizen Lab's report, Tencent changed their mind less than a day later and nicely asked the researchers not to make their report public: Sorry, my previous reply was wrong, we are dealing with this vulnerability, please do not make it public, thank you very much for your report. The researchers replied: Thank you for the update. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after July 31, 2023. As we can see, the vendor finally sat up and took official notice of this severe, privacy-affecting software bug on June 25th–only five days before Wu, who has previously tweeted about a vulnerability affecting the same Sogou software, was paid a visit by Chinese authorities. Wu explicitly drew this connection in my discussion with her: Five days after Tencent (Shenzhen) admits to the IME vulnerability, the Chinese person (in Shenzhen) who originally publicized it suddenly gets dragged in by the cops and forced offline. NONE of them could read English to see my account does not even make China look bad, it was all Baidu fucking translate and demands why I was talking about Signal and the keyboard Her account concluded with an unsettling revelation about the risk she would face if she were to continue tweeting: having already received two \"strikes\" from the authorities, a third could mean a years-long prison sentence. I had to sign and fingerprint a \"confession\". So, how could a security vulnerability in a Chinese mobile software play a part in Wu's recent warning from Chinese police? Wu herself had previously sent various public tweets obliquely warning about similar, privacy harming issues associated with the Sogou software in 2019, citing a 2015 report describing similar vulnerabilities. A particular concern she shared was that users of Sogou may decide to install Signal App to communicate, believing the app's safety profile to be broadly appropriate for many people. However, the eavesdropping and network fingerprinting risks associated with the use of a third party keyboard such as Sogou take precedence over Signal's security profile. Between those two, they are installed on 80/90% of Chinese computers and phones. This creates a major issue:https://t.co/ZcZpk04ce9https://t.co/UcxYrcWGlo — Naomi Wu 机械妖姬 (@RealSexyCyborg) November 22, 2019 Source: @RealSexyCyborg/Twitter This means Signal App cannot stop an input method such as Sogou from recording keystrokes and sending them back to its developer, as explicitly warned by Citizen Lab. 💡 China's National Security Law, established in 2020, empowers the government to access surveillance data from Chinese tech companies without the need for a judicial process. This grants authorities the ability to obtain private information whenever deemed necessary. It is possible that Wu's tweets about the issues in the Sogou software of which she was aware may have caught the attention of Chinese authorities who were searching for related information on Western networks. Wu's theory that her tweets about these vulnerabilities could have led to her temporary detention and coercion now seems entirely plausible. After 8 years of daily tweeting one of the loudest, most candid voices coming out of China has been deplatformed- absolutely no one gives a shit. I could be dead in a ditch- but we aren’t actually people, we’re just signs for people like you in the West to wave at each other in their ideological war. –Naomi Wu Subscribe Now Thank you for reading.

Wu refused to go along with China&#x27;s huge policy shift, from trying hard to contain COVID to giving up. She still takes precautions and has been plugging for UV sterilizers and HEPA filters. The government of China has been hassling people who still want to control COVID spread. It&#x27;s like \"return to office\" enforced by the cops.She had a previous visit from \"the authorities\", and wrote on Twitter, back on June 30th,\"I think the \"plainclothes cops\" who came to visit today and I told to fuck off were fake since they left when I threatened to call the real cops. That said, in the future it would be super helpful if whoever runs things could give me a contact point so if there is a real issue, I don&#x27;t tell them to fuck off.\"\"Personally, I think my uncensored rants and the fact that I get away with them makes us look really good, but if there are certain areas where things are delicate, I&#x27;m open to toning it down.

I originally supported her as that she was an enthusiast and talking about making things. However, she has a strong tendency to dramatize things and it&#x27;s very easy to get caught up in her net.Context: She started raking a maker site (I think it was instructables) about quietly dropping Chinese character support. She went a huge tirade that it was racism and it was intentional. I suggested that hey it&#x27;s probably a dumb product owner&#x2F;business decisions. Then she starts arguing with me that \"she knows tech.\" She then quote tweets me so she can target her audience against me also manages to call me a mansplaining tech bro. (And blocks me)Nearly everything she produced tried to focus it on getting attention, from 360 youtube videos to emphasis her sexual features, to selling 3d nude scans, overly dramatic videos to increase viewership. On top of that she&#x27;s snaps any any journalist who doesn&#x27;t cover her exactly how she wants: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Naomi_Wu#Vice_article reply cwkoss 3 hours agoparentHere&#x27;s the thread: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RealSexyCyborg&#x2F;status&#x2F;132928236969037005...She called it Sinophobic, not racist, which seems fair. In the most charitable light, instructables was apathetic about their Chinese users. I can&#x27;t imagine how bad their engineering org would have to be for this to be an unintentional change.I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re one of deleted replies so we&#x27;ll never know for sure, but from the tone of this comment I doubt your reply was respectful.(I&#x27;m assuming this is her quote tweet of you https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RealSexyCyborg&#x2F;status&#x2F;132936126856250982... - note that mansplaining is your word, not hers. Interesting word to try to put into her mouth.) reply boneitis 1 hour agorootparentI mean, looking at those tweets myself, i wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye at the receiver paraphrasing either one of them years later as racism or mansplaining, respectfully; sounds accurate to me (I guess, with their watered down meanings, since we get so much exposure to people trying to throw those words around at the drop of a hat)? Although, i can only see her side of dialogues.Regarding that exchange in isolation, I certainly offer my criticisms. Fwiw, I otherwise appreciate (heck, am a fan of, even) her approach to what she does and her participation in public discussions to offer her perspectives (notwithstanding all the commentary about state-imposed censorship on her public conduct up to this point); i just hadn&#x27;t seen any exchanges like that before. reply monksy 3 hours agorootparentprevYep that&#x27;s the one. I deleted my account after the takeover by Musk.That was quite a while ago. You&#x27;re right, apparently she didn&#x27;t say mansplaining, at least in that tweet she didn&#x27;t (not sure about the others I can&#x27;t see the full statement anymore). But the conversation we had was incredibly insulting to me, she ended up quote tweeting me to amplify her attack, and blocked me.

She works&#x2F;worked as a software developer for many years.Instructables used to support Chinese characters, and someone made a decision that broke that support and it got pushed to prod. (Did someone change the text encoding of UGC and migrate the DB without thinking about other languages?!) At best it was the result of incompetence and apathy.FWIW, it looks like instructables has Chinese character support again today. I bet her tweets played some role in getting that fixed. reply agos 1 hour agorootparent> > she doesn&#x27;t seem to understand prioritization&#x2F;feature cutting by businesses > > I think this is an incredibly patronizing perspective.

His claims about \"free speech absolutism\" are interesting, in the use of the word absolute (think \"L&#x27;État, c&#x27;est moi\") and subsequent statements about \"following the law\" and the resultant behavior.And, of course, his little trolincel fans are the perfect little army of toadies for these kinds of totalitarian governments... just waiting to denounce any \"enemies of the people\" (i.e., flag tweets so they may be passed on to House of Saud, CPC [CCP], etc.).Edit: It&#x27;s easy to see that this makes all of the craziness we&#x27;ve witnessed with Twitter, since the takeover, look less crazy. With this as a backdrop. That is: the bad deal is already done, but, some of the rationale and goals can still be salvaged.So, come in, get rid of anyone with a conscience, more experienced, more independent. Have NDAs in place (par for the course already, at \"MuskInc\", good cover), and a set of foreign indentured servants. The environment is perfectly transformed to extract THIS kind of value from the whole clusterfck. Plus, Elon gets to build his mythos further in multiple ways, including fostering further disgust in \"his enemies\".

The government showed up and told her to stop saying stuff, so she did. The problem is that the word has been diluted in contemporary usage.

Having a gun pointed at you isn&#x27;t nonviolent just because the trigger wasn&#x27;t pulled.Threatening someone to make them censor themselves is a means of censorship. reply jacquesm 42 minutes agorootparentI said &#x27;it goes beyond censorship&#x27;, that means that censorship is a part of it but that it goes well beyond that point.Here is the dictionary definition: \"the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.\"If we follow your logic then killing someone or jailing or intimidating them is censorship. But the bar for what is censorship is much lower than that. So if the bar for censorship is met by just targeting the media (for instance: youtube, to tell them to pull the account and not to let her back in) then that would be censorship and it wouldn&#x27;t require threats of harm or restrictions on movement. That&#x27;s active and possibly violent intimidation. Xi&#x27;s government gets a free pass from the West because (1) we like the goodies and (2) he&#x27;s not as bad as some of his predecessors. But meanwhile he&#x27;s a thug and his government is acting in very thuggish ways to achieve their goals and the casualness with which censorship escalates into other forms of abuse is telling.More telling is how apparently a fragment of the HN audience insists they see nothing more than the control of information. Trust me on this: if your internet connection is severed and&#x2F;or your online writings are officially erased that&#x27;s bad enough, having goons come to your house, threaten you and threaten your significant other that&#x27;s another level altogether.Censorship doesn&#x27;t require guns, does not require goons and in general doesn&#x27;t have a prerequisite of violence. But threats of harm, or being sent to a &#x27;reeducation camp&#x27; (I hate that term) especially in a country where people tend to just disappear aim to influence not just your writings and your media expression but your general behavior and serve to cow an individual completely, apparently successful. So censorship is only a sub-goal, and a minor one at that. This is all about behavior and coercion, hence the travel restrictions and targeting of groups of individuals. reply tbrownaw 9 hours agorootparentprevCensorship is not solely its most extreme form.

For example, if the perpetrator in those tweets had happened to be a high up&#x2F;protected government official, in the national party, well then I assure you that you would have seen some suspicious silence.Censorship in China is much more complicated than the false position that has been ascribed to me here, which would be \"nobody in China can be upset about anything\". reply seanmcdirmid 7 hours agoparentprev> People should remember this any time they see an influencer living in China who is highly critical of the west and yet suspiciously silent on issues within China.> The answer is, of course, that as soon as one of these influencers cross the line they or their family get threatened with jail time.Were any of us really ignorant of that?

They can both be biased in the way that media is biased, but one is actually not controlled by a single party while the other most definitely is (if you aren&#x27;t sure, check out the differences between CNN and FoxNews).China prefers the narrative that the rest of the world is antagonistic against it and out to get it.

I’m not American, either… reply mcpackieh 5 hours agorootparentprevA South Korean working for an American media organization, specifically called out as western, is a western journalist as I see it. The term \"Western\" is imprecise and should usually be avoided for this reason, but South Korea itself is often ranked among the Western nations in the economic and geopolitical alignment senses of the term. And it&#x27;s fair to say that any journalist working for an American media organization is a western journalist, in any sense of the term. Mentioning that somebody is from South Korea does not constitute a refutation of that person being a western journalist, nor do I believe that was the intention.In any case, the rest of palefaces&#x27;s comment plainly criticizes Sarah Jeong for doing the thing quoted: \"since her sexuality was outed by a Western journalist\" by sarcastically suggesting that Sarah Jeong should feel satisfied. Sarcasm is problematic, particularly in text, but I think in this case the sarcasm is clear. paleface&#x27;s comment provides details which substantiate the claims, they aren&#x27;t refuting it.Incidentally, I think your comment employs sarcasm too. But just to be safe, \"This makes sense\" is you being sarcastic, right? You think this actually doesn&#x27;t make sense?> I’m sure “anti white racist” isn’t any sort of culture war word salad.I am virtually certain that claim refers to this [quoted from wikipedia]:> \"In August 2018, Jeong was hired by The New York Times to join its editorial board as lead writer on technology.[18][19] The hiring sparked a strongly negative reaction in conservative media, which highlighted derogatory tweets about white people that Jeong had posted mostly in 2013 and 2014.[20][21][22] Critics characterized her tweets as being racist; Jeong released an apology,[23][24] saying that the tweets were meant to satirize online harassment toward her as a woman of color.[20][25]\"Whether or not you find the satire excuse credible, this incident is plainly the basis for the accusation of Sarah Jeong being racist. It may not be a perspective you agree with, I haven&#x27;t bothered to look up the tweets and their context so I don&#x27;t have an opinion one way or the other concerning Sarah Jeong actually being a racist or merely satirizing racism. But regardless of whether you agree with the claim it&#x27;s not &#x27;word salad&#x27; e.g. the incoherent speech of a schizophrenic. She would not have said her statements were satire of racism unless her statements could be reasonably construed as resembling racism. Satire of a thing will inherently resemble the thing, so teasing out the difference will be an exercise in subjective judgement. Tacitly accusing somebody of mental illness because you disagree with their subjective interpretation of ostensible satire is inappropriate. reply jrflowers 5 hours agorootparent> A South Korean working for an American media organizationThis makes sense.

    "originBody": "From portal!imurdock Mon Aug 16 06:31:03 1993 Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.development Path: portal.imurdock From: imurdock@shell.portal.com (Ian A Murdock) Subject: New release under development; suggestions requested Message-ID:Sender: news@unix.portal.com Nntp-Posting-Host: jobe.unix.portal.com Organization: Portal Communications Company -- 408/973-9111 (voice) 408/973-8091 (data) Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 13:05:37 GMT Lines: 86 Fellow Linuxers, This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new Linux release, which I'm calling the Debian Linux Release. This is a release that I have put together basically from scratch; in other words, I didn't simply make some changes to SLS and call it a new release. I was inspired to put together this release after running SLS and generally being dissatisfied with much of it, and after much altering of SLS I decided that it would be easier to start from scratch. The base system is now virtually complete (though I'm still looking around to make sure that I grabbed the most recent sources for everything), and I'd like to get some feedback before I add the \"fancy\" stuff. Please note that this release is not yet completed and may not be for several more weeks; however, I thought I'd post now to perhaps draw a few people out of the woodwork. Specifically, I'm looking for: 1) someone who will eventually be willing to allow me to upload the release to their anonymous ftp-site. Please contact me. Be warned that it will be rather large :) 2) comments, suggestions, advice, etc. from the Linux community. This is your chance to suggest specific packages, series, or anything you'd like to see part of the final release. Don't assume that because a package is in SLS that it will necessarily be included in the Debian release! Things like ls and cat are a given, but if there's anything that's in SLS that you couldn't live without please let me know! I'd also like suggestions for specific features for the release. For example, a friend of mine here suggested that undesired packages should be selected BEFORE the installation procedure begins so the installer doesn't have to babysit the installation. Suggestions along that line are also welcomed. What will make this release better than SLS? This: 1) Debian will be sleeker and slimmer. No more multiple binaries and manpages. 2) Debian will contain the most up-to-date of everything. The system will be easy to keep up-to-date with a 'upgrading' script in the base system which will allow complete integration of upgrade packages. 3) Debian will contain a installation procedure that doesn't need to be babysat; simply install the basedisk, copy the distribution disks to the harddrive, answer some question about what packages you want or don't want installed, and let the machine install the release while you do more interesting things. 4) Debian will contain a system setup procedure that will attempt to setup and configure everything from fstab to Xconfig. 5) Debian will contain a menu system that WORKS... menu-driven package installation and upgrading utility, menu-driven system setup, menu-driven help system, and menu-driven system administration. 6) Debian will make Linux easier for users who don't have access to the Internet. Currently, users are stuck with whatever comes with SLS. Non-Internet users will have the option of receiving periodic upgrade packages to apply to their system. They will also have the option of selecting from a huge library of additional packages that will not be included in the base system. This library will contain packages like the S3 X-server, nethack and Seyon; basically packages that you and I can ftp but non-netters cannot access. 7) Debian will be extensively documented (more than just a few READMEs). 8) As I put together Debian, I am keeping a meticulous record of where I got everything. This will allow the end-user to not only know where to get the source, but whether or not the most recent version is a part of Debian. This record will help to keep the Debian release as up-to-date as possible. 9) Lots more, but I'll detail later... Anyway, I'll provide more specifics in a week or so after I receive enough replies. Please, all replies by mail. I'll post a followup. If you wish to discuss this in the newsgroup, please don't turn it into a flamewar. :) Until later, Ian -- Ian Murdock Internet: imurdock@shell.portal.com The Linux Warehouse",

My first look at an OS produced by a collective of disparate developers was RedHat 5.0 in the late 90s. Linux HOWTOs were basically all the docs I had. I got a pppd to answer the phone and dialed home from my friends house. I was logged in as root all the time. fvwm was the pinnacle of cool.Debian changed all that. Local, top quality documentation. A community. Packages that had been hand crafted to work like the rest of the system. The friction disappeared and let me move freely around the OS discovering things. Imagine walking around LA and then someone gives you a car and a map — that was the kind of difference in quality of experience it gave me.potato worked. woody felt like the future. I ran it for years on my iBook G3 (which one of the DDs helped me set up.) To this day, “sarge” still feels like the ultimate next gen, so it’s funny to see it is actually pretty old. To me, sarge means “futuristic out of touch thing” because I waited for it for so long.Thank you all so much. reply TacticalCoder 14 hours agoparentI did my little part to help Debian: I ordered 100 CDs of Debian 1.1 (in 1996? 1997?) from the US to Europe, which I then shipped to 100 people in Europe (and even some in north Africa). I ran out of the 100 CD and ordered 30 more and by then it was already Debian 1.2!(my old memory may be failing: it may have been 1.2 then 1.3 and not 1.1 then 1.2)It was hard to get Linux distro for some of us back then: dial-up at best and otherwise we&#x27;d buy magazines or books that&#x27;d come with a Linux CD.I&#x27;ve basically been using Debian and derivatives since forever. Did a short stint with Red Hat and Fedora back in the days but came back to Debian.Before Debian I was using Slackware.And as you said: thanks so much to everyone who worked on Debian! reply antod 12 hours agoparentprevThat mirrors my first Linux&#x2F;Unix experiences in the late 90s. Except for a short go at OpenBSD for firewalling between trying Redhat 5.0 and ending up on Debian.Debian just felt so much more \"right\" to me than Redhat did back then, and I never really went back to the Redhat side of the fence. This was despite Debian having way less third party support for anything back then - it wasn&#x27;t really until Ubuntu took off that Debian (by extension) felt secure. Up until then, I always had a nagging feeling that the Redhat ecosystem would completely take over, and I would yet again have picked&#x2F;preferred the wrong horse in the technology world.A big thank you to all the Debian devs&#x2F;maintainers over the years. reply raxxorraxor 19 hours agoprev> 1) someone who will eventually be willing to allow me to upload the release to their anonymous ftp-site.

Despite the now present security threats in a more weaponized net, this even beats the most convenient drag&drop sharing site.> Debian will contain the most up-to-date of everything.Ironic that today it is the dependable system. Still flexible enough for development, but I guess priorities have changed.Debian is my favorite distro, it just always works for me. The author seemed to have a tragic life and made many stops at different companies, would have been interesting to hear his reaction to the development of Debian. I don&#x27;t know if he was still an active developer, Debian had many, many project leaders as far as I know. reply neilv 18 hours agoparentOf course, for anyone who wants up-to-the-minute Unstable&#x2F;Testing channel, Debian still has that as an option, but I&#x27;m with you on Debian Stable.When Debian&#x27;s APT network package manager happened, that was pretty new and unusual. Imagine hearing about a package, typing a shell command, and Debian probably had the package, and it was installing. (When I was using Red Hat before Debian, there was a set of Web sites that I&#x27;d have to use to find packages, in a way that now seems naive and reckless: \"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilvandyke.org&#x2F;lab-linux-1999&#x2F;#software\".)The package ecosystem is more mature now, and it turns out that Debian Stable almost always has what I need, so I still get the APT experience. (I even got the closed Nvidia CUDA stack from Debian Stable `non-free` repos, the other day, and it just worked. Maybe a little too easily and well, but that&#x27;s another matter.) reply antod 12 hours agorootparent> When Debian&#x27;s APT network package manager happened, that was pretty new and unusual. Imagine hearing about a package, typing a shell command, and Debian probably had the package, and it was installing.I think a lot of people who came to Linux later don&#x27;t fully realise how revolutionary apt was back then.I can still remember the pain of manually downloading rpms only to find it needed another one installed first or wasn&#x27;t version compatible with something else etc. reply ilyt 11 hours agorootparentWINDOWS STILL CAN&#x27;T DO THAT reply doubled112 9 hours agorootparentWinget with a huge \"sort of ish\".They tried, I guess. reply TacticalCoder 14 hours agorootparentprev> The package ecosystem is more mature now, and it turns out that Debian Stable almost always has what I needAt times it&#x27;s missing something I want but usually Debian stable is all I need. I don&#x27;t use unstable or backports: typically I either use Debian stable or I compile from source (like Emacs).Last little hiccup recently is the lack of support for JPEG XL in the latest ImageMagick shipped with Debian stable (if I&#x27;m not mistaken), so I&#x27;d need to compile it from source (haven&#x27;t done it yet but it&#x27;s on my todo list: I want to recompile \"losslessly\" all my JPG to JPEG XL). reply angled 5 hours agorootparentprevnwv!To this day, I still don’t quite get why so much of #linux was still using Red Hat at the time. Nat, miguel, the GNOME guys; the kernel guys; the storage guys. reply LanternLight83 11 hours agorootparentprevThis explains what freshmeat was; I hit it via google looking for an old scheme library, but the link&#x27;s long dead. reply macintux 15 hours agoparentprevI worked closely with Ian at Progeny Linux. He wasn’t an active developer on Debian at that point in time, although he was very technically savvy. reply TacticalCoder 18 hours agoparentprev> I don&#x27;t know if he was still an active developerAccording to Wikipedia he died in 2015:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ian_Murdock reply richardwhiuk 18 hours agorootparentI think the parent was wondering before they passed. reply echelon_musk 16 hours agorootparentprevThe use of \"was\" in the parent as opposed to \"is\" tells you that they are already aware. reply ilyt 11 hours agoparentprev> Ironic that today it is the dependable system. Still flexible enough for development, but I guess priorities have changed.Testing is pretty stable for something named \"testing\" and unstable is remarkably stable for something called stable. Well, except that one month every 2 years after release where all that was frozen for release gets unfrozen..And it being stable is not only important feature. The upgrades just work, better than in any other distro I tested (unless you make frankendebian but even then surprisingly often it also \"just works\". Slap unattended-upgrades package with some settings and you can basically forget it if it is just some service reply Doxin 2 hours agorootparentI honestly think debian does itself a disservice with calling testing testing. Testing is what any other distro would call stable, and stable is the sort of stable you need for running nuclear reactors and the like.How many people installed debian stable and bounced off because all the packages were quite old? reply clintfred 18 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately, he passed away in 2016. RIP Ian. reply avar 14 hours agorootparent2015, not 2016. reply glonq 17 hours agoprevMy first awareness of Debian was in a surplus electronics store in Rohnert Park California. A kid who bore a striking resemblance to Martin Short&#x27;s Ed Grimley character from SCTV brought a fat stack of floppy disks to the check-out and then proudly proclaimed that he was using them for installing Debian linux. Bless him. reply mr_sturd 15 hours agoprevEarly Linux is before my time in computing. Had to look up SLS - Softlanding Linux System[0] - thought it might have been something to do with Slackware.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Softlanding_Linux_System reply jzb 14 hours agoparentOther way around, really - Slackware was based on SLS. reply NelsonMinar 15 hours agoprevNice to see the key innovation described so well: \"The system will be easy to keep up-to-date with a &#x27;upgrading&#x27; script in the base system\"I don&#x27;t know that dpkg was the first such upgrade system but it definitely still is one of the best. And continues to be, many later imitators are not nearly as effective. A key part of that is all the work done in packaging so that the packages are maintainable and upgradeable, of course. reply seabass-labrax 13 hours agoparentI gave an online talk[1] about the history and future of package management last year that you might find interesting. It was very difficult to determine exactly what was the &#x27;first&#x27;; as is often the case with big ideas, the Linux community seemed to spontaneously decide that it was needed and came up with multiple solutions in the space of just a few years. Even the question itself is complicated, because software did not typically come with a clear &#x27;release date&#x27;, which it usually has now.Ultimately, the conclusion I drew from my research was that Bogus Linux[2] (which is still available, but no longer maintained) was the first distribution with a fully functional, system-wide binary package manager, but that Perl might have a had a functional package manager limited to Perl libraries in development or even in use by some in 1993 too.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framatube.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;uubjKne6swPQpJWiQLfqxd[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bogus.org&#x2F; reply NelsonMinar 12 hours agorootparentOh fascinating, thanks! Yeah CPAN dates to about 1993. CPAN in turn was based on CTAN (for TeX), which Wikipedia dates to 1991 or 1992. I used both systems in the early&#x2F;mid 90s and they were not very good. CPAN in particular had a penchant for deciding to rebuilding and reinstall everything, including the Perl interpreter.I assume the general idea is older, going back to at least the 70s and minicomputers or the like. reply oalders 12 hours agorootparentExcellent look back at the history of CPAN here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neilb&#x2F;history-of-cpan&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;history... reply ilyt 10 hours agoparentprevCertainly first that actually worked well. My current desktop was installed in 2007 and still just dist-upgraded to the current.That of course if packages are done well, but Debian organization process so far have been very good on quality. Different song with 3rd party packages of course... reply tuukkah 14 hours agoparentprevdpkg handles individual packages, while APT is used to handle dependencies and version upgrades. I recall using dselect as a predecessor of APT in the beginning, but I don&#x27;t know if it was part of the first release.EDIT: dselect was developed at the same time as dpkg and was initially considered a part of it, so in that sense it was possible to upgrade a system by using just dpkg: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dselect reply agumonkey 11 hours agorootparentIIRC deselect was ultra ambitious, but out of the missed target, apt emerged (sic) as a solid cornerstone. reply woleium 19 hours agoprevNamed after Deborah and Ian (Deborah was his girlfriend at the time) reply echelon_musk 16 hours agoparentI embarrassingly used to pronounce it as \"deebian\" before being schooled by a graybeard. reply joemi 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever said it aloud, but that&#x27;s how I always read it in my head. reply nicoburns 12 hours agorootparentprevI always assumed it was pronounced \"day-bian\" until I heard the above story of how the name came to be. reply fortyseven 14 hours agorootparentprevShit, I say it like that!

Ian should have picked a better name.Edit: corrected history of their relationship reply steppi 7 hours agorootparentWhile a college student, Murdock founded the Debian project in August 1993, and wrote the Debian Manifesto in January 1994. Murdock conceived Debian as a Linux distribution that embraced open design, contributions, and support from the free software community. He named Debian after his then-girlfriend (later wife) Debra Lynn, and himself.[3] They later married, had three children, and divorced in January 2008.[4]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ian_Murdock reply seabass-labrax 13 hours agoprevIf you&#x27;re using Debian, you can apt-install the debian-history package, which will put some nice HTML files in your &#x2F;usr&#x2F;share&#x2F;doc&#x2F;debian-history directory outlining the history of the project! reply HeckFeck 17 hours agoprevInteresting that they were called \"releases\" back then.

Was that word only used by BSD back then? reply darkwater 18 hours agoprevHappy 30th birthday, Debian! reply HankB99 12 hours agoparentHappy birthday Debian and thank you Mr. Murdock and all of the many devs and maintainers who have kept it going. reply stOneskull 8 hours agorootparentHear, Hear! reply pabs3 5 hours agoprevDebian&#x27;s celebratory blog post:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bits.debian.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;debian-turns-30.html reply ilyt 11 hours agoprevI now have 2 machines that are older than 13 years (one 2007, other 2010 install) and just dist-upgrade every 2 years. Ships of Theseus, both of them, everything replaced at some point.Started with Mandrake (now Mandriva), Red Hat 6 (NOT RHEL) that I got with some book, then Storm Linux that eventually got me into Debian.The thing worth nothing back then is that if you wanted to say, install a package with dependencies, you could do that in installer of Red Hat or Mandrake, but tools in the OS didn&#x27;t allow for that, yum only happened in 2002. So the first shock with Debian derivative was that I could just tell it to install package and it will find the deps. And it could uninstall those deps too! And UPGRADE WORKED!After Mandrake&#x2F;Red Hat it was like a miracle. I also liked the fact Debian kept it \"as vanilla as possible while still playing nice with rest of the packages, instead of... whatever the fuck RHEL was doing (without exaggeration we thousands lines of code of fixes for stuff in RHEL5&#x2F;6... that just went away when we moved to Debian as there it worked).Wonderful distro, can&#x27;t recommend it enough, especially on servers, slap unattended-upgrades on it and can basically forget it&#x27;s there. reply abhijeetpbodas 18 hours agoprev> 2) Debian will contain the most up-to-date of everything.Hasn&#x27;t aged too well, I suppose. reply rollcat 18 hours agoparentQuite the contrary, it aged extremely well. Debian testing&#x2F;sid is very usable on a desktop&#x2F;laptop; I&#x27;ve used it successfully in such fashion for something like a decade. Nowadays I do prefer a distro&#x2F;OS with a 6-month release cycle (like NixOS or OpenBSD), but as far as rolling releases go, Debian has always been great. reply abhijeetpbodas 13 hours agorootparentIt would have been fair to say it aged well, if the version which is currently called testing was their flagship version.For most software, the testing version gives you relatively latest stuff. But that doesn&#x27;t mean every software can advertise itself as being up-to-date.For debian specifically, I don&#x27;t think they recommend using the testing version unless you&#x27;re a Debian contributor&#x2F;tester.I&#x27;ve tried using Sid (desktop) in the past, but ran into several version issues while installing through apt. Didn&#x27;t try much to debug, and switched to stable. Been a happy user since! reply abhijeetpbodas 13 hours agorootparentAnd happy 30th birthday to debian! Really appreciate all the work and effort that has gone into it. reply Corsome 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat are the advantages of using Debian testing&#x2F;sid rolling release instead of a regular rolling release distro (say, Arch)? reply toyg 17 hours agorootparentDebian Sid is the original rolling release. Its advantage is is that you are on a rolling-release distro but it&#x27;s still Debian, so all the system knowledge you accrue will apply seamlessly to production Debian servers. Most rolling-release distros, on the other hand, are typically not used on production servers. reply JohnnyDoe737 12 hours agorootparentSid is not a rolling release. This is a common misconception.In preparation for a new stable release, it goes through what is effectively a package freeze. Maintainers are discouraged from updating packages in Sid in order to focus on the new release. So almost no new updates are uploaded to the repositories until Stable is finally out. reply ilyt 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not exactly a hard rule, just stuff maintainers do because it is far easier to still have normal flow of unstable -> testing for the freeze period, and keeping 2 (\"actual unstable\" + \"unstable on the way to the new release\") would be a big burden for maintainers. reply JohnnyDoe737 4 hours agorootparentCorrect. This is why I said “effectively”. At the end of the day, Unstable does run behind during the freeze period. Same for Testing, obviously reply dunno7456 17 hours agorootparentprevAlso, packages are tested in sid&#x2F;unstable and migrates to testing which then becomes the new stable when it&#x27;s ready.And packages are tested across releases, enabling one to dist-upgrade to a new version of the system easily. I think it&#x27;s piuparts that does this job of testing packages among themselves too. reply rollcat 17 hours agorootparentprevLike toyg says, I really enjoyed having a familiar working environment both on servers and on my workstation. When big changes would come around (like the transition from SysV init to systemd), I&#x27;d start getting hands-on experience early, and upgrade production with more confidence.Between testing&#x2F;sid&#x2F;experimental you also got the choice of running \"somewhat stable\" vs \"bleeding edge\"; I&#x27;d usually stick to testing (except around the freeze leading up to a release). reply type0 10 hours agorootparentMost Debian users are advised against using testing and should use Sid instead if new packages are neeed https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;debian-faq&#x2F;choosing.en.ht... reply brnt 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s irregular about Debian, and why would I use Arch instead of it? reply Corsome 13 hours agorootparentI rather meant irregular with regards to Debian Sid not Debian in general.Arch only has rolling release mode so everyone is using the latest (thus any potential issue in Arch will affect bigger % of Arch users) while Debian has stable and testing and I was wondering if that&#x27;d make Sid less stable for practical use (since \"it&#x27;s not stable\").I don&#x27;t want to start a distro war here, just wondering about some anecdata of actual distro users. reply type0 10 hours agorootparentAnecdata, if you aren&#x27;t advanced user with new hw, Sid might be more robust, otherwise Arch is superior in almost any way. I wish it wasn&#x27;t, I like Debian community more, it is less elitist. reply type0 10 hours agorootparentprevSid isn&#x27;t a rolling distro in a general sense reply emilsedgh 17 hours agoparentprevIt has aged extremely well.

Since you&#x27;re here...Debian won&#x27;t have snaps unless you install them, and they&#x27;re including firmware blobs in the default release now.

In 2022, n+1 published four reports (1, 2, 3, 4) from the war in Ukraine by the Russian journalist Elena Kostyuchenko. In the following essay, Kostyuchenko describes—for the first time—why she fled Ukraine and reveals that she was poisoned last fall in Munich. (The essay originally appeared in Russian on Meduza’s website and was translated by Bela Shayevich.) Kostyuchenko’s book I Love Russia, which includes her reporting from Ukraine and elsewhere, is forthcoming this fall from Penguin Press. I DIDN’T WANT TO WRITE THIS for a long time. I feel disgusted, afraid, ashamed. I can’t write about everything I know because I have to protect the people who’ve saved my life. On February 24, 2022, my country attacked Ukraine. On February 24, I went to Ukraine on assignment from Novaya Gazeta, where I had been working for the previous seventeen years. I crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border on the night of February 25. Over the course of four weeks, thanks to the incredible support of countless Ukrainians, I was able to file four stories—from the border, Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Kherson. Kherson was under occupation. Getting in and out meant crossing the frontlines twice. In Kherson, Russian soldiers were kidnapping and torturing people. I was able to find people who had survived being tortured. By collating their stories, working in the field, I was able to find where the kidnapped people were being held—a former temporary detention center located at 3 Teploenergetiki Street. I learned the names of forty-four kidnapped people and the circumstances under which they were taken. I published my article and handed over what I had uncovered to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office. The next place that I was going to was Mariupol. Mariupol was still resisting. There was active combat. On many days, there were no humanitarian corridors. The only occasionally passable road lay through Zaporizhzhia. It often came under fire, and, as you approached Mariupol, the Russian checkpoints began. Nevertheless, people traveled this road every day in order to try to rescue their loved ones from the city as it was being destroyed. Volunteers organized them into columns. I decided to travel with them. On March 28, I entered Zaporizhzhia. Waiting at the checkpoint, (the Teroborona were examining my passport and press credentials), I started getting messages from friends. “Assholes.” “Hang in there.” “Let me know if I can help.” That’s how I found out that Novaya Gazeta had shut down. Novaya had received its second warning that year from the state censorship agency, Roskomnadzor, which meant it could now lose its license. I’d been anticipating this, I’d been waiting for it from the moment of the incursion, but I couldn’t know how painful it would be. I decided I’d go to Mariupol anyway. Publish my piece wherever I could. On March 29, I was meeting with volunteers and the people heading to Mariupol to rescue their relatives. I found someone willing to take me in their car despite my Russian passport. We arranged to leave on the 31st. I spent March 30, the eve of our trip, in a hotel. I was trying to gather my strength. A colleague from Novaya called me. She asked me if I was going to Mariupol. I was puzzled: only two people from the paper knew I was going to Mariupol—the editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, and my editor Olga Bobrova. I said, Yes, I am going tomorrow. She said, “My sources have gotten in touch with me. They know that you’re going to Mariupol. They say that the Kadyrovites have orders to find you.” The Kadyrovites, a Chechen subdivision of Rosgvardia, were actively engaged in the fighting around Mariupol—they manned the checkpoints. I knew that. My colleague said, “They’re not planning to hold you. They are going to kill you. That’s been approved.” It was like running into a wall. I went deaf, everything went white. I said, “I don’t believe you.” She said, “That’s what I told them, too, that I didn’t believe them. Then they played me a recording of you talking to someone about Mariupol, planning your trip. I recognized your voice.” She hung up, I sat down on the bed. I didn’t think anything, I just sat. Forty minutes later, my source from Ukrainian military reconnaissance called me. He said, “We have information that an assassination of a female journalist from Novaya Gazeta is being organized in Ukraine. And all-points bulletin on you has been sent out to every Russian checkpoint.” An hour later, Muratov called me. He said, “You can’t go to Mariupol anymore. You have to leave Ukraine this minute.” But I couldn’t make myself go. The following morning, I woke up to messages from an editor at Novaya. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office and Roskomnadzor had sent them letters demanding they take my reporting from Ukraine down from their website, or else the site would be blocked. Novaya complied. Somehow, this was what crushed me. I started crying and couldn’t stop. Then rage came in place of the tears, and it filled my entire being. I tried to find another way into Mariupol, looking to bypass the Russian checkpoints. This path did not exist—there was active combat everywhere. The only road was through Zaporizhzhia, and they were waiting for me on that road. I was incapable of accepting my powerlessness. Rational arguments didn’t work on me. The only thing that stopped me from moving forward was thinking what would happen to the person who agreed to take me in their car. If I got killed, they wouldn’t be spared, either. On the night of April 1, I left Ukraine. I left in a very bad state. I had lice, mumps, and PTSD. My friends took me in, they passed me from hand to hand. My girlfriend Yana came from Russia, she took care of me, made sure I was eating and sleeping. I was planning on getting better, finishing the book I was writing, and going back to Russia. All of my work, my entire life, my mother and sister—they are all there. The worse the news from home got, the more I felt like I belonged there and nowhere else. I thought about how they were going to kill me. But the more I thought about it, the calmer I got. I feel stupid and embarrassed remembering what was going through my head. I didn’t know who had issued the orders, I referred to the killers as “them.” I thought that they’d probably made an emotional decision. The war wasn’t working out the way they wanted at all, everything was going haywire. And I had just gotten in and out of Kherson, right under their noses—of course they’d gotten upset. They started looking into what I was doing, found out I was going to Mariupol, which was, in its entirety, one giant war crime, and this was their diabolical solution for keeping me out of there. The distance between the last Ukrainian checkpoint and the first Russian one was a few kilometers apart—a no-man’s-land, not under anyone’s control. The Russian soldiers could have claimed that I’d never even made it to them. People are always disappearing during a war. Who knows, maybe it’d been the Ukrainian soldiers who’d killed me? I am a Russian journalist after all, and the Ukrainians hate Russians, as everyone knows. I thought, At least I’m alive, that is good. On the evening of April 28, Muratov called me. He spoke in a very gentle voice. He said, “I know that you want to come home. But you cannot go back to Russia. They will kill you.” I hung up the phone and started screaming. I stood in the street and screamed. A month later, we were able to meet. Muratov said, They’ll make it look like a hate crime. The people on the right hate lesbians and you’re a lesbian. Then I was working on my book. I wrote and only thought about what I was writing. There wasn’t room for anything else in my head and those were the best days. At the end of September, I got in touch with Muratov again. I asked him to find out whether I could return to Russia. He called me back several days later. “No. No. No.” I found an apartment in Berlin and moved there. On September 29, I began working for the website Meduza. We decided that my first reporting trip would be to Iran. I’d been there and I knew how to work there. I found people who would help me, got a visa, bought clothes. We decided that after Iran, I would go to Ukraine. Meduza asked me to submit the paperwork for a Ukrainian visa before I left. I COULDN’T FILL OUT AN APPLICATION or make an appointment at the embassy on their website—it wouldn’t let me. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs hotline told me their website was being attacked by hackers, and until they were able to deal with it, it’d be impossible. I started looking for contacts within the embassy. I got someone to agree to see me in their consulate in Munich. There is no justification for this, and there cannot be, but I have to say that I corresponded about my trip to Munich over Facebook Messenger. It’s not secure and I knew that. But I wasn’t in Russia, I was in Germany. I didn’t even think about the basic tenets of my security, the protocols I’d been following for years. On the evening of October 17, I traveled to Munich. I took an overnight train, traveling in a seating car. I took off my shoes, lay down on the seat, and slept. People walked past me, they’d knock into my feet. I kept sleeping. On the morning of October 18, I arrived. I went to meet my friend, tried to sleep, then went to the embassy. The staff there questioned me, asking what I was planning to do in Ukraine. They took my documents, but I still wasn’t able to apply for a visa—their internal system was glitching. We decided that I would come again another day. My friend picked me up at the embassy and we went to get lunch. We sat outside at a restaurant. While we were sitting there, two different groups of her acquaintances happened to run into us. They came up to our table—there was a man, and then two women. I thought, What a small town Munich is, it really seems like everyone knows each other. I went to the bathroom and came back. All I could think about was the visa—I was unlikely to get it, but what if it worked out? Then my friend took me to the train station. As we approached it, she said, “Listen, I have to tell you: you smell bad. Let me find you some deodorant.” She couldn’t find any. I remember I was shocked by what she said—she’s a very tactful person, and she would have never said anything if I hadn’t actually smelled terrible. When I got on the train, I found my seat and immediately went to the bathroom. I wet some paper towels and started wiping myself off with them. I was covered in sweat. The sweat smelled strong and strange, like rotten fruit. I sat down and started reading the manuscript of my book. After a while, I realized that I was just reading the same paragraph over and over and couldn’t move forward. My head ached. I’d gotten Covid three weeks earlier. I thought, Do I really have it again? I called Yana. I said, I feel unwell. I said, I hope it’s not Covid, how will I go to Iran if it is? I tried to get back to the book, but I kept feeling worse. My headache got so bad I couldn’t look at things anymore. I kept sweating, I went back to the bathroom and wiped myself off again. WHEN I GOT OUT AT THE TRAIN STATION, I realized that I couldn’t figure out how to get home. I knew that I needed to transfer to the subway, but I couldn’t figure out how. I considered going outside and calling a cab, but the very thought of having to find my location on the map in the app and figuring out how it corresponded to real streets terrified me. I thought to myself, this is too difficult a task, I won’t manage. I looked for the transfer for a long time. When I finally got down there, I burst into tears—I didn’t know what direction I was supposed to go in. Other passengers helped me. The walk home from the subway is five minutes. It took much longer. Every few steps, I had to put my bag down—it seemed unbearably heavy—and rest. On the stairs, I got short of breath. I thought to myself, This fucking Covid has really messed me up. As soon as I got home, I went to sleep. I hoped that I would feel better when I got up. But I only got worse. I woke up from a pain in my stomach. It was strange—very strong, but not sharp, it was like it was being turned on and off. I tried to sit up and lay right back down. I felt so dizzy, it was like the room was spinning. With every rotation, I grew more nauseous. I got to the bathroom where I threw up. I kept corresponding with the Iranians. I cried. It was supposed to be my first trip for my new job and now, this. The pain in my stomach kept getting worse. It was painful to even touch the skin. I barely slept those first few nights—as soon as I would drift off, I would be woken up by the pain. My head kept spinning whenever I sat down or got up. On the third day, it became clear that I was not going anywhere and that whatever I had wasn’t Covid. It isn’t easy to see a doctor in Berlin. I was only able to get an appointment on October 28, ten days after I became ill. It was a regular clinic in my neighborhood. The doctors—there were two of them—both immediately said that I had long Covid. “It can go on for up to six months. If you don’t feel better six months from now, come back.” But they did an ultrasound, too—all clear. They tapped on my stomach. I got them to do some blood tests. I came out of the clinic consoled—it was nothing, I’d get better soon. The blood tests came back bad. The levels of ALT and AST in my liver were five times above normal. They tested my urine. There was blood in it. The doctors stopped joking around. I was referred to another, more experienced specialist. She said that it was most likely viral hepatitis, which I had contracted during the war. We’ll figure out which one it is and then treat it, she said. The hepatitis tests came back negative. My symptoms kept changing. My stomach hurt less and I got less dizzy. But I was totally weak. My face started swelling. Then my fingers. I barely managed to take my rings off and could not get them back on again. My fingers looked like sausages. Then my feet started swelling. The swelling kept getting worse, I lost sight of my chin, my face was no longer my face. When I looked in the mirror, it took me a moment to recognize myself. Sometimes my heart would start racing as though I was running. Sometimes my palms and the bottoms of my feet would start to burn, turning red and shiny. Everything was exhausting. It was hard to go down the stairs. Sometimes, we would go out for fifteen minutes, half an hour, and I would get so tired that I’d have to go home. I stopped being able to sleep, no longer from pain. It was as though my brain had forgotten how to fall asleep. I’d lay there for hours trying not to wake up Yana, looking up at the ceiling and wondering what was wrong with me. My hepatic enzyme levels kept rising. There was still blood in my urine. I kept going to doctors. The doctors would come up with theories, test them, come up with new ones. Autoimmune diseases, acute complicated complex pyelonephritis, systemic diseases. Meduza put me in touch with a doctor they trusted. The doctor decided to retest me for hepatitis (the tests came back negative). While I was heading home from the hospital, he wrote to me, “Is it possible that you have been poisoned?” I replied, “No, I am not that dangerous.” I told Yana, we laughed. She said, Oh yeah, the simplest explanation. She must have been poisoned—she is a Russian journalist. ON DECEMBER 12, I went back to my neighborhood doctor. I got a new round of tests, the results had gotten worse, my ALT was seven times above normal. We sat in her office. She said nothing, going through her papers. Then she said, “Elena, there are two theories left. The first one is that the antidepressants you’re on may have suddenly started working aberrantly. But you recently changed medications and your symptoms and test results haven’t changed. That’s why we have a second theory. Please try to stay calm. You may have been poisoned.” I laughed. The doctor stayed silent. I said, “That’s impossible.” She said, “We’ve ruled out all other options. I’m sorry. You need to go to the toxicology department at Charite.” I spent the next three days lying there and thinking. I don’t remember what I was thinking about. Yana says that the first day I said it was stupid and that the doctors had made a mistake, it was just that they couldn’t diagnose me, and didn’t want to run any more tests. Then I stopped talking. Then I got in touch with Meduza and we started trying to figure out what to do next. In order to get blood tests done for poisoning, you have to go to the police. So I did. From the precinct, they sent me straight to the hospital. The police officers turned up too, to talk to me and the doctors. My first session was with the Berlin Criminal Police and lasted nine hours. The police wanted to know everything: what I was working on, what I was planning to work on, whom I had been in contact with in Ukraine, which of my colleagues I was in contact now. I had to reconstruct October 17 and 18 minute by minute. My clothes and apartment were checked for radiation. My body, too. They took the clothes I’d traveled to Munich with. Then the police did a “safety check” of my apartment. An officer asked me, “Why are your blinds open? You could easily be shot from the balcony across the way.” The police told me that I needed to follow new safety protocols. Like what? “Move. Take different routes home. Don’t get cabs directly to your destination, get out of cars a block away. Wear sunglasses.” “That’s it?” “Well, it will all help your chances.” The police officers were mad at me. They didn’t show it, but after the third round of questioning, we started talking. The senior detective had run the investigation into the killing of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a former Chechen field commander, who had been shot in the Tiergarten in 2019. The killer was quickly caught thanks to eyewitnesses and security camera footage. His passport said he was Vadim Sokolov, but journalists and police established that his real name was Vadim Krasikov and that he had ties to the FSB. He received a life sentence in Germany for murder “on the orders of the Russian government, being a part of the Russian law enforcement apparatus.” The judge called what happened “state terrorism.” In 2022, Russia filed two separate requests to include Krasikov on the list of prisoners up for exchange, but Germany refused. A year earlier, the same detective investigated the poisoning of Petr Verzilov, the publisher of Mediazona and a member of Pussy Riot. He had been taken to Charite from Moscow on a private plane, convulsing and delirious. Verzilov’s friends found that the Berlin hospital was under surveillance. The police offered Verzilov protection and opened an investigation. “And we weren’t able to establish anything. Not even the substance used.” “How come?” “Because it’s impossible to ask a lab, ‘Was this person poisoned?’ You can only ask if there was a specific substance present in their body. And there are thousands of substances. That’s why it’s such a popular means of assassination.” “We can’t understand why it took you this long to come to us. You should have called the police right away, as soon as you felt sick on the train. We would have met you at the station.” “But I didn’t think I’d been poisoned. I’m still not sure.” “Why didn’t you think so?” “It seemed crazy to me. And I’m in Europe.” “So what?” “I felt like I was safe.” “That is what drives us crazy,” the detective said. “You come here and act like you’re on vacation. Like this is some paradise. It doesn’t even occur to you to keep yourself safe. We have political killings here. The Russian special services are active in Germany. Your carelessness, yours and your colleagues, knows no bounds.” I was not kept informed of the progress of the investigation. On April 2, at a journalism conference, I was approached by Insider editor-in-chief Roman Dobrokhotov. He took me aside. “Lena, I have a personal question. But first I need to tell you something. Christo Grozev from Bellingcat and I have been investigating a series of poisonings in Europe. All the known targets are female Russian journalists. I want to ask you. You haven’t written anything for a long time—is it because you’ve been sick?” And I told him what I am telling you now. On May 2, I got a letter from the Berlin Prosecutor General’s office telling me that the investigation into my attempted assassination had been closed. The police had not found “any indication” that there had been an attempt to kill me. “Blood test results do not conclusively indicate poisoning.” The doctors consulting Insider and Bellingcat said that the most likely explanation of what had happened to me was that I’d been poisoned with a chloroorganic compound. I passed this information on to the police. On July 21, the Prosecutor’s office reopened the case. HOW AM I NOW? The pain, nausea, and swelling have gone. I still have no energy. I left Meduza—I am a long way away from being able to return to the field. Right now, I can work three hours a day. This keeps increasing, but slowly. There are days when I can’t do anything. I lay there and try not to hate myself. While I was writing this, I strove to establish the chronology of events, remember all the important details. But what details are really important? In November, a friend of mine came to Berlin. He is a publisher—not an activist, not a journalist, not a politician. He came over and he was horrified at the state I was in. He said, Do you understand that you may have been poisoned? Have you talked to your doctors about that? I said, I haven’t and I am not going to, that’s stupid. I said, Don’t try to infect me with your paranoia. I lied to the police. It wasn’t that the idea of it “seemed crazy” to me. During my time at Novaya Gazeta, four of my colleagues were killed. I organized the funeral of Khimki journalist Mikhail Beketov, he’d been a friend. I knew that journalists got murdered. But I did not want to believe that they could kill me. I was protected from this thought by revulsion, shame, and exhaustion. It disgusted me to think that there were people who wanted me dead. I was ashamed to talk about it. Even with loved ones, let alone the police. And I felt how exhausted I was, how little strength I had left, that I wouldn’t be able to go on the run again. My book is coming out in a few weeks. It is about how Russia descended into fascism. It is coming out in several languages simultaneously. The police believe that it might become a trigger. That the people who tried to kill me in Ukraine, and, possibly, in Germany, will try again. I want to live. That’s why I’m writing this. I also want my colleagues and friends, activists, and political refugees currently living abroad to be careful. More careful than I have been. We are not safe and we will not be safe until there is regime change in Russia. The work we do helps to bring this regime down, and it is defending itself. If you are suddenly ill, please do not discount the possibility that you may have been poisoned. Tell your doctors. Fight for yourself. And if it’s already happened to you, please make contact with the investigative team at Insider or Bellingcat. They are looking for the people who are trying to kill us. —Translated from the Russian by Bela Shayevich If you like this article, please subscribe or leave a tax-deductible tip below to support n+1.

Like this is some paradise. It doesn’t even occur to you to keep yourself safe. We have political killings here. The Russian special services are active in Germany. Your carelessness, yours and your colleagues, knows no bounds.”It&#x27;s very difficult to reconcile what seems like the safety of Europe with the reality of a war that is being fought online as much as on the ground. Journalists have always been targeted by authoritarian regimes, but the connectedness of the modern world makes them dangerous even outside after leaving the country. Clearly this is what the Russian state believes. reply foldedcornice 19 hours agoparentThis matches with an account by Bellingcat reporter Christo Grozev, who was interviewed by the Financial Times [1]:\"How does it feel, I ask, to be here in absentia? Grozev laughs. After the Russians indicted him “in absentia”, he posted a selfie video from Palm Beach, Florida, against a sunset backdrop. “I said, ‘If this is absentia, it’s a pretty great place to be.’”\"Is Austria the least safe European country? “Yes,” he replies. “While we [Bellingcat] were investigating the Austrians, they were surveilling me and I wasn’t aware of that at the time. They were doing so explicitly at the request of the Russians. That is deep penetration.”\"He says the Germans advised him not to settle in Germany. He last visited Germany in 2020 under heavy guard as a witness in the prosecution of a Russian who had assassinated a Chechen exile. “We are also investigating examples of Russian security services penetrating German political circles,” he says. “France, I would not trust them: they don’t even trust themselves. The only place in Europe I can come to safely nowadays is the UK.”\"He is still angry, however, at London’s Metropolitan Police for cancelling his and his family’s attendance at the Bafta film awards this year. “Hearing it through the grapevine was offensive,” he says. “If there is also a risk to my family, they should tell me directly.”\"Both Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which is teeming with Russians, are off-limits, he adds. “Dubai is Vienna on the Gulf,” he says. “I have heard this warning from both the Emirates and Turkey — ‘Do not come here. We will try to protect you. We will never extradite you [to Russia]. But we can’t guarantee your safety.’”\"Grozen did his interview in the United States, where he is currently living.

So if you want a person of above average intelligence, who does not mind going to plausibly suicidal missions, and is able to keep it all together, AND has decided to take a career in cloak&dagger… I’d say such fields agents are not trivial to replace.

They realized this after the fact. But when they seemed to get neutralized with very evil but textbook action, they said, in desperation (close from memory) \"But why would ___?! I don&#x27;t have any enemies!\"I&#x27;m not sure, but I think, if they would&#x27;ve been asked just then, they might&#x27;ve contradicted what they&#x27;d just said, to tell you who probably did it, and why they might get any of that party&#x27;s attention. That might&#x27;ve been some powerful psychology speaking just then.I suspect they were verbalizing reversion to their self image, and how they wanted the world to be. Something like this just wouldn&#x27;t happen to them, and they&#x27;re not in that world of stepping on the toes of characters like this, and don&#x27;t want to be.(Also, in case of this journalist, note the bit about the German official with poor bedside manner, when speaking with a potential victim of a heinous crime. Maybe the official was interrogating, or angry, or that was just their manner. The journalist spoke of shame as a reason, which I guess might be the journalist&#x27;s cultural upbringing about being tough and not being the oppressed, but the German also seemed to be shaming.) reply invalidname 18 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a cognitive dissonance of \"this won&#x27;t happen to me\" that comes from years of walking on the line.

Despite the fact that other nations were hit just as hard if not harder by Germany in WW2, and unlike Russians - didn&#x27;t started the WW2 as allies of hitler.Somehow the debt only applied to the authoritarian militaristic country that has lots of gas, not to its victims.The historical self-depreciating rhetoric of some pro-russian Germans was used to justify siding with the bully against the victim because it&#x27;s more profitable and historically it was the \"realpolitik\" choice.Yes, imperialism is bad.

There is a well documented gradient in attitudes of elites to autocracy as a style of leadership between Europe and Asia. I.e as Alexander the Great moved east, he took up to the local institutions of totalitarian leadership, and was considered a total dick by his generals due this.Also traditional example is the feud between Greek city states and Persia (Which is documented in the painstakingly historically accurate movies such as ‘300’).I’m not saying peoples are predestined to be forever in one system of governance, but the differences predate enlightenment way, way back. reply dralley 19 hours agorootparentprev>The rest of Europe (if Russia can be considered as being in Europe) went through centuries of war, revolution, upheaval, debate, and other forms of blood, sweat, and tears... all of it culminating in modern humanist thought.As Timothy Snyder points out, Europeans didn&#x27;t stop engaging in imperialist wars because they grew morals and humanist thought, they stopped engaging in imperialist wars because in the 50s and 60s they either lost them all, or knew they couldn&#x27;t afford to win them.Russia may or may not undergo the same development, but losing in their war of conquest over Ukraine is a prerequsite to any kind of progress in this area. reply fsloth 18 hours agorootparentYep.For example Winston Churchill lamented deeply the loss of India and considered Gandhi an annoyance.Another reason was that the American system of rule based relations instituted after second world war meant former colonial masters could still economically utilize the raw inputs from their colonies without risk of losing the colony to another colonial power and hence being cut off from those markets and resources.Before second world war any territories unable to defend themselves from european powers were more or leas up for grabs - hence you were afraid that giving your colony independence, another colonial power would have simply annexed them, thus you would lose the resources and the market.The US rule based order was overall good for the world, regardless of so many documented events of behaving as dicks within it. reply FredPret 18 hours agorootparentprevThey developed the beginnings of humanism and applied it to themselves long before colonialism even started.Racist thinking was prevalent and helped justify colonialism and humanism existing at the same time.But you’re right, if Russia loses, everyone will win, even Russians. reply iavael 19 hours agoparentprevAfter major political changes, such as the February Revolution or the collapse of the Soviet Union, there were brief periods of freedom.

But many people in the West keep saying that every Russian is accountable for atrocities committed by the Russian government because they \"elected\" that government. reply mistermann 20 hours agoparentprevEspecially impressive about westerners is their honesty about the shortcomings of their own nations. reply willcipriano 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m in the west and I&#x27;m often the only person in the room who is aware that the US has been murdering children in almost a dozen countries around the globe for the past two decades.

    "originBody": "Sports Business News Life Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals VALLEY VOICE How do we save water: Stop growing alfalfa in Imperial County Gerald McKennaSpecial to The Desert Sun If California is really short of water, why are we shipping it to Asia? We can do one simple thing and our water supply crisis will be over. We can stop growing alfalfa. The top water-using activity in California is growing alfalfa — a protein-rich type of hay. An alfalfa farmer can crop alfalfa 10 or even 12 times a year and sell it for $260 per ton. These are not the hardworking family farmers of yesteryear. They are giant agribusiness corporations pulling in $1.8 billion from selling 7 million tons of alfalfa every year in California, according to a University of California, Davis study by Daniel Geisseler and William R. Horwath. We make this business extremely profitable for them by selling them 3.4 million acre-feet (1 acre foot =325,851 gallons) of water every year for $35 to $60 per acre-foot. The water you get for your house costs you $800 per acre-foot today, and it could be double that in 10 years' time. You could supply the water needs of 40 million people with that 3.4 million acre-feet. In Arizona, something even more insane is happening. Saudi Arabian companies are pumping up groundwater from beneath land they have purchased and are using it to grow alfalfa for export to the Middle East. They have no plan for replacing this scarce and finite groundwater that accumulated over thousands of years. Incredibly, Arizona does not regulate groundwater extraction in agricultural areas. California didn’t get serious about groundwater management until 2014 so we deserve some criticism too. Alfalfa is used to feed farm animals like pigs and cows. But we export 70% of what we grow in California to Japan and China. The Japanese raise Kobe beef with it and send it back to us for $200 per pound. The Chinese use it to raise pigs to meet their rapidly expanding demand for pork as they become more affluent and eat more meat. Why don’t they grow their own alfalfa? Because they are short of water and it is so much cheaper to buy ours. In fact, alfalfa has become an instrument for exporting subsidized water. We need to ask ourselves: Is the California desert the right place to grow alfalfa? It needs around 6-foot depth of water applied to every field to sustain this crop for a year at the present cultivation intensity, according to a University of California study, “Irrigated Alfalfa Management.” So, next time you see a truckload of hay going west on the freeway give it a wave! Wave goodbye to $13,000 worth of scarce water that was sold to agribusiness for just $1,000 and is now headed overseas on that truck. And while this is happening, that slow-moving ecological train wreck, the Salton Sea, continues to dry up. We need to fix this.

Water in the American West is badly mispriced, so ranchers in China, Japan and Saudi Arabia are essentially buying this water for a very low price because their own water price is very high.I&#x27;m hoping there is eventually enough outrage in these areas to change policy. Especially in California, where they are forcing people to rip up their lawns and trying to guilt folks into feeling horrible if they take a shower a minute too long, meanwhile they&#x27;re doing nothing about what is actually the biggest cause of the problem. reply davidw 20 hours agoparentIt drives me absolutely bonkers when I see someone complain about some new apartments \"because water\". I live in a city in the west where there&#x27;s a pretty severe housing shortage, and water is also a concern.But when you dig into the water issue... it&#x27;s all agriculture, and even there they have so much leeway to eliminate waste. I saw an exhibit at the airport of a \"pipe\" they dug up less than 5 years ago that was made of wood squeezed together with bailing wire.The \"Total Water Use\" chart here is pretty similar throughout much of the West:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.centraloregonlandwatch.org&#x2F;update&#x2F;2021&#x2F;5&#x2F;5&#x2F;droug...And denser housing tends to use water more efficiently.Edit: dug up a picture of that pipe I took. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;PisNhiA81Rsw45Rx8 reply ajmurmann 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s frustrating that there is no political way to prices water at real cost rather than use archaic water rights.

Growing alfalfa in California for cows in China or Saudi Arabia does not impact the price of California beef in a measurable way. reply kolanos 18 hours agorootparentYes, it is. Have you quantified this claim? Do you know how little alfalfa is exported?> Based on USDA data for 2022, only 4% of all U.S. dry hay produced and 6.5% of all harvested alfalfa hay entered the export market.So 96% of all hay and 93.5% of alfalfa is used domestically.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hayandforage.com&#x2F;article-4300-hay-exports-in-2022-of... reply pdonis 18 hours agorootparentEvidently this must vary a lot by state, since the article under discussion says that 70% of California grown alfalfa is exported to Japan and China. reply coryrc 17 hours agorootparentprevMost hay isn&#x27;t grown in California, it&#x27;s in the Midwest. reply cjbgkagh 18 hours agorootparentprevPrice is set at the margins reply s0rce 19 hours agorootparentprevSadly, not that simple, few major issues here, we are exporting extremely low value, high water, crops overseas, like alfalfa. We are also growing these low value, high water crops to feed to animals (which also consume a lot of water). We don&#x27;t need to subsidize these activities, particularly not the former. reply kolanos 18 hours agorootparentAlfalfa is \"extremely low value\" by what metric? It is a rich food source for livestock. Alfalfa is also one of the most water efficient crops there is due to its deep roots, high yield and perennial nature. [1]A lot of \"studies\" on water efficiency of crops ignore yield, which is kind of the whole point of agriculture.And regarding your export claim:> Based on USDA data for 2022, only 4% of all U.S. dry hay produced and 6.5% of all harvested alfalfa hay entered the export market.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hayandforage.com&#x2F;article-4300-hay-exports-in-2022-of...

Based on USDA export and hay production data for those states, 19% of their alfalfa production was exported in 2022 and 26% of the grass production found its way into shipping containers. As such, hay prices in the Western states play a large role in setting market prices. reply opo 17 hours agorootparentprevThere might be other ways of measuring water efficiency of crops, but from a quick google search, most sources seem to consider alfalfa to not be very water efficient. For example:>...According to an analysis by the conservation non-profit Pacific Institute, alfalfa production in California uses around 5 feet an acre (6167.4 cubic metres) of water, making it one of the most water-intensive crops alongside the likes of almonds, pistachios and rice. Crops such as sugar beets use roughly 3 feet an acre (3,700 cubic metres), and dry beans as little as 1.5 feet each acre (1,850 cubic metres).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2022&#x2F;sep&#x2F;12&#x2F;colorado....>>...Based on USDA data for 2022, only 4% of all U.S. dry hay produced and 6.5% of all harvested alfalfa hay entered the export market.It is misleading to just talk about the entire US production of alfalfa since in many places water is not nearly as limited as it is in California.>...Government figures compiled by Putnam and fellow researchers William Matthews and Daniel Sumner show about 15 percent of alfalfa and more than 44 percent of other types of hay produced in the West have been exported in recent years.>The share exported from Southern California farms is significantly higher than the regional average, the researchers said, because the closeness of the port makes trucking costs relatively inexpensive.That percentage is from an article in 2017 - it sounds like the percentage today is at least that high or higher.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.desertsun.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;... reply BenjiWiebe 16 hours agorootparentWater efficiency by area isn&#x27;t very useful. Look at calories out or protein out or pounds of dry matter. reply margalabargala 19 hours agorootparentprevSure, but perhaps there need to be more regulations on who gets that cheap water.I&#x27;m fine with American taxpayers subsidizing water so that American food is cheaper for Americans.I&#x27;m less fine with American taxpayers subsidizing Saudi Arabian food.Perhaps any water used to grow something that is exported could be priced at market value, while water pricing for products consumed domestically can remain the same. reply freeopinion 18 hours agorootparentWhy do you think this water is not priced at market value?If a farmer could take their water and sell it for more money to somebody who would then treat it, transport it, and resell it to the public, the farmer would do that. It might be counterintuitive to a lot of people, but if you want to stop farmers from using their water to grow crops, raise the price of potable water.The farmer understands markets very well. They buy and use water based on market values. What you&#x27;re hearing is a lot of complaining from people who do not understand markets and think that they can dictate market prices just by word alone. Markets don&#x27;t usually work that way. reply pdonis 18 hours agorootparent> Why do you think this water is not priced at market value?Because farmers can&#x27;t take their water and sell it for more money to someone else, and they have no incentive to economize on water usage. Water prices are not set by supply and demand, they are set by government regulation. The \"market\" that farmers buy water in is not a free market. reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agorootparentWhere do you think these Saudi farmers bought the land and water contracts? They bought them from some other farmer.Governments can absolutely buy out water contracts from farmers on the open market.In the cases where water is tied to land title, it can be separated, as is common with other natural resources like natural gas and minerals reply margalabargala 16 hours agorootparentprevThe market for water that you describe does not exist, because that&#x27;s not how water rights work in the American West, where this is an issue.> If a farmer could take their water and sell it for more money to somebody who would then treat it, transport it, and resell it to the public, the farmer would do that.They can&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s not a market issue, it&#x27;s a water rights issue. The farmer is \"entitled\" to a quantity of water each year by virtue of owning the land they are on. If they do not spray that quantity of water onto that land, then they lose the right to get any water in future years.> What you&#x27;re hearing is a lot of complaining from people who do not understand marketsThus, it is not markets, but water rights, that are not understood by the people that I hear complaining. reply freeopinion 15 hours agorootparentFirst, let me say that water rights are not usually a use it or lose it right. That might be true in some part of the American West that you are familiar with, but not in the part of the American West where I use water.Secondly, where there exist rights there is usually a market for those rights. For instance, people buy and sell publishing rights or the right to first refusal. So it is with water rights. If I need more water than I have the right to use, I talk to my neighbor to see if I can buy her rights. If she won&#x27;t sell them, maybe she&#x27;ll let them. I can tell you exactly what the market price is for a share of water (a water right) where I live in the American West. I can tell you what it was last year and what it was 20 years ago. And there is a very active market to buy or lease water. My local municipal water company can require somebody wanting a new meter to sign over an irrigation water share to the company. The company pumps water from a well, processes the water and delivers it to the meter for a fee. reply margalabargala 13 hours agorootparentWhere I live (Central Oregon) the irrigation districts literally fly planes over the fields of people with water rights and send them warning letters if their fields are insufficiently green. If you&#x27;re wondering how that affects people who try to use water-saving methods such as hoop houses or greenhouses, they also get these warning letters.It sounds like where you are, the irrigation water and the municipal supply is also co-mingled in pipes? Where I am the systems are entirely separate, there&#x27;s the potable municipal supply, and separately a series of surface canals operated by irrigation districts that bring water directly from the Deschutes river to fields.For this reason (canals delivering irrigation water from source to destination via gravity), irrigation rights are fully tied to the land as they require adjacency to these canals. Properties may not sell their rights, even to other users of the same canal. Either they use it themselves, or they lose it and the rights revert back to the management of the irrigation district who may sell those acre-feet to a different user of the same canal.It&#x27;s not a great system, but unfortunately as the irrigation districts here are privately owned rather than public, the people required to change this are those currently benefiting from the status quo. reply freeopinion 12 hours agorootparentWhere I live, irrigation and municipal supply are two completely different systems managed by completely different entities. But the municipal provider can still say, \"We don&#x27;t have any more water than we are currently providing. If you want us to provide you with water, you have to sign over your water rights. Then we can use those rights to provide you with water.\" reply renewiltord 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s exactly right. The farmer is savvy. He knows that the legal mechanism for selling the water is to first spend it on plants and then export the plants.It&#x27;s a legal arbitrage. The valuable thing is the water because it can be used to make relatively expensive plants. The only permitted delivery mechanism is plants. So he follows the incentives. reply specialist 17 hours agorootparentprevWhere is the market for water rights in the US West? reply freeopinion 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s kind of like asking, \"Where is the market for eggs in the US West?\" reply specialist 11 hours agorootparentAm noob. Sorry.ELI5 Where I can buy me some water rights. Imagine I represent a consortium of commercial salmon fishers and we want (need) to buy the water to keep salmon healthy.

Even in different regions inside the same country.This also works as a signal to help water-thirsty industries to locate or relocate themselves. reply margalabargala 16 hours agorootparentThere are good reasons to do things like farming in the desert via irrigation. If water is not an issue, then crops are significantly more productive per acre due to the increased sunlight. Places where water is plentiful tend to be less productive for agriculture due to the increase in cloud cover; a rainy day is a day when the plants get less energy.There&#x27;s a balance to be struck between using an unsustainable amount of desert water, and using none of it. reply henearkr 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that the energy cost of irrigating in the desert will ever be sustainable.If you have a counter-example, I&#x27;m interested.But I do see the possibility of solving the problem by using photovoltaic energy (though maybe not optimally, because not having to move the water would allow to use the electricity for other usages).Bear in mind that the alternative is to grow crops in countries where it is raining most of the time.Plants fare really really well in rainy countries, they don&#x27;t mind at all that the sun is less present.The only real drawback is the shortened growing period, if the country is too far north or too far south. replydavidw 20 hours agorootparentprevYes, it&#x27;s pretty bad.Around Bend, where I live, there isn&#x27;t a ton of &#x27;serious&#x27; agriculture.

That&#x27;s used to generate ~$72k of economic activity.Alfalfa for instance uses ~0.4acre-feet per ton. Alfalfa prices haven&#x27;t ever been higher than $300&#x2F;ton. That means that if water cost more than $750&#x2F;acre-foot, they&#x27;d be out of business on water cost alone. At that price, the average Angeleno would have to pay a shockingly high... $5&#x2F;mo for all their water. Oh wait, no, that&#x27;s less than 0.1% of GDP per capita in Los Angeles County.The fact is urban dwellers don&#x27;t use much water, and are enormously economically productive, much moreso than rural areas, and so in any kind of open market for water, the urbanites will win handily every time.

Additionally, the water consumed by agriculture is often different than the &#x27;treated water&#x27; needed to serve residential communities.So yes, water is major a bottleneck for residential development out west. But to solve this you need new means of transport (pipes &#x2F; channels), storage (reservoirs), and treatment (plans)... infrastructure that doesn&#x27;t currently exist, is hard to get approved, and would likely need to be paid for by increasing the cost of living for existing residents.Agree that we should be smarter about how water is allocated &#x2F; used out West, but &#x27;taking from ag&#x27; isn&#x27;t going to make it any cheaper for you to buy a home. reply RoddaWallPro 16 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who also lives in Central Oregon (and was born and raised here), I will say this: this article is profoundly misleading.They state that the Upper Deschutes CFS goes from ~1200->~65, and state that is from irrigation. But they don&#x27;t actually prove that. Much of that CFS decline could be observed out of irrigation season, because that section of the Deschutes dumps a ton of water into lava tubes&#x2F;back into the ground. You&#x27;d have to measure the CFS at the end of that section prior to irrigation getting turned on, then after, and then the difference is what is going to irrigation. And CO Land Watch doesn&#x27;t do that. Hell, they don&#x27;t even state where their data is coming from.You can get a better idea of this drop by instead looking at official US govt data where the Deschutes drops into Lake Billy Chinook: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov&#x2F;usa&#x2F;nwis&#x2F;uv&#x2F;?cb_00060=on&for...That is for the year 2021, when that article was written.

Or I guess another way to put it is, how do we correct the system that got us here without punishing the farmers? AFAIK they are not the bad guys, rather they are the ones feeding us and are subject to operating in the system that was created before they were born. Changing water rights does not feel like it addresses the problem in a way that does not harm innocent people.

Eggs are great, but allergies are relatively common. Milk is the same. Farmed fish can be done well, but that also has allergies among those who also have shellfish allergies.

Where it rains almost daily and cattle mostly drinks surface water that normally gets drained to the sea.I’m an environmentalist myself, but repeating statistics without asking yourself if they are relevant is useless.In this case though, the farms are using up water that doesn’t get replenished.

Not saying it’s a good idea but comparing canal water for irrigation with fluorinated chlorinated potable water piped directly to your house doesn’t seem reasonable. reply seemaze 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worse than what you propose. In Arizona at least, the existing water rights allow agriculture to pump fresh, clean, ancient ground water as a less expensive alternative to surface water transported via canal. Because agriculture won&#x27;t use it, the canal water has to be made potable and distributed in the municipal water supply. reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentYeah that’s definitely worse.Although I would note the California case still makes me wonder, as it’s not apples to apples, even if it’s a stupid waste regardless of the actual metric. reply ethbr1 20 hours agorootparentprevYou can turn canal water into potable water at some cost.It&#x27;s much more difficult to turn no water into potable water. reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentNo debate there.

Maybe my physics teachers were too mean to me, or my work in quantitative fields has twisted me, but reading otherwise well reasoned stuff that makes unfair comparisons hurts the entire line of reasoning in my mind.So my question still stands out there - but I would note whatever savings over municipal water they have or don’t have, that doesn’t make it a good idea.

But for all the sprawl and population increase, the overwhelming amount of water used in the state is not consumed by residences, but rather farmers. So naturally, many argue that we should be doing less agriculture in the desert and move the production of cotton, alfalfa and various vegetables towards places with more rain. On this episode, we speak with Trevor Bales, the proprietor of Bales Hay Farm & Ranch in Arizona about his family’s history in the state and why he thinks this dry desert is a great place to grow alfalfa.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcasts.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;an-arizona-farmer-on-h...\"Understanding the Real Fight Over Water in Arizona\"> Arizona recently announced new constraints on housing development in the areas around Phoenix. At issue is water rights and scarcity, which have been a challenge for the US Southwest for as long as people have been living there. That being said, the region is currently in the midst of a 25-year megadrought and when you combine that with booming growth, difficult choices may have to be made. But how do water rights get divided? Who holds them? How much is water worth to the housing developers, farmers and semiconductor manufacturers that have flocked to the state? To learn more, we speak with Kathryn Sorensen, director of research at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University.

Either way, the article doesn&#x27;t even mention any regulations at issue. reply freeopinion 18 hours agoprev\"We can do one simple thing and our water supply crisis will be over.\"I don&#x27;t think this was written as a parody. I think the author really thinks like this.They seem to ignore some pretty obvious things. I will assume they are fairly intelligent and educated, so the ignorance is suspicious. For example, they seem shocked that treated potable water delivered via an expensive network of sanitary pipelines would be more expensive than untreated water delivered via a ditch. They gloss over the \"10 or even 12\" crops of alfalfa a year, but don&#x27;t seem to realize that 10 or 12 cuttings a year is phenomenal and a big part of why Imperial County is special. Other places struggle to get four cuttings per year.I think the author almost hits the right target even though they are aiming at the wrong target. We don&#x27;t need to stop growing alfalfa. We need to have a rational pricing system for water. If somebody can buy water for $1&#x2F;unit right out of a well, then spend $3&#x2F;unit to treat that water and $1&#x2F;unit to transport that water to market, and can sell it for $6&#x2F;unit to the public, they might get outbid by somebody who can buy the same water for $2&#x2F;unit out of the well, spend $0&#x2F;unit to treat the water, spend $0.5&#x2F;unit to transport the water to market and be able to sell it for $3.50&#x2F;unit. In any efficient economy, this is a no-brainer.It could be more rational to argue that we need to stop growing humans on our most productive agricultural real estate. We can grow humans by the bushel in Montana. We can&#x27;t get 12 cuttings of alfalfa per year in Montana.If the argument is that the world is running out of water (which does seem to be the author&#x27;s argument) then we have bigger problems than alfalfa. Eliminating farm land so we can fit more humans will not solve the water shortage. It will compound it.I am not proposing that we cut back on humans on the planet. I think there are plenty of resources for both. The author is right that we have to balance the demands we put on those resources. But I think we should be more thoughtful about it than the author proposes. reply jmcqk6 17 hours agoparent> It could be more rational to argue that we need to stop growing humans on our most productive agricultural real estate.

By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Aug 16, 2023, 7:21 AM EDT|22 Comments / 22 New Share this story Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge I can’t believe I’ve been struggling with apps in the Task Manager randomly moving around without realizing there’s a simple keyboard shortcut to pause the Task Manager and stop its contents in their tracks. Yup, all you have to do is hold down the CTRL key and it will pause the Task Manager on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, and perhaps even older versions of Windows, too. This legitimately useful tip comes from Jen Gentleman, a Microsoft employee on the Windows engineering team that regularly shares helpful shortcuts and tips for Windows. I’ve used Windows for more than 20 years, and I’m still learning the many ways you can do tasks in the operating system on a monthly basis. If you’re used to turning to the Task Manager to end faulty tasks then you might not even need to open it at all soon. Microsoft is working on a force quit option to close apps without the Task Manager in Windows 11 simply from a right-click option in the taskbar. But the hold CTRL option to pause the Task Manager will still be useful for everyone who hasn’t upgraded to Windows 11 just yet. While I have your attention, you might also like to know that you can spin the gear in Windows 11’s Notepad app. It’s like a digital fidget spinner, and part of the many delightful little additions to Windows 11. Microsoft has hidden little Easter eggs like this in Windows for decades; there was even a hidden prompt in Windows 95 that was only discovered in 2021. 22 COMMENTS22 NEW Most Popular Linus Tech Tips pauses production as controversy swirls Elon Musk keeps getting creepier It’s time to rethink our relationships with streaming services Today I learned you can easily pause the Windows Task Manager to stop apps moving around Tesla’s ‘ultra hardcore’ work culture — as told by its employees Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

The same menus in the same places, the same hotkeys worked everywhere, etc. Linux couldn&#x27;t claim that, was the pitch.Since human time is the expensive part, it didn&#x27;t matter if the OS itself wasn&#x27;t exactly performant, and we could afford to throw hardware at its ever-more-bloated footprint, because the investment in _human reflexes_ paid dividends whose value far exceeded some extra sticks of RAM or whatever.Now that hardware is virtually free and it _should_ cost nothing to continue that legacy of consistency, they&#x27;ve fucked it all up! Teams is completely unusable by keyboard, the new UI skin got rid of all the menu bars, lately I&#x27;ve found GUI elements that&#x27;re _hidden until you mouse over them_, like are they kidding?I feel like I&#x27;ve been played for a fool.

Discoverability is a very hard problem (which is probably why the modern trend is to just give up on it entirely). I&#x27;m glad that Microsoft didn&#x27;t completely neglect it here.Edit: Does View -> Update Speed -> Paused do what it implies? Does it pause all updates? because that&#x27;s not what I want here... what I want is to stop the reordering of the items in the list, not to stop the updating of the items. reply tom_ 17 hours agorootparentprevThe shortcut isn&#x27;t shown though, possibly at least in part because it&#x27;s not a shortcut to that option. Try selecting the Normal speed, then holding Ctrl, and activating the menu - note that the Normal speed is still highlighted. And yet the display is still paused!(Of course, just because it&#x27;s not a shortcut to that option specifically, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the current solution of not showing this shortcut anywhere is the right one.) reply LoganDark 18 hours agorootparentprevI wish more operating systems had adopted macOS&#x27;s feature to search through menu bar items, which also automatically points to where it is in the menu. reply jbverschoor 5 hours agorootparentRaycast’s menu search works way better by the way reply naikrovek 18 hours agorootparentprevthis is the correct way to expose keyboard shortcuts to users. this is how it used to be done before UX people started getting involved and following trends instead of thinking about usability. reply david422 17 hours agoparentprevReminds me of macOS menus.

Regular right click brings up a new metro-style simplified menu. Shift+Righr click brings up the classic right menu with the full menu. The new menu has maybe 7 items while the old is at 20+.I believe the new system was an attempt to get rid of all the cruft that has accumulated into the right click menu over the years. Notably it does not show any actions added by third party programs or file extension handlers. reply RajT88 17 hours agoparentprevThese kinds of features are what breaks in new Windows releases.For example: in windows explorer you can start typing the name of the file and it will character by character match it to a file.

DAN GOODIN - 8/16/2023, 12:23 PM Enlarge 130 WITH A few months ago, an engineer in a data center in Norway encountered some perplexing errors that caused a Windows server to suddenly reset its system clock to 55 days in the future. The engineer relied on the server to maintain a routing table that tracked cell phone numbers in real time as they moved from one carrier to the other. A jump of eight weeks had dire consequences because it caused numbers that had yet to be transferred to be listed as having already been moved and numbers that had already been transferred to be reported as pending. “With these updated routing tables, a lot of people were unable to make calls, as we didn't have a correct state!” the engineer, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Simen, wrote in an email. “We would route incoming and outgoing calls to the wrong operators! This meant, e.g., children could not reach their parents and vice versa.” Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletter Join Ars Technica and Get Our Best Tech Stories DELIVERED STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX.

A show-stopping issue Simen had experienced a similar error last August when a machine running Windows Server 2019 reset its clock to January 2023 and then changed it back a short time later. Troubleshooting the cause of that mysterious reset was hampered because the engineers didn’t discover it until after event logs had been purged. The newer jump of 55 days, on a machine running Windows Server 2016, prompted him to once again search for a cause, and this time, he found it. The culprit was a little-known feature in Windows known as Secure Time Seeding. Microsoft introduced the time-keeping feature in 2016 as a way to ensure that system clocks were accurate. Windows systems with clocks set to the wrong time can cause disastrous errors when they can’t properly parse timestamps in digital certificates or they execute jobs too early, too late, or out of the prescribed order. Secure Time Seeding, Microsoft said, was a hedge against failures in the battery-powered onboard devices designed to keep accurate time even when the machine is powered down. Advertisement “You may ask—why doesn’t the device ask the nearest time server for the current time over the network?” Microsoft engineers wrote. “Since the device is not in a state to communicate securely over the network, it cannot obtain time securely over the network as well, unless you choose to ignore network security or at least punch some holes into it by making exceptions.” To avoid making security exceptions, Secure Time Seeding sets the time based on data inside an SSL handshake the machine makes with remote servers. These handshakes occur whenever two devices connect using the Secure Sockets Layer protocol, the mechanism that provides encrypted HTTPS sessions (it is also known as Transport Layer Security). Because Secure Time Seeding (abbreviated as STS for the rest of this article) used SSL certificates Windows already stored locally, it could ensure that the machine was securely connected to the remote server. The mechanism, Microsoft engineers wrote, “helped us to break the cyclical dependency between client system time and security keys, including SSL certificates.” Simen wasn’t the only person encountering wild and spontaneous fluctuations in Windows system clocks used in mission-critical environments. Sometime last year, a separate engineer named Ken began seeing similar time drifts. They were limited to two or three servers and occurred every few months. Sometimes, the clock times jumped by a matter of weeks. Other times, the times changed to as late as the year 2159. “It has exponentially grown to be more and more servers that are affected by this,” Ken wrote in an email. “In total, we have around 20 servers (VMs) that have experienced this, out of 5,000. So it's not a huge amount, but it is considerable, especially considering the damage this does. It usually happens to database servers. When a database server jumps in time, it wreaks havoc, and the backup won’t run, either, as long as the server has such a huge offset in time. For our customers, this is crucial.” Simen and Ken, who both asked to be identified only by their first names because they weren’t authorized by their employers to speak on the record, soon found that engineers and administrators had been reporting the same time resets since 2016.

Advertisement Promoted Comments Zorro ♪ Lets Do The Time Warp Again! ♪ August 16, 2023 at 6:11 pm AnarchyCorp.ORG NTP has worked for decades under Unix. An organization of any real size (more than, say, a dozen systems) would do well to have their own trio (or more) of local NTP hosts that peer with each other while looking at distinct external time sources (or even a local GPS clock), then have all other systems sync from the peers. The peering helps to ensure that one broken clock doesn't throw the others completely off, and having all other systems look at the cluster of peers ensures the organization as a whole stays in sync with itself. Large organizations would do well to just have their own set of stratum 1 time servers (minimum of three) anyway. Some NTP appliances struggle with heavy client loads, so having a set of stratum 2 hosts can help buffer the load. NTP is an open protocol that's been around long enough that it's seen use in a fairly wide variety of environments. It is probably way more reliable than something Microsoft cooked up and acknowledges is based on trusting SSL handshakes occur in \"expected\" ways. August 16, 2023 at 6:18 pm jandrese So, for those that are unaware radio clock sync is a thing when you need a very reliable reference clock but either can't afford your own atomic clock (100s of thousands of dollars) or remote NTP stratum clocks aren't feasible, radio interface reference receivers accessed by USB or RS-232 are a thing. I have no idea if this would work around STS, because no one seems to know what its problem is, but you can turn it off and rely on your radio receiver. You can run an external antenna, pick up your choice of positioning satellite data or the clock sync radio beacons your country or WWV broadcast from the US NIST on various SW frequencies. The computer then takes that high quality time data and uses it to set the internal system clock and calculate skew. Then you can use that computer to sync the rest of the clocks on your isolated networks if you so desire over a secure version of ntpd. Also, please note, not just any GPS receiver will work. You have to have one that includes a reference signal on the access line so the computer can determine response lag and jitter across the interface cable. Most consumer grade GPS receivers don't have that. WWV signals can be difficult to tune outside of certain hours and weather conditions. It's also fairly difficult to find WWV recievers that can easily plug into computers that aren't expensive bespoke legacy devices. They were basically extinct when I went searching a few years ago, but maybe someone sells one again. GPS recievers are more reliable and easier to source (uBlox makes a lot of them), and you only need to care about the speed of light through the cable in special circumstances. For the majority of the population being off by a few microseconds is not an issue. You can also often add manual delay calculations by doing math on the propagation speed through the cables. Not quite as good as testing them, but good enough for most work. Your computer hardware and OS delays will cause far larger errors than that anyway.

Get all of them to include in their SSL headers the exact identical timestamp of July 5th 1998.Then get the user to connect to all those domains (eg. with a page with a bunch of iframes).The Secure Time service will see that lots of remote servers all agree with high confidence that the date is July 5th 1998. So the system clock gets set to then.Then you use a leaked yet expired cert (or maybe one signed with a broken algorithm) to impersonate an update server or steal valuable cookies&#x2F;tokens.Expired certs typically fall out the back of revocation systems too - so it really is just the expiry date&#x2F;time that protects against their use. reply gerdesj 12 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s not just plausible but probably needs a CVE and then MS will have to act.I can feel an experiment coming on: Mint an OpenSSL based CA and use it to generate 200 certs for randomly generated CNs. The script could write out a zone file and web server vhost configs. Pop the CA cert in a Win PC&#x2F;Server trust store. \"Fix\" the time on the web server. AutoIT could be used to poke a browser at each vhost or an iframe monstrosity.I have yet to see this snag myself but it sounds like an MS style screw up. Excellent engineering fucked up by one wrong assumption which leads to a huge towering monstrosity. Sheer arrogance precludes a back down, MS ploughs on and then after a year or two, a fix is silently released and the victim shaming carries on for a little while longer. Meanwhile social.ms carries on advising sfc &#x2F;scannow and then reinstalling the OS. reply londons_explore 11 hours agorootparent> advising sfc &#x2F;scannow and then reinstalling the OS.I really hate that. If there is some problem, properly diagnose it, figure out how it happened, and figure out how to change things so it can never happen to you or anyone else again.Or you could just wipe all config and reinstall everything and hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again! reply gerdesj 10 hours agorootparentMy work Windows server VM boxen started off life largely as 2008 R2, one was 2008. They are all now mostly 2022 and converted to EFI with secure boot - some of them put up quite a fight. Not a large setup - three DCs - one in my home attic for DR, a File n Print n NPS n CA box, a Trellix (Nee McAfee) ePO and a few more bits n pieces.sfc &#x2F;scannow can fix issues but it is not a panacea and certainly not the first thing you should reach for. It sorts some aspects of .dll hell but that is an app thing and a complex one.As you say, get the logs out and your stethoscope. Sadly most of us don&#x27;t have access to source with Windows, so we rely on intuition, 30 years of experience and some really cunning search queries. Even though Google search is largely wank, a decent and carefully curated ublocklist can winnow out the worst rubbish.Having said that, Outlook is totally damned when it comes to logs. Outlook trace logging is an Outlook programmers debugging tool only and of absolutely no use for a sysadmin. You literally fly blind with Outlook and are best off looking at Exchange logs instead. The Outlook devs are only interested in themselves and no one else. You do get CTRL - r click on Outlook icon to unlock the connectivity checker to give you absolutely no help apart from showing how bad things are. The autodiscovery checker is handy and I have fixed configuration issues with it. reply nullindividual 8 hours agorootparentFiddler w&#x2F; SSL decryption is the way to go to help diagnose connectivity issues with Exchange. reply gerdesj 27 minutes agorootparentI use wireshark instead - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.wireshark.org&#x2F;TLS replyjaegrqualm 12 hours agoparentprevTFA seems to only mention errors where the time is set to the future, which would probably indicate that Microsoft at least thought of this. Their responses seem to indicate that they also don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a security issue, which means they likely don&#x27;t know of any _explicit_ way to exploit this.It seems to me that it could still be used to bring down a windows server right around the time that you wanted to, which is still a potentially serious security concern. reply gerdesj 12 hours agorootparentAt the very least you can can screw with Kerberos which requires a default of something like five mins time sync. That&#x27;s a denial of service. Keep it up for long enough and the device will fall off AD as well. reply kelseyfrog 5 hours agoparentprevYou can, just not the one you think.If you&#x27;re a big enough customer, and you contrive a way to rely on this bug, then you&#x27;ve hacked the Microsoft backwards compatibility commitment.

Registering and unregistering w32time, trying different NTP servers. Trying to figure out why domain systems werent getting their time from the DC. It always felt so... stupid. Surely having the correct time on a device isnt that complicated. Turns out, its not, unless you&#x27;re on Windows. Somewhat ironic that these days the only Windows system I have to deal with is my gaming PC. It refuses to sync with time.windows.com. reply yetanotherloss 14 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s probably still the case that Windows will consider the firmware clock more reliable than anything but a stratum 1 (direct gps&#x2F;glonas&#x2F;atomic) or maybe 2 time source which can result in truly bizarre behavior if the firmwar&#x2F;hypervisor drifts too far from dozens of stratum 2 or 3 active directory servers. It logs no messages about this logic fork.I don&#x27;t recall the exact conditions that determine this but troubleshooting it is an exercise in thinking you&#x27;re having a stroke. reply ewoodrich 12 hours agoparentprevI have a Windows work laptop that sometimes drifts up to 10 minutes off the correct time despite time&#x2F;date settings saying it has synced every day. It won&#x27;t even let me correct the time because of an enterprise policy requiring it to use network time. Then one day it will be back to the correct time and the drift cycle begins anew. reply 93po 4 hours agorootparentI find some humor in this being somewhat familiar with the history of clocks and watches. Forever the battle was making the most accurate time pieces possible, with wrist watches eventually reaching a few seconds per day variance before digital watches took over. And new we have something trillions of times more complicated and is performing worse reply arthur2e5 4 hours agorootparentprevThere are ways said to circumvent the enterprise policy on the autosync side, like unregistering win32tm or deleting all servers from the registry.

Wish I knew how they ended up that way, but I’m surprised dialup was the only thing they noticed that was broken. reply jasonfarnon 10 hours agorootparentA lot of shareware back then stopped working after a certain # of calendar days, which it used windows to figure out.

How did MS think this was a good idea?To address the issue they were trying to address (what happens when a mission critical server&#x27;s RTC malfunctions or the battery dies?), Windows should treat it no differently than any other hardware malfunction in a mission-critical server: raise an alarm so a system operator can take a look and address the issue. reply pmontra 13 hours agoparentFrom the article> “The false assumption is that most SSL implementations return the server time,” Simen said. “This was probably true in a Microsoft-only ecosystem back when they implemented it, but at that time [when STS was introduced], OpenSSL was already sending random data instead.”And they link the reason for sending random data at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailarchive.ietf.org&#x2F;arch&#x2F;msg&#x2F;tls&#x2F;_clS-TIIlZUcid_2S4...The post starts with> Here&#x27;s something I wrote about removing a fingerprinting opportunity from the current TLS protocol.So the point is not that it was a bad idea, it is that MS didn&#x27;t keep up with the world and didn&#x27;t respond to requests from their customers to fix the problem. reply misnome 13 hours agorootparentBut, their _starting position_ is that they can&#x27;t trust the network> “Since the device is not in a state to communicate securely over the network, it cannot obtain time securely over the network as well, unless you choose to ignore network security or at least punch some holes into it by making exceptions.”So, because they can&#x27;t trust the network, or the time, they instead choose to randomly trust some of the requests over the network.But it&#x27;s okay because they rely on the certificate from that request to report whether it has been revoked or not. reply JohnFen 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, I read that.I think that if you&#x27;re making mission-critical systems rely on nonguaranteed behavior from systems you don&#x27;t control, then it&#x27;s a Bad Idea. reply biogene 4 hours agorootparentThe point is that it was guaranteed behavior before the spec was changed. As an aside, I do find it amusing that the memo was co-authored by a Googler. Google has the best fingerprinting & tracking tech baked into their core products. I guess they don&#x27;t want competition! :)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;id&#x2F;draft-mathewson-no-gmtunixti... reply rcme 13 hours agorootparentprevI mean it still seems like a bad idea reply cratermoon 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, when I read about SSL returning the server time I thought of fingerprinting, and I&#x27;m glad to see that it was removed. The reason giving for using it – PRNG completely broken – gave me a WTF moment, too. A broken PRNG is gonna cause a lot more trouble in SSL (TLS) than a non-random random field. reply gopher_space 11 hours agoparentprev> That feature is simply insane.It really feels like someone&#x27;s thought experiment that was cargo-culted into production. Timestamps are truthy to begin with, and mission-critical systems are designed to die and be reborn anew like the common Phoenix.

Like, why would the time service ever want to depend on all this insanity when if it has a network and everything else is bizarro world, just like scrape the time and date text from weather.gov.Or just accept that absent NTP, w32time maybe just shouldn&#x27;t try to set the clock to whatever a circus clown tells it?This sort of reminds me how there is a buried registry setting to tell w32time to not place the firmware clock at very high stratum in the time sources list which also is just a giant WTF in how those two behaviors were decided on. reply LeifCarrotson 14 hours agoparent> ...if it has a network...But that network is not trusted.Imagine this: You boot a machine for the first time, and the system clock tells you it&#x27;s January 1, 1970.

Sure, you can do that over SSL&#x2F;TLS. You send it a list of cipher suites and SSL&#x2F;TLS versions you can use, the weather.gov server selects a cipher and version, and sends you their certificate. It&#x27;s valid from Jun 2023 to Jun 2024, signed by a DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1 certificate valid Apr 2021 to Jun 2024, which is itself signed by the Digicert root global CA encoded into your OS&#x27;s root certificate store, valid Nov 2006 to Sun, Apr 2031.Wait a second. Or maybe 1.7 billion seconds. Are any of those certificates valid?

You absolutely should trust input from owner users, or if you won&#x27;t by default for some reason, you absolutely should give them the option to do so. Primarily, you should be giving them the choice as to what their system will do when it cannot reliably determine the actual time.The alternative is to pretend that you can somehow divine a &#x27;projected secure time.&#x27; Just, the gall to even write a sentence like that. reply bob-09 12 hours agorootparentIf your goal is to phase out local accounts and force microsoft.com logins as part of the computer setup, being able to trust your certificates seems like a prerequisite to being able to trust your users. And the correct time is a prerequisite to trusting your certificates. reply solardev 4 hours agorootparentThis makes no sense..? If the admin wants to change the clock to something else and make their certs invalid, they can always do so. It&#x27;s just for getting an initial handshake, and then after that NTP should keep working (at least until the next reset with a dead CMOS battery).There&#x27;s no way for the server to accurately determine the client&#x27;s hardware clock, barring some sort of user-hostile hardware clock with a nuclear battery or hardened GPS or radio time receiver or something. reply dylan604 11 hours agorootparentprev>&#x27;projected secure time.&#x27;It&#x27;s 5 o&#x27;clock somewhere! reply dullcrisp 10 hours agorootparentIt’s 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z somewhere reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentprevBut the user input thing is not the rule, its a specific case of the more general rule regarding external data generally.It definitely applies even more to the data it is trusting in this case. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentprev> You don&#x27;t have a secure network if you don&#x27;t know what time it isYes, that&#x27;s a very good reason not to trust the network to tell you what time it is.Unfortunately, Windows, because it doesn&#x27;t trust the network in the broad sense, relies on specific and known-to-be-unreliable SSL handshake data on the network to reset the clock. reply jmholla 13 hours agorootparentprevBut this isn&#x27;t just impacting machines at first boot.

Lots of systems forget the time when they power cycle because of bad batteries or other trouble. reply pixl97 12 hours agorootparentI mean, at that point the system should go to the IT group and be fixed. reply Varriount 14 hours agoparentprevThis is what puzzles me - while time drift does occur, it tends to be in the form of minor errors which build up over time; large jumps are relatively rare. You&#x27;d think the mechanism described in the article would have a failsafe ensuring that only minor time recalibrations are performed. reply toast0 14 hours agorootparentIt kind of depends. There&#x27;s a lot of poor clocks at boot up time, but a continuously running host usually doesn&#x27;t get too off, too quickly; I&#x27;ve seen some things, but even at 10% fast&#x2F;slow, you don&#x27;t have to jump days unless you&#x27;re checking infrequently.On the other hand, with virtualization, who knows how long it&#x27;s really been between clock ticks. Let&#x27;s say someone suspends a VM for a couple months and then unsuspends it; hopefully the clock is synchronized, but maybe it isn&#x27;t, and you do need to jump ahead.I thought I saw in the article that there are failsafes, but the allowed range is still pretty broad. But reporting is going to tend to be dominated by larger values, because smalller jumps are less likely to be noticed or more likely to be considered an accidental change. reply Wowfunhappy 14 hours agorootparentEvery VM software I&#x27;ve ever used automatically syncs the guest OS&#x27;s clock to the host OS&#x27;s clock. I&#x27;ve never used VMs in a server context, but do servers not do this too? It seems like the logical solution here. reply toast0 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve certainly had issues with time sync in the past, and Windows has a wide range of deployment, so I would imagine they can&#x27;t rely on it. reply HPsquared 14 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of machines out there with a dead battery on the real time clock. Every time they boot, the time is miles out and at some system-determined zero point. reply magicalhippo 8 hours agorootparentImagine one could make an approximate clock that does not rely on batteries or similar things that can expire. How close would it need to be to the actual time to be useful? Does it have to be within a day, or could it be within a week or a month? reply deepsun 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s already discussed in the article -- because to determine that weather.gov connection is sound and not hacked, you first need to check its certificate expiration date. Chicken&#x2F;Egg problem. reply ragebol 14 hours agorootparentWhy not let the user at least give an estimate for the current time & date. Should be close enough for certificate validation.Yes, that gets annoying fast for said user, but a good incentive to eg fix the bios battery. reply orf 13 hours agorootparentImagine there is no user, and there are thousands of machines reply cwilkes 10 hours agorootparentJust have those machines randomly ask one another for the time. Because of the Wisdom of Crowds the time will eventually be right.&#x2F; sarcasm reply yetanotherloss 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the point, if you can&#x27;t trust the connection, stop trying to come up with more complicated ways to use the untrustable connection and accept that there is no safe way to update time. reply oskarw85 6 hours agorootparentThat means your server could not serve HTTPS traffic at all, because you need valid timestamp for that. reply deepsun 12 hours agorootparentprevOk, so the system should fail to boot, right? reply yetanotherloss 9 hours agorootparentIf for some reason an invalid time causes boot failure? Sure. There are some instrumented devices I work with that will alarm and cease operation if they lose their serial connection to a satellite clock, but those are few and far between.But since the vast majority of them do not fail in that matter if the normal, configured methods of determining time aren&#x27;t working, using TLS parameters that have been deliberately randomized by standard for like what, a decade now?, can not possibly be a more straightforward failure mode than logging errors and waiting for operator input.If it&#x27;s that critically important, embed a fixed signature for a set of known time sources and query those as a last resort. Microsoft certainly has the resources to set up a few to do this the much more obvious and predictable way. reply simendsjo 13 hours agoparentprev> I can&#x27;t imagine the sequence of horrible decisions that led to doing this.My guess is that it was created because of Windows Phone 10.

But accurate time syncing is less common than you&#x27;d think :) reply nneonneo 13 hours agoprevI wonder if this feature might be “infectious”: if a handful of servers wind up with the wrong time, and start propagating that wrong time in their server handshakes, it might cause a cascade of other servers to reset their times too.In any case, it seems like a poor solution especially given that random timestamps can occasionally look valid (they’re random!).The problem they’re trying to solve seems to be to obtain a trustworthy timestamp in the presence of a potentially hostile network - one that could be presenting expired, cracked certificates for every connection to arbitrarily tamper with all SSL connections. It’s not a trivial problem, for sure, but resetting perfectly valid clocks using this algorithm seems like a strict downgrade…. reply cratermoon 13 hours agoparentAt the very least the system should do what NTP does: refuse to change the system time if the delta is too large. reply simendsjo 13 hours agorootparentFunny thing is that it does refuse to change the time when the delta is large. So it trusts these random bytes in the TLS handshake blindly, but when it gets the correct time from the time server some seconds later, it doesn&#x27;t dare to change the time as the delta is too large! reply przemeq 15 hours agoprevWow, we encountered a similar problem on one of our servers. We couldn&#x27;t determine the cause. We set up an alarm to notify us when such a change occurs, and we&#x27;ve developed a procedure to handle the consequences. Great discovery! reply mlichvar 14 hours agoprevA better solution to secure bootstrapping of time would be NTP+NTS (RFC 8915) using self-signed certificates with unlimited time validity, which can be preloaded with the OS and updated via normal OS updates if the server key is compromised. They would probably need to run their own servers. There are some public NTS servers (e.g. Cloudflare and Netnod), but I have not seen any using long-term certificates specifically for this use case. reply spartanatreyu 10 hours agoprevA bit of a tangent, but this time-checking heuristic reminds me of the game \"Halo 3: ODST\".The story takes place in a future African megacity before, during, and after an alien invasion. Part of the game&#x27;s story is shown from an AI&#x27;s perspective who controls the city&#x27;s operations trying to evacuate the Human survivors.Whenever the story is shown through the AI&#x27;s perspective, you can see an overlay of the AI&#x27;s working memory including which suburb&#x27;s cameras are being monitored, the emotional state of the AI, and the current running timestamp.Some of the aliens end up withdrawing from within the city by making an FTL jump which causes extreme localised time dilation.Immediately afterwards, the timestamp in the AI&#x27;s working memory is frozen because it&#x27;s not sure what the exact timestamp is anymore, each system it connects to gives it a slightly different time depending on how close it was to the FTL event.It guesses a likely time and uses that until sometime later it is able to reconnect with other unaffected human networks and resumes the correct timestamps.This time heuristic was shown in the game, but also makes an appearance of sorts in the announcement trailer (seen in the bottom right): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WroxHMo6B_k reply predictabl3 8 hours agoparentI am so happy you shared this here, I had no idea.

Fun to finally know why it happened reply zokier 14 hours agoprevWhile this Windows feature does sound quite bonkers as described, it is also baffling to me that the timekeeping on computers is such a mess; would it really be that difficult to have my multithousand dollar computer keep time at least as well as a dollar-store quartz watch? Have time already set in factory, and be correct to within few hours at least; enough to do networking and more accurate time syncing safely. reply taylodl 14 hours agoparentYour dollar-store quartz watch isn&#x27;t on a worldwide network communicating with other watches where there needs to be an agreement on what time it is. The watch also expects you to notice when the time drifts and for you to correct it. That includes DST adjustments, leap second adjustments, and physically moving to different timezones.Even when using an NTP server to set your time, network latencies have to be taken into account. Otherwise, if the request took 300ms round-trip and that weren&#x27;t accounted for then your machine is already 300ms off from \"official\" time. Depending upon what you&#x27;re doing, being that far off can be critical.These are things your dollar-store quartz watch simply doesn&#x27;t need to concern itself with. reply 8organicbits 10 hours agorootparent> That includes DST adjustments, leap second adjustments, and physically moving to different timezones.Does it? My system&#x2F;bios time is in UTC. The timezone is not managed for me, when I travel I change it. DST and leap seconds are deltas you add to UNIX epoch. Tracking the number of ticks since epoch is a simpler task, much closer to what a quartz watch attempts to do on its own. Both fail when the battery does, of course.If your end user facing application can&#x27;t handle 300ms drift that seems like a bug in the application. Even stuff like TOTP generators let you apply a time delta correction and servers usually allow >1 minute drift. reply pixl97 12 hours agorootparentprevI mean for SSL purposes, no that&#x27;s not really needed that much. Micro seconds don&#x27;t matter as certs typically expire on a monthly to yearly basis. And those that expire closer to monthly are typically updated on a regular basis.If you have a critical need for leap second time you&#x27;re typically using your own means of NTP and not Microsofts broken ass bullshit. reply kmeisthax 14 hours agoparentprevThe problem of computer timekeeping lives on the margins. Your computer is probably more accurate than the quartz watch, but there&#x27;s all sorts of ways that timekeeping can fail even on a system that&#x27;s accurately counting time when on. Many of these have to do with early boot or unattended scenarios where trustworthy sources of time data are scarce or difficult to reach. e.g. maybe the motherboard clock chip is five months off because of a firmware bug or something, and this is a server so there&#x27;s no user to notice the incorrect time and not having it set itself would cause catastrophic application failures somewhere else. Computer timekeeping is a comedy of errors. reply jstanley 14 hours agoparentprevComputers do do this. The problem is that some computers are quite old and the battery that keeps the real-time clock running has gone flat. That means if the computer is powered off it forgets what time it is.If your quartz watch battery goes flat you replace it straight away because a watch with a flat battery is 100% useless. But if the battery on your motherboard goes flat you don&#x27;t even notice, so why would you replace it? To a layperson, \"my computer&#x27;s time is always wrong\" is not likely to be caused by a random flat battery that they didn&#x27;t know existed.Microsoft came up with this \"Secure Time\" system so that even computers with flat batteries would be able to work out what time it is, but obviously it is kind of weird and sometimes makes wrong decisions. reply pixl97 12 hours agorootparentFixing computers with a broken batteries sounds just about as smart as\"Microsoft came up with an internet boot image that allows your computers to boot windows even if the hard drive is dead without users realizing this is the case\"Honestly, when the battery dies, it&#x27;s time to take it to the shop. reply orbital-decay 14 hours agorootparentprevTimepieces last a decade on a shirt button sized battery. Surely you can afford a bit larger battery on a motherboard, probably even a rechargeable one, make the clock sufficiently autonomous from the rest of the system, and make the motherboard not boot when it doesn&#x27;t have the battery, so you can leave it unattended for a while. reply einr 2 hours agorootparentThe CR2032 on a PC motherboard does usually last for about a decade, and the BIOS (or, well, UEFI) will scream about the CMOS battery being dead when you boot it. It will not refuse to boot, but it will tell you that the battery is dead and&#x2F;or that its settings are corrupt and alert you to change it. reply HPsquared 14 hours agoparentprevComputers have a lot more temperature variations than a typical quartz watch.

A few $ at most should get you one.This shouldn&#x27;t be overkill for a server dedicated to timekeeping on a large company network, right?In a datacenter one could even go for a matchbox sized atomic clock. Last I checked (years ago) such a miracle device could be had for ~$1500.Then: how often does atomic clock (or even TXCO) fail, in practice? My guess: only about as often as even the backup power fails.Note that either should provide accurate timekeeping without even going outside a physical location.

HOME LATEST NEWS TIPS & GUIDES REVIEWS THE BESTS CULTURE REPORT OPINION ANIME We may earn a commission from links on this page NEWS Nintendo Is Trying To Patent Some Really Broad Tears Of The Kingdom Mechanics Loading screen maps and movement physics are just some of the Zelda elements Nintendo is trying to patent Nintendo The Legend Of Zelda By Kenneth Shepard PublishedFriday 4:25PM Comments (28) Screenshot: Nintendo / Kotaku Nintendo is registering several new patents from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that are extremely broad, to the point where they seem unreasonable for other developers to be beholden to. Automaton, a gaming website that focuses on Japanese games like Zelda, has a roundup of the 32 patents Nintendo put forth. Some of them are specific to Link’s latest adventure, including things like Riju’s lightning ability, which lets the player target enemies with a bow and bring down a lighting strike wherever the arrow lands. The weirder ones are related to baseline game design and coding that applies to plenty of other video games on the market. One of the hopeful patents relates to the physics of a character riding on top of a moving vehicle and reacting dynamically to it in a realistic manner. Image: J-Plat Pat via Automaton (Fair Use) The distinction, according to Automaton’s translation of Japanese site Hatena Blog user nayoa2k’s post on the matter, is down to how Tears of the Kingdom codes these interactions. Link and the objects he rides on move together at the same speed, rather than Link being technically stationary on top of a moving object as is common in the physics of other games. The two are functionally the same, but given that plenty of video games displayed characters who can walk around on top of moving vehicles, it’s highly unlikely this kind of approach hasn’t been utilized before. On top of trying to patent the tech, Nintendo seeks to patent the loading screen that shows up when the player is fast-traveling across Hyrule. This specifically refers to the screen that shows the map transition from the player’s starting point to their destination. Sure, that’s pretty specific and not something every game utilizes, but it’s still such a general concept that it feels almost petty to patent it when it’s hardly an iconic draw of Tears of the Kingdom. Top Articles on Kotaku 01:12 Cop Arrested And Fired For Allegedly Stealing Pokémon Cards It’s not uncommon for game developers to try to patent mechanics and features. One of the most famous examples is when Bandai Namco had a patent on loading screen mini-games, which finally ended in 2015. Who knows if these patents actually go anywhere? But when game design concepts are gatekept like this, it only leads to a loss of innovation for other devs. Though these specific patents are small in the grand scheme of things, they can be a slippery slope for things like WB patenting Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis System, which should be in more games.

The more patents on gameplay are granted, the more they&#x27;ll be applied for by big companies who will eventually end up with big patent portfolios they can use to shut down other games from reusing cool mechanics, whether from big companies or indie studios.The potential for killing off novelty entirely (or slowing it down to a trickle) in game development is definitely there long term.This reminds of Cory Doctorow&#x27;s recent essay on the trend towards owning and extracting rent on things rather than actually producing them[0].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluralistic.net&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;rent-to-pwn&#x2F; reply sooheon 18 hours agoparentGreat link.

Konami patented beatmania&#x27;s keysounding[0] and DDR[1]&#x27;s control scheme and effectively had veto rights on competing rhythm games for decades. And they enforced those rights very strictly:- They sued Andamiro for Pump it Up, a competing dance game with five panels arranged diagonally. Andamiro was able to settle with Konami, possibly because they&#x27;d found some prior art that limited the DDR patent, which is the only reason why we still have PIU today.- They sued RoXoR for In The Groove, a proprietary[2] fork of StepMania, which is a DDR clone. In The Groove was designed as a conversion kit for DDR cabinets as well as having dedicabs produced by Andamiro and then themselves. RoXoR settled and Konami basically got to kill ITG as part of the settlement.- They sued Pentavision for having keysounding in DJMAX, a competing DJ game that was popular in Korea. They settled with the end result being that Konami gets a permanent share of DJMAX sales and Japanese distribution rights for that game.- They sued AmuseWorld for EZ2DJ, although to be fair this one looks literally identical to five-key beatmania. They... sort of just rebranded to EZ2AC and kept going, as far as I can tell from the Wikipedia page?Harmonix was involved with the ITG lawsuits at one point, so they wound up designing a more complicated and worse design-around for the keysounding patent in Guitar Hero. Other rhythm games not made by Konami also tend to have very generic keysounds (e.g. it just plays one sample).As for extracting rent... oh boy. There&#x27;s a reason why rhythm games disappeared from American and European arcades. To explain that I first need to provide some context. The ownership model that western arcade operators are used to is that they buy a very expensive machine (in the $10k+ range) and then get to rent it out to people for $1 a play or so. This is why private collectors and retro arcades exist and used to be how rhythm games worked too.Konami changed all this in Japan over two decades ago. First they added online capability with eAmusement - you could pay a monthly fee to get your arcade cabinets auto-updated. Then they added score tracking through NFC cards through the same service. Around 2011 they switched to a licensing model where arcade owners have to pre-pay a rev share for each play, and as part of this, the machines have always-online DRM. If your machine isn&#x27;t connected to Konami&#x27;s eAmusement VPN, it won&#x27;t boot, and if your revshare isn&#x27;t paid up it won&#x27;t accept payment from users.Outside of East Asia, arcade operators balked at all of this. Originally this just meant not having eAmusement passes to save scores on, but after they moved to licensing instead of ownership, we stopped getting DDR cabinets altogether. Dave & Busters still wanted to operate DDR though, so they somehow got Round1[3] to negotiate a joint order of DDR White Cabs running a special build of DDR A with an offline mode. You&#x27;re probably reading this and thinking that D&B is the good guy, except my local Round1&#x27;s arcade techs hate them for this, because major game updates are now expensive upgrade kits that frequently brick machines[4]. Furthermore, D&B is penny-pinching right now, so the A3 upgrade for all the NA-region DDR cabs got delayed by like a year while Round1 renegotiated with Konami.If you&#x27;re not D&B or Round1, you either operate decades-old DDR cabinets, Pump It Up[5], or StepManiaX, another dance game by the ITG people with better patent design-arounds.[0] When you press a button, the game makes the sound. It&#x27;s why you know immediately when you suck at Beatmania.[1] DanceDanceRevolution, not East Germany. (Formerly?) Known as \"Dancing Stage\" in Europe for this reason.[2] They convinced StepMania&#x27;s developers to relicense to MIT so they could license songs for ITG[3] Round1 is an arcade chain from Osaka with a US branch and a frightening ability to get Konami to license import cabs for the US. It is the closest you&#x27;ll get to the Japanese arcade experience in the US and you could probably film a shot-for-shot recreation of Lost in Translation in there.[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;EvilDave219&#x2F;status&#x2F;1691599463276564579[5] I have no clue if Andamiro&#x27;s also charges revshare and requires always-online but I suspect they are. reply NickC25 19 hours agorootparentGrew up on DDR back in the early 2000s as part of my workouts. Loved it immensely but when ITG came out, switched over immediately. I understand why Konami did what they did although I wished they didn&#x27;t, because it killed the genre. ITG had better UI&#x2F;UX, better tracks, better graphics, and equally important - better content. I was good enough that 10-footers like Max300 and Legend of MaxX were not cutting it, so when ITG came out and tracks like Vertex and Vertex^2 had a 12 foot rating, the game was really challenging. What wasn&#x27;t to like?Still have a version of the old StepMania running on a Mac I bought in like 2002, with the ITG patch and probably 500+ songs. I bust that out from time to time. Still great fun.Honestly I miss that whole scene, my local arcade had 10 or so guys that were really good and the online community was great too. Wish rhythm games made a comeback. reply kmeisthax 18 hours agorootparentI would highly recommend checking out Zenius-i-vanisher&#x27;s arcade search[0], you might have a local operator with something worth playing. Even if it&#x27;s just StepManiaX. Actually, SMX is pretty cool on its own, I shouldn&#x27;t talk about it like it&#x27;s the red-headed stepchild of dance games.Speaking of UI&#x2F;UX... that&#x27;s actually the reason why I prefer Pump It Up to DDR right now. DDR A has this extremely irritating menu noise. If I want to switch from level 7 to 8, I have to BZZ-BZZ-BZZ-BZZ-BZZT up, close the level 7 folder, open the level 8 folder, BZZ-BZZ-BZZ-BZZ-BZZT down through the song list, etc. Pump&#x27;s UI noises are far more tolerable, you can pick songs from the dance pad, and you can quickly get in and out of different level folders. StepManiaX actually takes this one step further and just makes the monitor a touch screen so you can swipe through songs.DDR actually rebalanced their level curve a while back, so MAX 300 is now a level 15 instead of a 10-footer, and the scale goes up to 20. So there&#x27;s harder stuff now, but top-level players still want stuff harder than that, and complain that DDR isn&#x27;t giving it to them. I don&#x27;t know about SMX but Pump has some pretty insane high-level charts[1] that I will probably never be good enough to clear.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenius-i-vanisher.com&#x2F;v5.2&#x2F;arcades.php[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yQ8DPAD2zCs reply zkldi 18 hours agorootparentprevfun addendum: StepmaniaX doesn&#x27;t have note receptors because konami&#x27;s patents for DDR are so broad that the idea of notes scrolling towards a visible note outline is something they can sue you for.I believe that patent has expired now at this point, but it&#x27;s the reason StepmaniaX doesn&#x27;t have receptors.Similarly this is the reason games like Guitar Hero&#x2F;Rock Band&#x2F;ITG have hallway style viewports instead of straight lines. It was to mitigate the patents on having things scroll towards receptors in a straight line. reply PaulHoule 19 hours agorootparentprevOuch!What I find funny about it is that Breath of the Wild is a story-based game and competes with a movie or a book in a certain respect, but that DDG has no plot (though you could apply the \"scene analysis\" from the Meisner school to a situation like that.)For a game like \"Breath of the Wild\" one is left wondering if you could patent a trope in a movie, as opposed to depending on this kind of IP lawhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;theipcenter.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;copyright-cartoon-images&#x2F;but DDR is something entirely different. reply jncfhnb 20 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s the significance of 0? Is it just playing a sound on the key press?Is it something more nuanced like playing the sound on the press without waiting for the next frame to tick? reply kmeisthax 20 hours agorootparentYes, keysounding in beatmania is literally just playing a sound when you press a key.Harmonix keysounding works a bit differently. If you press the strum bar with the wrong frets pressed, it plays a generic error noise and cuts out the guitar&#x2F;bass&#x2F;drum portion of the song until you play another note correctly. It&#x27;s arguably easier to chart since you just need separate audio tracks for each instrument, but the main reason this was done was to avoid a second Konami lawsuit. reply iamjackg 18 hours agorootparentDo you have a source on that being the reason? I&#x27;m extremely curious. The amount of work it takes to keysound a track (and figure out hot to not make it awkward at lower difficulty levels) seems like a much more reasonable reason not to do it, especially since there is some evidence[0] that Konami and Activision might have struck a deal for patent access, and even ended up collaborating to manufacture and distribute Guitar Hero Arcade.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamedeveloper.com&#x2F;pc&#x2F;exclusive-exploring-i-guita... reply kmeisthax 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have hard sources on Harmonix keysounding and may have misremembered things[0], or this might just be community misinformation. The article you are linking to concerns Guitar Hero III, which was made by Neversoft after Activision bought RedOctane without Harmonix. At that point they had enough money to pay for patent licenses. The amount of money being spent on guitar games in the US was utterly insane at this point (and part of the reason why they died off so quickly).A few years prior they did NOT have that kind of money. The history of Guitar Hero is that RedOctane was involved in manufacturing third-party softpads for people importing DDR home games from Japan. They saw GuitarFreaks in a Japanese arcade and contracted Harmonix to build a game around a guitar controller. The game they made, Guitar Hero, was startlingly low budget, with loads of covers[1]. Nobody had any money to license patents.In terms of the cost of actually keysounding a track, relative to Harmonix&#x27;s patent workaround... I&#x27;m not entirely sure. It could go either way. I could imagine some automated&#x2F;cheap way to do &#x27;good enough&#x27; keysounding could have been made, especially since they&#x27;re already charting out note data.[0] For example, I said Harmonix was involved in the ITG lawsuit but it was actually RedOctane who published ITG. I&#x27;d edit my comment but I can&#x27;t find the edit link.[1] Which arguably worked in the game&#x27;s favor - I do remember people noting that the all-masters-all-the-time approach of Guitar Hero World Tour made playing vocals feel strange. reply lewispollard 20 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s just playing a sound on the keypress, but each note in the song has an individual sound assigned to it that matches the song. In Beatmania iirc, the sound assigned to each note is the section of the song itself, meaning if you miss a note, the song stops playing until you hit a correct note. reply kmeisthax 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just if you miss a note, the song stops playing. If you&#x27;re off on your timing, the song plays off. If you press the wrong button, the wrong part of the song plays. All of this is immediate and obvious audio feedback that you don&#x27;t really get from other rhythm games, because all the workarounds for beatmania keysounding can&#x27;t do this.You know those YouTube videos of people playing whole songs on a DAW control surface? beatmania is literally just that with a scrolling note chart and a judgment of your performance, except it came out in like 1997. reply x0x0 18 hours agorootparentprevHey, this was a fascinating read.

So no one else is making anything like it.

You could probably get a similar emergent behaviour from older systems like goal-oriented action planning, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if games like Dwarf Fortress already had something similar. reply bluefirebrand 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s probably true, but the specific implementation in the Mordor games is pretty unique. It&#x27;s not just emergent gameplay, there&#x27;s elements of deliberate action in there. The game selects certain enemies to become \"resurrected\" to come back stronger and become your longterm rivals.The enemies are also generated with perks and flaws based on the available game mechanics. These orcs return to fight you again, they often have upgrades themselves to resist or be immune to the ways you killed them previously.Taken individually none of these mechanics are novel I don&#x27;t think. But this particular implementation is pretty unique. I&#x27;d love to see similar things in other games. Like Mech pilot rivalries in a Mecha game or something similar. But games aren&#x27;t copying it, despite how well received it was. I can only think it&#x27;s due to some kind of patent licensing issue. reply insanitybit 20 hours agorootparentprevOne of the techniques when you file a patent is to come up with as many variations of an idea as possible. You don&#x27;t even need to have built those ideas into an implementation. So maybe I say \"This patent is for playing a sound right when a button is pressed\" but I expand it to \"and right before and right after, based on some cadence, or a configuration\", etc etc etc. This makes patents both precise and very broad, leaving little room for someone to go \"ah but I did it differently\". reply edgyquant 20 hours agorootparentCouldn’t this be fixed by requiring an implementation to patent? reply insanitybit 20 hours agorootparentI think that would have its own issues, such as creating a significant burden on both the person filing (who the system is designed to protect) as well as the patent office having to verify the implementation. I think it would be very complex.Really, patents should just expire after 5 years by default, possibly with exceptional grants for 10 years. I think 5-10 years is plenty of time to establish yourself in a market, and if at that point your competitors start competing, well, you had your grace period. reply PeterisP 17 hours agorootparentprevNo, because one of the traditional use-cases why patents were made is so that an inventor of a novel solution can get investment to get that invention actually implemented without risking that the investors will just steal the invention; or that the inventor can contract a manufacturing company to make the prototype without risking that they will just include the invention in their own products.So being able to secure a patent before its first implementation is made is pretty much a non-negotiable requirement. reply brightlancer 11 hours agorootparentPatents are often not directly exploited by the holder; instead, the holder sits and waits decfor someone else to build a working tool, then sues.So, yes, folks should be able to secure a parent before they&#x27;re able to build and sell a working product, _but_ it should be a requirement that they build and sell within a shorter time-frame than the length of the patent, e.g. the patent is for X years and I have to build and sell within 0.2*X years or the patent is rejected. reply PeterisP 1 hour agorootparentIt seems to make sense, but is problematic in practice - for example, for pharmaceuticals it might take half of the total patent time until you are able to sell a product based on the patent, as getting FDA approval could take something like 8 years if they ask for more trials.Also, patents make sense also for things that are not for sale to general public - for example, an invention to improve some machines that you use in your factory, but aren&#x27;t selling to other factories i.e. your competitors; consumer products are the thing that is visible, but B2B products matter even more. reply OkayPhysicist 16 hours agorootparentprevIt could also be fixed by making the penalty for filing an invalid patent prohibitively high. If someone proves prior art, you have to pay them \"a mountain of cash\". That way, there&#x27;s A) a real risk in making your patent any broader than it needs to be and B) an incentive for law firms specialize in killing patents for the reward payout. reply insanitybit 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s going to make it way easier for large companies who can afford a team of lawyers to hunt through potential infringements (and defend them). The cost of filing a patent is already really high (1000s, 10s of thosands) even without that. reply concordDance 20 hours agorootparentprevA game consists of many mechanics combined. A great game needs all of them to work and licensing deals have very high transaction costs.

Then you&#x27;ll be able to play with different accounts.Usually most people only have one Switch so this never is a problem. However, if you&#x27;ve switched consoles and you didn&#x27;t do System Transfer, you need to manually switch over the home console in order to get your offline play rights back.Alternatively your partner may have explicitly set their home account to someone else&#x27;s system. There&#x27;s a mildly pirate-y[0] thing you can do with a friend where you log into your account on their system and they log into your system with their account, and then you have a shared game pool. In order to be able to play on your own account you need to swap the home console associations around so your friend&#x27;s Switch is your home console and vice versa. But if you do this you can never play your own games on other accounts, since your friend&#x27;s the one who took that half of the license.[0] As in, it bends the rules of the DRM in ways Nintendo probably does not intend and thus probably violates a license agreement somewhere reply semiquaver 21 hours agorootparentprevI don’t disagree with the sentiment but you’re straight wrong on the need to buy multiple copies of a game to play on different profiles on a single switch. reply alexilliamson 21 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s odd...

Repetitive use of same IP over 30+ years, 100%. Its like Fast N Furious or other movie franchises that just publish a slightly different version on some cadence. If you really like it, then yes those would be great games for you.I recently fired up the original NES Zelda game and it was fun. I also got a switch and BoTW and the original is more fun. There is so much filler and repetitive game mechanics that don&#x27;t add to the game at all in BoTW. Game companies keep adding stuff to lengthen game play loops and this ends up in tedious, repetitive gaming sessions which after some point I don&#x27;t find enjoyable.Its art though so to each their own and in my opinion you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to patent art. reply PsylentKnight 18 hours agorootparentYou say the games don&#x27;t change significantly, then you say the games have changed in a way you don&#x27;t like.Yes, they use the same IP&#x27;s for decades but they remain relevant because they do new things with those IP&#x27;s. BoTW completely bucked the Zelda formula. ToTK was so successful because they didn&#x27;t try to just ride off the success of its predecessor - they did a lot of new stuff.A far better comparison to Fast N Furious would be Madden. reply matt_s 17 hours agorootparentI get tired of the same story being repeated, maybe I could have worded it better - thats the part that they just recycle all the time. Yeah they aren’t releasing new games on a yearly basis but when they do its the same characters and nearly the same story lines. BoTW is about rescuing the princess, so is the orig Zelda. Yes there are different mini-boss fights, puzzles, etc. and they can be fun but its certainly not a new original story.I like how with Batman and Joker movies different directors&#x2F;actors have a different take on the characters or setting (gritty vs campy humor, etc.) and I don’t mind similar story elements being re-used. I don’t like that in most video games for some reason. Horizon Zero Dawn was awesome, same with Last of Us (game), haven’t looked at a sequels, they look like more of the same.

Hell, BoTW is ALSO another re-interpretation of the story and characters reply matt_s 13 hours agorootparentI’m not asking for anything, Nintendo is going to do whatever they want with their video game art form. I’m just commenting that I’ve found for most video games with story elements I don’t like repeat&#x2F;rehashing a story. For whatever reason I’m ok with that sometimes in movies. I got through most of BoTW but just can’t pick it back up to finish, so I don’t.Maybe the difference for me is with a movie, I’m just along for the ride and have no input into anything, but with a video game I’m playing the main character and when I’ve played that same exact main character with that same overall story arc I just don’t find it interesting. The other element I think is my age, I’m finding less consumable media (tv, movies, games, books, sports) enjoyable as I get older. There are things I still really enjoy but genres of them that I used to and now I don’t find interesting. reply larrik 18 hours agorootparentprevI disagree with everything you said, lol. Besides the original NEW Zelda being fun.Nintendo is very sparing in how often they make mainline games in their IP (besides Pokemon). Mario has had one main 3d game in a decade. Zelda had 6 years between BoTW and ToTK, and 5 years between BoTW and it&#x27;s predecessor. Everyone of those (Mario and Zelda) until ToTK was completely different, with a different feel and different mechanics. reply pfannkuchen 11 hours agorootparentI think a lot of what makes the games special is the level of polish vs other studios.

Sure all those games have Mario in it, but they’re only the same in the sense that the Mandalorian takes place in the same galaxy as Star Wars Ep 4. I would never compare this franchise (or Zelda) with Fast and Furious or even something like CoD. And I don’t know how you can call the IP repetitive when the only constant in all the games I listed is Mario. It’s not like FIFA that updates every year with a new roster and the exact same game.The reason I love playing these game is because they do innovate and create completely new games even if it’s the same franchise. reply m3kw9 16 hours agorootparentprevEvery fps is just new graphics and few mechanic changes, no more different than sequels, at least Nintendo does it better than anyone reply ninedays 18 hours agorootparentprevCouldn&#x27;t disagree more with the first 2 paragraphs.

Miles better than the first-party outputs from Sony or Nintendo.Apparently, though, their corporate culture is VERY Japanese and kind of crappy. I know someone who negotiated with them directly and although the gentleman was and remains a massive fan of Nintendo, the experience put a bad taste in his mouth.Wish Nintendo would also listen to fans and give some of their lesser IP a fresh coat of paint.

The only ability that is actually usable (and only really outside of combat) is Tulin&#x27;s gust of wind; everything else is a struggle to make useful.You have to walk up to a sage (they keep running around trying to fight enemies; and they all have an identical color palette; so it&#x27;s super awkward and error-prone), press a button, and only then you get to make use of the ability. The more sages you summon, the bigger the crowd, the bigger the problem. Even the one sage that does not appear as a ghost still has a broadly similar palette (and on top of that, identical to a class of enemies). Compare with BotW, where you also get broadly similar abilities, but using each one was a decision you could execute in a split second using a dedicated key combo&#x2F;mechanic, and all of them were directly viable in combat.If Nintendo were to hold a patent on this bullshit and thusly prevent it from being implemented in any other game, they&#x27;d do the gamers a favour.> Who knows if these patents actually go anywhere? But when game design concepts are gatekept like this, it only leads to a loss of innovation for other devs.True! There&#x27;s plenty of prior art for the remaining patents, so I sincerely doubt a lot of this would hold up in court. But the fact that this makes news at all is just proof of how rotten the system is; the patent doesn&#x27;t have to be standing on a firm ground before it can successfully deter from climbing the shoulders of giants, which is foundational to innovation.Nintendo has always been famous for pushing innovative gameplay, rather than endlessly refining the graphics on yet-another \"next-gen\" console that has all the same last year&#x27;s titles in a new package. Whatever patents they can hold, I don&#x27;t think it would help them: patents only help entrench your current position; Nintendo was always about moving forward. reply ot 22 hours agoparent> To be quite blunt, the sages&#x27; abilities are implemented absolutely horribly in this gameI agree 100%.

I’ve run into the same issues, makes the game not fun when you go to pick items up and initiate their power. Especially when their powers have a tendency to kill the frame rate.

I think the worst part is that they traded the open feeling of adventure in the original game, which felt quite lean on mechanics and different things to do, for a much more common open world style of gameplay.

But Nintendo hadn&#x27;t conceived of Smash as a competitive game and so they went alllll the way out of their way to shut that shit down in the next iteration. Lowered the speed of the game, made it way floatier so combos are harder, ensured there were no advanced movement techniques, and even introduced mandatory bullshit rng like the tripping mechanic. reply thaumasiotes 22 hours agoprev> Automaton, a gaming website that focuses on Japanese games like Zelda, has a roundup of the 32 patents Nintendo put forth.

    "originBody": "ts_zip: Text Compression using Large Language Models The ts_zip utility provided with the ts_server software can compress (and hopefully decompress) text files with Large Language Models. The compression ratio is much higher than with other compression tools. There are some caveats of course: Unlike NNCP, the language model must be available when decompressing. A GPU is mandatory to get a reasonable speed. Depending on the model size, the speed varies between a few kB/s to one hundred kB/s. The same exact GPU model and program versions must be used for compression and decompression. The model is frozen so it works only for text files in a language that the model has already seen. Compression Ratio The compression ratio is given in bits per byte for each model. CMIX v19 is one of the best lossless data compression program.

This allows for excellent compression, and I would assume (and have for a while, I suppose) the nearly-linear nature of LLMs allows for excellent interpolation between these very sparse states.This lets us &#x27;break&#x27; the hard-combinatorial problem into one that can be softly, albeit with the fuzzy error that comes with any estimator.Since computers cannot tractably compress markov chains past a certain point, this allows LLMs some opportunity to outpace traditional methods for compression, at least in theory.Also, this method technically cheats since you need the language model to decompress, which counts towards your dictionary size. In a truly unbounded case, I would be interested to see which method wins. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the LLM.Apologies for any factual inaccuracies or such, I am still learning many of these things. Many thanks and much love!outputs and there is some dimensionality reduction (though I think orthogonality would be a trait of an ideal system [i.e. an emergent property approached in the limit], not one that is explicitly enforced each step). reply nl 10 hours agorootparentprevThe link between compression and intelligence is a popular theory. Indeed the linked work here came out of the Hutter Prize:> The goal of the Hutter Prize is to encourage research in artificial intelligence (AI). The organizers believe that text compression and AI are equivalent problems. Hutter proved that the optimal behavior of a goal-seeking agent in an unknown but computable environment is to guess at each step that the environment is probably controlled by one of the shortest programs consistent with all interaction so far.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hutter_Prize reply angch 8 hours agorootparentNNCP (Bellard&#x27;s prelude to ts_zip, using similar techniques) is not qualified for Hutter Prize, btw, because hardware and speed limitations specified by Hutter Prize.\"Must run in ≲50 hours using a single CPU core and Turing awards are all theorists game, not engineersRobert Metcalfe just won the award for Ethernet.

It wouldn&#x27;t be a fair comparison otherwise reply NobodyNada 13 hours agoparentEvery lossless “compression” algorithm makes some strings shorter and other strings longer, such that the average space savings against all possible strings is neutral at best. This is a fundamental consequence of the way information works — there’s no way to losslessly map (say) 8 bits of input into 7 bits of output.The goal of compression, then, is to make common strings shorter while making uncommon strings longer. You can think of, say, UTF-8 as a simple compression algorithm: it would take 20 bits per character to encode all Unicode code points with a fixed-width encoding, but UTF-8 takes advantage of the fact that the most commonly used characters have a lot of leading zeroes (at least in English). So the characters of the English alphabet require only 8 bits to encode, but uncommon characters require up to 32 bits.Thus, I would expect an LLM-based compression algorithm to do well on strings that were common in its training data, and make strings that were uncommon or absent slightly longer. If it did not do that, it would not be a lossless compression algorithm. reply freedmand 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t disagree with anything you said.I&#x27;m saying more that if the compression algorithm is benchmarking against \"Alice in Wonderland\" and has consumed the entirety of \"Alice in Wonderland\" in training the LLM (along with popular paragraphs and sentences quoted elsewhere), then it might do particularly well at reciting lines from that book and thus be able to compress it extremely well. I&#x27;d be more interested in seeing the compression algorithm&#x27;s performance on new or unreleased works that would have no way of being training data.As an extreme hypothetical, I could make a compression algorithm that is a table mapping an ID to an entire book and fill it with all the popular works. \"Alice in Wonderland\" would be replaced with a single short identifier string and achieve a ~0.001% compression ratio. An unseen work would be replaced with anID followed by the entire work and be slightly bigger. Then, I benchmark only the popular works and show insanely impressive results!I have no doubt the LLM compressor would do really well on unseen works based on what you said above, but it&#x27;s not a fair look at its performance to run it on works it may have been explicitly trained on. reply NobodyNada 3 hours agorootparentGotcha, sorry I completely misunderstood what you were asking!

This is a fundamental consequence of the way information works — there’s no way to losslessly map (say) 8 bits of input into 7 bits of output.I think I&#x27;m missing a point here. Is it a provable fact that all lossless compression algorithms are neutral at best? Or just something that occurs in the real world?I can&#x27;t think of a good example, so I&#x27;ll give a trivial example to explain my thinking.It seems to me that you could have an algorithm which did not change any text, except the sentence \"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\", which it encodes as something much shorter like \"\". The algorithm would be (very marginally) better than neutral. If this is true, then surely other improvements would be possible to make a lossless algorithm with real reduction.(Edited a typo) reply tarvaina 5 hours agorootparentThe impossibility of a general lossless compression algorithm is a consequence of the pigeon-hole principle.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pigeonhole_principle reply coryrc 6 hours agorootparentprevThen how do you encode an input of \"\"?

This is id always a pitfall when benchmarking LLM based techniques.

So if my calculations are correct, the LLM&#x27;s can perform 50% better then the best performing conventional compressors excluding the zipped LLM decompressor code (I am unsure about the size).The bpb ratio for each existing program can be calculated as: bpb ratio=(Original size (enwik9)Total size (enwik9+prog) )×8nncp v3.1: Given compressed size is not provided, we cannot calculate bpb for nncp v3.1 using enwik8.cmix v19: bpb=(14,837,987+223,485108)×8bpb=(10814,837,987+223,485 )×8 bpb≈1.205tensorflow-compress v4: bpb=(15,905,037+55,283108)×8bpb=(10815,905,037+55,283 )×8 bpb≈1.272cmix-hp 10 Jun 2021: Given compressed size is not provided, we cannot calculate bpb for cmix-hp using enwik8.fast-cmix: Given compressed size is not provided, we cannot calculate bpb for fast-cmix using enwik8.starlit 31 May 2021: bpb=(15,215,107108)×8bpb=(10815,215,107 )×8 bpb≈1.217phda9 1.8: bpb=(15,010,414+42,944108)×8bpb=(10815,010,414+42,944 )×8 bpb≈1.205paq8px_v206fix1: bpb=(15,849,084+402,949108)×8bpb=(10815,849,084+402,949 )×8 bpb≈1.265durilca&#x27;kingsize: bpb=(16,209,167+407,477108)×8bpb=(10816,209,167+407,477 )×8 bpb≈1.317 reply londons_explore 12 hours agoparent> The bpb value of rwkv_430M on enwik8 is 0.948 bpbThis is an unfair test, because the rwkv_430M model was almost certainly trained on wikipedia. Testing using training data is a big no-no in the ML world - you get unrealistically good results.To test this properly, it needs to be run on a bit of newly written text which is nowhere on the internet. Obviously writing 100 MB of human written text which is not already on the internet is rather a big task... reply ndriscoll 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s fair because the model itself is included in the compressed size. You&#x27;re not trying to extrapolate predictions. It makes perfect sense for compression \"at rest\" applications to intentionally overfit on the data you&#x27;re trying to compress if that gives a smaller total size(model ++ compressed text).If you were going to standardize on a foundational model that gets delivered to billions of devices to be used in network transfers (where you just transfer the compressed text and assume the other side already has the model), then it makes sense to optimize for generalizability. In that case it would make sense to exclude the model itself from the compressed size.

This is based on the idea of the Dictionary... IIRC, some compression systems include the Dictionary as part of the decompressor, to save space in the payload, but then that Dictionary is fixed and may be suboptimal for the data. Others include it in the payload, so that it&#x27;s optimal for the data, which most do.But you could achieve incredible compression of, say, The Complete Works Of Shakespeare if you knew your peer knew about The Complete Works Of Shakespeare (had a rich enough dictionary) and just send them that designator of the payload! Or, you could send them a particular high-resolution picture of a wheat field with cypresses under a blue sky with an appropriately specific \"description\".What Fabrice did is gone ahead and put this theoretical idea in practice. And that&#x27;s hilarious. reply sterlind 12 hours agoparentNotably, I think this would fail on the Wikipedia compression contest because that counts the size of the decompression program (model in this case), so that it measures Kolmogorov complexity.

I know that LLMs predict the log-likelihood of the next token in a sequence.. so I guess you initialize the LLM from scratch, say that each token of the input text is the Nth most likely possibility, and record what N is for that token? And then you do some combination of run-length encoding and Huffman trees or something to record the Ns?Since this is not open-source, but seems simple to do, perhaps I&#x27;ll make my own. reply Scene_Cast2 10 hours agoparentA slightly more elegant method would be to throw an arithmetic coder on the output vector (normalized and represented as an interval) and record the interval represented by the real token to be compressed. This would allow for better compression ratios than your approach, I think (due to arbitrary probability support).My potential issue with NNs for compression is that sometimes they predict near zero for some probabilities that actually occur in real data - in which case the number of bytes needed to encode would blow up. But that can be somewhat guarded against (perhaps by limiting the lower bound of output probabilities). reply TheMiddleMan 10 hours agoprevIs it reasonable to imagine a future where most devices come with a, say, 500MB file used for decompressing?Imagine the potential bandwidth savings.

This is a common mistake that people make, and is a popular expression making the rounds right now, but it is incorrect.Intelligence _may arise_ from information. Information _necessarily arises_ from compression.It is very similar, to me, to the concept of humors (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Humorism). Empirically, it was observed that these things had some correlation, and they occurred together, but they are not directly causative. Similarly with the theory of spontaneous generation (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spontaneous_generation), which was another theory spawned (heh, as it were), from casual causal correlation (again, as it were).This can be shown rather easily when you show that the time-dynamics of an exemplar system with high information diverge from the time dynamics of a system with high intelligence, i.e. there is a structural component to the information embedded in the system such that the temporal aspects of applied information are somehow necessary for intelligence.I hope to release some work at least tangentially related to this within the next few years (though of course it is a bit more high-flying and depends on some other in-flight work). If we are to attempt to move towards AGI, I really think we need to stick with the mathematical basics. Neural networks, although they&#x27;ve been made out to be really complicated, are actually quite simple in terms of the concepts powering them, I believe. That&#x27;s something I&#x27;m currently working on putting together and trying to distill to its essence. That will also be at least 1-2 years out, and likely before any temporally-related work, all going well. In my experience, this all is just a personal belief from a great deal of time and thought with the minutia of neural networks. That said, I could perhaps be biased with some notion of simplicity, since I&#x27;ve worked with them long enough for some concepts to feel comfortably second-nature. reply derefr 11 hours agorootparentI think what the GP meant is not that compressed data has intelligence, but rather that a compressor is necessarily \"intelligent\" in correlation to the degree that it compresses well on arbitrary novel datasets it wasn&#x27;t tuned for. At least insofar as we define \"intelligence\" with measures like IQ, that relate to \"number of examples of a pattern required to notice the pattern.\"To compress data, you have to derive some interesting insight about that data that allows the data to be projected into a lower-dimensional, lower-entropy embedding. (In pop-neurological terms, you have to \"make a neuron\" that represents a concept, so that you can re-phrase your dataset into a star-schema expressed in its connections to that concept.)The more different kinds of things a single compressor can do that for — without the compressor itself being made larger — the more \"intelligent\" the compressor is, no? reply tysam_and 11 hours agorootparentYes, that is the point I&#x27;m addressing, I&#x27;m using Shannon&#x27;s definition of information and making an argument about the _temporal_ aspects of it. If you&#x27;re looking for a hint, it&#x27;s in the Lyapunov exponents of the system, which do not come necessarily from compression alone, though compression I feel is a critical part of the process.Hence, the set vs superset argument. reply bbstats 12 hours agorootparentprevOTOH true intelligence can still poorly compress things. reply tysam_and 12 hours agorootparentAny ERM-based method will have this flaw (if it is a flaw -- I&#x27;d possibly consider it a tradeoff) -- it is the nature of compression itself. I would make the argument, I think, that I believe that this disrupts the &#x27;information&#x27; layer of the hierarchy, not the &#x27;intelligence&#x27;, though that is just my personal 2 cents of course. reply YeGoblynQueenne 13 hours agoparentprev>> Reminder that compression = intelligence:If I conclude from this that you mean that gzip is intelligent, will I be accused of bad faith? reply canjobear 6 hours agoparentprevCompression is equivalent to learning but it&#x27;s not clear to me that that gets you all the way to intelligent action.

For example, zstd is a pretty good compressor, but does any one think it should be called a pretty good “AI”? reply londons_explore 12 hours agorootparentRead the paper...Zstd, while it might be better than gzip or bzip, is still a very poor compressor compared to an ideal compressor (which hasn&#x27;t yet been discovered).That is why zstd acts like a rather bad AI.
