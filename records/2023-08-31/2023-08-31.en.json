E.g. if I ran it every 6 months and last year \"db\" produced \"debug\", while this year it produces \"database\". Because talk about messing up my muscle memory and habits. And the language I write changes very much over time.So I&#x27;d actually be much more interested in a \"universal\" version of this -- if you ran it across books and e-mails and text messages from thousands of authors covering diverse backgrounds and contexts, then what would most reliably help everyone?E.g. expanding \"t\" to \"the\" seems like a no-brainer, just like \"st\" to \"something\". Is there a minimal set of, say, 200-500 of these that could simply be turned into a \"standard keyboard\" that everyone could learn? reply throwaway738393 9 hours agoparent> E.g. expanding \"t\" to \"the\" seems like a no-brainer, just like \"st\" to \"something\".

If using a QMK or other configurable keyboard, I could see this being on a dedicated modifier+chords. reply sosodev 11 hours agoparentprevIs the universal version of this stenotype? reply NateEag 11 hours agorootparentMore or less, yeah.There are different stenography systems, each with their own shortcuts and abbreviations, but at core they&#x27;re all about producing large volumes of text with minimal physical effort at very high speeds.Those interested should check out http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstenoproject.org&#x2F;.A good mechanical keyboard (e.g. the ErgoDox EZ) and Plover mean the only thing standing between you and >200 WPM typing is the time and effort to learn it. reply Exuma 10 hours agorootparentI hit this invisible wall at about 165 WPM that I can&#x27;t just get beyond, and it kills me. I wonder how fast I could get with stenography... I see dem 400 WPM videos and they look awesome. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 9 hours agorootparentCurious what kind of work you are doing where WPM is a limiting factor. I’m in software, like a lot of people here, so being able to type in speed is rarely the limiting factor. Besides stenographers, the only other line of work off the top of my head that needs this kind of speed are people who are paid to write subtitles for TV shows and movies in another language. Which I guess is just another form of stenography, when you unwrap it.Or is it not for work and it’s just purely to see how fast you can type? reply Exuma 9 hours agorootparentTyping fast is one of the greatest strengths for programming for me personally, especially when compared with Vim. It&#x27;s that that it&#x27;s a limiting factor, but rather I max out typing quite often, and also I have always wanted to hit 200 just for fun, but it currently feels not attainable.Some people say they spend more time than they do typing, but I definitely don&#x27;t find that to be the case very often. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 8 hours agorootparentI am a bit jealous (maybe?) that typing speed is a factor for you. I am the kind of person that will think for minutes at a time before writing a single line of code reply Exuma 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s definitely situation dependent. When writing a lot of frontend code (vue, typescript, css, tailwind, html) I know what I&#x27;m typing several mental steps before I actually type it, so speed gains there are most pronounced.Sitting somewhere in the middle are dynamic languages where there might be certain implementations (say... some random api integration) where it&#x27;s simply a lot of code I&#x27;ve typed thousands of times before. This still benefits from fast typing, especially when needing to operate surgically with vim, it&#x27;s one of the moments I love the most (basically getting 20x combos with perfect typing at high speed when moving&#x2F;modifying&#x2F;transforming blocks of text etc etc)What benefits least of the 3 is writing things like Golang where it still definitely helps typing fast, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I usually have to think more there. Pace is slower, and symbols can become a pain in the ass.At the end of the day... you&#x27;re still typing thousands of lines of code regardless of whether you&#x27;re thinking or not. I never understood the argument \"I spend more time thinking than coding\". You are still going to write the same amount of code whether you&#x27;re thinking or not. My ideal world (why I love typing fast) is that that time of me coding gets brought down by 50-200% over someone who types slow. I use that time for accelerating ahead. Ie... prototyping and deleting tons of code before refining&#x2F;cementing in a design is painless. reply the_af 7 hours agorootparent> I never understood the argument \"I spend more time thinking than coding\". You are still going to write the same amount of code whether you&#x27;re thinking or not.The argument is that time spent typing is insignificant compared to time spent thinking, so optimizing for WPM seems like a less relevant endeavor.So if you spend (say) 1 day thinking about the problem and 1 hour typing, it matters little if you can speed up your typing by 50% or whatever: you still spend the bulk of your day thinking, and optimizing typing speed is not going to change your deadlines.It sometimes seems people fetishize typing speed because that&#x27;s easier to get better at (and measure), while there are no shortcuts for thinking \"better\". reply Exuma 6 hours agorootparentI spend over 10+ hours a day typing at the computer, across slack, writing specs, writing code, etc. So really I suppose in my mind I don&#x27;t live in a vaccuum.I don&#x27;t fetishize it at all, in my mind it is a simple objective fact that I actually experience myself. Fast typing is up there with Vim as one of the literal most productive things I have ever done, with the 3rd being memorizing hundreds if not thousands of OS&#x2F;app hotkeys. reply gertlex 5 hours agorootparentWriting specs is a key bit here that I&#x27;d generalize as: I think by typing. The hardest problems I troubleshoot are worked through with best quality if I am typing up a worklog of stuff tried, rather than taking no notes at all. And like mentioned in other comments, the effort of typing these notes is a limiting factor on the quality of my notes (too much time spent typing slows the troubleshooting iteration loop). reply lycopodiopsida 2 hours agorootparentprevIt is either an objective fact, or something you experience, but it cannot be both. Having said it, have you actually measured how much time you spend typing, to claim a huge boost in productivity? Developers very often overstate the amount they type p.d.I can imagine, that going from pecking on keyboard to 10 fingers is actually huge - it is just a bump disappearing. But going from 80 wpm to 160 should have diminishing returns, even more so going from 160 to 320 - here, the Pareto principle should kick in. reply baq 2 hours agorootparentprevTyping is bursty. You don’t type much usually, but sometimes there’s a lot of it. Effortless typing minimizes interruptions and allows to stay in the zone for longer. It isn’t just about the time spent typing, it’s about typing at the speed of thought so you don’t switch contexts from thinking to typing. reply penteract 6 hours agorootparentprev> I never understood the argument \"I spend more time thinking than coding\". You are still going to write the same amount of code whether you&#x27;re thinking or not. My ideal world (why I love typing fast) is that that time of me coding gets brought down by 50-200% over someone who types slow.My perspective on this (I&#x27;m not a fast typist, but don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a big limitation) is that I can think while typing, so if I can type at least as fast as I can plan the next bit of code, there isn&#x27;t any benefit to typing faster.Of course, that isn&#x27;t the complete picture, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if typing out less concrete thoughts (which might mean the same as when you say \"prototyping and deleting tons of code\") might improve my code or speed me up in plenty of situations. It&#x27;s also possible there are things I avoid more than I should (such as writing short programs to see how some interface behaves) because I&#x27;m too slow at typing. reply Exuma 6 hours agorootparentIf you want my unsolicited 2 cents to help speed up (if you care!)1. put your fingers on home row keys with pointer fingers feeling the bumps on F and J2. DONT move your wrists all around, try to keep them still and let your fingers do all the work. try to keep your entire palms as still as possible, they really shouldnt move. I rest mine on my laptop surface.3. dont look at the keys. use https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typing.com to help you if you cant do that4. relax your hands as much as possibleTyping.com is better IMO if you don&#x27;t know how to type fast, and monkeytype.com is way more fun when you do (the interface is just way more fun) reply penteract 5 hours agorootparentThanks for the advice - I do 1 & 3 and I think I do 2 & 4 although that&#x27;s less true when writing things with symbols (such as code), or when navigating text (I don&#x27;t use vim). According to monkeytype.com, my typing speed is ~40wpm, which is apparently around average (not average for monkeytype users).Thinking time definitely dominates, I&#x27;m hesitant to write something unless I&#x27;m confident in it, which I feel serves me well when writing code, but less well in other contexts (except perhaps HN, which has an unusually high fondness for accurate rebuttals of minor technical points). I spent ~20 minutes writing each of my 3 replies to you (longer on this one now that I&#x27;ve finished it). Perhaps being able to type at the speed I could talk would deny me the chance to think about it while waiting to finish typing, speeding me up indirectly. reply Exuma 6 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know how it is working on large teams, but for my daily work working alone I usually write maybe 10-15 emails, I issue a dozen or more commits, I outline specs (a vague word I&#x27;m using which could mean writing documentation, writing technical explanations to clients, writing comments, commits, boilerplate, talking about technical things to my peers via chat).The entire technical burden of all things fall on me, so I suspect I&#x27;m editing code a good 6-8 hours of the day, and the other 3-4 hours at the computer are spent communicating of some form. I wish I knew how many words I typed per day but it must be seriously 10&#x27;s of thousands. Maybe 5000-15,000 depending on the day. Now I imagine doing that.......... 3 times slower. That gives me excrutiating physical pain.If I sat in a vaccum, with no outside communication, and nothing else dependent on me whatsoever, and I was basically given a single task to produce a 50 line file by the end of the day, and the other 7 hours was spent deep in thought, then i could see typing not being important. reply penteract 6 hours agorootparentMy point was intended to be with regard to code specifically, I don&#x27;t dispute that typing speed is beneficial for other communication. My recent coding experiences have been much closer to your last paragraph than your first (talking to peers about technical things has often been via audio). reply SOLAR_FIELDS 7 hours agorootparentprevfor me philosophically code is a liability. Every line of code I write is a liability for me and future generations. So I try as hard as I can to not write code at all so it takes me quite a long time to decide to write code. I see it like that in the places I work too, I get paid to decide when it makes sense to write code eg introduce liability to the business reply Exuma 7 hours agorootparentInteresting perspective. I am a solo developer for all my own companies, and I basically work alone managing a number of high volume businesses. I look at code as \"art\" oddly enough, and not a liability. I look for elegant solutions that wrap complexity up in the most elegant way possible, and I think a lot of \"liability\" comes from people not knowing what they want, and not refining features, as opposed to code (at least in the business I work on, it sounds different for you in your case)Edit: Not that \"high volume\" means anything but I put that there to illustrate there&#x27;s millions of dollars of liability on the line, not just pet projects or something. It just sounds like a different kind of business I&#x27;d guess. Working on a team is definitely something a lot different, that I don&#x27;t really deal with, nor have much experience with. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 7 hours agorootparentThis perspective makes total sense if you never have to write code that is maintained by someone else or deal with code that some else has written.All of our abstractions make sense to us. We wouldn’t have written them otherwise. But unless we are gods at documentation passing that context off to someone else is hard. It’s very easy to casually dismiss a bunch of code as over engineered by also casually dismissing requirements. By being extremely diligent about what you introduce in terms of code you will save yourself and other engineers hundred of hours down the line (if not thousands)That being said, if you’re a startup who won’t survive without working code and your end users don’t ever see the code you write, who the fuck cares about the 10,000 lines of code you write that would take some other engineer half a month to understand? 10,000 lines of code that make money are worth infinitely more than 10 elegant ones that don’t reply Exuma 7 hours agorootparentThat makes complete sense. The team aspect is probably where our experiences differ the most. reply TehShrike 7 hours agorootparentprevI agree. Code is a liability, and you should think as hard as possible so that you can write the smallest amount to produce value.But at the end of the day, you are often going to be writing something, and once you figure out what that is, it should transmit from your brain to the editor as fast as possible. reply baq 2 hours agorootparentprevI’ve come to that realization consciously not long ago after two decades in software, but felt this tingling for a while.Code not written is code not using up resources of your colleagues… and future you. It might be an asset if you sell code, otherwise it’s strictly a liability if you sell a service which the code provides. reply wryanzimmerman 8 hours agorootparentprevAll depends on what you’re doing… sometimes people have to write, like, css. reply spindle 5 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s that thatMade me laugh, given the topic! reply j45 4 hours agorootparentprevIt might not be a limiting factor as much as an enabling factor.Sometimes being able to type fast can also mean thinking broad or deep quickly.Coding at WPM is very different than communicating at WPM. The latter might be valuable.If you can type faster you can help teammates a bit more easily.WPM isn’t a high score for me, but there’s probably a floor.Virtual assistants for example is one area where the average of 3 typeracers can be interesting.In fairness to your comment, the ability to speak to text accurately can be faster than typing too, and maybe it’s a combination of clarity meeting WPM. reply Swizec 6 hours agorootparentprev> I’m in software, like a lot of people here, so being able to type in speed is rarely the limiting factorI think of typing speed in coding the same way I think of cardio in boxing – it won’t win you the round, but the lack of it can easily lose you the round.You want topping to feel seamless and reliable. Whatever you think should come out on the keyboard reliably and without friction. Any time you have to stop and think about typing or go back to check for typos, is time you’re losing focus and flow.Take an extreme example – search-and-peck typing where every character takes 2 seconds. Can you really hold a complex programming context sharp in your mind while it takes a minute to type a few instructions? I sure couldn’t.But you probably also can’t think fast enough to fill a 200wpm typing buffer.Somewhere in between those extremes lies the sweet spot where your typing speed and your thinking speed match. reply pferde 27 minutes agorootparentIndeed, being able to type quickly is invaluable in minimizing the time your mind is blocked from continuing onwards.Or, in general, being able to use keyboard quickly. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people who, when troubleshooting some issue in a SSH session, are v e r y s l o w in shell (quick sequence of little tasks like: type a command, find a particular command in your recent shell history, bring it back up, change something in it, navigate to a different directory, grep some log output).If even the simplest of those tasks takes you a few seconds, you risk losing the train of thought. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 5 hours agorootparentprevInteresting perspective. I have a decent wpm (like 120 if we are doing mavis beacon shit) but otherwise I usually go at like 70. I cannot think of a single time in my 10 year software engineer career where I have been like “damn, I wish I could have typed that faster and my typing speed was a limiting factor in my job” reply Vicinity9635 7 hours agorootparentprevOne thing I would check out is short key travel distance.I love my Bloody B975, but I know I type faster on both my Apple keyboard and especially the Magic Keyboard Folio just because of the super short travel. I can hit 80-90sh on the gaming keyboard, but I&#x27;m probably at least tickling 120 the iPad. reply Exuma 6 hours agorootparentThe newest macbook pro is 10&#x2F;10 for me on typing speed.

Just list all the words in your corpus in order by how frequently they&#x27;re used, then use a dedicated software solution like the one given here to make shorthand from it and expand as you type. Machine learning is massive overkill for this, like nuking a fly-- it&#x27;s a massive waste of resources (time, energy, energy over time, every metric I can think of), and you&#x27;re going to have targeting issues at that scale (how exactly do you propose to ensure a LLM stays on target and doesn&#x27;t duplicate answers, make up words, skip words, etc? Are you sure your LLM actually knows what the correct distribution is? If you know it does because you checked, doesn&#x27;t that mean you already have a word list you can use?) reply offices 54 minutes agorootparentprevYes, LLMs and text compression are the same problem: guessing what comes next. reply fxtentacle 1 hour agorootparentprevI was thinking the exact same thing. That sounds like a small ByT5 LLM model.

And by making the tool available to everyone, more people could get bigger benefits from it, rather than just \"average\" benefits. reply crazygringo 11 hours agorootparent> Sounds like exactly you want something that evolves after time, since how you write changes over time.No, because I don&#x27;t want the shortcuts to be changing on me. That would drive me nuts. The whole point for me would be to establish new habits and then keep them. To turn into muscle memory, not something to be thinking about.It&#x27;s like toolbars that \"learn\" which actions you&#x27;re currently using the most, but the buttons are constantly moving around and are never where they were last week.

Use case: I write a lot of docs with long phrases (i.e. \"data augmentation\"). Could I automate them?I arrived at: 1. Calculate \"surprisal\" of unigrams and bigrams (entropy) from a general dataset (an NYT corpus), give a boost to words in the \"fine-tuned\" index; 2. Create a trie data structure that is weighed by surprisals. The more surprising a word, the more weight it gets. 3. Use that as advanced autocomplete.I got a working solution here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;capjamesg&#x2F;autowrite&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;autocomplet...(No docs yet -- coming in the next few days.

I&#x27;m using Espanso now, but I suffix every shortcut with an \";\" character which causes the expansion. Since it&#x27;s home row, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to actually type it right after typing some letters, making it ideal, cause then I can use whatever shortcuts I want and very rarely have collisions.I do think this automated generation of suggestions is a great idea, and I it made me realize I hadn&#x27;t thought enough about the amount of times I type something vs. how big the word is.

That was one of the reason I seldom use SMS&#x2F;Text-Messages unless I really need to.I have been using text-expansion since the early days of TextExpander[1], an app that works on iOS and macOS. However good the iPhone keyboard was, it was always not convenient to type and retype details such as home address, home&#x2F;work map, and many other work&#x2F;personal related info. TextExpander helped a lot.I started looking for an alternative when TextExpander converted to a subscription model, which I (personal) believe is not suitable for such a tool. I found a better alternative in Alfred[2], bundled with its Powerpack — Snippets.macOS&#x2F;iOS also has its built-in “Text Replacements” but it fails me quite often in non-Apple apps. What you have here is similar to that of Apple’s Text Replacement. I let that remain and the others are managed via Alfred. Honestly, I may move to this once I can totally walk out of Alfred (Spotlight is becoming good enough.)However, I’d like to use a delimiter to expand so it does not come in the way of my normal typing (I can touch type). Currently, I use “,” (comma) as a delimiter (Affix) because, in English, there is always a space after a comma and my expansion is only after I type a comma and the short-text without a space. Also the comma key is located conveniently when you touch type.If I do reconcile and stay with the OS’s Text Replacement, I might still introduce the delimiter to prevent automatic expansion of the word which wasn’t intended for that particular scenario.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;textexpander.com2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alfredapp.com reply eschluntz 5 hours agoparentyeah, I spent a decent amount of time getting delimiter correct in the Autokey configs that I generate.

This is only one of the variations I have. The previous one had me enter the master password in the form itself, and it&#x27;ll read the context of the browser itself get the URL from there and automatically replace the correct password.

You can select with the up&#x2F;down arrows and insert by pressing space again.In practice, most of the time you can convert by pressing space twice in quick succession, because either you have a single candidate, or because the default selection, the top candidate is automatically set to your last, or most frequent selection.If there&#x27;s no match, you can add a new abbreviation to your dictionary.You can turn on&#x2F;off the system by pressing CTRL-space, or some other key combo. reply lxe 10 hours agoprevFrom the gif I originally thought this was a \"AI\" predictive typing assistant, which would not require a shortcut map heuristic but rather predict text based on probability. reply IAmGraydon 7 hours agoprevThis is basically Emmet for the English language, right?

It only runs locally, so no weird data scraping issues to worry about. And it&#x27;s easy to update as things changes because everything lives in a simple yml file.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;espanso.org&#x2F;It can do simple text replacement, so I have words, phrases, and sentences I use frequently compressed into a few keyboard clicks. It can also grab what is in your clipboard, so that can be incorporated into responses, which is simple but very handy.A simple text replacement looks like this in the yml file: - trigger: \":espanso\" replace: \"Hi there!\"But it can even work with a shell, which I think is amazing! For example, I have a particular task at work where I often need to insert a random number into a text document. I can have Espano run PowerShell behind the scenes to run a simple PowerShell command, and that looks something like: - trigger: \";rand\" replace: \" {{output}}\" vars: - name: output type: shell params: cmd: \"Get-Random -Minimum 100000\" shell: powershell reply Xeophon 11 hours agoparentI love espanso.

    "originBody": "Home CV Publications On (my) Caste Aug 29, 2023 Allow me to introduce you to one of the largest population groups in India, as recognized by the constitution of India: Other Backward Classes (OBC Category). OBCs are estimated to comprise 40-45% of India's population, therefore, about 500 million people belong to OBC category. In other words, 1 in 16 people in the world belongs to the OBC category. As you might have already guessed, OBCs have historically been socio-economically disadvantaged. The wiki page is a good start. The purpose of this post is three-fold: (1) re-claim my identity in its entirety, (2) inform the broader public, and (3) reach out to someone searching for an OBC who \"made\" it in academia. It is, perhaps, appropriate to address the elephant in the room: I belong to OBC Category. Phew, this was not as hard as I anticipated. Typically, one's surname (last name) is a giveaway and most Indians can reasonably identify someone's caste based on the last name. Fortunately, my last name is rather uncommon and in such scenarios one often gets benefit of the doubt, and therefore, very few people have been aware of my caste. I had begun to mention references to my caste in Facebook/Twitter threads in the past two years. I was, however, not ready to publicly declare it until I received tenure as it seemed too risky. An uninitiated might be forgiven for not realizing that caste-based discrimination is rampant in India (yes, even among faculty members at IITs), and perhaps worse among Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). Therefore, there was always fear of what would a potential letter writer or someone on tenure evaluation committee think of me if they knew I belonged to OBC. It was the same fear that stopped me from mentioning anything about my caste in any of DEI statements that I prepared for the job search or tenure: I had to pretend not to know what it feels to be under-represented. As a professor at a public university, I feel I ought to inform broader public about the lack of representation of OBCs. I think I can summarize the lack of representation with the help of a claim that I believe is true: There are at most five tenure-track faculty who belong to OBC category among all the faculty members in North America's \"top\" 50 CS departments. Any reasonable process to pick 50 CS departments should suffice. I will, of course, be overjoyed to be corrected. You might ask: What evidence do I have to support my claim? To this end, in early 2023, I sought to determine the distribution of CS faculty according to their castes at the five of the most prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IITs). I relied on Right to Information (RTI) queries to individual IITs to gather data. The result are either shocking or not surprising, depending on how much one knows about the caste system. Well, without further ado, here are the responses from each of the IITs: IIT Bombay IIT Delhi IIT Kanpur IIT Madras IIT Kharagpur Here is the summary: There is exactly one out of 180 CS faculty members across five IITs who belongs to OBC category. While the past and present draw a bleak picture concerning the representations of OBCs, I remain wishful about the future, but there is work to be done. One of the reasons I wanted to write this post was because I remember craving a role model belonging to the OBC category. Therefore, if an OBC person is contemplating a Ph.D. or faculty position, I want them to know: Yes, \"we\" can succeed. Please reach out to me if I can help, and let me assure you I would be happier than you if I were to hear from you. It's been a lonely road for far too long. Addendum (Aug 30): Acknowledgements: Several close friends and family members helped with the initial drafts of this post.

The author says he was born as OBC (Other Backward Classes), but that&#x27;s not the lowest in the overall scheme. SC (Scheduled Castes) are considered lower in the hierarchy. ST (Scheduled Tribes) are considered even lower (there are variations across states and regions, so please take this with a pinch of salt). While the atrocities and punishments by \"upper\" caste people on \"lower\" caste people continue, even OBCs oppress SCs and STs quite badly, sometimes along with other \"upper\" caste people and sometimes by themselves. [1] It&#x27;s a sad fact that the oppressed themselves don&#x27;t understand it well enough to avoid oppressing others. If they could get together and lift each other up, things could be very different (or at least not as bad as they have been and are).[1]: Searching for news on atrocities and punishments on \"dalits\" would yield many results from as recent as a few days to long ago in the past. reply rollcat 15 hours agoparent> While the atrocities and punishments by \"upper\" caste people on \"lower\" caste people continue, even OBCs oppress SCs and STs quite badly [...].This is the step 1. in ensuring any oppressive system continues to be supported by a majority &#x2F; critical mass of people, who are themselves subject to oppression: make sure there&#x27;s someone even lower than you, on whom you can unleash your frustration. reply alephnerd 15 hours agorootparentThe issue is OBC (Other Backwards Castes) was invented as a populist measure in 1992.After Independence, Affirmative Action&#x2F;Reservation was created so Dalits and Nomadic Tribes who were traditionally outcastes in South Asian society could be integrated into society.Yet, in the 1980s-90s, Agrarian and Feudal Caste politicians like Mulayam Singh Yadav (Yadav), Lalu Prasad Yadav (Yadav), Chaudhary Charan Singh (Jatt), Bal Thackarey (Maratha), YRS Reddy (Reddy), etc began pushing to expand Affirmative Action to include those castes that are traditionally Feudal Lords&#x2F;Zamindars and oppressed Dalits and Nomads.When this expansion began in 1992, every single non-Dalit caste saw that if they could lobby hard enough, they could also be give guarunteed Affirmative Action for college admissions, government jobs, welfare, etc.This is why even some Brahmin majority castes like Paharis were given Affimative Action by being treated as an OBC or Scheduled Tribe. reply rhuru 10 hours agorootparentOBC is indeed a completely made up category and has no relation to any kind of historic \"atrocities\".OBCs are > 50% of India&#x27;s population my some measure which tells you they are extremely powerful in an democracy. They engage in this race to bottom where they want more legal discrimination that favors them at the expense of another.One can easily see that the most powerful politicians everywhere in India are mostly OBC. India&#x27;s current PM is an OBC, so is the CMs of some of the richest states like Maharahstra, Tamilnadu or the most populous states like Uttar Pradesh.

But at least you had a solid house, instead of living in a mud hut (if you were lucky) like most Dalits and Nomads in rural India back then.If someone from an elite rural family came to the city, their privilige automatically becomes moot because in a purely capitalist society Money begets Privilige.In the 1990s-to-present, there was a massive migration from rural India to cities, and a number of formerly priviliged Men (it&#x27;s men who become migrant workers) were at the bottom rung of the urban social ladder. And they were&#x2F;are PISSED. So in retaliation, they began organizing their own Castes to fight for political power and quotas.Also, in India, Affirmative Action is a Quota System, unlike the US where Quotas are unconstitutional.

The task is on those frustrated individuals to find ways to adapt whatever they have adapting to in a changinf society, because the only these large changes can be surpressed is by oppressing others. We all know where that ends.Those frustrated young men (and it is mostly men) so, they are actually in a pretty bad spot. Those that actually act on those feelings are just plain pathetic so, the others, well, society owes them some form of support. Just don&#x27;t ask me what kind of support so.The much much worse proboem so is the people in power, read populist and nationalist movement and political leader along with their religious counterparts, that use those men to further their own goals of power. More often than not, that use ends in violence and death. No idea what can be done about that neither, other than voting for parties that are not like that and keep tbose radicals out of government and power as much as possible.

Almost all Indians save for a narrow clade of people who worked directly under the imperial administration of the British Empire had access to anything, and even those were the cream of the crop from the pre-British days who could translate their prior privileges to getting ahead of their peers in the rat race.It’s basically tautological to say OBCs are underrepresented in the upper echelons of society.

The entrance exam score gap between reserved and general is massive (numbers are public) and it shows in their relative academic performance.

The whole education system from primary to all the way to universities is failing: incompetent teachers abound. There was a time Indian politicians used to send their kids to colleges in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Culcutta.

A political system with a tiny elite controlling the rest is inherently unstable (think monarchies or communism) whereas a political system which distributes its elites tends to be stable. That is what the caste system is. Each jati had its own ruling body and social structure. And then there were broader rules which governed how jatis interact, which is where the varnas come in.Now how do you maintain this political system if people are free to leave a jati or intermarry with another jati willy-nilly? You can&#x27;t. That is why caste endogamy is so strictly enforced (and often violently) in the sub-continent. And the endogamy dates back to like from 2000 years ago. This socio-political system is so fundamental a building block of the sub-contient that even Muslims and Christians follow it unlike in other parts of the world.The other problem to solve in this jati system is that how do you keep some jati doing the dirty or undesirable jobs? This is where the concept of karma comes in. Some people can get away with murder because that&#x27;s just how the universe works. They will get their just desserts in the next life.Given all that, people who grow up in such a culture carry some biases pretty strongly. Like if a guy gets into medical college due to reservation, but earns the degree like everyone else in his class - by you know completing all the course requirements - he is still not qualified to treat people.

All Indian institutions of higher education are completely bogged down by this perverse affirmative action system. Unless an institution is run by religious minorities like muslims or christians, they have to agree to do affirmative action. Even if they are private.

If there is an opening for two faculty positions in the IITM CS department esp in machine learning and AI, if 20 people are applied, two are selected, and two happened to be from un-reserved category. Does it prove caste-discrimination? Well, look at the profiles of twenty candidates and see their research record and also academic pedigree, see whether one can pick up two candidates from reserved category (that is, SC, ST and OBC). If one can show that, yes, indeed caste-discrimination is occurred: both candidates A (reserved category) and B (un-reserved category) are excellent both academically and research-wise, only B is chosen, yes, one can say that the committee should have picked A.Btw, I am not a product of IITs or any elite institution in the West&#x2F;East.

But for someone in India, they very well could view the other 1.29B Indians as being in tribes as different as “white” and “black” tribes in the US.Note that racism is not skin color-ism, since a very light skinned descendent of a darker skinner person is also, commonly, referred to as being “black”, especially if they have obvious physical traits that display they have “black” ancestors.Race in the US (and other parts of the developed world) is about the socioeconomic tribe that the one belongs to, or that one’s network (including ancestors) belong to.

His achievement is worth celebrating on its own grounds.____It&#x27;s been 6 years for me in the US, and no one has asked me my caste. Even in India, the only time someone could have inferred my caste, was when someone indirectly asked my university JEE (SAT) scores in my first few weeks of freshman year. My scores were as high as &#x27;general&#x27; (upper class) candidates, so they&#x27;d quickly assess me as &#x27;one who deserves his spot here&#x27;. Still, I was pretty transparent about my caste status. Afterall, I was one of the lucky few who&#x27;d never been discriminated on caste. Hell, I didn&#x27;t know I belonged to the umbrella term &#x27;OBC&#x27; until I started filling out application forms for universities.Their inquiry, it was less so malice, and more so a sense of unfairness about a system that was supposed to be strictly meritocratic. But a few weeks side-by-side in a dorm made everyone intimately aware of the poverty of the lowest class. Soon, no one would dare think that the barely-English-conversant SC&#x2F;ST, who came from a town without running water, was on the same level playing field as them. There were admittedly a few grifters and abusers of this system. All castes were equally bewildered by that group.The Indian-American diaspora in the US remains untarnished by caste (Can&#x27;t comment on Canada). I make this as both of statement of faith, anecdotal personal experience and a statically aligned truth seeker. OBC is an artificially created term from less than 100 years ago. The communities have nothing in common, except a tag of underdevelopment forced onto us.The vast vast majority of Indians in the US are upper caste and the vast majority of tall NBA players had access to protein growing up. SC&#x2F;ST communities and many poor OBC communities are backwards because their problems begin at nutrition, K-12 schooling and cultural emphasis on lower-income professions. By the time you make it to freshman year of college, you have mostly risen past the burden of your caste. This also means, that trying to increase visibility of the community at the highest levels, does diddly-squat for those grappling with crippling poverty and the worst of caste discrimination.Leaving outrage-driving topics like IQ, discrimination and generational trauma aside for a minute, vast statistical gaps within communities can still manifest due to emergent properties of systems converging to their nearest stable state.Caste discrimination is terrible in lower-class India. People actively try to move beyond Caste in middle class India. Caste is unheard of in upper class India. And the upper-most caste of operates at the family level, deeming everyone from their own caste and otherwise to be similarly &#x27;pedestrian&#x27;. American immigration policy ensures that only middle and upper class Indian can move to the US. This means that every Indian who arrives in the US, is preconditioned to want to move past caste. reply rramadass 2 hours agoparentYou might find the Carnegie Endowment article on Indian-Americans in my comment here useful - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37333418 reply barbarr 9 hours agoparentprevThis is one of the few good replies here, thanks for writing it out. reply rhuru 5 hours agoparentprevActually a pretty sane and reasonable comment.

The referrer should not even be a part of the interview process, anyway.

Vegetarianism permeates throughout society in both upper and lower classes.Asking someone&#x27;s village name to know anything is laughable. There are about a million villages in India, and most villages have mixed caste populations, so this is just so laughably absurd. Even if you meet someone in a local city, you will not get to know their caste by their village name, let alone meeting someone in a big Indian city or the US. Asking someone&#x27;s village gives you same amount of information as doing Math.random(1e6).> see if the person is wearing a JuneauThis is something that has almost stopped and at this point almost nobody wears it since it involves a lot of extra effort.

But at the same time caste discrimination is still very much a thing.The way I&#x27;ve seen people in the west envision it is that everyone is keenly aware of their caste, where they are in society and what they&#x27;re \"allowed\" to do. But it isn&#x27;t that blatant to me, so I felt impressions of caste discrimination were overblown. I was raised to be caste-blind (literally wasn&#x27;t taught the differences to be able to even subconsciously be biased) so I projected that upon everyone.However as I&#x27;ve interacted with other Indians, I have noticed that our conversations tend to be very different. I don&#x27;t really care about where they&#x27;re from, barely care about their name beyond how to refer to them etc, mostly interested in what they do professionally and what they&#x27;re interested in while their questions tend to focus on where I&#x27;m from and what my family history is.My understanding is that my caste is fairly mundane so I haven&#x27;t really noticed any discrimination towards myself, but I think I&#x27;ve atleast noticed that many people have a lot of interest in identifying the caste at least, which can obviously lead to discrimination pretty easily. reply anyonecancode 15 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s silly.

The meaning now seems to be converging on \"I don’t agree with .\".Generally western laws would view caste-based discrimination as illegal and wrong.

A community of people with type 1 diabetes got a self-built device approved. What can they offer that big companies can’t? Liam Drew Twitter Facebook Email A person with type 1 diabetes demonstrates a smartphone application that automatically doses insulin through a pump. Credit: Patrick Hertzog/AFP via Getty Ten years ago, a tech-savvy group of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) decided to pursue a DIY approach to their own treatment. They knew that a fairly straightforward piece of software could make their lives much easier, but no companies were developing it quickly enough. What this software promised was freedom from having to constantly measure and control their blood-glucose levels. In people without T1D, when glucose levels rise, cells in the pancreas release insulin, a hormone that helps tissues to absorb that glucose. In T1D, these cells are killed by the immune system, leaving people with the condition to manage their blood sugar by taking insulin. “It is almost inhumane,” says Shane O’Donnell, a medical sociologist at University College Dublin, who, like everyone quoted in this article, lives with T1D. “You’re constantly having to think about diabetes in order to survive.” Members of the nascent DIY community were using the most sophisticated technology available: insulin pumps and wearable devices called constant glucose monitors. But they still had to read the monitor’s data, forecast their diet and exercise and then calculate the appropriate insulin dose. What they wanted was automation — an algorithm that would analyse glucose data and program the pump itself. Coalescing around this aim in 2013, the community debuted a hashtag: #WeAreNotWaiting. Then, in February 2015, group member Dana Lewis shared the code for an algorithm that she and two collaborators had developed and tested. ‘Bionic pancreas’ tames diabetes blood-sugar spikes “We didn’t set out do to anything big,” says Lewis, now an independent researcher in Seattle, Washington. But soon, people who had downloaded and used the algorithm shared their personal experiences and gave feedback. When users suggested tweaks and potential improvements, others tried them and reported back. Katarina Braune, an endocrinologist at Charité – Berlin University Medicine, estimates that around 30,000 people now use open-source technology for automated insulin delivery (AID). Some use Lewis and colleagues’ original OpenAPS system, which requires a minicomputer to control it, whereas others use either AndroidAPS (which evolved from Lewis’ system) or Loop, which are smartphone applications. The movement has continued to mature. After years of relying on self-reported data, in the past year, two randomized controlled trials1,2 have shown the safety and effectiveness of open-source systems. And this January, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted regulatory clearance to an AID system based on an open-source algorithm for the first time. Today, however, the technology landscape for T1D is much more crowded. The first commercial AID system was launched in 2017 and, currently, five companies sell such systems, with more than 750,000 users. Is this the beginning of the end for the open-source movement in diabetes care? Some diabetologists think so. But many advocates reject that idea, saying that the community is still pushing the technology in new directions that promise more personalization and automation than commercial versions currently provide. Gaining traction Sufyan Hussain, an endocrinologist at King’s College London, says that he was initially sceptical about the DIY AID community. But when he started to engage with it in around 2016, he was “shocked at how well engineered the solutions were in terms of the safety and understanding”. In 2022, Hussain co-authored an international consensus statement3 — signed by more than 40 medical and legal experts and backed by 9 diabetes charities — calling for health-care professionals to support those wanting to use open-source AID. Results from randomized trials have further elevated the status of DIY technology. A study published this year1 found that an open-source and a commercial AID system both controlled glucose levels similarly well. And a September 2022 study2 demonstrated the efficacy of an algorithm that runs an artificial pancreas system on Android smartphones. By recruiting participants who were new to the technology, the study addressed long-standing criticisms that advocates had previously cherry-picked data from highly motivated, tech-literate members. Despite their tens of thousands of users, many of whom have chosen not to use available commercial systems, DIY devices for T1D remain relatively niche. O’Donnell says that a welcoming and supportive community guides people with limited technology skills through setting up systems. But most people with T1D — and most doctors — haven’t encountered these systems, says Aaron Kowalski, president and chief executive of JDRF, a non-profit research organization in New York City that focuses on T1D.

The minicomputer running the algorithm (left) connects to the constant glucose monitor (pink), a battery pack, and an insulin pump (right).Credit: Jack Darrell The FDA’s approval of the open-source system Tidepool Loop could change things, says Kowalski. The algorithm underlying it was created in 2016 by people living with T1D, and was initially rolled out through online forums, before a version of it was taken through FDA clearance by Tidepool, a non-profit organization in Palo Alto, California. Tidepool’s goal in getting Loop through regulation is “to make it more accessible to a wider audience”, says spokesperson Saira Khan-Gallo. “Downloading code and building an app on your phone is not for everyone,” she says. But “the algorithm, the novel features and technology should be available to anyone who is interested”. Tidepool and others hoping to roll out open-source algorithms face a big challenge: their products do not stand alone. The algorithms require compatibility with continuous glucose monitors and pumps — made by other companies — thereby demanding a cooperative relationship between manufacturers. Tidepool is yet to announce which device company it will collaborate with to launch Loop. Interoperability between different products and algorithms could shake up a marketplace in which individual manufacturers have usually developed proprietary, exclusive software. This could have ramifications beyond T1D treatment, affecting any computerized medical hardware that software developers might attempt to improve. Kowalski points to examples in other industries, such as aerospace, in which companies use engines made by others. “They’re plugging [in] different components from different manufacturers to get the best performance,” he says. “People with diabetes should have the opportunity to use the best tools that work the best for them.” As COVID-19 cases rose, so did diabetes — no one knows why Several device manufacturers, however, told Nature that they are wary of relying on third parties to provide crucial pieces of AID systems. For instance, Tandem, a pump manufacturer in San Diego, California, says that if an algorithm runs on a smartphone app and not on the pump itself, phone damage or connectivity problems could be a risk to therapy. And Medtronic, a medical technology company in Watford, UK, has decided to prioritize designing their own complete system rather than interoperable components. Nonetheless, Tidepool’s regulatory approval will hopefully ease the way for future standalone algorithms seeking clearance, says Khan-Gallo. She hopes that having more options will incentivize companies to make their devices cross-compatible. And where algorithms have led, open-source hardware might follow, says O’Donnell. A team at the University of Otago in New Zealand has run a successful early-stage clinical trial of an open-source insulin pump4. The goal is to provide free-of-charge design plans to qualified manufacturers to build pumps for a fraction of the cost of current commercial ones. Algorithms ablaze When asked whether the open-source community of users still has a part to play, Kowalski says: “The DIY community is always going to be there. I think they’re the ultimate testing ground for what people want and need.” Hussain agrees. Participants’ lived experiences of T1D constantly generate ideas for novel features, he says. But more importantly, the network of online forums and highly motivated members has created a rapid and powerful way to test algorithm functions. Milestones in diabetes Problematic updates are quickly weeded out, and beneficial innovations self-propagate and achieve widespread use in just months. Currently, Hussain says, “The commercial systems don’t have advanced features that the open-source systems allow.” Some of these features mean that certain open-source systems come close to regulating blood sugar completely autonomously. Although commercial systems are advancing, none is as near to solving this important problem; they currently use hybrid algorithms that manage insulin dosing most of the time, but they require a lot of manual input. For instance, users must program in meals to ensure that the devices deliver large corrective insulin doses. By contrast, many open-source systems do not require meal announcements and come close to being a fully closed loop5. Several advances in technology made this possible, says Lewis. The apps can analyse long-term changes in glucose control and insulin sensitivity resulting from, say, hormonal changes or illness. They do this by retrospectively comparing glucose levels with insulin doses over days or weeks, to adjust upcoming dosing according to changes in insulin sensitivity. They can also deal with perturbations to blood glucose “without knowing whether it was a meal, adrenaline, stress, excitement — whatever, it doesn’t matter”, says Lewis. Whether open-source systems are better than commercial ones “is a big ‘it depends’ question”, says Rayhan Lal, an endocrinologist at Stanford University in California, and Tidepool’s chief medical adviser, who says that he has started more than 3,000 people on open-source AID systems, and uses one himself. What matters, Lal says, is that individuals can find what works best for them, in terms of the control they gain or the effort they want to make. Some people might want to tailor their devices; others might prefer the simplicity of a package from a commercial manufacturer. The DIY community and industry are not in opposition, says Lewis. She is delighted that a safety feature that she wrote and freely shared was incorporated into a commercial device. The open-source community will stay relevant, she says, as long as it offers users choice. “The vision of where I’d love to get to — whether it’s commercial or DIY — is really, really about the person with diabetes and our safety and our quality of life.” Nature 620, 940-941 (2023) doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02648-9 References Wu, Z. et al.

However, there appears to now be shelf-stable glucagon [1], a hormone which can be injected similarly to insulin and raises blood glucose levels.AFAIK there is only one company, Beta Bionics [2], that is working on commercialization of such technology with dual pumps. In this case, you could be more aggressive in either direction of pushing BG, because you have a safety net.Because this feels like a holy grail &#x2F; functional cure, I&#x27;m surprised the incredible DIY teams out there haven&#x27;t trained their guns on doing this. Having both \"turn it up\" and \"turn it down\" knobs seems so much more valuable than squeezing the last 5% of efficacy of AID systems. I feel like glucagon is obviously \"the answer\", but I don&#x27;t see much talk about it.Is the problem that there is no hardware for dual hormone pumps? I would have thought by now they&#x27;d have hacked 2 patch-pump AIDs to work simultaneously.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;947962 [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thejdca.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;fda-approves-beta... reply jablongo 18 hours agoparentFor some background - I&#x27;m a T1D working on a search engine and conversational interface for integrating a bunch of new data sources and models into metabolic decision making: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replica.health. I&#x27;ve also been a user of and worked on various open source artificial pancreas systems through the years, and am currently on Loop.>I would have thought by now they&#x27;d have hacked 2 patch-pump AIDs to work simultaneously.As you pointed out, the problem is not really hardware. It could technically be done in a straightforward way using two independently controlled insulin pumps, but the complexity and risk of the whole operation goes way up if you are taking way more insulin. Taking a bunch of insulin and glucagon at the same time is not necessarily a great idea either - they don&#x27;t just annihilate each other without consequence and you could end up with secondary effects like gaining a bunch of weight.>Because this feels like a holy grail &#x2F; functional cureUnfortunately it is not; even dual hormone systems have problems keeping up w&#x2F; the kinetics of glucose absorption and to address this there is also research into tri-hormonal systems, w&#x2F; amylin as the third hormone. In any case you will still need some a-priori info about meals and planned activities, though less so than with a single hormone system. Integration of exogenous data sources to provide this info to the APS is what we are working on at Replica.Also, hate to be the bearer of bad news but beta bionics has shelved their dual hormone ambitions for now; their prototype device soon to be released is insulin-only. On the bright side there is a small Dutch company whose tech predates beta-bionics. They sell a dual hormone device and will give it to you for a ton of $ (and probably have you sign a bunch of waivers): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inredadiabetic.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;discover-the-ap&#x2F; reply nahsra 17 hours agorootparent> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replica.healthOh my gosh, this is the startup I considered starting last year when this issue became personal to me and I wrapped my brain around the complexity of insulin dosing.There are a lot of challenges here but we absolutely need an external \"brain\" to correlate many data points, some trends, and reasonably estimate current insulin sensitivity. reply jablongo 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love to chat - send me an email at sam@replica.health . An accurate time-varying insulin sensitivity model is one of our big projects. reply andrewchilds 6 hours agorootparentGood luck with Replica!

I have however worked a number of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) projects, and what you describe kind of sounds like a PID control loop, which also is not a simple push up&#x2F;down approach.From Wikipedia:\"A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.\"Getting PID control loops to work has a lot of research behind it, but it&#x27;s still hard to get right with new hardware. I would imagine a PID control loop involving organics (wetware) would be much order, and harder still a PID control loop in organics with life-threatening failures possible. reply idiotsecant 15 hours agorootparentPID works well for most industrial controls, but it&#x27;s a blunt instrument. Its mainly valuable because it&#x27;s simple and doesn&#x27;t really require much knowledge of the plant to implement. No &#x27;model&#x27; is really required, other than the vaguest knowledge of first order dynamics. Instead of model knowledge you just iteratively tune it until it works.If you need a really optimal control trajectory minimizing or maximizing for some parameter, you are willing to do the system identification necessary for it to work, and you don&#x27;t much care whether an electrician can understand how it works model-based controls are much better. as &#x2F;u&#x2F;Communitivity mentioned so called &#x27;model based control&#x27; (which is an umbrella of techniques) is a much more powerful tool. reply jablongo 16 hours agorootparentprevAt this point all the major solutions are using an algorithm that would probably fall under the umbrella of \"Model Predictive Control\" rather than a vanilla PID controller. An absurd spate of patent trolling occurred back in the early 2000s related to Controller definitions like these though. Researchers patented the use of a \"PID controller in artificial pancreas systems\" [1][2] which slowed down the development of APSs by many years.The way the Supreme Court recently changed patent law [3] for software has definitely had a positive effect for APS development.

That means that everything that people now come up with has well-documented prior art? reply haldujai 17 hours agorootparentprev> In any case you will still need some a-priori info about meals and planned activitiesNot necessarily, at least not via patient input. In the albeit small Inreda studies manual announcement of exercise and meals wasn&#x27;t required (or an option). Medtronic also has a meal prediction algorithm on their newest offering that&#x27;s a step towards a fully automated process and currently more or less obviates carb counting but isn&#x27;t at the point where you don&#x27;t have to announce a meal (yet).Rather than integrating external data sources the algorithms are predicting based on historical glucose levels and&#x2F;or insulin administration and it seems to be working.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamasurgery&#x2F;article-abstrac... reply jablongo 17 hours agorootparentAgree that patient input shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, but to replace it we will need to include other inputs besides CGM in a systematic way to get the optimal results. My company is working on how to use contextual info automatically collected by your devices to help (detected activity, measured calorie burn, geofencing, data from meal-ordering apis, etc.). This is especially true given that the CGM data themselves are lagged due to averaging and&#x2F;or kalman filtering going on under the hood. This is a fundamental problem; Inreda uses two identical CGMs for noise reduction purposes just so they can get clean data with less of a lag.None of the systems claiming you don&#x27;t have to do anything in terms of meal announcement are _working_ in the sense of achieving euglycemic parity, which should be the goal. I can say with certainty that the cgm logs from people who don&#x27;t announce meals on the Inreda device do not look like they are from non-diabetics: there are still often large post-prandial spikes. Inreda likely does better than any single hormone system, but the problem is not solved in any sense. reply haldujai 16 hours agorootparent> Agree that patient input shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, but to replace it we will need to include other inputs besides CGM in a systematic way to get the optimal results.I&#x27;m not going as far as to claim Medtronic&#x27;s approach (I believe the only one commercially available with so-called meal prediction based on historical CGM and offers full correction boluses) is the optimal one, just that it is an approach that is at least very good (~80% time in target) and while it still requires meal announcements it&#x27;s just the first step of what they&#x27;re trying to do. Clearly we can expect further iterations of these algorithms as the technology matures.> Inreda uses two identical CGMs for noise reduction purposes just so they can get clean data with less of a lag.Just giving an example that this is possible without external input or data, your statement was that you will need a-priori information which is not necessarily the case. Whether such a system is optimal is a different question.I haven&#x27;t seen the raw data and highly doubt enough of it even exists for anyone to make a claim whether or not such a system can be optimized to the point necessary.> None of the systems claiming you don&#x27;t have to do anything in terms of meal announcement are _working_ in the sense of achieving euglycemic parity, which should be the goal.For clarity to any less knowledgeable readers while time spent in euglycemia is a very important outcome measure it cannot come at the expense of severe hypoglycemia or severe hyperglycemia&#x2F;diabetic ketoacidosis (i.e. an algorithm that improves euglycemia to 95% but has a 2% severe hypo time is less acceptable than 80% euglycemia and 0.5% severe hypo.)To my knowledge no system on the market&#x2F;generally available right now is claiming to be completely input free. The closest to my knowledge is again the MiniMed 780G discussed in my first point which will assuredly be iterated on.Also to be clear I&#x27;m not being dismissive of what your company is working on, it&#x27;s a very interesting and novel approach. It may even be necessary to achieve the optimal product. I look forward to reading about your results when you publish them. I&#x27;m just presenting alternatives and a brief overview of what other approaches are for HN readers who are likely unfamiliar with the topic being discussed. reply jablongo 12 hours agorootparentReally appreciate the pointed commentary on this! Happy to make further prognostications about the success of CGM-input-only APSs via email.For the record, when I say \"Euglycemic Parity\" what I really mean is a sort of Turing test (not time in range), where a data-driven Endocrinologist is asked to tell the difference between CGM records from a non-diabetic, and CGM records from a diabetic equipped with some control system. Passing this test should be our long term goal IMO and we will probably have to bring many techniques to bear to eventually achieve it. reply nahsra 17 hours agorootparentprevI think the \"no meal announcement\" features are really valuable for traditionally underserved demographics who, for whatever reason, can&#x27;t \"get good\" at managing their disease.The difference between how quickly food and insulin hit your bloodstream make it seem like there is no way to \"algorithm your way out of\" meal announcements. Food hits almost immediately, and with variable strength depending on macronutrients in it, and insulin takes ~15 minutes to start working, and peaks at 1 hour, with no concern about BG levels. Can you square these 2 for me and make it make sense? reply haldujai 15 hours agorootparentI think what you&#x27;re missing for this to make sense is what is the desired outcome. For type 1 diabetics there are three important ones:1. Time in severe hypoglycemia - ideally 0%2. Time in severe hyperglycemia&#x2F;diabetic ketoacidosis - ideally 0%3. Time in euglycemia (also called time in target) - clinical target is >70% and for reference the median healthy non-diabetic is in target ~90-95% of the time.Closed loop systems are very good at #1 and #2 as it takes a while for levels to get to the severe state and insulin can be administered (or withheld) based on CGM.When we talk about algorithming out of meal announcements it&#x27;s whether historical patient-specific blood glucose levels and insulin administrations (i.e. a prediction of what you eat and when) combined with CGM can keep #3 acceptable, not necessarily optimal. Medtronic is using this approach and their newest model more or less eliminates the need for accurate carb-counting but they still require meal announcements. The hope&#x2F;idea is that this can potentially be eliminated in further iterations.Another important thing to keep in mind which is sometimes lost in these discussions is that we don&#x27;t treat numbers we treat patients (i.e. what are the clinical outcomes). Generally speaking, we assume the closer to normal the better but we don&#x27;t have actual data about how much an extra X% outside of target ranges matters in terms of clinical outcomes and complication rates. We only really started getting this data with CGM and complications in these mild states would require very large cohorts and long (10-20 year) follow-ups to detect differences as they&#x27;re likely to also be mild.So while you&#x27;re absolutely correct regarding the limitations and that an algorithm cannot outperform accurate carb-counting and meal announcements the missing piece is that it may be sufficient. Particularly if said algorithms result in improved time-in-target for patients who aren&#x27;t good at managing their diabetes and find meal announcements cumbersome. reply thecosas 10 hours agorootparentprevBummer to hear about beta bionics! My understanding was that the hardware they are releasing does have a place for glucagon, just not the software and additional reservoir required. I&#x27;m considering a switch to their pump since it seems like they&#x27;ve made it as automated as possible with insulin-only.Would love to see&#x2F;hear more about what you&#x27;re working on! reply agawish 13 hours agorootparentprevSorry I know this is off topic, but I&#x27;m a recently diagnosed T1D and I would like to get more information about Loop and other loop-like open-source systems. reply wombatpm 12 hours agorootparentMy son is T1D since age 7. He is now on the OmniPod pump and the Dexcom G6 sensor. It’s been a very effective combination that’s covered by insurance. The challenge with the open source projects is limited equipment that can be hacked. reply jablongo 9 hours agorootparentMost people on loop have omnipod and dexcom g6 also so I don’t think it’s that limited. It’s true that it takes a few months for new devices to get integrated but open source APS are the only systems lets you choose what devices you want to use with them. reply gitfan86 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is awesome. The obvious next step here would be integration with the pump to send the correct dose after the user confirms the app is correct in the food they are eating reply awaywethrow 18 hours agoparentprevMy worry with this approach has been that infusion sites (both for insulin and glucagon) can become occluded, pulled out, etc. to suddenly render them completely ineffective, and that automated detection of these scenarios is not great.You need to move forward, and therefore must occasionally have a foot on the gas (insulin). The gas pedal failing, causing you to stop moving forward, is not urgently dangerous (hyperglycemia). However, if your brakes (glucagon) can sometimes fail completely, that could cause you to die almost immediately if you&#x27;re moving too fast toward danger (extreme hypoglycemia). Given this situation where brakes are unreliable, do you want your automated control system to rely on them and push you to dangerous speeds? reply nahsra 18 hours agorootparentThe detectability of failure is an excellent point. Anybody who uses the hardware can confirm it&#x27;s not 100%. I think your point helps me re-frame the glucagon as more of an insurance backstop for when we accidentally hit the gas a little hard, rather than a permission slip to constantly be going too fast and constantly be slamming on the brakes.Even in this framing, it still feels like an extraordinarily valuable addition, and relatively low risk. It&#x27;s also, of course, more to add to the patient&#x27;s maintenance, but might help them or their caregivers sleep at night. reply awaywethrow 18 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s also, of course, more to add to the patient&#x27;s maintenanceI agree with all that you&#x27;ve said, and this point in particular is extremely important. It&#x27;s also the reason I moved from a DIY system like the one mentioned here, to a commercial system, once the latter was available. There is simply less hardware and software to juggle with the commercial system. There are fewer knobs, bells, and whistles, meaning I might not be able to tweak things to be in as tight control as might be possible with a DIY system (though with risks!), but overall it&#x27;s been \"good enough\" for me, and greatly reduces the cognitive burden of having T1D. My experience clearly doesn&#x27;t match everyone&#x27;s, but considering I&#x27;m typically someone who loves to tinker, and has plenty of T1D experience (engineer, 34 years with T1D), I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m far from the only one that feels this way. My glycemic control isn&#x27;t significantly better than it was when I did it via constant monitoring and mental math, but the cognitive and emotional burden is much lower. reply haldujai 17 hours agorootparentprev> However, if your brakes (glucagon) can sometimes fail completely, that could cause you to die almost immediatelyFailure detection is via alarms to trigger patient action based on the continuous glucose monitor (which has a different set of reliability issues) as well as patient symptoms.Hypoglycemia becomes symptomatic long before blood sugar is low enough to result in death or serious debilitation and T1D patients know their symptoms well. The risks are not nearly as dramatic as you&#x27;re suggesting as one isn&#x27;t&#x2F;shouldn&#x27;t be relying on glucagon to prevent severe hypoglycemia, I don&#x27;t think any system is designed or being conceived to operate in such conditions.Hypoglycemia isn&#x27;t really much of a problem anymore with current CGMs and pumps. reply pigeons 15 hours agorootparent> Hypoglycemia becomes symptomatic long before blood sugar is low enough to result in death or serious debilitation and T1D patients know their symptoms well.There is a what seems to be a significant number of people who don&#x27;t \"feel their lows.\"> Hypoglycemia isn&#x27;t really much of a problem anymore with current CGMs and pumps.Current CGM&#x27;s can still require hours of \"warm up\", and many current pumps still must be removed for things like swimming so they don&#x27;t get penetrated with water. reply haldujai 15 hours agorootparent> There is a what seems to be a significant number of people who don&#x27;t \"feel their lows.\"Severe hypoglycemia to the point of what was described (death) is not reported in any of the recent device studies.Level 2 or moderate hypoglycemia, very different from death, is reported atCurrent CGM&#x27;s can still require hours of \"warm up\", and many current pumps still must be removed for things like swimming so they don&#x27;t get penetrated with water.Current CGMs are water resistant but conveniently one is also not administering insulin while swimming either. The bionic pancreas is also dependent on CGMs and has the same limitations.I&#x27;m really not sure what point you&#x27;re getting at. Hypoglycemia is not what&#x27;s being improved upon with current advancements, it&#x27;s time in target. reply pigeons 14 hours agorootparentOK thanks, I get your points. What I was getting at is a disagreement with \"Hypoglycemia isn&#x27;t really much of a problem anymore with current CGMs and pumps.\" Because lots of people on current CGMs and pumps still deal with hypoglycemia, despite these pumps and CGMs making the situation so much better than otherwise. reply awaywethrow 14 hours agorootparentprev> Severe hypoglycemia to the point of what was described (death) is not reported in any of the recent device studies.Are there large-scale studies that show this for a dual hormone control algorithm (the context of this thread)? reply haldujai 13 hours agorootparentYou seem to be misunderstanding how these devices work.Bihormonal pumps do not mean continuous infusions of both insulin and glucagon. The pumps pulse insulin when you&#x27;re high and glucagon when you&#x27;re low. They&#x27;re not both administered at the same time or continuously infused in a \"balanced state\".The context in this thread:> However, if your brakes (glucagon) can sometimes fail completelyA bihormonal system would not result in more insulin being administered than an insulin-only system for a given blood sugar, if the glucagon pump fails we would have an insulin-only system where we have plenty of safety data. There is no mechanism by which a bihormonal system has higher risk of hypoglycemia than existing closed loop insulin system. reply awaywethrow 12 hours agorootparentTo clarify, the context of this thread &#x2F; what I was originally responding to was:> In this case, you could be more aggressive in either direction of pushing BG, because you have a safety net. replyet2o 9 hours agorootparentprev> Hypoglycemia becomes symptomatic long before blood sugar is low enough to result in death or serious debilitation and T1D patients know their symptoms well.Often times in an acute setting, yes. However patients who have had diabetes (T1 or T2) for a long time often lose a lot of their hypoglycemia sensitivity and symptoms. It&#x27;s not nearly that simple. reply jablongo 17 hours agorootparentprevYea you would need really good failure detection if you were going to \"hit the gas\" with a bunch of insulin. Part of the solution is going to be controlling risk via the dosing algorithm itself, so you never get in those situations where you are at risk of severe hypo in the event of a (glucagon) site failure. reply Projectiboga 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m a type 1 insulin dependent. The three low tech \"hacks\" I&#x27;ve been happy with are the following. First I take a sublingual Melatonin most nights, Melatonin upregulates the insulin receptors and lowers my insulin requirements about 40% by my guess. The second one is dietary I add olive oil to my lunch and dinner, I feel this provides my body a reserve of non glucose energy. Finally I use a very small dose of cannabis most days, I like to get a puff or two and night, THC protects nerve cells from Hypoxia so I feel this keeps my brain cells going when my blood sugar gets low. I feel these three things, give me a leg up on my long term blood sugar control. I am thankful there are hackers and diy opensource initiatives. The CGM readers here in America Dexcom, and Libre both have crazy bad user interfaces. Libre will only let you pair to a single device, I had their device fail leaving a functional sensor in my arm, a quick idea I searched for opensource libre reader app and found two. One worked and started reading the sensor. Dexcom has the issue of being a 10 day use cycle so you run out on varying days of the week. Both take the FDA mandate to have low blood sugar alarms as a blank check to overide any controls about sound or do not disturb to bother about countdown to a new sensor. I liked that external libre2 reader as it was the only device or official app that can be silenced, but their rigid only pair with one device still angers me, what if my loved one want&#x27;s to be able to scan my sensor? Low blood sugars are challenging as they affect my brain and I can answer an amazing amount of questions about my blood sugar wrong if I get too low, my brain trying to preserve energy can be dangerous at times. This was an issue more before CGM. Dexcom decides that it is OK to have a completely automatic warning at any hour of the night \"your sensor will expire in six hours!!!\", that warning has little to do with my care as it is too late to influence refill compliance and seems to have been ordered by the executives to some how improve their pRofItiBiLiTY. I am so much happier on a third party app with the silent reader as an extra. Sorry if this was long winded, being insulin dependent has bee a challenge over 40 years.

The way glucagon fits into her life is that we have an emergency glucagon shot that she carries in her purse to use in the case of an emergency. The glucagon is more of an immediate emergency recovery. On the flip side glucagon doesn&#x27;t lower the blood sugar which is dangerous when she is going high. reply uberduper 13 hours agorootparentI may be misunderstanding something here. I&#x27;m assuming the emergency you&#x27;re referring to is low glucose. Why would you use a shot of glucagon rather than a dextrose tablet for that sort of emergency? reply db3pt0 13 hours agorootparentA glucose tablet and a glucagon shot can both be used in emergencies, but they are best used to treat different levels of emergencies. You can take a glucose tablet if you&#x27;re coherent and conscious, but when you&#x27;re incoherent or passed out from a severe hypoglycemia, someone else administering a glucagon shot is a lot easier and safer. reply jeroenvlek 18 hours agoparentprevMy wife has diabetes and her endocrinologist told me 5 years ago that the absence of shel-stable glucagon was the reason her insulin pump and glucose sensor weren&#x27;t connected yet.

Body builders have been known to use insulin to gain muscle. reply haldujai 17 hours agoparentprevNo, there isn&#x27;t a hardware problem and such systems exist. Several trials[1-3] dating back several years have looked at \"bionic pancreas\" or a closed loop bihormonal system.Inreda (a Dutch company) has a CE-marked device[4] that can be clinically used but one limitation has been glucagon stability (has to be replenished daily). Tandem in the US was working on this as well but I haven&#x27;t heard anything about them in a while, not sure how far along they are.The Inreda product is still in the early stages of testing but fully functional. Small crossover trials seem promising (defined by more time in euglycemic state).There is a competing approach with \"intelligent insulin\" or a self-regulating glucose sensitive insulin formulation that has different bioavailability depending on circulating glucose levels rather than relying on a monitor, this is farther out from clinical use.One of the reasons bihormonal pumps haven&#x27;t entered mainstream use yet is that it&#x27;s more expensive&#x2F;complicated and the current techniques of algorithmic predictions of hypoglycemic episodes and insulin delivery suspension are already very good that hypo isn&#x27;t much of a problem with modern devices like Tandem&#x27;s offering.Medtronic has added a meal detection algorithm[5] that&#x27;s really good too (the best on the market I&#x27;m told by my endo colleagues) and they say we&#x27;re getting close to not needing meal announcement anymore, this practically eliminates carb counting. It&#x27;s the first such algorithm to be in clinical use so we&#x27;re not there yet but the expectation is that this approach will get us there.The question (for glucagon) then becomes how clinically useful more time in euglycemia is as the hypo episode problem is essentially solved, we&#x27;ll need more data to draw any conclusions and it will take a while for this particular question as many of the outcome measures are long-term (i.e. what are the long-term sequela of mild intermittent hyperglycemia, it&#x27;s somewhere between nothing and uncontrolled diabetes but how far along on that line is the billion dollar question).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28007348&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamasurgery&#x2F;article-abstrac...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;24931572&#x2F;[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inredadiabetic.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;discover-the-ap&#x2F;[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medtronicdiabetes.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;minimed-780g-insu... reply nahsra 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not clear from their site whether the Inreda product also has CGM built into it, or if it must be paired with one?Glucose-responsive insulin also seems like science fiction as this point, but would be extremely powerful tool.I&#x27;m very familiar with one of the most popular, closed-loop system combinations in the USA and I definitely don&#x27;t feel the hypoglycemia problem is anywhere near \"solved\".

Pumps are getting smaller, which is one factor that helps and analysis is getting more accurate. Reliability and sensors are improving. But the timing aspect is critical especially without knowledge about environmental factors and the relatively long hysteresis of the feedback is a major obstacle to the big leap forward. Key here is that the body has more data about the situation than an outside device will ever have and that regulation in the body is a fairly global affair [1] so it can act faster and with more precision than you can ever do from a single site. These are all super tricky problems. But compared to the situation only a decade ago it is already much better and I fully expect at least one more round of breakthrough devices.

With that said, your pancreas also does not know that you plan to work out, at least I would assume so. So what is the crucial difference between a pancreas and insulin injections? That the response is delayed because the injection is not into the blood stream or does the pancreas also have better sensors to figure out how much insulin to release, or maybe even release things other than insulin? If it is the former, what obstacle is there for injecting into the blood stream? The infection risk of having a permanently open port into the circulatory system? If so, is there a similarly effective way to deliver insulin that is not into the blood stream and with less risks? Or could you have some kind of membrane in the port that only allows insulin to pass through but that is impermeable for pathogens? Or would that get clogged immediately? reply epilys 18 hours agorootparentThe difference is the pancreas reacts immediately to changes and has no practical delay for its effects, same concept as PID controllers in engineering. reply danbruc 17 hours agorootparentSo the limiting factor is the subcutane delivery, i.e. if the insulin could be delivered into the blood stream, then continuous glucose monitoring and controlled precise insulin doses could work as well as the pancreas? reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a huge oversimplification, but essentially yes.The current external artificial pancreas solutions operate subcutaneously, and your pancreas gets to work more directly with your blood. Subcutaneous blood sugar readings lag about 20 minutes compared to actual blood (finger pricks), and subcutaneous insulin delivery lags behind a healthy pancreas by even longer. reply mlsu 15 hours agorootparentprevThe subcutaneous part is not really solvable, but even if it were, \"real\" insulin is much faster than even the fastest insulins (lispros) that we currently have. So there is a delay between delivery and action. There is also a delay on the sensing side; the pancreas always knows what&#x27;s up, but even cutting edge CGM technology has significant delays, mostly related to that subcutaneous issue from my understanding. reply haldujai 13 hours agorootparentThere are faster acting insulins creatively named \"faster aspart\" and \"ultra rapid lispro\" with the latter beginning to appear in the bloodstream at 2 minutes and reaching 50% effect around 20 minutes.With that said the difference between CGM&#x2F;pumps and the human body&#x27;s mechanisms of blood glucose regulation is not purely due to pharmacokinetics, regulation of blood sugar is very complex and we still don&#x27;t fully understand them but there are multiple hormones and factors affecting blood glucose regulation.As one example some incretins are released in response to ingested food content and stimulate insulin secretion before blood glucose levels rise. We can&#x27;t replicate that just by measuring blood glucose (not that we necessarily have to).The homeostatic mechanisms of the human body are fascinatingly complex. reply photon_lines 16 hours agorootparentprevThere isn&#x27;t much of a difference between injecting insulin (being diabetic) or getting your body to produce it. The main difference lies in having no automated mechanism for regulating blood sugar levels. Due to this - you have to calculate the correct amount of insulin you need for your meals and measure your blood sugar regularly to make sure it stays within balance. If your blood sugar levels tend to be higher than normal (i.e. you aren&#x27;t injecting enough insulin), that isn&#x27;t good. It is OK in the near term - but can be devastating in the long term due to health complications (i.e. blindness &#x2F; nerve damage &#x2F; etc..). If your blood sugars are fall too low - you can have severe consequences in the near term (i.e. die or have a seizure within 1 hour of injecting insulin). In other words - you need to always keep your blood sugar in check in order to survive and to be in good health. Some people find this extremely hard to do - some people like me embrace it. reply et2o 9 hours agorootparentprevYour pancreas actually does know things like that you&#x27;ve ingested a lot of carbohydrates before they enter the bloodstream, etc. Certainly there is also a response to exercise that occurs before you coiod easily detect it with a CGM.

You might&#x2F;probably already know this, but I&#x27;ll put it out there anyway in case I&#x27;m wrong.The thing to watch out for is that if the CGM was previously alerting about frequent nighttime lows, there should probably be some basal dose adjustment made in the pump. The pump can cover incorrect basal dosages for a good range with its automatic adjustments, but it&#x27;s better to periodically look at the numbers and see if it&#x27;s regularly backing off the basal dose because it&#x27;s too high. reply jablongo 17 hours agoparentprev> - it cannot know external factors like how much carbohydrates you are eating, or if you are planning to work out, etc. Like conventional pumps you have to enter it manually.Sign up for the waitlist of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replica.health!

They are as motivated as any to get it right, not because of a financial incentive but because their life is in the most literal sense at risk of getting it wrong. Of course the big players will all push the fear button, but that should be contrasted with the simple fact that they all have had (sometimes multiple) recalls.Do not underestimate how hard it is to do this right, the people that built these DIY solutions have spent a ton of effort on them, probably more than the equivalent commercial players. But long term my prediction would be that the DIY movement will lose out. The competition has massive lobbying power, a lot of funding and looks like the safe option to outsiders, especially when there is feature parity. The main driver for this development was a simple one: all the parts were out there, but nobody was willing to take the plunge and build a closed loop system and have it certified. But that impetus is now gone and future improvements will be much higher hanging fruit.But I&#x27;d love for them to stay around to keep the industry on its toes. Especially because commercial interests are always going to maximize profits, which for a disease that is so widespread and that affects so many lives should not be a factor. Incidentally: a modern insulin pump is a work of art, if you don&#x27;t know how they work and you fancy technology I would encourage you to have a look at this. reply tracker1 17 hours agoparentI think it&#x27;s awesome that DIY options are becoming more readily available. I&#x27;m t2d, but have a relatively hard time with glucose control overall. If I stick to eggs, meat and green veg, then I don&#x27;t need much beyond the weekly Trulicity and daily Basaglar.If I have anything else, beyond the various food intolerance issues I have, I&#x27;m also experiencing Gastroparesis, which means what I eat may hit sooner, later or much later... as much as 20+ hours later, so I usually have to take a lighter tough to insulin and be more diligent about followup checks. It&#x27;s a literal roller coaster. At least having a Continuous Glucose Monitor (cgm) makes it easier to track. reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentYes, the roller coaster is a great way to put it. One of my business partners had it so bad that whenever he was out of sight for longer than an hour or so people would start to worry if he was ok. We had a major crisis when he dropped off the radar for a full day, everybody pitched in until we found him (and not in a coma). Scary stuff, and with large variations between individuals in terms of severity and speed of onset of symptoms. reply tracker1 16 hours agorootparentThe worst, is the couple times I&#x27;ve experienced ketoacidosis... always feels like a cold&#x2F;flu at first, and only when I&#x27;m coughing up water do I stop to take notice. I keep a keto mojo in addition to my cgm and glocometer... if my glucose is elevated at all, and my ketones are as well, time to start hourly injections until in normal range... I have my cgm alarm at 70 & 240, only because it will fire off many times after eating if I don&#x27;t and takes a while to settle (few hours).Definitely sucks having a broken metabolism. Wish I could go back to my 15-20yo self and totally stop consuming most processed food, seed oils and sugars. It&#x27;s sad that a glucose tolerance and resting insulin tests aren&#x27;t normalized since a1c won&#x27;t start slipping until years later. reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a huge problem. On the plus side though: there is an absolute mountain of information about this disease and there is substantial funding poured into getting it further under control. The holy grail (and artificial pancreas like a pace maker) is still a long way off. But substantial improvements have been made in the last decade and a half and I expect that trend to continue for a while.What I love about this story is that the DIY community managed to break the log-jam of the manufacturers and the regulatory authorities by simply providing them with proof that it can work and can work reliably enough to be allowed on the market. That shortcut probably shaved at least a decade (possibly more) off the progress charts. Manufacturers were (to some degree rightly so) antsy about closed loop systems because it would require them to assume much more liability than they are normally used to, the symptom->diagnosis->action loop that you can engage in by close monitoring and patching together available systems cuts the human out of the loop: the system will function autonomously and a software error or hardware glitch has the potential to kill someone.So the manufacturers were effectively all waiting on each other to show that this can be done safely and that holding pattern had already lasted for multiple years. In the meantime, the larger manufacturers had some time to gain the upper hand over reliability and teething problems of the newer generation of pumps and those came together just in time with continuous monitoring to enable a big step forward in a very hacked (but fully functional) way. No single manufacturer would have taken that risk at this point in time without that push. But now that it is done they can&#x27;t be left behind either or they&#x27;ll lose market share rapidly.It&#x27;s a pity that there are not more diseases (at least, not that I&#x27;m aware of) that would benefit from this approach, diabetes is unique in that respect.Best of luck there. By the way: if you want to stay current with the developments in this field the best spot to look for is the announcement of trials, and sometimes the calls for volunteers for such trials. replyxyzal 19 hours agoprevA friend showed me AndroidAPS&#x27;s automation capabilities and my jaw dropped. \"If this SSID is visible, I am in a gym, so lower basal rate by 20%\".edit: docs for the interested> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;androidaps.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Usage&#x2F;Automation... reply lolc 19 hours agoparentFor me, those features were always very gimmicky. When you arrive at the gym, you should&#x27;ve set the basal rate lower at least an hour ago. So it&#x27;s not going to help unless you stay for multiple hours.The meal detection mentioned is similarly lagging behind. For people who don&#x27;t manage to tell their APS when they eat carbs, yeah it helps, but the outcome is not comparable to dosing before you eat.I also found the calibration features to be too fiddly. Between sensor noise, sensor offset, and calibration, when they try to adapt the situation already changed.I guess these features work better with a very regular lifestyle, which I lack :-) And while I don&#x27;t like having to micro-manage some aspects, like carbs, I appreciate that AndroidAPS reduces my mental load quite a bit and enables living days that are never the same regarding exercise or meals. reply tracker1 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll say, one thing I really appreciate about the fad aspects of Keto as a diet, is that there are a lot more low carb options out there. Of course, ymmv with various fiber varieties and low&#x2F;no calorie sweeteners in practice. Makes it a little easier to keep carb load minimal. I still do far better sticking to eggs, meat and greens, but it&#x27;s hard to do. reply lolc 12 hours agorootparentCan relate as I lived borderline keto for a while. That was nice as my sugar was very stable. Then I decided carbs are nicer.And sure, sweeteners are the better option for drinks. Still prefer my dessert with some sugar. reply DoingIsLearning 19 hours agoparentprevIf you have a safety-critical decision maker running on Android doesn&#x27;t that raise the criticality of the OS (provided there is no other fall-back)?For the regulatory people out there, how does this align in terms of risk management in the world of IEC 62304? reply iancmceachern 19 hours agorootparentMany other similar devices use all types of OSS.You just need to make sure it fails safe. If the OS or any software hangs or crashes just make sure the thing turns off and doesn&#x27;t dump all the insulin or anything. reply birdman3131 19 hours agorootparentI would want a beep or something to let me know it had disconnected. (Also a low battery alarm as well.) On the device not on the phone. And the phone should have the same thing if the device does not respond to a heartbeat signal. reply DoingIsLearning 19 hours agorootparentprevBut this is the mitigations I am asking in terms of risk management. Perhaps people using the app can comment if any of this is already implemented? reply nshepperd 19 hours agorootparentI have an AndroidAPS. This is how it works. If the phone loses contact for any reason the device just falls back to delivering insulin at a fixed rate as normal. reply Forge36 19 hours agoparentprevMy first thought was this sounded like Tasker.

It&#x27;s a huge improvement over just the pump alone. Even just changing basal settings is easier in the app versus the pump device interface, which is no longer required using Loop on iOS with the OrangeLink device.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loopkit.github.io&#x2F;loopdocs&#x2F; They have a new web browser build method using TestFlight, which no longer requires an up to date Mac running the latest version of Xcode. The web build mode also enables someone to update the Loop app using only their smartphone. Something which is handy for travel or long periods of time without access to a Mac. It only lasts 90 days instead of the 1 year of the Xcode build, but is easy to rebuild on TestFlight. reply jfengel 18 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s impressive as hell. The FDA is, by nature, a very conservative and slow-moving organization. They set a very high standard of evidence for anything that&#x27;s actually called \"medicine\". (As opposed to supplements and devices that pretend not to make medical claims, in which they are largely hamstrung.)It takes a ton of effort to get FDA approval. Navigating the process is expensive and aggravating. reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan 8 hours agorootparentI work in the space, and back in 2018 the FDA was communicating very clearly that they wanted to see someone make a closed loop artificial pancreas. They do go a little easier on companies that are developing the new stuff they want. But I suspect the bigger companies didn&#x27;t want to touch it because it&#x27;s inherently risky: any minor bug or glitch can literally kill children any you could lose the whole company.It&#x27;s awesome that the DIY &#x2F; hacker &#x2F; open source folks were able to step up to the opportunity and build this great think, but it is all very much proceed-at-your-own-risk: there&#x27;s nobody with a big pile of cash to sue if you or your loved ones get hurt.I&#x27;d love to see more of these sorts of trailblazing initiatives in the future, and it&#x27;s tremendously encouraging that the FDA is apparently open to this as well. reply nimish 18 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s incredibly impressive. Medical device approval for anything novel is very hard. reply stevezsa8 3 hours agoprevMy wife is a Type 1 diabetic. Here is some interesting complexity:She has a continuous glucose monitor on her body that tells the insulin pump how to dose her basal insulin.Basal insulin is the background dose that you have continuously delivered.At night, if she sleeps on the part of the body with the sensor, the blood sugar reading will be lower than actual. So the pump stops insulin and starts beeping an alarm. No big deal, she just gets up and does a finger stick blood test to check for a false positive. About half the time it will be a false low-blood sugar measure.A related issue is that when you first insert the sensor, the blood sugar reading is way off until the body calms down at the insertion site.So long story short, I think we need better continuous glucose monitors to prevent potential wild see-sawing when there are two opposing meds, as with the insulin-glucagon combo. reply nshepperd 18 hours agoprev> The DIY community and industry are not in opposition, says Lewis.I would really like to believe that, but given how Medtronic and every CGM I have used have seemingly intentionally sabotaged open source loop compatibility with every new product, it doesn&#x27;t seem like everyone&#x27;s on board... reply jablongo 17 hours agoparentYeah she&#x27;s being diplomatic for sure. Dexcom plays ball and is also the most successful of the CGMs, so you would think that others would follow their lead and write their data to apple health. Most companies keep their data thinking its going lead to some unspecified profits down the line but then never really do anything with it. reply thecosas 10 hours agorootparentI still don&#x27;t understand why they put a 3-hour delay on writing to Apple Health though.

The problem is that nobody notices pancreatic cancer until the death warrant is signed (to use your metaphor). Using a bionic pancreas would be like putting out the fire in the kitchen only when the rest of the house is also in flames. reply rexreed 17 hours agorootparentDefinitely what is needed is better early detection but I know that&#x27;s a can of worms of its own. I commented on the bionic pancreas article as I know it&#x27;s not a solution to pancreatic cancer, but I&#x27;m hoping that continued research in this direction evolves into better diagnosis and cures. reply mlsu 15 hours agoprevI assure you: commercial players are working very hard on this.The difficult part is actually power management. There are clearly very sophisticated algorithms that can do no meal announce closed loop management of t1d (just google scholar \"closed loop type 1\" -- it&#x27;s a very popular problem for control systems researchers).But they take a lot of power. Embedded convex solvers for large MPC schemes do not come cheap, especially when you want them running every 5 minutes! I have used this DIY loop system in the past. It is extremely power hungry and requires recharging daily, even when plugged in half the day. And I don&#x27;t even think they are doing anything exotic like MPC. I stopped using it because of those battery issues and the implementation is gnarly -- it&#x27;s basically a collection of bash scripts and relies on the operating system (armbian linux) to schedule doses. No RTOS, no watchdogs...Power management is extremely important in a pump. If a pump dies every <24 hours without being recharged, that impacts both the patient experience and can be very dangerous. If it dies overnight you get no insulin and you will be very sick the next morning.That said, I love that this is a thing. It pushes the tech forward and gets people excited about a machine cure, which is the only viable solution to \"curing\" type 1 at the moment. reply lolc 19 hours agoprevDepending on AndroidAPS for my insulin management, I&#x27;m very happy that people are working on getting this into app stores!I&#x27;m not using most of the advanced features but just having the device regulate basal rate is life-changing.

As I come from the libre3 I have to say that the G7 overall feels more sophisticated, yet alone the overpatch they send with each sensor will help keeping the sensor on my arm. In the past the libre3 often just fell of during my swim training.Further, libre3 is often just not supported by third party apps or pumps or other. They do not provide an official API, that might be helpful for tracking your clucose. Back in the days I used and contributed to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timoschlueter&#x2F;nightscout-librelink-up to periodically fetched my sensor data from librelink and stored it my nightscout, that runs on my server at my home. That helped a lot, but it was more than a hack. reply sgmoore 19 minutes agorootparentprevI have read a few people who say they prefer the dexcom because the freestyle is pre-calibrated and Abbott&#x27;s software doesn&#x27;t allow you to calibrate the device.(I&#x27;ve never tried the dexcom and am very happy with my libre) reply user_7832 14 hours agorootparentprevAs someone using a freestyle Libre 2, I’m also curious.From what I know, I think the main reason is that the Libre needs NFC vs the Dexcom’s Bluetooth… except that Abbott recently updated (!!) the software and now Bluetooth works at par as the dexcom.Some people have better sensitivity with one or the other I agree, but both are fairly solid.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content The Verge homepage / Tech/ Reviews/ Science/ Entertainment/ More Menu MICROSOFT/TECH/GOOGLE Microsoft is using malware-like pop-ups in Windows 11 to get people to ditch Google / Microsoft’s latest desperate attempts to get people to use Bing are a disgusting overreach. By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Aug 30, 2023, 3:00 AM PDT|95 Comments / 95 New Share this story Illustration: The Verge I thought I had malware on my main Windows 11 machine this weekend. There I was minding my own business in Chrome before tabbing back to a game and wham a pop-up appeared asking me to switch my default search engine to Microsoft Bing in Chrome. Stunningly, Microsoft now thinks it’s ok to shove a pop-up in my face above my apps and games just because I dare to use Chrome instead of Microsoft Edge. This isn’t a normal notification, either. It didn’t appear in the notification center in Windows 11, nor is it connected to the part of Windows 11 that suggests new features to you. It’s quite literally a rogue executable file that has somehow appeared in c:\\windows\\temp\\mubstemp and is digitally signed by Microsoft. “We are aware of these reports and have paused this notification while we investigate and take appropriate action to address this unintended behavior,” says Caitlin Roulston, director of communications, in a statement to The Verge. The latest Bing popup appeared above the taskbar on Windows 11. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge This annoying popup even appeared above a game. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge I have no idea why Microsoft thinks it’s ok to fire off these pop-ups to Windows 11 users in the first place. I wasn’t alone in thinking it was malware, with posts dating back three months showing Reddit users trying to figure out why they were seeing the pop-up. I’m sure Microsoft is legally covered by the myriad of license agreements that nobody reads, but in reality I never knowingly consented to Microsoft abusing its ability to analyze my PC usage to show me a Bing pop-up just because I use Chrome with Google search. This isn’t Microsoft’s first rodeo, either. I’m growing increasingly frustrated by the company’s methods of getting people to switch from Google and Chrome to Bing and Edge. Microsoft has been using a variety of prompts for years now, with pop-ups appearing inside Chrome, on the Windows taskbar, and elsewhere. Microsoft has even forced people into Edge after a Windows Update, and regularly presents a full-screen message to switch to Bing and Edge after updates. Microsoft also started taking over Chrome searches in Bing recently to deliver a canned response that looks like it’s generated from Microsoft’s GPT-4-powered chatbot. The fake AI interaction produced a full Bing page to entirely take over the search result for Chrome and convince Windows users to stick with Edge and Bing. Microsoft even took over Chrome search results in Bing recently. Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge You’ve probably never seen this latest pop-up or even some of the ones in the past, and that’s because Microsoft only experiments with a small number of Windows users before there’s an outcry and the company pivots to try and find another way to nag Windows users. Microsoft even had to backtrack on plans to force the Chrome default search to Bing for businesses installing its Office apps. You might argue that this is Microsoft’s operating system, or that when using Microsoft’s browser and search engine it’s well within its rights to try and sway people away from Chrome. After all, Google runs similar notifications on its webpages to get people to use Chrome or it’s annoying YouTube premium spam. But Microsoft’s behaviors here are totally beyond a simple webpage prompt. I shouldn’t have to be dismissing pop-ups that appear on top of my apps and games, or ones that magically appear after I update my copy of Windows. Windows isn’t freeware, it requires a license that almost every consumer ultimately pays for. That could be in the form of the price of a laptop that has a Windows OEM license baked in, or a product key if you built your own PC. Microsoft should respect the fact that people already pay for Windows and don’t want ads shoved down their throats. Windows is an important productivity tool for many people, and shouldn’t be treated like a cheap streaming box loaded with ads. I truly hope Microsoft changes its ways here, but this has been going on in several different forms for years now so I’m just counting the days until the next annoying pop-up appears. 95 COMMENTS95 NEW Most Popular Google leaked Google’s flagship Pixel 8 Pro, again Sony is raising PlayStation Plus prices up to $40 per year The Fairphone 5 is a little more repairable and much more modern Microsoft is using malware-like pop-ups in Windows 11 to get people to ditch Google Wireless carriers are messing with your autopay discount Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

It&#x27;s also great for running multiple OS&#x27;s, e.g. you can install a headless Ubuntu with `brew install lima` or install and run latest ARM Windows 11, Ubuntu and Fedora OS&#x27;s with UTM [2] which saved me a Parallels License I thought I needed to run Windows on macOS.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;servicestack.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;postgres-mysql-sqlserver-on-a...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mac.getutm.app reply giancarlostoro 20 hours agoparentI wanted to add a new user account on my new Windows 11 system. It came with Windows Home right. So when I went to add one, it told me that feature is disabled because I have poor man&#x27;s Windows, go to this other program. So I go to program B. Guess what program B told me? It told me I was using poor man&#x27;s Windows to go back to program A to add a new user. I had to do it via command line. After I was about to remove my Hotmail user (I just wanted offline only users) I said screw this, and installed POP_OS! instead, installed Steam, and move on with life. I even played the good &#x27;ole Cyberpunk 2077 on Linux thanks to Proton.I think at this point I have nothing keeping me using Windows other than the rare game that Proton doesn&#x27;t support, but my old gaming rig still works and plays most games, so I can easily swap. It pisses me off though, because my Windows 10 box for some reason, at some point, any new program I install does not show up in the start menu whatsoever. I&#x27;ve not even been able to find anything on Google that remotely answers why its broken. At least with Steam I dont have to worry about it, but if I hit Windows Key and type anything, I dont see any programs I installed like three years ago. Freaking weird.Anyway, I think moving forward I&#x27;ll be buying Mac or Linux Systems. I&#x27;ll let employers buy me Windows boxes.Edit: Typo&#x27;d Proton as Photon ;) reply simiones 19 hours agorootparentUnfortunately Linux is still far from ready. It&#x27;s awesome that it can run Steam games quite seamlessly, and it can even run non-Steam games if you fiddle around a bit and find the magic incantations. But - I tried using it for things like GoG, and quickly found out that there is actually no way of running GOG on Linux, even with Proton&#x2F;Wine, unless maybe if I go and install a bunch of other 3rd parties. Not to mention, installing the Nvidia drivers without first running an apt upgrade on my newly installed system quickly broke the whole thing to where it wouldn&#x27;t even boot.So back to Windows it is, and hoping that they respect the GDPR enough to protect me from the worse of their snooping. reply matkoniecz 19 hours agorootparent\"GoG\" what is that?> Unfortunately Linux is still far from ready.Depends on person. I use it for over decade, exclusively for few years since my Windows install bricked itself and recovery partition few years ago (and I discovered that I have no idea how I should reinstall Windows) reply simiones 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m referring to GOG Galaxy, the Good Old Games game launcher. It&#x27;s an app similar to Steam, which allows you to install and update your GOG games, get achievements, sync saves etc. reply nailer 19 hours agorootparentprevGood Old Games. It&#x27;s a game store, like Steam. Used to be for old games hence the name. reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparent> quickly found out that there is actually no way of running GOG on LinuxBut GoG is a website, not an application. The games they&#x27;ve ported&#x2F;adapted to Linux work great, at least for me. I&#x27;ve never had the slightest trouble. reply simiones 17 hours agorootparentClarified in another reply, I was referring to GOG Galaxy, the launcher that you would use to keep those games up to date, sync saves across systems etc. reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparentAh, OK. I&#x27;ve actually never heard of GoG Galaxy before, and so haven&#x27;t ever used it. reply simiones 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s obviously not required, but I do find it nice, especially for newer games that still receive regular patches. And of course, achievements are sometimes fun to have as well. replybastardoperator 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s called heroicgameslauncher, runs on Linux and works with GoG.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Heroic-Games-Launcher&#x2F;HeroicGamesLauncher reply simiones 17 hours agorootparentI hadn&#x27;t heard about this one when I was researching options. I&#x27;ll give it a go next time I feel inclined to play with Linux, it sounds like it supports most of the features I&#x27;d like. reply bastardoperator 17 hours agorootparentTo be fair&#x2F;transparent, I hadn&#x27;t heard about it either until my 16 year old pointed it out a couple of months ago, LOL. reply schlurken 16 hours agorootparentprevCan also be used on the Steam Deck to run games from GoG (since the Steam Deck uses Linux). reply dleslie 18 hours agorootparentprevHeroic Launcher does a great job of getting GoG products working on Linux with minimal effort. reply giancarlostoro 19 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried Lutris? It seems to have GOG support, and is designed to help you do all the incantations for you. I havent tried it yet, but have heard a lot of good things about it. reply simiones 19 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a limit to how many third parties I was willing to install to get the programs I wanted working. I also didn&#x27;t read anywhere that Lutris would have helped with GOG - every reddit thread I trawled ended up saying that we need to wait for a Linux version of GOG. I tried Steam, I tried playing with a few of its options, I tried a few ways of running GOG as a steam game - decided to switch back to Windows. I do enough debugging at work, I don&#x27;t want to spend too much of my free time debugging there either. reply giancarlostoro 18 hours agorootparentAll I know is Lutris is meant to handle every windows game client: GOG, Steam, Origin, and so on. reply simiones 17 hours agorootparentResearching a bit more, it seems that Lutris can download and perhaps run these games, but it doesn&#x27;t offer other integrations. It&#x27;s not clear to me whether it downloads updates automatically for them, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t handle things like cloud saves (I game from multiple systems) or achievements. replykibwen 19 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m a big fan of PopOS after using it for over a year now. I hadn&#x27;t used desktop Linux for over a decade and expected the usual hassle and obscure fiddling, but in all honesty I&#x27;ve found it easier to use than not just Windows (obviously, it&#x27;s a shitshow these days) but even Mac too (which wouldn&#x27;t let me configure my suspend settings without running obscure shell commands copied off the internet, and required me to set up homebrew to get any decent software store, and broke git on every single system update, and...) reply wing-_-nuts 19 hours agorootparentI fled to pop os after the arch devs decided that shipping a broken build of grub master branch (nightly) was totally acceptable, and if I didn&#x27;t like it I should &#x27;use an easier distro&#x27;. They left millions of users in an unbootable state and weren&#x27;t the least bit apologetic about it. Easiest decision I ever made. reply processunknown 8 hours agorootparentThats a wild response. I left arch in 2012 and have been with debian since then because its stable. I would have lost all faith. reply giancarlostoro 19 hours agorootparentprevI might switch to Fedora since I want something kind of \"rolling\" but not quite bleeding edge. But I&#x27;ve used Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu based OS&#x27; for a while, and POP is definitely one of my favorites currently. I will nag about one thing though, their package manager UI has some severe bug where it halts the whole UI (probably a threading issue). reply tamimio 13 hours agorootparentprevI use linux as a daily driver since probably around 2006, but to say it’s a replacement for windows, it’s just not the case, your example for “readiness” is video games, a lot don’t care about that but rather other productivity software, Adobe suite and Adobe acrobat, MS suite, some CAD&#x2F;3D software, a lot of engineering software like simulators and what not, and you either have crappy alternatives (like anything to replace adobe) or none in the case of other software. That’s why I still have Win10 on a non-upgradable CPU, and as long as I can run these software there, will not update. reply whywhywhywhy 17 hours agoparentprev> But I can&#x27;t stand the scammy adware infused OS Windows has becomeSet up the drivers for a professional level ASUS motherboard last night, during the installation of the drivers, which was essential because LAN and Wifi didn&#x27;t work without them. It showed me ads for Norton 360 and WinRar over and over during the installation that seemed to take way longer than it should.Then it told me an update was required and preselected in the update was install WinRar and Norton360.Like ASUS, please I&#x27;m begging you, just charge me the $0.20 to $1 more that these ads earned you direct to me. Please just charge what you need to make a quality professional product and have some self respect for what you&#x27;re shipping.This only happens because it&#x27;s become normal all across windows software and tools. reply gumballindie 20 hours agoparentprevWhy not Linux (depending on your line of work). Wider hardware choice, easier to upgrade, and no corporate oversight. Doesn&#x27;t cover all use cases but it&#x27;s a good option these days. reply trustingtrust 20 hours agorootparentWith computers like framework and system76, the community for hardware support is solid too now. Seriously considering a switch from M1. I feel like macOS is half baked development environment. I only stay because I never bought a Linux supported computer and I got the M1 air very cheap. But I am considering getting a framework as I just damaged a usb-c port and I am not entering apple’s repairability problem. reply squarefoot 19 hours agorootparentThe Starfighter also seems quite interesting: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starlabs.systems&#x2F;pages&#x2F;starfighter (Although I love the Framework concept)As for Linux support for your M1, did you check out Asahi Linux? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9zHoZK4FoIo Its development is progressing rapidly, so be sure to check out the latest development status at their site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asahilinux.org&#x2F; reply senectus1 8 hours agorootparentHave a work mate that has just bought a 2nd hand apple lappy with the M2 and has Asahi installed on it.it is blazingly fast. No kidding around... everything just snaps on when clicked.If this is the future I may have to start buying apple hardware reply _fat_santa 19 hours agorootparentprevWhile Framework and Sys76 are the two major players in the Linux laptop space, if you are looking to save money I would recommend picking up a Dell&#x2F;Lenovo&#x2F;HP \"business\" laptop, those run Linux really well and a good chunk are even certified to run Ubuntu.In my experience though I stopped buying laptops for personal use and started buying desktops. Easier to upgrade, usually cheaper and better support for Linux just by virtue of not having things like a Wifi or BT card. reply pxc 17 hours agorootparentWhy is Framework considered a player in that space? What does that company actively do to improve Linux support? Do they offer free BIOSes like coreboot? Are any of their peripheral firmwares open-source? What kind of Linux compatibility do they guarantee for their hardware prior to launch?Afaik they&#x27;re exactly the same as Lenovo: a Windows PC manufacturer that happens to be popular with Linux users, and which doesn&#x27;t go out of their way to break things for Linux users. But they&#x27;ve shipped laptops that had broken power management on Linux on launch day, for example. They&#x27;re not a Linux hardware vendor. reply hot_gril 16 hours agorootparentLenovo Thinkpads have explicit Linux support, but they still tend to have issues with Bluetooth audio at the very least. reply pxc 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a welcome development. In the past, every time I&#x27;ve been in the market for a laptop, they had few or no explicitly supported models.(The Bluetooth thing sucks though.) reply backendanon 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had excellent support from Linux across a variety of machines for 2 decades. Dell, Lenovo and HP. reply mort96 19 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with PC hardware is that yes, there&#x27;s more choice, but it&#x27;s all mostly bad. Nobody other than Apple manages to put a decent and reliable trackpad on their machines for example, and all PC laptops I&#x27;ve used have at times gotten really loud. If you&#x27;re okay with non-Windows OSes, hardware choice is the main reason to pick Apple machines.Also, Linux is coming along rather well on Apple Silicon machines. reply vladvasiliu 19 hours agorootparentFWIW, I find current gen (starting with 8th) HP EliteBooks decent enough. They work perfectly in Linux (actually better than Windows, since for a while some bits weren&#x27;t recognized...). They&#x27;re quiet unless I&#x27;m compiling something (if I don&#x27;t use Windows, which for some reasons gets the fan spinning even when it&#x27;s supposed to be asleep). The trackpad is good, even though it&#x27;s worse than my 2013 MBP&#x27;s. The main issue I have with them is the absurdly bad displays. Even the top-of-the-line display is ridiculously bad. reply webnrrd2k 17 hours agorootparentJust to add a data point, the HP ElitBooks have been my replacement for ThinkPads. I find the to be a good replacement. I&#x27;ve been running Redhat on an HP elitebook 840 g6, which Ive had for about a year now, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. The trackpad is mostly good, not great, but I&#x27;m more of a nub guy and that works perfectly. reply vladvasiliu 16 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m more of a nub guy and that works perfectlyI&#x27;d never had a PC with a trackpoint before the hp, but I can&#x27;t get used to it. How do you configure it? I find it&#x27;s either uncontrollably quick, or slow as molasses. I like the idea of being able to drive it without moving my hand to the trackpad. reply jader201 18 hours agorootparentprev> Even the top-of-the-line display is ridiculously bad.To me, that’s far from “decent enough”, not even taking into account the other (more minor) differences you name. reply vladvasiliu 17 hours agorootparentThe reason I mention it is because some people don&#x27;t really care about display quality. I know basically none of my colleagues do. They&#x27;ll see a MBP and go \"yeah, it looks better. so?\". But they do care if half the things don&#x27;t work (think borked wifi or no webcam). So, for people like this, I find it&#x27;s a good data point. And even though I do care about display quality, given my usage pattern, this isn&#x27;t much of an issue in practice, since 99% of this PC&#x27;s usage is tethered to a high-quality external screen. If I had a gorgeous MBP, I&#x27;d still be looking at the same monitor.The battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as an M mac, either. But then again, I rarely use it away from a desk. I could technically use one of those mini pcs that I&#x27;d cart around, but for the 1% of the time when I do use while out and about, it&#x27;s a good compromise. reply nicolaslem 17 hours agorootparentprevI daily drive a Gen 9 on Linux, it works fairly well, it even gets BIOS updates through fwupd now! However I cannot state how bad the display is, it&#x27;s dragging-a-window-leaves-a-visible-trail bad. reply vladvasiliu 16 hours agorootparentAs far as I remember, the \"best\" displays on the Elitebooks sport a whopping 72%... NTSC coverage. Some are worse, at around 48% or something.I don&#x27;t understand why they cheap out so much on displays. These could be very nice little laptops... My 10 yo MBP&#x27;s display is running circles around them... reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprevEvery single LCD display technology right now has serious flaws. I don&#x27;t understand it. reply gorjusborg 20 hours agorootparentprevNot the person you responded to, but I&#x27;m in the same boat; I went from grudgingly using it due to being the &#x27;best&#x27; in practice, to seeing it as something I need to move away from.I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;big three&#x27; (windows&#x2F;macos&#x2F;linux) desktop OSs at work and home in recent years. Here&#x27;s my ranking:1) Linux 2) MacOS 3) WindowsWhere I have control to use what I want, linux is my choice. At work though, I need to jump through endpoint management and security theater nonsense, so I am stuck choosing between MacOS and Windows. reply mythz 20 hours agorootparentprevI do all my deployment to Linux Servers, but I want my main Desktop to just work and plan on sticking to the primary OS the hardware was built for. Don&#x27;t need broad hardware support, it just needs to support M3 hardware when it comes out. I&#x27;m also running macOS software like Pixelmator Pro and Affinity software suite.I&#x27;m already running multiple Docker Linux containers, headless Ubuntu on lima and GUI Ubuntu and Fedora VMs in UTM, so don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m missing out on the Desktop Linux experience.I could definitely do most of my development on Linux given .NET SDK and JetBrains products supports it, but I&#x27;ll be waiting a few years at least for Asahi Linux to get feature parity before running it natively. reply jwells89 20 hours agorootparentprevThe frustrating thing about shopping for x86 laptops (as you probably will be if you’re wanting to run Linux) is how few models come even a little close to comparing to MacBooks in terms of battery life even with tools like tlp running and CPU throttled down as far as it’ll go, and that’s to say nothing about heat and fan noise.I’ve been looking around and the only two 12-14” options I can find that match that description are the HP Dragonfly G4 and ASUS Zenbook S OLED (AMD), and those still fall several hours short of the M2 Air, and the M3 Air will likely widen that gap with its SoC being on a smaller process node. reply gumballindie 19 hours agorootparentBattery is indeed best on macbooks.> ASUS Zenbook S OLED (AMD)I went for the asus proart studio book. high screen resolution, high refresh rate, the oled display is gorgeous (although the touch screen overlay is slightly visible, not an issue once used to it) and it feels more robust than a macbook. also trivially upgrade-able short of cpu and gpu. had to patch my acpi tables for sound support, and no asus dial compat yet. every now and then i get my hands dirty and i might be able to hack something to get it working. thus got a new hobby as well :-) reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprev>Wider hardware choiceYou&#x27;re joking right? Sure, something built in 2002 will probably still work well in Linux, but that&#x27;s often the case for Windows, and on a Windows system, the hardware AND the proprietary software it came with will probably still work.Meanwhile, in Linux land, if you don&#x27;t buy very very very specific hardware you can never hope to have functional sleep. reply hot_gril 17 hours agorootparentprevLinux is ok nowadays, but why? The Mac hardware is already better, and Apple isn&#x27;t too annoying. You&#x27;ll have more random nonsense to deal with on Linux, some of it not their fault. reply consoomer 16 hours agorootparentMac is more annoying than it seems. I went full Linux around three years ago. The annoyance for me peaked with Mac phoning home file data every time I tried to open a file and apps breaking upon major updates.My main issue was with the hardware though. I would spend $3,400-$4500 on a nice machine only to have the keyboard break and be told they would replace the entire motherboard, etc. Then to have a screen break due to a poor cable connection and be told I would have to replace everything again.I said fuck it and bought a decent machine with open hardware and a good-enough screen. It&#x27;s no mac display, but damn... I haven&#x27;t had to fight with hardware or software in about three years. The kicker? My machine only cost me $1,100 and battery isn&#x27;t half bad. I get 9 hours with it.. which I never believed was possible with Linux before. reply JohnFen 16 hours agorootparentprev> Apple isn&#x27;t too annoyingI find Apple to be too annoying for my tastes. Less annoying than Microsoft, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much. reply hot_gril 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s that vs the annoyance of using Linux. Which is worse? I&#x27;ve been there, diagnosing bluetooth and wifi issues, dealing with free vs non-free drivers, finding out Netflix won&#x27;t run in 1080p&#x2F;4K, going down the Flash rabbit hole back then, dealing with sleep issues, having sound not work, jumping ship to whatever DE is best supported, messing with WINE for the plethora of non-Linux-supported apps, it never ends. A \"how to do X in Linux\" article exists for so many things that you&#x27;d never search for on Mac (or even Windows), but Linux users tend to make it sound like everything works out of the box. reply JohnFen 15 hours agorootparentAs a Linux user, everything does tend to work out of the box for me, and Linux is far less annoying to me than Apple&#x27;s stuff. YMMV, of course.I&#x27;m thinking that a lot of this depends on what you&#x27;re doing with your machines. Linux isn&#x27;t ideal for certain things (that happen to be things that don&#x27;t matter to me), for certain. Just as other OSes aren&#x27;t ideal for other things. Your experience, I suspect, largely depends on what your use case is. reply myaccountonhn 14 hours agorootparentprevI just switched to a 6 year old laptop I had from Mac and installed Linux on it. Everything worked great for my use case. I think this depends so much on the hardware you use. replyFredPret 19 hours agoparentprevI became a new MacOS user when the M1 was released.One thing I really like is that it&#x27;s so much more similar to Linux than Windows. Many of my favourite Linux server tools also run on Mac. They&#x27;re either included or are a \"brew install x\" away.Everything from cron to nginx (for local web dev) works like a charm. Combine this with the extreme ease of doing office-type work on a Macbook: Excel works, printing &#x2F; scanning works. Add in multi-day battery life and a kickass CPU. Price this the same or lower than the equivalent Windows machine. It&#x27;s a learning curve to go from Windows to MacOS, but well worth it, and a total no-brainer for most non-gamers. reply calciphus 19 hours agorootparentEvery time I click the play button on my keyboard, Apple Music launches and asks if I want to start a subscription. There&#x27;s no (normal) way to make it so that play will launch, or even reliably play, Spotify.MacOS is covered in non-removable Apple adware like this but somehow always gets a pass.... yes apparently I can install an app that force quits Music every time it launches, or I can modify system permissions, but...why can&#x27;t I just uninstall it? reply rogual 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s odd, I just tried mine and it controls VLC just fine. reply hot_gril 17 hours agorootparentIf a video is already open in VLC, yes. It&#x27;s a little annoying how the button will launch Music if there&#x27;s nothing to play. I don&#x27;t give them a pass for this, it&#x27;s just still a lottt less annoying than Windows. reply FredPret 18 hours agorootparentprevMine plays whatever was playing last, including youtube in Chrome. Brutal! Now I just click on the play icon in the top menu instead - that shows a list of all play button targets and you can pick which one should play. reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentMine usually works great, controlling whatever program or video I&#x27;m watching, but 10% of the time it just decides to go control a completely different AV program in the background, for no discernible reason.I don&#x27;t have that issue with play buttons on Windows. Never tried media keys on linux. reply ant6n 18 hours agorootparentprevApple is full of weird choices that are off-putting to newcomers, intrusive ads, bugs. For some reason in German, they use a non-standard keyboard layout and they don&#x27;t sell a standard one.But it&#x27;s still better than Windows.I just wish Apple would fix their idiosyncrasies, I may have gone into the eco-system more fully. I guess they don&#x27;t need the business of undecided people. reply acruns 19 hours agorootparentprevpeople can&#x27;t manage to block \"malware\" on a Windows system but somehow manage to use a dev tools? and the idea that a Mac costs the same or less as a dell&#x2F;hp is ludicrous. the cheapest MacBook air is $1000, while a Windows laptop is $500. sorry to destroy your ideology but at least be honest and say I prefer a Mac and can afford it suck windows can pound sand. reply FredPret 18 hours agorootparentEquivalent hardware. $500 does not buy you a Mac Air level laptop.And I am talking about power users, not the hypothetical grandma.

Within the first couple weeks of using it, I&#x27;ve run into* Time doesn&#x27;t stay in sync after sleeping, which breaks package updating.* It doesn&#x27;t get the DNS servers it should from DHCP, so you have to go manually edit &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.conf* The filesystem is super slow, and git commands take multiple seconds.All stuff that can be worked around, but I don&#x27;t have to deal with this crap when just running Linux, and all Windows gets me is a clunky UI and ads. It&#x27;s mystifying to me that everyone is somehow capable of managing fleets of Linux servers just fine, but for some reason managing developer Linux workstations is impossible, so we end up with these Rube Goldberg machines. reply NikkiA 18 hours agorootparentThe problem I see most often is that WSL causes processor stalls in my other VMs, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s intentional to force you to use WSL or the Hyper-V VM subsystem exclusively, if it is I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a wise move.Enabling Hyper-V also meant that virtualbox completely lost the ability to have a clock that ran properly - each VM was seeing the hardware timer out by 3 seconds every minute, and thus the only fix there was to run ntp every minute. vmware wasn&#x27;t affected somehow. reply lenova 18 hours agorootparentprev> The filesystem is super slow, and git commands take multiple seconds.Ugh, this is a known issue in WSL if you try to use git on the host operating system (&#x2F;mnt&#x2F;c&#x2F;Users&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;repo)... there are cross-system file system virtualization issues in WSL2 when reading from the Windows hosts.Workaround is to have your git repos within WSL itself (~&#x2F;my-git-repo) to have native performance. reply capableweb 17 hours agorootparentAll of these workarounds unfortunately adds up, and after a while it&#x27;s just too much to having to deal with, when you could have just gone straight up for a Linux&#x2F;Windows dual boot setup and not having to deal with any of those issues at all. reply wing-_-nuts 16 hours agorootparentprevIt really is a shame.

Then limit innovation in delivery to places where it&#x27;s both not intrusive and already established (e.g. media publications, etc).The manipulation and excessive proliferation has to stop, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with a business being able to reach out to tell people about what they&#x27;re selling.

He talked about frames of reference. To illustrate the point, he asked if we had seen the movie, E.T. Of course, we all had. It was the Star Wars-level blockbuster of the summer of 1982. He asked if we remembered the bus scene. None of us could. \"You know, &#x27;Uranus?&#x27;\" Oh, right. Yes, we all remembered that line. Then he asked us if we could remember what any of the other kids were doing. Nope. They were standing, yelling, throwing things, and generally being disruptive. He said, as a principal, this anarchy on a school bus horrified him. It never even registered with us.This lesson continues to reverberate with me over 40 years later.People on this site \"govern\" our computers and devices as much as we can, so when these things happen, they stick out like a sore thumb, and we set about stopping it from happening again. Even after 30 years of \"being on the internet,\" I am RUTHLESS about spam. When one shows up in my inbox, I deal with it, so that, by and large, every email that comes through is of interest and needs my attention.The people who use Windows for any more than gaming (and a lot of them, too) are the kind of people that have 10,000 unread emails in their inbox, all of which are spam for services and offers they agreed to be spammed by, because they couldn&#x27;t be bothered to at least tick the opt-out box (which only works half the time anyway). When the vast majority of these users see a popup like this, they simply click the button to dismiss it, just like hundreds other digital annoyances they put up with all day long, which they do not understand, and which they do not know how to turn off.It doesn&#x27;t matter that we get upset about this. It&#x27;s already been proven several times over that we cannot influence this situation. The economics just don&#x27;t matter to Microsoft.

The only surprise here is that The Verge wrote a piece that is overtly negative about Microsoft. reply marcodiego 16 hours agoparent> It&#x27;s already been proven several times over that we cannot influence this situation.I have a few points against this.First is that it is not that important if we can revert M$ (yes, sorry, I&#x27;ll refer to them this way for this comment) behavior, the most important is that we should have alternatives. For that we must push hardware and software vendors to support other OS&#x27;s, specially Linux.Second is that, by making a choice, we can influence statistics and this influence may be becoming strong enough to give us some bargain powers (a lot of recent open source drivers only became economically viable because of that). I don&#x27;t know how much worse is the Android-land but most \"normal\" people are using their mobile devices more than their desktops, the same shift doesn&#x27;t happened to power users. This made the share of power users on desktop to grow significantly recently, specially after the pandemic. Actually, I partly assign to this the current uptick of the Linux desktop (more than 3% with ChromeOS above 4% recently).We may be a minority, but we are no longer a minority that can be ignored. A share of 7% of under served proficient users is a huge market wanting to be pleased. Vendors can not ignore us any longer.We should not waste our efforts trying to convince M$ not to turn their OS into a ad-infested wastebasket; Let it be! We should concentrate our efforts so that we can comfortably live without depending on M$. reply ryandrake 15 hours agorootparentVery true. Go shadow a \"normal\" user of a web browser without adblocking, and you&#x27;ll see they spend so much time dismissing popup after popup after popup. It&#x27;s totally normal to them and doesn&#x27;t even irritate them. The act of finding and tapping the tiny \"X\" is practically automatic and second nature.Same for people who don&#x27;t curate their phone notifications. I was standing in line at a fast food restaurant and had a good look at some guy&#x27;s phone he left unlocked on one of the tables. It was just notification after notification. Ding, buzz, ding, ding, buzz, ding-ding, ding-ding, buzz-buzz, ding, ding. The top notification area had something displaying there 100% of the time. How can people even live like that?Another example. My elderly parents still watch cable TV. When I visit them, I can&#x27;t even bear the loud and constant ads, but it doesn&#x27;t even phase them--they don&#x27;t even notice them.

That is incomprehensible that someone would go to the effort of programming that message thinking it was in any way useful. How did that make it past code review and Canonical bundling into mainline Ubuntu server? It can go with the Ubuntu Server installer which, when there&#x27;s no network connection asks if you want to continue installing without network access and when you say yes the next step prompts for a proxy server address to get to the internet and the step after tries to connect to the internet to apt update - just running through that one single time or even thinking it through is enough to show the problem there, but apparently Canonical developers ... didn&#x27;t do either?

It’s the same toxic fanboy wars we see if a game doesn’t come out on a specific console or available on a specific store.Doing so costs money for a small portion of the community. Ultimately these studios are businesses and have to make financial choices.I do fully recognize that this is a chicken and the egg problem.

I want to play the games. reply gumballindie 19 hours agorootparentI paid for a product and I expect that product to at least not intentionally restrict use on proton. If you intentionally restrict its use on whatever platform i see fit then you are getting a negative review. The wine folks and valve have put serious effort into patching your product to work on linux, but when you actively undermine their effort and intentionally limit its use - either by banning players on linux or hacking your game to not work - then that&#x27;s not nice.There is no fanboying in wanting to use a product whichever way I see fit. It&#x27;s mine. reply nerdjon 18 hours agorootparentI partially agree, however considering you are mentioning banning players I think that when we are talking about an online game it is entirely within their right (and we should expect them too) to ban someone from playing in an unsupported manner. Cheating is a problem with online games. If they feel like (wether or not the community agrees doesn&#x27;t matter) that configuration is not secure they don&#x27;t have any obligation to support it.However, when you paid for the product you should know how something is supported. If you buy it to do something that is not supported you should not leave a negative review. You are punishing them for your choice.There needs to be a serious discussion about what exactly steam did with the steam deck and proton. They put out a new platform and basically told developers, it&#x27;s now your job to support this. Yes a lot of the work is done by proton but it is not a silver bullet but normal consumers don&#x27;t understand this. If your game breaks on proton most likely the company just doesn&#x27;t consider it a platform to test, which is perfectly valid when they never said they supported it int he first place. Yet consumers go to the developers to complain? That makes no sense. reply lolinder 19 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that the more people buy Steam Decks, the less understanding the average Linux gamer will be of bugs.For every hardcore Linux gamer who would leave a negative review on a game because it&#x27;s not available on their platform, there will be several regular gamers who would leave a negative review because it doesn&#x27;t work well on the Steam Deck. Enabling Linux support without actually working at supporting it for real is a risk that game studios rightly avoid.Steam could probably help with this by giving you a way to bypass the publisher&#x27;s recommendation with lots of warnings (and maybe disabling negative reviews if you do), but that that doesn&#x27;t exist is on Steam, not the publisher. reply mrguyorama 15 hours agorootparent>the less understanding the average Linux gamer will be of bugs.Linux gamers have NEVER been tolerant of bugs. They are the exact people who make bug reports to niche indie developers on an ultra specific, custom configured system that some small part of the game doesn&#x27;t work, and get extremely entitled and pissed when the dev says \"I literally can&#x27;t afford to take the time to fix that, even if I knew what the hell in your system is borked\". reply GrinningFool 18 hours agorootparentprev> If you intentionally restrict its use on whatever platform i see fit then you are getting a negative review.The flip side of this coin is that when they don&#x27;t restrict it, it&#x27;s viewed as supported, and they get bad reviews when it doesn&#x27;t work perfectly on those platforms they don&#x27;t test on. reply bialpio 18 hours agorootparentprevDo you agree with this statement? \"If you paid for a product with a known platform restriction, don&#x27;t expect it to Just Work, & don&#x27;t leave a negative review if it doesn&#x27;t.\"I&#x27;m asking because IMO you initially claimed something more broad than your second comment indicates. reply sickofparadox 20 hours agorootparentprevLeaving a negative review of the product because it doesn&#x27;t work where you want it to work is absolutely not \"toxic fanboy\" behavior, its called being an advocate for your own interests.

To paraphrase George Carlin - the average reviewer is dumb and half of the ones Metacritic is aggregating are even dumber than that.

While I hate setting up Windows while I feel they are the owner of my physical device (e.g. cannot start the device if I don&#x27;t know how to proceed with the hidden option of not having a Microsoft account), this is a practice that every vendor is having nowadays with some little differences. It is time to add real pressure to these vendors.The pressure should take into account the power in the hands of these vendors: it is not the same if Google is using dark patterns than if they are used by a small site. Both are wrong but big tech has a completely different advantage. reply gabereiser 20 hours agoparentYeah. If Microsoft owns my account, they own the OS, they essentially own my PC. At which point do they become culpable to litigation on behalf of their users? If I’m a hacker, my defense would be this - Microsoft sent me a suggestion pop up that I clicked on, got infected with a virus, anything past that is Microsoft’s inability to protect my PC, my person, and others from malicious errant code. reply ta988 19 hours agoprevNow wait for the same PM to go work on vscode and github.\"We see .idea files in your repository, do you know that VSCode can make your hair grow again\"\"You are running Linux, but have you tried Linux in Windows with WSL2, free 30 days license by clicking here\" reply codalan 15 hours agoparentA big reason for me to start learning Emacs again is due to the inevitable rot of VS Code. I&#x27;m even playing around with Neovim a bit.VS Code is like milk, but with an unknown expiration date. At some point, it will be spoiled by MSFT injecting their marketing garbage into the experience. This will take priority over improving performance and fixing bugs. And they&#x27;ve already added spyware into the software by default.I&#x27;ve realized I would have been better off just sticking to Emacs&#x2F;Vim entirely, where I can rely on my tools for decades to come. They&#x27;re not constantly changing the UI&#x2F;UX, because the maintainers of those products are actually doing useful work, rather than busy work. reply myaccountonhn 14 hours agorootparentSame reason I switched, eMacs 29.1 does have an initial hurdle I needed to get through but now it’s very productive and it feels good to ditch vscode. reply dawnerd 19 hours agoprevMicrosoft confuses me. They’ve been building up all this goodwill with frankly outstanding software and services. Then… they go and ruin it all with windows. What the heck is going on over there? Whoever leads that division probably needs to be replaced.I’ve heard installing windows with language set to English Europe or world makes the experience a lot better. Is that true? reply pxc 10 hours agoparentThe answer is not complicated, and it has two parts:1. Microsoft isn&#x27;t a person and doesn&#x27;t have values.2. Businesses behave their worst when they are dominant players in a space, and their best when they are weak or marginal in a space.Microsoft has been responding to their relative weakness when it comes to certain kinds of developer tooling with relatively user-friendly &#x27;open core&#x27; freeware. They have nothing forcing them to &#x27;play nice&#x27; when it comes to their desktop operating system. So they won&#x27;t! And they haven&#x27;t, for a very long time. Windows has a host of other defects (stability, UI inconsistency, etc.), but aside from those its enshittification (infestation with adware, push towards online accounts via dark patterns, continual piling on of more telemetry, etc.) has been going on longer than the &#x27;new Microsoft&#x27;. It&#x27;s not a turning away from some newer, nicer Microsoft in any way— it&#x27;s been continuous and simultaneous with that new Microsoft the whole time. reply teddyh 18 hours agoparentprev> Microsoft confuses me. They’ve been building up all this goodwill with frankly outstanding software and services.

Most employees have little to no power to change anything. Protest is a kind of insubordination that would likely do no good and lead to personal hardship and little else.The only people with power in a company are the owners and their designated employee-agents (executive managers). Even in a heavily unionized company, employee power doesn&#x27;t extend much beyond influencing pay and working conditions. reply anonymousab 20 hours agoparentprev> protest at the UI&#x2F;UX&#x2F;managersRemember, so many of them don&#x27;t even use Windows itself.

Constant popups, Edge is garbage, I won&#x27;t have any complaints that haven&#x27;t been enumerated by people more articulate than I am. But it&#x27;s shocking that in an OS you pay for, it seems like an ad-riddled iOS app put together by second-rate UX designers.Even though 99% of the developers at Microsoft don&#x27;t have anything to do with Windows, it&#x27;s so bad I would never apply for a job there strictly based on the association.

Add in the growing UI inconsistencies, options I turn off re-appearing after every &#x27;feature update&#x27; and its just not worth it.Also, not sure if I&#x27;m running on the beta channel right now, but damn is the thing unstable as anything, opening task manager takes FOREVER, explorer is incredibly slow and crashes frequently. reply askonomm 19 hours agoparentYeah, totally agree - but I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different distros, and the UI inconsistencies are there as well, the fractional scaling support (or lack thereof) is much worse than on Windows, Gnome feels like it&#x27;s made with CSS and JavaScript or something, and doesn&#x27;t feel very \"fluent\" whereas KDE is clearly not touched by any professional designers. Then the apps look absolutely horrid (e.g Electron apps in Gnome), and if you use fractional scaling, everything is blurry.I&#x27;m afraid the grass isn&#x27;t greener on the other side. Yeah, you get UNIX niceties, but as far as a daily-driver desktop, I could tolerate Linux even less than Windows. Seems like I should just go back to overpaying and to Apple. reply 85 more comments... Guidelin",

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Microsoft Windows Blogs Windows Experience Devices Windows Developer Microsoft Edge Windows Insider Microsoft 365 All Microsoft Search Announcing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 23531 (Dev Channel) Written By Amanda Langowski Brandon LeBlanc published August 25, 2023 Hello Windows Insiders, today we are releasing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 23531 to the Dev Channel. Changes and Improvements [General] [REMINDER] Insider Preview Build Expiration: The expiration date for Insider Preview builds flighted to the Dev Channel has been updated to 9/15/2024 starting with Build 23526. Please make sure you are updated to the latest build in the Dev Channel. In the European Economic Area (EEA), Windows system components use the default browser to open links. [Search on the Taskbar] We’re re-introducing the search experience for invoking the search flyout when you hover over the search box gleam. This behavior can be adjusted by right-clicking on the taskbar, choosing “Taskbar settings” and adjusting your preferred search box experience. Fixes [General] Fixed an issue which was causing explorer.exe to not work in safe mode. [File Explorer] Fixed an issue which could cause explorer.exe to crash when closing File Explorer. Fixed an issue which was causing File Explorer to crash when navigating to Gallery if you had a large number of images. Fixed an issue where “Automatically type into the Search Box” wasn’t working when File Explorer was open to Home. Fixed an issue where if you tried to copy and paste, a file out of a compressed folder and into a OneDrive folder might fail with an error code. [HDR Backgrounds] Fixed an issue which could cause HDR wallpapers to appear washed out when HDR was enabled. [Task Manager] Fixed an issue where it wasn’t possible to move the Task Manager window with touch or pen. Fixed an issue where Task Manager was crashing when using the reset to default button in Settings. Fixed an issue which was causing sporadic crashes when using Task Manager, including when ending tasks. Fixed an issue where if you did a search and then cleared it, the view would still be filtered even though there was no search anymore. Fixed an issue where the search icon would become overlapped with the Task Manager text in the title bar. Did some work to help improve the performance when switching between different pages in Task Manager. Updated the summary view for the Performance page (that you see when double clicking the graphs in the navigation pane) to make the window smaller. NOTE: Some fixes noted here in Insider Preview builds from the Dev Channel may make their way into the servicing updates for the released version of Windows 11. Known issues [Start menu] Some apps under All apps on the Start menu, such as PWA apps installed via Microsoft Edge, may incorrectly be labeled as a system component. [Search on the Taskbar] Sometimes the tooltip when mousing over the search box does not match the current search highlight. [Input] [ADDED 8/28] Unicode Emoji 15 support which began rolling out with Build 23475 and the updated color font format with COLRv1 support that began rolling out with Build 23506 no longer appear after updating to Build 23531 due to a bug. This issue will be fixed in a future flight soon. [Windows Copilot] You can use Alt + Tab to switch out of Windows Copilot, but not back into it. Windows + C will move focus back to Windows Copilot When first launching or after refreshing Copilot while using voice access you’ll need to use “Show grid” commands to click in the “Ask me anything” box for the first time. For developers You can download the latest Windows Insider SDK at aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk. SDK NuGet packages are now also flighting at NuGet GalleryWindowsSDK which include: .NET TFM packages for use in .NET apps as described at aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk C++ packages for Win32 headers and libs per architecture BuildTools package when you just need tools like MakeAppx.exe, MakePri.exe, and SignTool.exe These NuGet packages provide more granular access to the SDK and better integration in CI/CD pipelines. SDK flights are now published for both the Canary and Dev Channels, so be sure to choose the right version for your Insider Channel. Remember to use adaptive code when targeting new APIs to make sure your app runs on all customer machines, particularly when building against the Dev Channel SDK. Feature detection is recommended over OS version checks, as OS version checks are unreliable and will not work as expected in all cases. About the Dev Channel REMINDER: The Dev Channel has been rebooted. Windows Insiders who were in the Dev Channel on 25000 series builds have been moved to the new Canary Channel. Going forward, the Dev Channel will receive 23000 series builds. Insiders who were moved to the Canary Channel and want to move back to the Dev Channel can follow these instructions to do a clean installation of Windows 11 and then re-join the Dev Channel to receive 23000 series builds. The Dev Channel receives builds that represent long lead work from our engineers with features and experiences that may never get released as we try out different concepts and get feedback. It is important to remember that the builds we release to the Dev Channel should not be seen as matched to any specific release of Windows and the features included may change over time, be removed, or replaced in Insider builds or may never be released beyond Windows Insiders to general customers. For more information, please read this blog post about how we plan to use the Dev Channel to incubate new ideas, work on long lead items, and control the states of individual features. In some cases, features and experiences may go out to the Canary Channel first before going out to the Dev Channel however the Dev Channel will provide better platform stability. As we get closer to shipping, some features and experiences will also make their way to the Beta Channel when they are ready. The desktop watermark you see at the lower right corner of your desktop is normal for these pre-release builds.

The user has actively selected a browser as the one they want to use by default, but windows only uses it in the EEA because they were forced to.As it will be used by EEA system components, there&#x27;s presumably no technical&#x2F;compatibility issues that would stop the rest of the world using it to. reply pjerem 20 hours agoparent> there&#x27;s presumably no technical&#x2F;compatibility issues that would stop the rest of the world using it to.There never were an technical issue in defining the default browser. It&#x27;s something that worked on any OS since nearly 30 years, including Windows.It&#x27;s 100% disrespect. reply xg15 19 hours agorootparentNot to mention that MS already went out of their way and spent considerable technical effort to not have the system apps respect the default browser setting - such as introducing a separate URL scheme for \"edge-only\" links, then later patching the scheme registry so that no other app could register itself as a handler for that scheme.It was never a technical issue, on the contrary. reply beembeem 19 hours agorootparentCorrect, merely a money issue. Incentives are in the wrong place here. reply tempodox 18 hours agorootparentprevComplete disrespect for the end luser is nothing new with Microsoft. reply coffeeling 17 hours agorootparentI feel like there are two Microsofts. There are parts that make some honestly good software. And then there are parts touched by Bing and MSN, and they&#x27;re some of the most hideous, dark patterny piles of user hostile garbage. Win11 search, widgets. Edge. Now Skype. They just ruin things that might otherwise even be great. Edge has a bunch of good ideas going on the UI but it hates user choice so much it just feels bad to use. reply ptdorf 13 hours agorootparent> I feel like there are two MicrosoftsSame with most companies. The business side tends to steer, resist and fight the creative side. The irony is that in the long run, these two are aligned.Sad that higher management feels the need to use short-term mechanisms for profit at the expense of reputation and what&#x27;s best for their users in the long run. reply dark-star 18 hours agorootparentprevNot completely correct. In the past there were technical issues opening \"system service sites\" with any other browser, because ActiveX controls only worked in Internet Explorer reply _fat_santa 19 hours agoparentprevI have to ask a really basic question: Why does Microsoft have such a vested interest in users using Edge over competitors?I get the argument: \"it&#x27;s their browser, of course they want people to use it\" but for me that answer isn&#x27;t satisfactory. What is the financial motive to go through all the trouble of pushing Edge? The only reason I can think of is \"your data\" but even then, what sort of data might MS want to extract from your browser that they can&#x27;t get from the underlying OS? reply QuantumGood 18 hours agorootparentNot necessarily an answer, but an overview of the topics in the domain space of your question might include:- DATA COLLECTION: Allows Microsoft to collect user data for analytics, targeted advertising, and product improvement.- REVENUE GENERATION: Advertisements and search engine partnerships generate revenue for Microsoft.- ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION: Encourages use of other Microsoft products, enhancing user experience.- VENDOR LOCK-IN: User familiarity discourages switching to competitors, ensuring long-term revenue.- COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: Maintaining a popular browser aids in negotiation with third-party service providers.- SOFTWARE CONTROL: Allows Microsoft to guide software standards, impacting web development.- USER EXPERIENCE: Direct control over browser enhances customer support and troubleshooting. reply tornato7 13 hours agorootparentThanks, ChatGPT reply QuantumGood 9 hours agorootparentYeah, I&#x27;ve reorganized and edited a bit some ChatGPT answers—it&#x27;s quick at sketching out the big picture, and it&#x27;s easy to fact- or logic-check if needed. Also helps me catch stuff I might miss if I&#x27;m in a hurry. reply burnte 18 hours agorootparentprev> I have to ask a really basic question: Why does Microsoft have such a vested interest in users using Edge over competitors?FOMO and Paranoia. Anything that looks like a market they might miss out on they get scared, freak out, create a shit product and jump in the market with HUGE marketing&#x2F;info campaigns to convince everyone theirs is the best product, and then it turns out it&#x27;s not really a profitable market at all. But at least they weren&#x27;t usurped. reply WirelessGigabit 19 hours agorootparentprevHave you used Microsoft Edge recently? It is a dumping ground for all things that Microsoft wants to try in a way that is easier to do than sending A&#x2F;B testing out via Windows Update.* Collections* Shopping* Browser Essentials* Website scanning* Outlook integration* Games integration* ... reply coffeeling 17 hours agorootparentThey have a OneNote feed sidebar now, too. Actually great for quick notes during browsing. Except that it&#x27;s part of Edge, which is a privacy disaster full of dark patterns. reply coffeeling 17 hours agorootparentprevAdvertising is really lucrative. MS wants to get a bigger share of the pie, and that&#x27;s done by driving people to use Bing. Also, if Bing Chat gets people used to using AI chatbots for search, that dramatically increases the cost of delivering search. Search results are not a huge chunk of Microsoft&#x27;s revenue, but they are Google&#x27;s main source of income. Search standardizing on LLM chatbots would take a huge chunk out of Google&#x27;s margins. reply GrinningFool 18 hours agorootparentprevA generous interpretation is that they don&#x27;t want to worry about the resources used by internal OS components being compatible across infinite variety of browser vendors, versions, add-ons (and those versions), etc. reply arkx 19 hours agorootparentprevYour web browsing habits reveal a lot more about you than your desktop habits. reply pbmonster 18 hours agorootparentReally hard to hide your web browsing habits from the OS itself.

They wouldn&#x27;t actually engage in honest debate. reply whatwhaaaaat 19 hours agorootparentprevI think mostly people condemn the eu for its attempt at censorship.The eu would actually have to have a big tech company consumers actually interface with in order to fine them -besides just hardware. reply cyanydeez 19 hours agorootparentThey have a suspicious lack of coup attempts in the last decade. reply ChadNauseam 19 hours agorootparentIs the idea that it would have been really good if the person who organized the insurrection also had the ability to censor people who disagreed with him? reply cyanydeez 11 hours agorootparentAre you paying attention to their current argument about why it was legal to conspire to overthrow the government? reply Spivak 19 hours agorootparentprevI think the stance is that while what the EU does is good for the consumer it&#x27;s annoying as hell for American tech companies to be assessed billion dollar fines all the time. If the punishment was \"comply in 180 days or we&#x27;ll suspend your business charter\" I think you&#x27;d see a lot more support. reply seszett 18 hours agorootparent> If the punishment was \"comply in 180 days or we&#x27;ll suspend your business charter\"The punishment is generally \"comply in 180 days [actually it&#x27;s usually measured in years] or we&#x27;ll fine you\". And they often don&#x27;t comply, and then get fined and sometimes end up complying.Why would your proposal be better? reply tempodox 18 hours agorootparentBecause the fines are just priced in as cost of doing business. They don&#x27;t actually change anything. reply seszett 17 hours agorootparentBut the very article we are discussing shows that it does change things, though? reply NeoTar 19 hours agorootparentprevIf they obeyed the rules to begin with they wouldn&#x27;t be fined. It&#x27;s literally a calculated risk by the big tech companies that the cost of compliance will be less than the profits during the time of non-compliance. reply danuker 18 hours agorootparentSadly it pays off. The biggest ones are the worst. Windows has been rewriting boot loaders and bullying smaller companies with SmartScreen Application Reputation. Android has forced everyone through FCM (or suffer degraded experience). Apple adds software glitches if you replace iPhone parts.Where are the regulators? Asleep, underfunded, or being paid off to close their eyes. And then, these companies get to write the laws through lobbying because of their scale. reply matkoniecz 19 hours agorootparentprevNot sure why the proposed alternative is better to anyone at all. reply sebazzz 18 hours agorootparentprevIt is just a culture difference basically. reply xg15 20 hours agoparentprevI hope someone manages to write a crack or something that enables the same behaviour in non-EEA locales, if only to see what mental gymnastics MS will engage in to explain why that would be bad for users. reply martin_a 14 hours agorootparentHow are they going to implement it anyway?

On my iPhone, I&#x27;ve: -changed the &#x27;default browser&#x27; -&#x27;uninstalled&#x27; SafariYet, whenever I want to search for a highlighted word, it opens Safari. This is such an absurd situation where I am browsing a site and want to do a search for something I just read and, instead of just opening a new tab or replacing the active tab with a web search, it opens a different browser app I do not want to use.This is just not the way any reasonable user would expect a system app to behave once all browser selection settings are configured to use a different browser. reply _silicon 16 hours agorootparentAlso I would argue that forcing everything to wrap WebKit is Apple’s own disrespect for user preference. reply sph 18 hours agorootparentprev> Yet, whenever I want to search for a highlighted word, it opens Safari.I cannot replicate, it opens Firefox for me BUT it completely disregards my search engine choice, so it opens Google even though Kagi is my default search engine. reply ezfe 20 hours agorootparentprevEdit: I was looking at something else, Search on Web does in fact always open in Safari. I&#x27;ve filed a bug report for this just now.---This is not true, and I&#x27;ve got receipts.

It will always search in Safari. Firefox had to add their own \"Search in Firefox\" option, that appears at the end of the popup (and sometimes not at all). reply hombre_fatal 20 hours agorootparentI can verify this. Setting Firefox to my default browser doesn’t change the behavior of “Search on internet” word lookup on long press: it still opens in Safari. reply classified 20 hours agorootparentprevAll \"non-Safari\" browsers are still just different skins on WebKit anyway. reply Angostura 20 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t duplicate this.

I think I would not hate the Edge experience quite so much if it did not shove MSN content in my face, display a garish bing search page, and aghressively promote their browser. Also it does not help that I have 25 years of experience avoiding MS browsers for various other reasons. I’m not saying it’s great that Apple does this, but I do think Microsoft could make fewer technically minded people (and legislators) complain about it if they were less aggressive with their tactics. reply xg15 20 hours agorootparentSo you&#x27;re saying, MS&#x27; tactics of forcing Edge would actually be perfectly fine if just the browser was nicer? reply flatline 20 hours agorootparentOnly in part - and it would certainly not be “just fine”. Edge is pretty nice nowadays. It’s the tactics to promote it as the default - now and in the past - that have drawn so much scrutiny. And IE did used to be objectively inferior to the competition.I’m saying the people at MS promoting this in this particular way are, well, dumb. reply evilduck 18 hours agorootparentAs a developer targeting Edge is fine, there&#x27;s not really any significant difference between building a page that supports it versus any other Chrome derivatives.But as a user wow is it the most trashy and abusive program I routinely encounter. Start it for the first time and you&#x27;re confronted with tabloid news and advertising. Sponsored links are mixed into your frequently visited sites by default. It injects itself into your online shopping and sends all your images and browser behavior to their servers for various weak justifications. You can turn it into a passable experience by scrolling through and configuring something in nearly every single settings tab, but then they just ignore you and inject new advertising sidebars or icons in a random update. Keeping it restricted to \"just a browser\" requires constant vigilance. It&#x27;s clearly first and foremost just an advertising revenue funnel for Microsoft, which is completely pathetic of them. At least IE was mostly just a browser even if it did that pretty badly most years. replyjemmyw 21 hours agorootparentprevThey respect it on Mac and don&#x27;t let you have a non WebKit browser on iOS reply dijit 20 hours agorootparentThe hard and fast rule is: you&#x27;re not permitted to have a source code interpreter.That&#x27;s the \"rules of engagement\", same way you can&#x27;t run Flash or Linux binaries; the same way you can&#x27;t touch windows kernel space without a code-signing certificate from a eye-gouging authority.Exceptions to apples rule are rarely given, even for educational purposes; such as pythonista.When taken though that lens; if we hadn&#x27;t turned everything into a fucking web-app: alternative interpreters of HTML&#x2F;CSS could exist.Unrelated, but: Ironically the original vision for the iPhone was web-apps not native ones (as there was only an app store created after community backlash over Apple pushing people to the web). reply teddyh 20 hours agorootparent> the original vision for the iPhone was web-apps not native onesAs I heard, that was just the cover story to hide the fact that the original iPhone was too slow to properly run Flash (or native apps). reply dijit 20 hours agorootparenttoo slow for native apps.Read that again to yourself, slowly. reply xnickb 20 hours agorootparentA concept of thin clients is of course completely unthinkable in this context. reply dijit 20 hours agorootparentThin clients with 2007-era javascript interpreters as the only code execution framework (vs local MACH-O binaries) does seem to be a bit of a weird choice if \"slow\" was the problem and you intended to have thin clients. reply kergonath 19 hours agorootparentprevNot really. I mean, iPhones were slower than laptops back then but that’s not saying much as all phones were in the same ballpark at best. The actual reasons are well documented: it was a ressource hog (on all platforms, not only phones; there were still netbooks around), sucked batteries dry (including on both Windows and Mac laptops with much better batteries than phones), and was unstable (being the leading cause of crashes on Macs at the time). Jobs even wrote an open letter about it.It was not practical on Android either, mostly a stunt, and faded quietly into obscurity over the course of a couple of years. reply sanitycheck 18 hours agorootparentEh. Jobs was disingenuous at the best of times, I had Flash Lite running fine on Symbian a year or so before the iPhone hit the market.I&#x27;m not saying it was great, but performance&#x2F;efficiency was massively better than similar code in JS at the time.

You can&#x27;t ignore Apple&#x27;s arbitrary shite while complaining about the prevalence of other arbitrary decisions, it&#x27;s a go-nowhere fallacy. There is no point; you are just promoting something that you think can help you, and then refusing to rationalize it in the greater context beyond browsers.There&#x27;s no reason to paint this as an \"enemy of my enemy\" situation, either.

Oh wait... replysmoldesu 20 hours agorootparentprev> if we hadn&#x27;t turned everything into a fucking web-appIt&#x27;s rich to hear this used as a defense of any corporation. Everything is a web app now because nobody got their act together to ship a true \"write once, ship anywhere\" platform. Microsoft smugly profited off this in the short term with Windows, and Apple used it as an excuse to double-down on their proprietary SDKs. It&#x27;s obvious why everything is a webapp; what&#x27;s the realistic alternative? Developing native apps for every platform on one device isn&#x27;t even feasible nowadays. Then you&#x27;d need the developer subscriptions, a cross-platform app architecture and the willingness to write n number of UI mockups, where n is the number of target platforms you intend to hit.

You don&#x27;t get the sit around though and reap the benefits of the system they built (and developers helped build) while simultaneously trying to tear it down.They set the rules, you all agreed to play by them; so why are we complaining?If you actually care you would make programs on one of the many open standards platforms which in turn would turn them into more attractive platforms as the ecosystem improved.But nobody does, everyone just wants the money now. reply smoldesu 18 hours agorootparentLargely, I don&#x27;t disagree with you. Apple&#x27;s stance is entirely business-oriented. My original point isn&#x27;t taking a stand here either; this is just why native apps suck and why people disregard them to make Electron apps. We both seem to agree that business is the core concern.Apple is at least complicit in the status-quo as a vendor of native app SDKs, and it&#x27;s something they could probably fix with the right initiative. At the business layer, they have no motivation to fix this issue. On an individual level, it&#x27;s a black hole of annoyance, confusion and hand-wavey abstraction as to why certain things are off-limits or why certain apps aren&#x27;t on iPhone. Treating your userbase as a hostage situation is an obvious ploy, and one I can&#x27;t encourage even to fix another problem. If we rely on the altruism of businesses to fix our market problems, then we are subject to their whims when they want to change things for themselves.If we can both agree that Apple can and does make decisions that harm their users, then we&#x27;re basically on the same page. I want to scrutinize that harm, and hopefully spread enough awareness to codify a change.

The internet will do whatever it wants, including whittle itself down to the lowest common denominator of &#x27;document rendering&#x27; to hit Apple&#x27;s platforms.

This is because they bothered to mitigate migration within the parameters of the law; since the right to work under EU&#x27;s four freedoms only applies for 6 months. reply tankenmate 20 hours agorootparentprevBut tariff free trade for goods benefits the EU more as the UK service sector is bigger than their goods sector.

It&#x27;s what pulled our economic system back from where it was headed in the \"robber baron\" era of the early 1900&#x27;s, and allowed for the post-war boom. The Fortune 500 has learned to stop at duopolies and triopolies, but private equity is quietly trying to monopolize literally everything else. Lina Kahn and the current FTC have been trying, but they are hampered by the economic forces, corporations, and billionaires that have gotten us to this place already, and I just don&#x27;t see them making much substantive progress. It certainly doesn&#x27;t help that the public is also filled with Microsoft stans who think allowing them to buy Activision somehow \"increases competition,\" when what they really mean is that they just hate that Microsoft is in third place behind Sony and Nintendo, as if this means the gaming division is somehow a failure, and pressure the FTC to back off of preventing more consolidation. reply bjackman 19 hours agoparentprevI think this is the smart way to see it. Tax avoidance is another example. Being angry with Amazon for not paying tax is like being angry at the sea for sinking your ship. The absolute best case scenario is that boycotting Amazon leads to Amazon paying marginaly more taxes, and every other company and billionaire on earth continues to avoid it.Instead, it makes more sense to direct your energy towards the government that&#x27;s letting them get away with it.Same with monopolies; it&#x27;s absolutely fundamental to their nature that we don&#x27;t have any leverage over them as consumers. We can either cry impotently about Google and MS being bad guys or we can actually demand our governments do something about it. It&#x27;s bizarre how often people choose the former! reply npteljes 20 hours agoparentprevThis hits the nail on the head. The issue is that the system is shitty - the entities within the system practically have to act shitty, otherwise the other one that does goes ahead and takes the profit.

Especially in the past, it seemed like a cost factor to keep up a modern browser (just ask Mozilla) if people might as well install anything else and still buy your OS and use your services. That may have just been going with the flow, not wanting to miss the boat.My best guess for nowadays is the same as why Google hijacked a login to any google service (from gmail to youtube) as a log in to the Chrome browser, after which all the data on any website is up for grabs and they can facilitate privacy extensions all they want without compromising their own market position. Does Microsoft (plan to) run an ad business? Is it built-in Cortana integration which can answer with ads included or ranking own services higher? Is it just to be able to shove any new future service into more people&#x27;s faces? To steer web standards, like if you have >70% market share on Windows desktops can you just build in a new ActiveX for WebOffice (as an example) and you&#x27;d force others to follow?Or maybe a combination of all of the above.

Topics Countries Instruments & mechanisms Latest About us Get Involved Get Involved Latest Media Center PRESS RELEASES OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS Hundreds of thousands trafficked to work as online scammers in SE Asia, says UN report 29 August 2023 Share RELATED PRESS RELEASES Iran must immediately release critically ill human rights defender Arash Sadeghi: UN experts PRESS RELEASES UN anti-torture body to step up surprise visits to detention centres PRESS RELEASES Committee against Torture examines report of Bolivia GENEVA (29 August 2023) – Hundreds of thousands of people are being forcibly engaged by organised criminal gangs into online criminality in Southeast Asia - from romance-investment scams and crypto fraud to illegal gambling - a report issued today by the UN Human Rights Office shows. Victims face a range of serious violations and abuses, including threats to their safety and security; and many have been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced labour, and other human rights abuses, the report says. “People who are coerced into working in these scamming operations endure inhumane treatment while being forced to carry out crimes. They are victims. They are not criminals,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk. “In continuing to call for justice for those who have been defrauded through online criminality, we must not forget that this complex phenomenon has two sets of victims.” The enormity of online scam trafficking in Southeast Asia is difficult to estimate, the reports says, because of the clandestine nature and gaps in the official response. Credible sources indicate that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams, with estimates in Cambodia similarly at around 100,000. Other States in the region, including Lao PDR, the Philippines and Thailand, have also been identified as main countries of destination or transit where at least tens of thousands of people have been involved. The scam centres generate revenue amounting to billions of US dollars each year. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated response measures had a drastic impact on illicit activities across the region. Public health measures closed casinos in many countries and in response, casino operators moved operations to less regulated spaces including conflict-affected border areas and Special Economic Zones, as well as to the increasingly lucrative online space, the report says. Faced with new operational realities, criminal actors increasingly targeted migrants in vulnerable situations – who were stranded in these countries and out of work due to border and business closures – for recruitment into criminal operations, under the pretence of offering them real jobs. As COVID-related shutdowns saw millions of people restricted to their homes, spending more time online, there were more ready targets for online fraud schemes and more people susceptible to fraudulent recruitment. Most people trafficked into the online scam operations are men, although women and adolescents are also among the victims, the report says. Most are not citizens of the countries in which the trafficking occurs. Many of the victims are well-educated, sometimes coming from professional jobs or with graduate or even post-graduate degrees, computer-literate and multi-lingual. Victims come from across the ASEAN region (from Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), as well as mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, South Asia, and even further afield from Africa and Latin America. While some countries in Southeast Asia have put in place legal and policy frameworks relevant to counter trafficking, in some cases they fall short of international standards. In many cases their implementation has failed to respond adequately to the context and sophistication of these online scams, the report says. Victims of trafficking and other human rights abuse are erroneously identified as criminals or as immigration offenders and, rather than being protected and given access to the rehabilitation and remedy they need, they are subjected to criminal prosecution or immigration penalties, it says. “All affected States need to summon the political will to strengthen human rights and improve governance and the rule of law, including through serious and sustained efforts to tackle corruption. This must be as much a part of the response to these scams as a robust criminal justice response,” said Türk. “Only such a holistic approach can break the cycle of impunity and ensure protection and justice for the people who have been so horrifically abused.” To read the report, click here ENDS For more information and media requests, please contact: In Geneva Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org or Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org or Jeremy Laurence + +41 22 917 9383 / jeremy.laurence@un.org or Marta Hurtado - + 41 22 917 9466 / marta.hurtadogomez@un.org In Nairobi Seif Magango - +254 788 343 897 / seif.magango@un.org Tag and share Twitter @UNHumanRights Facebook unitednationshumanrights Instagram @unitednationshumanrights Tags Arbitrary detention Sexual violence Torture and inhuman treatment Forced or bonded labour VIEW THIS PAGE IN: Español Our Work The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is the leading United Nations entity in the field of human rights, with a unique mandate to promote and protect all human rights for all people. © OHCHR 1996-2023 Latest Feature Stories Media Center Meetings & Events Resources Databases Library Publications Connect Contact Us Follow us Work With Us Global Social Channels Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Donate Contact Copyrights Privacy Policy Terms of use",

They are falsely promised for \"entrepreneurial opportunities,\" promptly got locked up and financially deprived to do scamming, prostitution, etc. One guy escaped, bystanders took him to the police and the police was part of the traffiking ring and sold him back. He finally paid off somebody with promise of ransom payment from his relatives, and upon entering Chinese border, he was fined by Chinese border control for violations. These local traffik orgs are armed with AKs and well connected politically. What a crazy, crazy world. reply adhesive_wombat 20 hours agoparent> They are falsely promised for \"entrepreneurial opportunities\"From what I heard, which I cannot verify, it&#x27;s more sinister then that. People take completely normal-sounding jobs in normal-looking and functioning offices. After several months of being paid normally for normal work, they&#x27;re invited to a team-building event in SE Asia. There, they lose their passports, are interned in huge camps and are press-ganged into being scammers, and tortured or killed if they refuse.This isn&#x27;t your usual \"can&#x27;t cheat an honest man\" tale where you sucker in greedy rubes with a promised free lunch. reply brucethemoose2 20 hours agorootparentThe entire chain that enables this is disturbing, but fascinating.For instance, the scammers would need some kind of credibility in the job market before the team-building exercise. Do they just start up new legtimate businesses with new people just for this purpose?And the SE Asia slave camps need a huge amount of compliance from the locals.And what happens when none of the employees return from the original country? reply costco 18 hours agorootparent> And the SE Asia slave camps need a huge amount of compliance from the locals.Myanmar is home to like 20 different civil wars. Some of these conflicts ended in ceasefires. The areas that got good ceasefire deals (Wa, Mongla, some \"border guard forces\" who the military lets do whatever they want in return for allegiance) generally have a high degree autonomy from the Burmese government. So these areas are essentially run by warlords who are accountable to no one because the Burmese government cannot enter these areas. China backs some rebel groups and occasionally puts pressure on them to stop various crimes but they quickly adapt (when China cut internet to Mongla they just started using satellite). These areas are home to the largest meth labs in the world, illegal logging, illegal mining, etc. So they are perfect for criminals as they just have to pay \"taxes\" to whoever is in power. I read a good book on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;62141000-stalemateSome scams are in Cambodia and Laos. The survival of these mostly has to do with corrupt law enforcement. All of the scam victims are either Chinese or in the West so they have even less reason to care.> For instance, the scammers would need some kind of credibility in the job market before the team-building exercise. Do they just start up new legtimate businesses with new people just for this purpose?I think it goes something like this: You make $200 a month as a dishwasher in Cambodia. A friend of friend messages you and tells you that you can make $800 a month. Because you are hopeful and want to improve your life you do not thoroughly vet them.> And what happens when none of the employees return from the original country?If they are from the region there&#x27;s usually no record because they are picked up by an \"agent\" and go through a series of illegal border crossings.There are people who actually knowingly apply for these jobs too: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vodenglish.news&#x2F;underground-group-chat-teems-with-hu... reply harpiaharpyja 20 hours agorootparentprevThis seems like an important point. Either this element is being exaggerated, or some aspect of their society itself is enabling this at a fairly deep level. reply kirso 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is not exactly secret. Many of these companies are perfectly \"legit\" legal entities being covered as a \"call center\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r1Q_P__aqAk reply nradov 19 hours agorootparentprevPeople who need a job apply to new start-up companies all the time. The scammers can just start a new company every few months. All they need a rented office. reply ConfusedDog 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I saw that, too. If they refuse, they claimed that they are going to be \"harvested\" of cornea, plasma, kidney, etc. What I don&#x27;t understand is that they said they were threatened to be taken to international water for organ harvesting procedures, but was that even necessary? Those camps are pretty criminal already, seems to be an unnecessary extra step. reply adhesive_wombat 20 hours agorootparentThat sounds very much like the plot of Animal World!To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t all add up for me as simply described: offices where multiple people suddenly vanish seem unlikely to escape notice back home, unless they&#x27;re excellent at picking people without any support network to report them missing. But maybe there&#x27;s more to it than the simple description. And there is an enormous supply of migrant workers in cities without friends or families to come looking until it&#x27;s to late, so I suppose it could happen. Or maybe it&#x27;s garbled in the transmission and the jobs are all actually out of the country, but they don&#x27;t spring the trap instantly when you walk inBut at least it seems not to be simply little scammers tricked by bigger, eviller ones, but rather they really have people who were genuinely looking for at least fairly honest work being ensnared. reply jstarfish 18 hours agorootparentFrom other accounts, people back home are generally too poor to come looking.These people have to smuggle themselves out of their own country, then maintain a presence illegally abroad, then run an amateur investigation. It just doesn&#x27;t work out like that. reply WeylandYutani 14 hours agorootparentI live in a rich European country and every once in a while they find some poor smucks forced to pick asparagus at a farm or have sex with a dozen men a day in a hotel. It gets a little column in a newspaper.It&#x27;s really not that hard to make people drop off the grid in an uncaring world. reply derefr 17 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding — which mostly comes from reading about the \"scam centers\" operating in the Laos \"golden triangle\" autonomous region specifically — is that everything happening there is either \"legal\" or \"unprosecutable\" due to jurisdictional problems. If a Chinese-owned-and-operated company has a bunch of illegal immigrants from Myanmar and Thailand and Cambodia (but no Laotians!) locked up in a \"scam center\" in a Laotian AR... then which police force has both the motivation and the right to come knocking, without that being an international incident and potential incitement to another territorial war in the region that nobody wants?Laotian police have been quoted as saying that they have full authority to come into the autonomous region to investigate a crime, given irrefutable evidence of a crime — but that they can&#x27;t come in without such evidence; and that it&#x27;s very hard for them to get such evidence.I&#x27;m guessing that by \"crime\", here, they probably mean \"a felony\" (or whatever the Laotian equivalent is) — which is likely the blocker for them, and probably the basis for the very thin line that these criminal gangs are treading.I believe that \"an escapee who can show that their organs had been harvested\" would be irrefutable evidence, enough for a police raid; while \"an escapee who told a story about being held captive for years\" would not.(And re: the other part, of some of the things happening there being \"legal\" — a large part of how these companies work is by indentured servitude, in the literal sense: they get people coming there to sign contracts for provision of services and equipment, that create a debt owed by the worker to the service&#x2F;equipment-provider; and then they don&#x27;t let them leave until they work it off. These contracts seem to have a lot of power for the gangs; they don&#x27;t bother to chase escapees who haven&#x27;t signed them, while considering people who have signed them to be \"theirs to keep.\" Presumably, they&#x27;ve tested these contracts with local law-in-practice, and found that they actually work as a shield for what they&#x27;re doing.) reply whimsicalism 17 hours agorootparentprevI am sure that there are terrible human rights abuses as outlined in the parent article, but I think it is also true that the media loves to jump on stories like these and exaggerates things.See for instance CNN reporting that Kim Jong Un had his uncle torn apart by a pack of dogs. Generally once organ harvesting starts coming in to play, one should put on a very skeptical hat, while there is evidence that this has happened among some prisoners in China, I think one should remain skeptical on first-read of such claims. reply b0afc375b5 18 hours agorootparentprev> After several months of being paid normally for normal work, they&#x27;re invited to a team-building event in SE AsiaHoly ####. This reminds me of my previous software developer job when we were supposed to go to South Korea for God knows what[0]. The reason why we had to go there wasn&#x27;t really explained well to me, and I didn&#x27;t care enough to ask because I was just excited to go to another country. In the end our application was denied by the embassy, and I always felt a bit disappointed by that.Perhaps the possibility of my case being sinister is miniscule, but maybe I shouldn&#x27;t feel too disappointed.[0] the owner of the company I worked for was South Korean reply jesterson 37 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s pretty hard simplification for the matter.There is only 2 airports where this sort of things happen. If your teambuilding event scheduled to be in some god forbidden area of Colombia for example, and if this doesn&#x27;t bring any suspicion to you - well... reply saiya-jin 18 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think that South Korea would fall into this category, its pretty well developed and western-style democracy (with some strong nepotic powers at place but ultimately even they are not untouchable).If you would be invited to say Philippines, Indonesia (which covers Bali too), Myanmar, Laos etc. that should raise an eyebrow. reply rolph 17 hours agorootparentjust because someone says you are being taken to a particular place doesnt mean thats where you will end up. reply PeterisP 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not how international travel works until you totally leave civilization; no matter who&#x27;s paying for the trip, you do know where you&#x27;re going, and each individual has a choice at every border crossing; they can&#x27;t simply \"export\" a box filled with people on a plane that&#x27;s going \"somewhere\". reply rolph 14 hours agorootparentThats only if they play by the rules and everyone is honest and unfettered by coercion.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37327558 reply mcpackieh 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but if you&#x27;re a westerner being taken on a trip to South Korea, read your plane ticket to see if that&#x27;s actually were you&#x27;re going.If the deal is more akin to \"get in this van and my guy will take you to where you need to go\", then that&#x27;s another story. reply bonestamp2 13 hours agorootparent> get in this van and my guy will take you to where you need to goThat could have been their pickup from the airport. reply rolph 14 hours agorootparentprevonce your in the air you are effectively detained.a large number of situations, contrived or otherwise, can result in emergency diversions.you may want to be sure a connecting flight is legitimate when travelling in &#x27;suspect&#x27; regions.this would be high profile kidnapping, but a source of non SEA persons, that would be more convincing, and a source of international ransom revenues, espescially if they were also accused of some crime. reply slingnow 17 hours agorootparentprevSo with zero substantiation from the OP (who admitted this), you believe this explanation and you&#x27;ve now connected it to some company trip to South Korea you once didn&#x27;t go on? reply hef19898 18 hours agorootparentprevSounds like an industry ripe for disruption, AI, LLMs and AI voice generators to the rescue! &#x2F;sIn all honesty, if AI is killing those organisations, that might be the only half way decent thing coming of the current AI use cases. reply coconut_crab 16 hours agorootparentprevThe usual story here (Vietnam) is that the victims are often promised a job with high earning prospect in Cambodia, or they are in debt after playing in casinos over there. Since Vietnam economy isn&#x27;t in a good shape, there is no lack of potential victims. They don&#x27;t really get killed either as it will cost the kidnappers, they will just get sold to another scam center. Oh and the victim can buy their freedom back if they scam enough people (my friend lost 10k USD in one such scam), not that there is many people who can do that though. reply soared 19 hours agorootparentprevSource?

Yet there seems to be this strange political push back against anti-trafficking efforts.I’ve seen it for years to the point of pretending it’s not even a problem. The recent political reaction to Sound of Freedom, which was not a political movie, is just the latest example.It’s one of the most worrisome aspects I’ve seen in general “politicize everything” trends. reply xwolfi 17 hours agorootparentPolitics is a fancy name for \"controlling the rules well enough to be able to prospect my little business\". Politicians are not all ideologically positive and benevolent, or even patriotic or nationalist, some are really just trying to find a way to do business better.One of the worst banana republics in that regard are the USA: here in China we&#x27;d never let a frigging casino operator rule the country, we have a small pride still. reply whimsicalism 17 hours agorootparentBo Xilai literally was on the Politburo and laundered massive amounts of casino money from Macau internationally. reply appleflaxen 18 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s the modern day slave trade. reply andrethegiant 20 hours agoparentprevLink to documentary? reply ConfusedDog 20 hours agorootparentI couldn&#x27;t find the exact video I saw on YouTube.

There were not 100,000 working in Cambodia and most were not trafficked.This UN statement is garbage, liars bore me. It&#x27;s why this is progressing to organ harvesting and other rubbish because the UN is bringing it to fantasy.Watch the doco and they mention the amounts they were making, then times that by 100,000 trafficked then all the ones who answered the Facebook ads and it doesn&#x27;t add up.It&#x27;s the Chinese doing this, which the UN page doesn&#x27;t mention.

If I’ve not met someone in a personal or professional setting before, I assume they’re a robot unless proven otherwise.Some pig butchers have also tried to contact my parents, but my parents are careful, and I immediately block any such number.Pretty sad to see that these operations could easily be stopped, but the perpetrators live in extremely corrupt places&#x2F;semi-failed states where they just pay bribes to the local authorities to leave them alone. reply bettercallsalad 20 hours agoparentCan relate. I was in a dating app and there were so many of them pretending “nice looking girl looking for husband” that then tried to befriend you and tried crypto scam. It’s so smooth that even as someone who is relatively well versed in the crypto world and associated scams I couldn’t tell at least in first two or three attempts. Their first few messages leading upto this would be “do you believe in financial freedom as for a happy life?” I would play along just to see what their strategy is and it would almost always end up trying to lure you into yield farming asking to deposit in some random wallet address promising 15% monthly yield.It was so frustrating at some point, my first questions to someone matching me would be are you a crypto or onlyfan scam? Man the online dating world has turned completely shameless. reply soco 18 hours agorootparentJust try Tumblr nowadays, which is not even a dating app. But those scammers don&#x27;t mind, they \"only want to make friends\" and push ahead with one fresh empty profile after another. And I&#x27;m sure it brings them profit, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t see them swarming you by dozens. reply devoutsalsa 7 hours agorootparentprevA quick way to spot one of these is once you establish a nominal connection, ask to meet or video call. The standard scammer response will be something like “I don’t like video calls” or “let’s get to know each other online” first. reply apetresc 20 hours agoparentprevSorry, is \"pig butchering\" a euphemism for something, or am I missing out on some new scamming trend? reply heja2009 20 hours agorootparentThe term was also new to me.

Along the way, they start suggesting cryptocurrency investments on trading platforms that look legit at a glance but are fake underneath. They instruct the target to deposit money into a wallet, like any exchange, but the perpetrators just steal the tokens and show the mark fake figures.It’s a long term thing that takes a ton of work…I have no idea how the scammers even pull it off at scale.This site goes into more detail; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techtarget.com&#x2F;whatis&#x2F;feature&#x2F;Pig-butchering-sca... reply Zenul_Abidin 20 hours agorootparentSomeone&#x27;s obviously making the websites, a few other people are finding the victims, and all the money is funneled to one overlord who pays everyone else a small cut of the stolen money.It is appalling that no social platform is taking this seriously. reply soco 18 hours agorootparentTumblr has created a special reporting type exactly for these, and they do disappear afterwards quickly (tested this). But by the amount of requests I still receive daily from fresh and empty accounts, I guess the work on avoiding them in the first place still has a lot to catch up. A quarantine period for fresh users risks alienating legit ones, IP filtering won&#x27;t bring it too far, no idea what one could do to quench it. reply bloopernova 20 hours agorootparentprev> It is appalling that no social platform is taking this seriously.The big social media corps won&#x27;t eat into their profits by hiring people to find the scammers.It will take a law that says something about keeping a human in the loop, or that your reports should always be validated by a human. reply mschuster91 20 hours agorootparentprev> It’s a long term thing that takes a ton of work…I have no idea how the scammers even pull it off at scale.When cost of living is a few hundred dollars a month at best, looting 10k from a single mark is going to last quite the time. reply jamal-kumar 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s really nasty, I lost contact with an ex girlfriend after her social media got taken over by this shit.

It may not be an effective deterrent of the most heinous crimes. It doesn’t seem to work as rehabilitation. It only works as physical prevention of recidivism in people that lack self-awareness and self-control to prevent it, but unfortunately those are exonerating conditions in our system. It seems to me that prison should be understood and used in the opposite way: not punishment, but a compassionate alternative to remove people from society. Punishment and deterrence are something different from a behaviorist perspective, and there are other things that work better, faster, and cheaper. Physical pain is punishment: pepper spray, bullet ants, microwave cannons, carbon dioxide. Deterrence is mainly the quality of alternatives available, for which there should be a floor established, like an agricultural labor camp at sub-minimum wage. reply devoutsalsa 7 hours agorootparentprevThe problem comes into play when there’s a financial incentive to imprison people. reply _jal 20 hours agorootparentprev> In that sense trafficking victims are absolutely more deserving of those rights than convicted criminals.No. you assume conviction = guilt, and that whatever treatment that comes thereafter is just.For instance, it appears you would endorse treating people like these trafficking victims if they were first convicted by some court you consider valid, since \"that&#x27;s what being a prisoner means\". reply the_other 20 hours agorootparentprevMight is right, huh? reply logicchains 20 hours agorootparentWhat would you consider an acceptable alternative?

If you already have a viable way to dispose of bodies, why let anybody leave?The better reason not to play games with scammers is that you&#x27;re antagonizing someone who does not respect rule of law. Consider what someone overconfident in their ability to commit crimes unchecked might do to you in retribution. reply mcpackieh 17 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s sad that these scammers are victims themselves, but measures that reduce the extent to which these victims can victimize other people are a clear net good for society. You won&#x27;t save a trafficked scammer by hanging up early so he can move on to easier marks, but you can prevent him from using the next hour to make a new victim out of somebody else.Or to put this in other terms; you&#x27;re a Ukrainian machine gunner. In the distance you see Russian soldiers. You know that many of them are from the Russian gulags, unjustly imprisoned in an oppressive autocracy, quite likely for a crime they didn&#x27;t commit, and now forced to invade a foreign country. You pull the trigger and mow those victims down, because if you don&#x27;t those victims will make victims out of your friends, family, and fellow countrymen. reply csomar 20 hours agoprev [–] I don&#x27;t know about Myanmar but I am a little bit skeptical about \"hundreds of thousands\" in the rest (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia). I&#x27;ve traveled the region extensively and am in a remote place in Laos now.I think the UN is using the word \"trafficked\" way too liberally. While I heard stories from fellow travelers and citizens (only in Cambodia, be careful in Phnom Penh and don&#x27;t go to Sinahouk); my guess is that the majority of these are in some kind of situation (like owing money to the boss) or maybe justifying what they are doing (it&#x27;s not a crime if you are forced!).For some reason, I find this \"hundreds of thousands\" quite sinister. It devalues the whole issue as it normalizes it; while there are some people now in real need of help and in real danger. reply cheeze 19 hours agoparent [–] I mean, these aren&#x27;t people locked up on slave ships and hauled to a new world or something, but they are absolutely trafficked in that they are forced to do the work against their will without a way out - literally modern slavery.This comment feels mega weird to me, like you&#x27;re trying to downplay the plight of these hundreds of thousands of modern-day slaves because it doesn&#x27;t meet your definition of trafficking.I&#x27;m certainly going to trust official figures coming from the UN over someone on HN who happens to be traveling in SEA reply Eridrus 18 hours agorootparentMany advocacy groups (particularly those making claims about human trafficking) fudge their numbers to make their cause seem more important, and you can see why, we would probably not be discussing this article without such an eye catching statistic in it.If you try to see how they got this number in their report it is \"credible estimates&#x2F;sources\" that are \"on file at OHCR\". So there&#x27;s no way to independently verify this, you have to just trust them, which doesn&#x27;t breed confidence in their estimates. reply hungryforcodes 17 hours agorootparentAnecdotally I met an NGO worker once in Phenom Phen who was drunk and admitted exactly this -- because he had to justify his 200K Euro job in that city. With that salary you&#x27;re like a king, you&#x27;d probably do alot to keep it. reply hungryforcodes 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] I don&#x27;t see in any country in SEA -- and I live out here -- how you could hide 100K people in concertation camps to do high tech scamming.There is a comment above about someone&#x27;s Laotian wife working hard conditions doing these scams because it pays much better than local work -- this seems much more convincing.Even the issue with the Vietnamese casino workers was only 40 people -- though not to minimize it&#x27;s importance. reply deadbeeves 13 hours agorootparent [–] We&#x27;re talking about hundreds of thousands across several countries, not in a single facility. If you have 50 prisoners per building, you only need 4000 buildings like that to get to 200k. This could be happening anywhere, even in large cities. You don&#x27;t need huge infrastructure per location to do this, though it does take some logistics to keep it up. Running a clandestine prison in the middle of a city is not trivial, but certainly not impossible to keep under wraps. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s profitable, though. reply csomar 8 hours agorootparent [–] For Laos and Cambodia you do. They have small populations and most cities don’t have any large buildings at all. I can understand this happening in remote areas in these countries where there are no locals and no local law enforcement.

FCC says \"no.\" JON BRODKIN - 8/30/2023, 2:28 PM Enlarge Getty Imagesimagedepotpro 162 WITH The Federal Communications Commission yesterday rejected requests to eliminate an upcoming requirement that Internet service providers list all of their monthly fees. Five major trade groups representing US broadband providers petitioned the FCC in January to scrap the requirement before it takes effect. In June, Comcast told the FCC that the listing-every-fee rule \"impose[s] significant administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements.\" Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletter Join Ars Technica and Get Our Best Tech Stories DELIVERED STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX.

You can unsubscribe at any time. The five trade groups kept up the pressure earlier this month in a meeting with FCC officials and in a filing that complained that listing every fee is too hard. The FCC refused to bend, announcing yesterday that the rules will take effect without major changes. \"Every consumer needs transparent information when making decisions about what Internet service offering makes the most sense for their family or household. No one wants to be hit with charges they didn't ask for or they did not expect,\" FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said. Yesterday's order \"largely affirms the rules... while making some revisions and clarifications such as modifying provider record-keeping requirements when directing consumers to a label on an alternative sales channel and confirming that providers may state 'taxes included' when their price already incorporates taxes,\" the FCC said. ISPs don’t want to list all fees Comcast and other ISPs objected to a requirement that ISPs \"list all recurring monthly fees\" including \"all charges that providers impose at their discretion, i.e., charges not mandated by a government.\" They complained that the rule will force them \"to display the pass-through of fees imposed by federal, state, or local government agencies on the consumer broadband label.\" Advertisement As we've previously written, ISPs could simplify billing and comply with the new broadband-labeling rules by including all costs in their advertised rates. That would give potential customers a clearer idea of how much they have to pay each month and save ISPs the trouble of listing every charge that they currently choose to break out separately. Rejecting the broadband industry's request, the FCC order yesterday said: [W]e affirm our requirement that providers display all monthly fees with respect to broadband service on the label to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the cost of their broadband service. We thus decline providers' request that they not disclose those fees or that they instead display an \"up to\" price for certain fees they choose to pass through to consumers. Specifically, \"providers must itemize the fees they add to base monthly prices, including fees related to government programs they choose to 'pass through' to consumers, such as fees related to universal service or regulatory fees,\" the FCC said. The FCC was ordered by Congress to implement broadband-label rules. The FCC is requiring ISPs to display the labels to consumers at the point of sale and include information such as the monthly price, additional fees, introductory rates, data caps, charges for data overages, and performance metrics. The FCC rules aren't in force yet because they are subject to a federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under the US Paperwork Reduction Act.

When the ISP&#x27;s claim it&#x27;s \"too hard\" to do, you know something is wrong. Either the ISP&#x27;s are lying (duh) or the taxes and fees structure is just messed up... or someone is trying to slip in bullshit charges.Our world needs more transparency. It breeds competition... and hopefully bankrupts a few corrupt corporations. reply tptacek 14 hours agoparentThey&#x27;re obviously not lying. NCTA&#x27;s letter made the issue clear: retail stores have items pre-labeled, and, under this new rule, they&#x27;d need to create thousands of variations of those labels. Unlike sales tax, where the business always knows what it&#x27;s going to be charging every customer, pass-through fees vary based on the customer&#x27;s home address.Again: these aren&#x27;t fees Comcast chooses to charge; it&#x27;s money local governments are taxing from their residents, piggybacking on the ISP billing system. reply daft_pink 13 hours agorootparentI just want to point out that while it might be true there are some local fees included that are hyper local and hard to disclose. Where I live Comcast and other providers advertise fake low rates, and then tack on multiple surcharges and cost recovery fees that they refuse to disclose, should be considered false advertising, and make it impossible to compare between the different relevant services, because the fees represent more than 20% of your bill. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentNCTA isn&#x27;t complaining about anything but the pass-through fees. reply babypuncher 11 hours agorootparentThis is a problem they created for themselves. They engaged in sleazy, shitty business practices that made everybody hate them. We pass laws to make these practices harder and they find clever workarounds and loopholes to keep doing it.So now the FCC is passing a regulation that will be impossible for them to weasel out of. Comcast has nobody to blame but themselves. And personally, the more miserable it makes Comcast, the happier it makes me.These companies can&#x27;t spend literal decades operating in bad faith then act surprised when voters and regulators say \"enough is enough\" and stop taking anything they say seriously. reply whatwhaaaaat 13 hours agorootparentprevYes but if you label all the pass-through fees then everything else is a non pass through fee right? reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand your question, sorry. reply whatwhaaaaat 12 hours agorootparentYou have fees. Some are government and some are actually just cost of getting the service - modem rental fee or bring your own modem fee.The pass through government fees get labeled as such (small township build rights fee).The other non government fees that are really just the price of the service are now clear because the government fees are labeled. replynimish 13 hours agorootparentprevFTA:>ISPs can meet the label requirement in alternate sales channels either by providing a hard copy of the label or by \"directing the consumer to the specific web page on which the label appears.\"There&#x27;s already lookups for sales tax. If they can bill the address the fees, they can show the fees to the customer. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentNo: retail businesses don&#x27;t need to \"look up\" their sales tax, because it doesn&#x27;t change per customer. reply shaftway 13 hours agorootparentI think here the parent is saying \"the ISP must be able to determine the fees in order to bill the customer (the lookup), so they should be able to determine the fees before billing the customer\" reply hock_ads_ad_hoc 13 hours agorootparentprevI doubt the utility of mentioning what retail businesses do when we are talking about ISPs. reply abawany 11 hours agorootparentprevfor online stores it does, based on shipping address. reply patmorgan23 10 hours agorootparentprevThey do when they open a new location. reply resist_futility 14 hours agorootparentprevThey already know what the fees are from, they just don&#x27;t want to tell the consumer. How else would they calculate them? reply WWLink 14 hours agorootparentprev\"NCTA&#x27;s letter made the issue clear: retail stores have items pre-labeled, and, under this new rule, they&#x27;d need to create thousands of variations of those labels.\"That&#x27;s a bunch of bullshit though. The cable companies use vastly different pricing all over the place, so there&#x27;s already \"thousands of variations of those labels\" - in fact I&#x27;m pretty sure those labels are produced regionally. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentSo we&#x27;re clear: we&#x27;re talking about labeling requirements that can change multiple times within the span of 10 blocks or so. This isn&#x27;t a regional problem; it&#x27;s about as local as it gets. reply amphitoky 14 hours agorootparentso why not regulate the other end too and force more consistency and transparency in pass-through fees as well? reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentBecause Home Rule prevents those regulations. reply JoeAltmaier 11 hours agorootparentprevAgain, this is spurious. They can create the bill; they can label the charges on the bill. That&#x27;s inarguable. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s NCTA&#x27;s claim, and we should consider their side, but maybe we shouldn&#x27;t take it all at face value? reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentWe can take what they&#x27;re objecting to at face value, because they&#x27;re the ones objecting. So when I say that NCTA is objecting only to pass-through fees, I feel like I&#x27;m on pretty firm ground, because they have not objected to other labeling requirements. reply wolverine876 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not saying we should ignore NCTA&#x27;s public statements, but I&#x27;m sure you know that parties who are sophisticated public communicators will object to the thing they are most likely to win on, and which will gain them the most support, rather than the thing they care about most.It happens all the time in public discourse, in politics and in business.Thinking about it, that of course is fundamental to sophisticated negotiations - not revealing your true objectives. And thinking more, people use that same tactic instinctively all the time in social situations. reply tptacek 5 hours agorootparentThis doesn&#x27;t make sense. They&#x27;ve conceded the rest of the issues, and were asking for a concession exclusively on this issue. You should read NCTA&#x27;s filing. reply vel0city 14 hours agorootparentprevIf they want to simplify their marketing, just roll all those extra fees into their final price. I have that currently with my AT&T internet bill, the amount my card gets charged every month is the same as what it was advertised. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re not allowed to do that. reply usefulcat 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand that statement. I have Google fiber and AFAICT that&#x27;s exactly what they do, and have done for as long as I&#x27;ve been a customer.Before buying, I only ever saw one advertised price for this particular product, and since becoming a customer I only ever see that same price on the statements they send me each month. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that they are being required by the FCC to break these fees out, though someone else on the thread claims otherwise and for all I know is correct. Either way: hiding the fees and raising their rates does the opposite of what people want from this FCC ruling! reply supertimor 8 hours agorootparentThey are only being required to breakdown and include these fees if the ISPs are tacking on these fees in addition to their quoted base price that the customer was expecting to pay.If the ISPs wanted to include these fees in their base price, they can, as long as the customer is paying for the quoted price and not surprised by a bunch of unadvertised additional fees.Consumers cannot make informed decisions about their providers if ISPs are allowed to tack on these costs that are ultimately unknowable to the consumer. If ISPs decide to pass these fees directly onto the consumer, rather than work them into their base price, then the consumer should be able to know what these fees will be upfront. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentThe ISPs aren&#x27;t tacking anything on here. Their objection is exclusively to those fees that governments are requiring them, by contract or statute, to add and pass through to their subscribers. They&#x27;re not just deciding to pass the fees on to their customers: the municipal agreements instruct them to do so explicitly. reply supertimor 4 hours agorootparentIn his complaint to the FCC, Comcast’s VP of regulatory affairs, Jordan Goldstein, wrote that the government should grant their petition “to avoid the unnecessarily onerous burden associated with itemizing non-mandatory passthrough government fees.”The ISPs are pushing back about non-mandatory passthrough government fees though. Unlike mandatory fees, which are required by law, non-mandatory pass-through fees are typically discretionary charges that ISPs choose to levy on their customers to offset expenses related to compliance with regulations or taxation.Is this just not the cost of doing business? Do we pay a liquor license fee when we go to a bar? I think most people would find that absurd because that is just one of the business costs of opening a bar and those fees and taxes the business pays is baked into the price of food and beverages.To most, this just looks like a way for ISPs to advertise their services at low prices while offloading the cost of doing business onto the consumer. Which the FCC is actually fine with. However, they are no longer fine with these providers lack of transparency in offloading these costs to the consumer.Some non-mandatory pass-through fees (which FCC allows to be bundled into the base price if the ISP wants to do it that way):Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee: ISPs may charge this fee to cover the costs associated with complying with various government regulations related to the provision of internet services.Local Franchise Fee: Some local governments impose franchise fees on ISPs for the use of public rights-of-way or utility infrastructure.State and Local Taxes: These could include sales taxes, use taxes, or telecommunications taxes that ISPs may pass on to customers as a way to cover the tax burden imposed on their services.911 Fee: This fee helps fund emergency services like 911 call centers and systems.Internet Infrastructure Surcharge: ISPs might implement this fee to cover the costs of maintaining and upgrading their network infrastructure.Broadcast TV Fee: Though not directly a government fee, some ISPs list a Broadcast TV Fee on bills to cover the retransmission of local broadcast stations, which is influenced by regulatory requirementsUniversal Service Fund Fee: This fee is used to support the Universal Service Fund, which helps provide affordable telecommunications services in underserved or remote areas (such as affordable broadband internet and phone service for low-income households, rural healthcare facilities, Tribal lands, schools, and libraries.)Some other fees that some ISPs like to charge that are just literally the cost of doing business.-Network access and maintenance fee-Network enhancement fee-Broadband cost recovery fee-Internet infrastructure fee-Municipal construction charge-Administration fee-Technology service fee-High-speed network recovery feeSome of these fees above would be like if a bar decides to charge a renovation fee after doing a remodel of their premises. Again, these fees are all just the cost of doing business and if they’re going to offload that cost to their customers, then their customers need to know exactly what they are paying for in advance. reply tptacek 3 hours agorootparentThe NCTA letter refers exclusively to pass-through fees imposed by governments. None of those fees are like if a bar decides to charge a renovation fee after doing a remodel. reply smsm42 10 hours agorootparentprev> ISPs could alternatively roll such discretionary fees into the base monthly price, thereby eliminating the need to itemize them on the label.That&#x27;s right from the article.I don&#x27;t know what \"people\" want, I just want the quoted price to match the billed one. reply vel0city 14 hours agorootparentprevWell, they do, I don&#x27;t understand why they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to. Same thing with my cell phone bill through Mint, other than regular sales tax all the other telecom fees are all rolled into their price.They just mess around with their actual price until the final price lines up with their marketing. Its not exactly challenging math. reply ckozlowski 14 hours agorootparentprev\"it&#x27;s money local governments are taxing from their residents, piggybacking on the ISP billing system.\"I&#x27;m sympathetic to the point, and this feels like there&#x27;s area for compromise here. Something along the lines of \"We&#x27;ll gladly support this change if local governments stop hiding taxes behind us.\"I have to believe the NCTA made this issue clear; I wonder then if the FCC noticed, and if so, why there isn&#x27;t a similar directive levied at municipalities to stop this practice?To be clear, I fully support forcing ISPs to be transparent, period. But that is a messy issue they&#x27;re dealing with, and I feel like there could easily a co-argument to localities to stop making it hard for them to be transparent.Edit: Just saw your comment below about Home Rule. Drat. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentMostly my subtext here is that municipalities should stop being so sneaky with their taxes and just come out and bill residents directly, instead of pretending that their taxes are just Comcast being greedy. reply ckozlowski 14 hours agorootparentI sense that perhaps a lawsuit targeting this practice might be incoming then, if the FCC forces them to proceed. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentOn what basis would they sue the municipalities? reply Avshalom 13 hours agorootparentprevThe FCC did notice.from the article:Providers are free, of course, to not pass these fees through to consumers reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s even less transparent! reply neltnerb 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t care about any other company being \"transparent\" in this sense, I care how much what I am paying for will actually cost.It&#x27;s a low bar, I guess, but the excuses as to why it&#x27;s too hard are just so insulting to the reader...It&#x27;s so incredibly strange to see a large corporation complain that figuring out how much its product costs is too hard with one hand while billing people those same fees just fine with the other. reply smsm42 10 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t need to know how the sausage is made, I just need to know how much does it cost. If I&#x27;m given a fixed all included price upfront, I don&#x27;t care how much of if goes where inside of ISP. Now, if they quote me one price and bill another - then we have a problem. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentThey asked to do exactly this and were denied. replysmsm42 10 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t have to pass on the fees, it&#x27;s their choice. Too hard? Charge fixed price, eat the fees and save the troubles. Want to nickel and dime instead? Disclose it then. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentThis doesn&#x27;t make much sense as an objection. It&#x27;s not Comcast that came up with the idea of charging subscribers these fees; it&#x27;s their own local governments, who wrote contracts requiring fees to be passed through to the customers. reply tareqak 11 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a technical problem though right? The ISP could create state&#x2F;county&#x2F;parish&#x2F;municipal maps that show which passthrough fees are in effect. Putting that on a bill would be difficult I agree.What about listing the ceiling of the passthrough fees e.g.these aren&#x27;t fees Comcast chooses to chargeThese are, in fact, fees Comcast chooses to charge.This reminds me of the confusion of some other employees when a start-up I was working for got purchased. The new owners proposed that we should sign documents agreeing certain conditions in exchange for which they&#x27;d pay us a \"bonus\" of an amount to be determined by a complicated formula at the end of their financial year.So I glance at this document, it&#x27;s as I think, and I explain this document requires you to work for them for a period of time, it&#x27;s a weaker version of the document the senior people are signing or have signed -- but unlike theirs it doesn&#x27;t actually pay us ordinary employees any money - therefore I explain you should not sign if you think you might want to work somewhere else any time soon. e.g. if your role makes no sense as part of the larger entity and you&#x27;ve got better things to do with your life rather than collect a salary for a few months until they realise you aren&#x27;t necessary and fire you.I got widespread objections - it has a bonus scheme. Yeah, the way that scheme works their accountants are going to decide whether they pay us money in a year&#x27;s time. Guess what those accountants are going to say? They&#x27;re going to say \"No\". If they wanted to pay us money, they would just pay us money as they did with our management. Employers can always pay you money. There is tax due on it if they do, but that&#x27;s their problem not yours. When an employer doesn&#x27;t give you money the reason is that they don&#x27;t want to give you money. Don&#x27;t ask for another explanation, it&#x27;s demeaning for them to have to pretend and for you to listen.In a year&#x27;s time I got a call from the CTO, an old friend, was I on that bonus scheme? Yes, I said, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me (then or now). He was warning people because he&#x27;d been tipped off that of course it was worthless, exactly as I had said, but whoever had told him had seen the numbers from the accountants now.Comcast can choose not to charge these fees, but it wants to. It would like to be able to say \"Our price is $49.99\" and then bill you say $84 per month and blame the difference on vague \"fees\". They only need to justify how that adds up to $84 in the case that someone works very hard, maybe a journalist working on a story about rip off ISPs. And if it&#x27;s bullshit? They just say \"Oops\" and refund some fees when caught if their lawyers tell them that&#x27;s cheapest.In the UK for a long time ISPs would claim their charges didn&#x27;t match the advertised price because it didn&#x27;t include a fee they paid to BT Openreach, the incumbent telco whose copper cables they&#x27;re using to provide service. In a way they were telling the truth, Openreach did charge them a fee. Unfortunately that fee is published by law, fairly small, and it had been steadily going down, because \"maintaining some copper cables under the street\" isn&#x27;t expensive. On the other hand the fee these ISPs would add to the supposed \"price\" for consumers was larger and going up over time. Eventually the regulator told them to knock it off with this bullshit and just tell people the actual price including this mandatory fee. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentThis is obviously not true. If you&#x27;re in a municipality in the US (if you&#x27;re not, none of this matters anyways), you can probably go to the website for that municipality and look it up; the franchise contracts for mine are the first search result, and they spell out the fees that Comcast are required to charge.The reason I&#x27;m on this hobby horse is that I serve on my local village telecom commission and, after 2 years of zoning out and playing solitaire whenever the \"franchise agreement\" came up as a topic, I finally paid attention and learned that we were making high six figures every year in our general fund charging Comcast users a Comcast tax. It&#x27;s a thing my commission works on: just how much we should soak local ISP users.We&#x27;ve gone for several years without a franchise contract renewal because, apparently, Comcast doesn&#x27;t want to do this anymore. I don&#x27;t blame them! reply taeric 11 hours agorootparentThis is still misrepresenting it, though? They are free to not pass the fees through directly to users. They are required to pay the fee to the municipality. These are not, necessarily, linked things.You are correct that it would somewhat increase their costs, such that they may have to increase their billing rate, but they are in no way required to pass the bill through directly to the customer.Note that this is very different from taxes. Those are typically collected by the business, but owed by the purchaser. Right? reply tptacek 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m having trouble understanding how they are anything other than taxes. They&#x27;re called \"pass-through fees\" because the underlying contracts (or, in some cases, statutes) set the expectation that they&#x27;ll be passed directly to the consumer. They&#x27;re fees governments charge to their residents, through service providers, for services the government does not itself provide. They&#x27;re not even tolls. They&#x27;re taxes.I like taxes! I&#x27;m a Democrat! But I think these particular taxes are pretty shady. reply taeric 9 hours agorootparentSnidely, they aren&#x27;t taxes for the simple reason that I couldn&#x27;t itemize them in federal deductions. That isn&#x27;t quite as relevant nowadays, I suppose.There is also usually a benefit for Comcast in this, as well. As such, it feels somewhat ok to treat them separate from taxes collected by Comcast. In particular, it is not uncommon for the franchise agreement to free up a ton of advertising concerns that the company would otherwise have to do.I do think an interesting question is if this is counted as revenue for them? I&#x27;m currently assuming that they do count it in gross revenue? As such, it is literally them finding a way to get more revenue for places that cost more to do business, without open faced charging more.That is, yes it is an expense that they have to pay, but so is, for example, the gas they have to pay to send a technician out. For that matter, the vehicle is also an expense of doing business. I&#x27;d be annoyed if those were line item added to my bill as a way to inflate what I paid. Not sure how this is any different? reply xbar 6 hours agorootparentI do not accept Comcast’s response. Nor do I accept your justification.Comcast has alll the data it needs to produce an accurate bill and is free to price its service in a manner that hides municipal fees if it chooses. Or not and it can advertise low rates and break the fees out.Comcast wants to make a profit out of lack of transparency and leverage that lack of transparency in marketing against competitors, public and private. reply tptacek 5 hours agorootparentExplain how Comcast makes a profit by quoting the maximum possible price from all the municipalities in the region it serves. replytialaramex 12 hours agorootparentprev> We&#x27;ve gone for several years without a franchise contract renewalAnd so as a result there&#x27;s no Internet in your village and you just realised you aren&#x27;t actually posting on HN and the reply has vanished in a puff of logic?

How does this requirement supposedly work to your understanding? What exactly would happen if Comcast charged the wrong amount of tax to some customers. Do the customers get a receipt so that they know they&#x27;ve paid the correct local taxes?The reality is that your village taxes Comcast via this \"franchise agreement\". Comcast have no obligation to \"pass through\" that cost to their customers in your village, they choose to charge opaque and vague extra \"fees\" which may or may not be adjusted according to the tax, and you are (presumably inadvertently) now here arguing that a giant corporation is the victim because they have to pay taxes like everybody else. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentWe would sue them, and collect in state court.

Comcast are not, in fact, required to do this but they choose to do so.Specifically the 1934 Communications Act (yeah, I know, that&#x27;s a super old law, it was updated to explain how cable TV works) tells cable companies that they may pass through such franchise fees to their end customer. Note the word used, not \"must\". replyGuvante 14 hours agorootparentprevThere is an explicit exemption for mandatory charges.If Comcast decides to change it&#x27;s rate because of those fees it can explain that. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentAgain: they are exclusively objecting to labeling requirement for pass-through fees. reply Guvante 11 hours agorootparentWhat makes something a pass through fee?Does access to a conduit count?

You receiving those charges is not mandated by the government; rather, passing them through to the consumer is entirely discretionary and often done by ISPs or cell carriers.

ISP are complaining (presumably because the increased transparency will make it harder to milk the customer) by trying to claim that itemizing the invoice will be confusing since they have to pass-through all these state and federal fees. The FCC is saying \"tough shit\", and if they want to keep it \"simple\" then they need to roll these fees into the sticker price.Basically, either itemize or be upfront.

Those businesses that are already low margin do have to pass the costs on to customers otherwise the risk adjusted return of their business is not worth it compared to savings bonds.Ultimately if the cost of doing business is higher whether its because the government has imposed additional fees or because your money tree died, the cost of the producing the product has gone up and this has to be an upward pressure on prices.

However, that&#x27;s not what this discussion is about. The discussion is about whether the customer is told the price will be $X and then they have to pay $Y where Y is considerably more than X.Instead of appealing to the magic money tree, companies simply need to be honest when they tell customers the price. They are free to keep the same prices, they just now need to say the price is $Y, and can choose to say that it&#x27;s comprised of $X and then all these other things or just say it&#x27;s $Y and leave it at that.The reason companies don&#x27;t want to do that, is they want to compete on having the lowest number for $X and sneak as many extra charges into the real price $Y in the hopes that customers don&#x27;t discover it until they&#x27;re locked into a contract.Part of the problem is that the US has had this tradition for a long time with sales tax. Now I can understand online shops listing prices without sales tax, because it genuinely depends on where the customer lives. But in a regular real-world shop, they know exactly where the shop is and what the final cost of an item will be when it&#x27;s sold, regardless of who buys it.You have the same thing with tipping - you buy food at a restaurant, and then get told some nonsense that amounts to \"because we don&#x27;t pay our workers a fair wage, we&#x27;re going to add an extra 20% on top of the price we offered and on top of taxes and all the rest\". With your money tree argument, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re not in favour of your restaurants advertising a steak at $20, then when the bill arrives it&#x27;s $20 plus $30 for the ingredients, $20 for the cook, $10 for the dishwasher, $10 for the waitress, $10 for the supervisor, $5 for the parking lot because the company rents that from someone, $2 for the company&#x27;s phone line, $2 for the gas and electricity used, $1 because they need to clean the tables between customers, $2 for the condiments you might have used, and and did we mention that we want 20% tip as well. Yes, this is all the cost of business, but the customer doesn&#x27;t need to know all that - they are, after all, just buying a steak.The situation with broadband should be just as simple - \"I want an internet connection.

Are you arguing that increases in costs are not passed on to consumers at all?It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that the FTC is not just talking about passing along random costs - they are specifically talking about things like the Universal Service Fee (basically sales tax for ISPs) and local regulatory fees. Things that are assessed on customer billing. reply wolverine876 5 hours agorootparent> ??? Are you arguing that increases in costs are not passed on to consumers at all?Now that you point it out, I can see how it might be read that way. Beyond a doubt, in practice, many cost increases cause some increase in sale price, and that always will be true (and should be true). I&#x27;m objecting to the word must, in \"must be passed on to their customers\". Businesses have a choice, and making that choice every day is a fundamental task in business. I might also object to passed on, but that&#x27;s a technicality.> It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that the FTC is not just talking about passing along random costs - they are specifically talking about things like the Universal Service Fee (basically sales tax for ISPs) and local regulatory fees. Things that are assessed on customer billing.That conflates what is with what must be. The ISPs often do show it on customer billing, but they could aborb the costs and not show it. That&#x27;s the point. reply az226 8 hours agoparentprevNo, FCC said at point of sale, not point of advertising. reply bhhaskin 14 hours agoparentprevISPs are putting BS fees instead of raising their prices. reply datadrivenangel 15 hours agoprevGood. Companies should be able to charge the prices they want, but if that&#x27;s the case they should be required to disclose the full price and nothing but the price. reply tptacek 14 hours agoparentIn this case, ISPs are charging prices they don&#x27;t want, but rather are mandated to by local governments. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a normal part of business. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentReally? In what other ordinary retail business do you need to get a customer zip code before you can quote them an accurate price on a standard offering? reply vel0city 14 hours agorootparentPractically all of them. I don&#x27;t see the final price from pretty much any online store until I put in my ZIP as otherwise it doesn&#x27;t know shipping or taxes.But at least I can see the final price before I choose to commit to buying the item. Many ISPs won&#x27;t tell you what the bill is going to be until they&#x27;ve already wired you up for service. reply mqus 12 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t they need to know your address anyways to check if they can provide service at all? reply jcranmer 14 hours agorootparentprevE-commerce? reply meepmorp 13 hours agorootparentprevZip code isn&#x27;t nearly enough information to work out telecom taxes&#x2F;fees, as they often cross political boundaries with potentially different rates and charges. You need a full street address. reply tzs 11 hours agorootparentSame for sales tax, if you are selling in a way where the applicable sales tax is where the customer lives rather than where the seller is. reply pessimizer 14 hours agorootparentprevThose are expenses. The ISPs choose the price they want based on their expenses. Complaining about local regulations is no more or less legitimate than complaining about the price of copper. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentNo, they&#x27;re not. Comcast&#x27;s price doesn&#x27;t float municipality to municipality. These are simply taxes that local governments are charging and forcing Comcast to collect. reply frumper 14 hours agorootparentPrices do change in different municipalities. I&#x27;ve paid different sticker prices in different towns that are within an hour of each other for the same service. reply viraptor 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is the real price though. The customer doesn&#x27;t care normally - the price is what they pay, not the weird partial amount that the ISP itself gets in the end. reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agorootparent> customer doesn&#x27;t care normally - the price is what they payA savvy customer should. If 90% of the bill is Comcast, I&#x27;m going to negotiate with Comcast. If 90% is municipal fees, I&#x27;m going to call my city council. reply supertimor 8 hours agorootparentOk, sure. And this is exactly why this rule is being put into place. So customers can see a list of fees instead of some nebulous “fee” added on that tells the consumer nothing about what they are actually paying for. reply macinjosh 12 hours agorootparentprevThe US has a long tradition of separating taxes from sale prices. Every fast food joint lists a price w&#x2F;o sales tax. You don&#x27;t pay sales tax to the state individually. The state is taxing the businesses&#x27; sales, but the cost is passed on to you. Why should ISPs not be able to do the same thing Del Taco does?In my area we have small shopping districts that have their infrastructure funded through a 1.7% sales tax on every retail business. Best Buy doesn&#x27;t change the price of the iPhone 14 to reflect this. Should they? I don&#x27;t know. Instead taped to the surface of every checkout is a typed note informing the customer of the improvement fund. I think a good compromise would be to allow advertising to remain how it is, but require a full detailed bill at the point of sale. reply Animats 14 hours agoprev\"Separately, the order said the FCC rejected a wireless-industry \"request to include potentially complex and lengthy details about data allowances on the label, and instead affirm that providers can make those details available to consumers on a linked website.\" To maintain simplicity, the labels must \"identify the amount of data included with the monthly price,\" and \"disclose any charges or reductions in service for any data used in excess of the amount included in the plan,\" the FCC said.\"Good. reply tptacek 14 hours agoprevJust a reminder: the ISPs objected only to labeling pass-through fees, which aren&#x27;t fees at all, but rather taxes levied by local governments and mandated on the ISPs (franchise fees are the most common example). Contrary to popular opinion, most of these franchise contracts don&#x27;t include exclusivity; either way, it&#x27;s money that goes to your municipality&#x27;s general fund, not to Comcast.NCTA asked instead to be allowed to label the maximum possible total bill customers would face, but FCC has, apparently, rejected that. reply mulmen 14 hours agoparentAny idea why they did this? What did Comcast stand to gain by not labeling these taxes? My imagination is failing me here. All I can think is that if Comcast wants it then it is probably bad for me. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentSince they&#x27;re willing to label the maximum possible price, which maximizes the sticker shock, I&#x27;m inclined to take them at their word that the problem here is logistical: they operate retail businesses (and work with partners at big box stores) where they don&#x27;t know until they speak to the customer what the pass-through fees will be, and that makes accurate labels difficult to pre-print.My stake here is just to alert people that their municipalities are taxing them for using the Internet, and hiding it in \"fees\" that most customers assume are Comcast soaking them (see: this very thread).Because of the historical and contractual differences between TV cable and fiber, there are municipalities where you&#x27;re taxed differentially based on whether you&#x27;re with Comcast or ATT&#x2F;Verizon! reply az226 8 hours agorootparentprevComcast wants to list a lower list price for getting customers through the door. They want to make comparison shopping difficulty so customers give and just choose them. And then they sneakily add all the junk fees on the customer&#x27;s bill, but deep down the UI so you have to download the PDF to see it, not exposed inside the UI itself, so few customers ever see it. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentAgain: they asked explicitly to be allowed to quote the maximum of all the pass-through fees in their regions, and were denied. reply protocolture 6 hours agoparentprevWe get some of this in oz, where larger entities often dont resell over smaller open access networks because maintaining a price book for 100 different networks is logistically very difficult for a large business. reply meindnoch 14 hours agoprevWhat is tge FCC equivalent for restaurants? We need legislation to prominently display those bullshit \"service fees\" and \"kitchen appreciation fees\" everywhere, not just the final bill. reply cvoss 14 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t know that the consumer expenses for dining out rise to the same level of importance as those for internet service in the digital world. On the luxury&#x2F;need spectrum, the former is decidedly on the luxury side while the latter is increasingly on the need side.That being said, I am curious what cities&#x2F;regions or restaurant types you see this happening at. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever encountered anything like that where I live (southeast) except for things like the customary mandatory 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. reply no_wizard 14 hours agorootparentWith the absolute proliferation of hidden &#x2F; undisclosed &#x2F; hard to find fees since 2020, the trend only seems to be accelerating.For instance, I went out to eat the other day, and I hadn&#x27;t gone to a regular restaurant in awhile. Prices seemed reasonable. Then the final bill came, and had almost $7 dollars worth of various little fees.Prior to 2020, this was nearly unheard of, and I certainly never experienced it.I have vowed to not eat out for the foreseeable future without a really compelling reason.The calculus would be different if that had to be listed in the price or otherwise disclosed in an obvious manner. This happens in other establishments too.For another example, apparently, my apartment mandates a cleaning \"charge\". This is not disclosed in the lease, nor on the website, or anything of that nature. Its taken out of your deposit, non optional. Apparently, this is completely legal, and its frustrating. reply hot_gril 14 hours agorootparentprevBay Area and California in general. San Francisco was first with the 5% restaurant healthcare fee, which I think was a citywide tax that explicitly allowed businesses to list the fee separately. Maybe this inspired other restaurants in adjacent cities to start adding similar things despite not having any law like that, usually (but not always) mentioning the fee in fine print. It got even more widespread lately with the classic \"covid fee\" which later got changed to \"inflation fee.\" The other less rigid thing is asking for a 22-30% tip on the credit card machine, often for things you don&#x27;t traditionally tip for; at those places I use cash.Highest I&#x27;ve seen is 8% while also asking for a tip, but at least the fee is clearly listed at the top of the menu: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asliceofny.com&#x2F;sunnyvale&#x2F;menu&#x2F; reply meindnoch 13 hours agorootparent\"An 8% Co-op Wellness service charge is added to all orders and is split 40&#x2F;60 between employees+managers and the cooperative. It is not a tip.\"Yeah, this is the kind of bullshit I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s a percent-based surcharge, so why can&#x27;t they just increase their prices by 8%?Prices on the menu are meaningless at this point. With sales tax, the \"obligatory\" tipping and these new bullshit fees you&#x27;d be closer to the real price by mentally doubling everything on the menu. How people put up with this shit is beyond me. reply hot_gril 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more like 30-35% but yeah. Don&#x27;t forget the credit card fee if you&#x27;re using that, except that one actually makes sense since you can opt out. reply JumpCrisscross 12 hours agorootparentprevJust deduct it from your tip and move on. reply hot_gril 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s take-out pizza, shouldn&#x27;t have a tip anyway. replykj4ips 11 hours agoprevThis is fascinating, I live in a region where there are patches of competitive ISP area, and as a consequence, I have never seen an ISP advertise a price outside of a targeted mailing or phone call.I had assumed that most of the rest of the country was like this, and you only got prices after you gave an address.Even a medium size ISP that was running a \"price for life\" deal, didn&#x27;t even advertise with the price was, and you got better deals if you were in a competitive area. (Based on comparing mailed advertisements).Prices appear on physical mail advertisements I get for internet service, I get quite a lot of them, but billboards, television ads, and everything else simply lacks a price and touts product quality and speed. reply scarab92 11 hours agoparentAustralia simply banned component pricing altogether.You are simply not permitted to communicate any price other the total price, which must include government fees and sales taxes.What makes this especially nice is that Australia also doesn’t allow employers to pay under a living wage (currently about USD $21 for casual staff), which means tipping culture never took off here, so your total out of pocket is always exactly equal to the advertised amount.Aide: I believe in some jurisdictions in Australia it’s actually illegal to solicit tips, as it’s known to be discriminatory (since tipped amounts are known to vary by race, gender, age etc..). reply mikece 15 hours agoprevAside from cable companies wanting to hide fees, is there any reason why this rule should be scrapped? reply lizard 15 hours agoparentI imagine some people won&#x27;t be thrilled about the \"Fee listing fee\" that&#x27;s going to show up on their bill. reply sharts 15 hours agoparentprevYes. Those who support it will be paid handsomely by lobbyists. Why doesn&#x27;t anybody stand up for those people&#x27;s right to make money at public expense? reply rolph 15 hours agoparentprevthe actual title explains the problem a little more acurately>>FCC says “too bad” to ISPs complaining that listing every fee is too hard How would that work when you may not even know where the person wants service?No cost until the service location is known. It&#x27;s a two way street, right? It&#x27;s entirely reasonable that if you were to obligate the ISP to deliver precision in pricing they&#x27;d have no recourse but to require accurate disclosure of the service location.This is all fantasy, however. This clown world we&#x27;ve built doesn&#x27;t contemplate such things. The minor ask the FCC is making here is as far as it will go, and if the big ISPs put enough campaign money into the right \"family foundations\" we might not even get that much. reply pessimizer 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you don&#x27;t know the price that you can charge, you shouldn&#x27;t get the right to make one up for advertising. That&#x27;s creating a special right for the stupid or lazy. reply throwaway14356 15 hours agorootparentprevlets also require an api and standardize the offers.Just like one can see 2 jars of peanut butter side by side in the store. reply JoshTko 14 hours agoprevThis is great. Kind of crazy that price transparency isn&#x27;t available for healthcare yet in the US. reply londons_explore 14 hours agoprevIn the UK, the advertised price of a service must be the price that a typical user ends up actually paying.And it can&#x27;t be hidden in the terms - all the actual amount paid by a regular user must be the headline price of the advert. Taxes, fees, etc must all be included.It works pretty well. reply londons_explore 14 hours agoparentThere are some things that get quibbled over - for example should the advertised price of an ice rink include the price of ice skate hire? Most people don&#x27;t own their own ice skates round there, so have to hire them too.But in general, it means there are usually no hidden fees. reply meepmorp 13 hours agoparentprevThe taxes&#x2F;fees on telecom services are complicated in the US because we have multiple overlapping taxation authorities who might impose them. Unless you know a person&#x27;s address, you don&#x27;t actually know what they&#x27;re on the hook for. reply viraptor 13 hours agorootparentFor the ISPs I dealt with in other countries, the lookup normally starts with: tell me your address so we can tell you what services we provide they&#x27;re. Sounds like the price could easily come after that step. reply meepmorp 12 hours agorootparentThe issue here is a requirement to provide product labels for broadband services, with the intent of letting consumers compare between providers, i.e., before the point where they inquire about service. I totally agree that they should be required to provide a complete (and accurate!) list of taxes and fees to a potential customer before any agreement. reply londons_explore 9 hours agorootparentprevYou could still add on whatever the average customer pays in taxes. reply izzydata 14 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t see why they can&#x27;t just charge a flat rate that is slightly above whatever the sum of all fees would be and then they sort it out themselves. Is it actually better for the consumer that they charge us $36.78 instead of $40.00 so they can avoid listing 15 different local fees?I&#x27;m honestly asking because I don&#x27;t know. reply legitster 14 hours agoparentI believe that the rules are that if you list something as a fee, all of that money has to go towards that fee or else you get in trouble.The FTC suggests though that ISPs just raise prices and internalize the fees. But then your price is always going to look worse than the next guy, and you may just encourage local governments to give you more fees for you to bury for them. reply protocolture 6 hours agoprevSo lets say I am a retailer.I don&#x27;t own the product (have a relationship with the person ultimately setting the pass through charges) and I sell the subscriptions to the end user for access.Unless those passthrough charges are made available to me before the customer signs up, I cannot reasonably estimate them when advertising the service. Instead, I can only pass them through when they appear on my invoice, or absorb them. In fact those are the 3 options here. Pull out of the market, pass the costs through (and attract fines) or absorb the pass through fees.Punishing me as the access provider doesn&#x27;t make sense. Whether or not you have personal misgivings against the access carrier, it seems like the municipality setting the pass through charges should be asked to make them more consistent, or provide an API for lookup.I dont know what the response here is going to be from the retailers, but I am betting its not going to be pro consumer. reply ivanmontillam 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;m with the FCC on this one.It&#x27;s silly ISPs are fighting this, because if they can charge you a specific fee, it&#x27;s obvious they can provide an CSV or Excel file with all the fees. I don&#x27;t see anything too hard about it. It&#x27;s literally a SELECT and maybe a JOIN with it.Hell, I don&#x27;t even understand what&#x27;s so hard about it. Literally, Twilio gives you a nice CSV file with all the fees and tiers applicable to you and you can use it to ask for discounts. If Twilio can do it, you standard AT&T for sure can.It&#x27;s ironic how in The Land of the Free, ISPs are fighting to be opaque. If your corporate strategy is based on obscurity, maybe it&#x27;s time for some serious consumer protection regulation? reply nottorp 1 hour agoprevHow can you budget anything in the US if you&#x27;re never charged a price you can look up beforehand? reply az226 9 hours agoprevIf they can charge me, they can list the fee.

I’m charged $0.55 in fees on every bill and that’s it. So I pay $55.55 each month, pretty consistently for the past 20 years or so.The bandwidth is mediocre and I could switch to other companies but just finding the price was hard because there were activation fees and equipment fees and state and local fees and an fcc fee and some random fee they decided to add that changes from month to month. It was so weird. And also odd that they would have different state, local, and fcc fees that att didn’t. reply roflchoppa 14 hours agoprevJessica Rosenworcel once again stepping to bat for the people. reply failuser 12 hours agoprevI hope this will not result in FCC being dismantled or nerfed. reply virtuous_sloth 12 hours agoprevIf you can afford to bill it, you can afford to list it. reply nektro 9 hours agoprevlet it be known this is biden&#x27;s FCC reply macinjosh 12 hours agoprevAfter reading the FCC&#x27;s statement this is clearly about elected officials and regulators wanting cover from corporations for the taxes and fees they levy. The corporations want to point out what goes into their costs on the bill, but it is impractical to advertise on price when each viewer of a TV ad may have a slightly different cost because of their location.Either way, consumers are paying for it. The two parties are just arguing over how it is presented to the public. We will probably end up with even less transparency in advertising with tactics like: \"plans as low as $X\" or the like. reply what-no-tests 13 hours agoprevCan they at least offset some of my fees by paying me a dividend for all the data they sell to law enforcement agencies? reply resuresu 13 hours agoprevI cancelled my home internet, got tired of haggling with them every month.

Thankfully, the open source ecosystem is starting to develop, and we are now seeing open source models that rival closed-source alternatives. Hundreds of small teams and individuals are also working to make these models more useful, accessible, and performant. These projects push the state of the art in open source AI and help provide a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the technology. They include: instruction-tuning base LLMs; removing censorship from LLM outputs; optimizing models for low-powered machines; building novel tooling for model inference; researching LLM security issues; and many others. However, the people behind these projects often don’t have the resources available to pursue their work to conclusion or maintain it in the long run. The situation is more acute in AI than traditional infrastructure, since even fine-tuning models requires significant GPU computing resources, especially as open source models get larger. Obligatory xkcd homage (original) To help close this resource gap, we’re announcing today the a16z Open Source AI Grant program. We’ll support a small group of open source developers through grant funding (not an investment or SAFE note), giving them the opportunity to continue their work without the pressure to generate financial returns. We’re also announcing the first batch of grant recipients and funded projects: Jon Durbin (Airoboros): instruction-tuning LLMs on synthetic data Eric Hartford: fine-tuning uncensored LLMs Jeremy Howard (fast.ai): fine-tuning foundation models for vertical applications Tom Jobbins (TheBloke): quantizing LLMs to run locally Woosuk Kwon and Zhuohan Li (vLLM): library for high-throughput LLM inference Nous Research: new fine-tuned language models akin to the Nous Hermes and Puffin series oobabooga: web UI and platform for local LLMs Teknium: synthetic data pipelines for LLM training We want to thank them for their contributions to the field, and for fostering open collaboration, learning, and advancement in AI. *** The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

Here&#x27;s some additional details based on questions I see in the comments:My grant covered the purchase of a Scalar server from Lambda Labs, which allowed me to configure a system with 8 previous-gen A6000 GPUs, partly also thanks to NVIDIA who has recently given me 3 of those cards, and Lambda Labs who offered to provide everything at cost.a16z didn&#x27;t ask for any equity or any kind of quid pro quo, other than to let folks know that they provided this grant. They couldn&#x27;t have been more helpful through the process - I didn&#x27;t have to fill out any forms (other than sign a single one page agreement), the contract was clear and totally fair (even explicitly saying that a16z wasn&#x27;t going to receive any kind of rights to anything), and they wired me the money for buying the server promptly. reply Reviving1514 8 hours agoparentHi Jeremy,I&#x27;m sure you get this a lot, but thank you for teaching me ML - I am a hardware engineer&#x2F;manufacturing person who learned to code in the early 2010s and it&#x27;s been immensely helpful in my career.

Thanks for making this field approachable. reply rajko_rad 16 hours agoprevHi HN, we are super excited to announce this new initiative!!Please note, this program was designed to support individuals, teams, and hackers who are not pursuing commercial companies. Nevertheless, these projects push the state of the art in open source AI and help provide us with a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the technology as it is developed.We are really proud to be contributing in this small fashion and grateful to the first cohort and all others contributing in this space! reply thewataccount 14 hours agoparentHello, I think this is a great project!If an individual is looking to contribute to the field with different training data ideas - would they need to first establish themselves and get your attention, or would there be a way to submit a proposal?For myself compute is rather expensive, I could likely afford a few test runs for proofs of concept but beyond that it would be difficult. I&#x27;ve got a single 4090 so I can&#x27;t run llama70b faster then 1it&#x2F;s. reply rajko_rad 14 hours agorootparentThank you so much for your work and enthusiasm here!! Unfortunately, that’s roughly the best way to approach it and how most of these have worked so far, demonstrations on smaller models (e.g. 7&#x2F;13B), with slightly smaller datasets, catching the eye of the community, etc. in general it’s not a bad approach to research too, prove out concepts at smaller scale before scaling up! reply thewataccount 14 hours agorootparentTotally understand! I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d get swarmed with requests.Are you interested in non-LLMs as well? Stable diffusion for example? reply rajko_rad 14 hours agorootparentDefinitely. This was kicked off in the last month or two when there just seemed to be a bit more happening in OSS LLMs, but we are prioritizing diversifying this for the next cohort! reply latchkey 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m curious, where are you getting the GPUs? reply rajko_rad 16 hours agorootparentin most cases the teams already had their own source or platform of choice! reply samstave 15 hours agorootparentMaybe build a FAQ for others on how to accomplish, or resources you can point people at? reply kcorbitt 14 hours agorootparentA lot of people are using RunPod for experimental&#x2F;small-scale workloads. They have good network and disk speeds and you can generally find availability for a latest-gen GPU like an L40 or 4090 if your workload can fit on a single GPU. One GPU is plenty for fine-tuning Llama 2 7B or 13B with LoRA or QLoRA. They also sometimes have availability for multi-GPU servers like 8xA100s, but that&#x27;s more hit-or-miss.If you want to go even cheaper vast.ai is a popular option. It&#x27;s a P2P marketplace for individuals to rent out their GPUs. You can generally get a ~20-30% discount vs RunPod prices by using Vast, but network speeds and perf are much more variable and there&#x27;s always the possibility that the host will just shut you off without warning. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it if you&#x27;re training with proprietary data since they can&#x27;t guarantee the host isn&#x27;t logging it, but most of the OSS fine-tuning community publishes their datasets anyway. reply tikkun 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve done a version of this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36632397Let me know what you&#x27;d want to see added! reply rajko_rad 15 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, hadn’t thought of that, thank you! If you want to host end points Replicate is a great option, they also have a newer fine tuning api and solution! for raw VMs with GPUs right now it’s a bit situational and you have to try multiple different vendors tbh, also really depends on the capacity you need and which machines!! reply qwertox 16 hours agoparentprevThank you! reply rajko_rad 16 hours agorootparentOur pleasure :) reply politelemon 16 hours agoprevVery happy to see oobabooga on the list.

I am building https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomictessellator.com, and since I am 100% technical I am not sure about commercialising or open sourcing it, I definitly would like to open source some of the components (e.g. turnkey dockerized scientific computing environments, the molecular force viewer, and also open up a hub for the environments and models) - when I was in Stanford meeting with some comp chemists a few months ago they got very excited for this.I negotiated with my day job to work 2AM to 10AM so that I can work on this passion project in the afternoons, some grant funding would really help me focus on this more. There&#x27;s quite a bit of interesting stuff not on the website in catalyst discovery and molecular dynamics. Contact me if you&#x27;d like to chat &#x2F; demo.In my ideal world I would work on this full time and totally open source it. reply rajko_rad 14 hours agorootparentfeel free to DM on twitter or linkedin. In a nutshell, if you want to pursue a company now in or in the near future, we would likely need to consider you through our normal investing process for equity funding. If you are considering just working on it OSS, we would encourage taking first steps in that direct, and testing community-project fit validation before quite going full or near-full time! reply syntaxing 14 hours agoprevWhoa this is honestly awesome, a lot of tools I see on the list are ones I’ve been using so it’s great to see they’re getting financial support.

I.e. closer to 16x4090 machines. Sure labor is worth something but he has it in cash, and also there&#x27;s barely a lot of people (yet) paying high prices for research (non ML ops) labor hours for this yet so the salary wouldn&#x27;t be that high anyway.Just a pet peeve when ppl under exaggerate how many gpus&#x2F;flops a dollar can buy (if you&#x27;re slighly smart with your money). reply junipertea 15 hours agorootparentWhat about PSU to power all of this, GPU motherboards, SSDs, CPU to not bottleneck this and sufficient RAM? You could argue it&#x27;s more than 8, but definitely not 16. To utilize those GPUs to the max you need memory bandwidth to even feed it enough data. reply fyloraspit 14 hours agorootparentYeh I built a dual 3090 machine and just to have those 2 cards run well cost a lot for all the other stuff. Workstation spec mobo, top tier PSU, CPU and memory with headroom for the system, not to mention storage and case and cooling. And this is just a hobbyist build.

For example, many people&#x2F;companies have the real pain&#x2F;need to improve ad click-through-rates and reduce crypto&#x2F;gas fees but maybe these aren&#x27;t problems you care about. reply bodecker 13 hours agorootparentAgreed, \"real pain\" is a subjective&#x2F;vague term and even crypto is a broad term. My intended use here is to describe solutions that are more grounded&#x2F;integrated into reality vs. more grounded in a fantasy of how the world works. It is hard to describe well though and if you keep unrolling most perceptions of reality are subjective reply samstave 14 hours agorootparentprevSolving pain point == A problem we can profit from.

It&#x27;s extremely hard to vet.It&#x27;s a much safer bet to wait until projects are already popular in the community, already being relied on by people, and where those devs would love to spend more time on their open source projects but they&#x27;re limited by money.Yes, the downside of this is that some people could make things happen if they were given money first. But, if I was them, I&#x27;d still prefer to do what they&#x27;re doing and pick projects that are already successful and give grants to those.(This isn&#x27;t a comment about your project specifically, for all I know your project might be a popular open source LLM project that lots of people already rely on, in which case they probably already know about your project and will probably reach out to you for the second round, is my guess) reply zekrioca 14 hours agoparentprevIt seems so. reply waihtis 16 hours agoprevhail e&#x2F;acc and the thermodynamic god reply artninja1988 15 hours agoprevThank you for doing this.

    "originBody": "🏠 Marginalia📁 Weblog📄 Absurd Success Absurd Success Posted: 2023-08-30 Tags: search-engine nlnet So… I’ve had the most unreal week of coding. Zero exaggeration, I’ve halved the RAM requirements of the search engine, removed the need to take the system offline during an upgrade, removed hard limits on how many documents can be indexed, and quadrupled soft limits on how many keywords can be in the corpus. It’s been a long term goal to keep it possible to run and operate the system on low-powered hardware, and so far improvements have been made, to the point where my 32 Gb RAM developer machine feels spacey rather than cramped, but this set of changes takes it several notches further. But to roll back the tape to more somber times. Marginalia Search went offline for almost a week due to some problems with the latest release. I won’t go into the details too much here, it was a string of fairly trivial scaling problems in a process with a run time of 1 day when it works well and 2-3 days when it doesn’t. Had to restart it a few times, mostly because it ran out of RAM. The cause of the outage was the fact that the system needs to go offline during an index switch in the first place. If it could have staid online while all this went on, nobody would have been the wiser… The reason for this is that the URL database is wiped during an upgrade. Inserting and updating rows in a database table rapidly approaching a billion rows is slow, and the processes involved in loading the new data uses a crap-ton of RAM and can’t co-run with the index service which does the same; and the primary key for the table is also a 32 bit integer so … you can’t really go beyond 2 billion in the first place. While the processes to get the system up and kicking again were ticking along, I had a moment to reflect on the problems, came up a plan to slay the dragons responsible for needing any sort of outage, while at the same time drastically reducing the system requirements. The First Dragon: The URL database. The URL database is one of the oldest components of the search engine and a lot of the design decisions that went into it made sense at the time, but that hasn’t been the case for years since. Everything about the system is alien to how it looked back when the tables were first drawn up. Migrating the data has been such a nasty prospect that it’s mostly been left to be as-is modulo some fairly small changes (ALTER TABLE … takes a few hours in prod). At the heart of the URL database is two tables that are only ever written to while loading a new index, and only ever read via primary key lookups. There’s an additional index keeping paths unique within domains, and it is just absurdly large for what it does. There’s a URL table mostly responsible for assigning an unique numeric ID to each URL, and a PAGE_DATA table, where each PAGE_DATA entry contains information such as the title and of a link, if we’ve indexed it. So what if we smack these two tables together into a single table sqlite database, keep the data real simple, make the loader process responsible for generating unique IDs, and have some other table for enumerating URLs we aren’t indexing… yeah that’s pretty doable. It’s an unconventional choice to mix sqlite and mariadb like this, but the two serve different needs. The system needs a persistent view of the world, but that view is relatively small, like sub 1 GB most likely, but also plug-and-play state changes (with state in the terabytes). It does fly in the face of every conventional wisdom, but has real benefits. So, something like this: We’re still softly relating the DOCUMENT and DOMAIN tables acoss databases, but we never actually need to join the two; in fact in a disaster scenario, the most important bits of the DOMAIN table can be re-constructed from the DOCUMENT table. I’m glossing over some details… Generate unique URL IDs with no index The URLs table was using 32 bit IDs, and it was always on the brink of integer rollover and a known scaling issue. Part of why the URL database is wiped is to keep the ID column from overflowing. This doesn’t really work if we want to generate unique IDs in a way that won’t require us to keep a collection of each URL we’ve seen in memory. URLs are sometimes repeated so we can’t just use a counter and increment each time. Each record also had a DOMAIN ID, but each URL only has a single domain. In the old solution there was a unique constraint on URL ID and DOMAIN ID. That’s not really desirable, as indices get very expensive for tables this large. So let’s construct a 64 bit ID instead of letting the database assign one for us. Say the lower 26 bits are an ordinal, bits 26-56 are a document ID, and the highest most bits are reserved for the index to do sorting tricks with. This permits about 67,000,000 documents per domain (~10x English Wikipedia), and 2 billion domains, which is nearly 100 times as many domains as the number of domains Marginalia has seen referenced anywhere on the web. Nice and future proof. We’re moving a lot of data sanity responsibility out of the database and into the process that generates the data, but they are a lot cheaper to enforce on that end so that’s a feature, if a bit unconventional. Unexpected Benefits So getting rid of all these humongous indices and large tables mixing hot and cold URL data means the MariaDB server doesn’t need 36 Gb of RAM anymore. The hot data left in MariaDB is a few hundred megabyteas at most, and the server most likely won’t need more than 2 Gb assigned to it. The SQLite data needs an index too, but only for its primary key, and the actual hot part of the index should be sub-gigabyte. It’s this much smaller because we’re indexing an order of magnitude less data, and the index is of a single 64 bit long. There is no additional unique constraint! Additionally, since the output from the loader is now just a bunch of files, it turned out to be pretty easy to create an automatic backup of these files. That means that in the case of a bad deployment, the system can recover from a disaster within a few hours as contrasted with almost a week like before. If I had stopped there, it would be a pretty sweet change, but I felt emboldened by the success and decided to turn to the other piece of ancient technical debt. The Second Dragon: Reverse index construction The previous changes mostly affected the loader. It outputs a urls database and a (document,words[])-oriented journal of document data. We need to transpose that data into something that is not only on the shape (word,documents[]), but then make it indexable. To help do this, a lexicon is used to map from keyword strings to a dense mapping of term ids. The first word you insert gets id 0, the next word id 1, etc. This is basically a long->int open hash map. The system maps from string to long using a 64 bit hash function. The problem with this is that it gets full. This is mostly a Java problem, since Java doesn’t permit arrays with more than 2 billion entries; and the implementation used chokes all the way back at 1 billion. You can work around it, but even if you do, the next problem is that at 1 billion entries, it uses 12 Gb of RAM. The index service sits at a well-endowed 60 Gb RAM in production right now, most of which is off-heap memory so it could do with going on a bit of a diet. It’s on-heap (i.e. within-JVM) size somewhat exceeds 32 Gb wich is especially unfortunate, as it prevents the use of CompressedOOPs, which is something you really want in Java. The old reverse index construction has, like the URLs table, been around for a hot minute. It’s mostly been around due to how unpleasant it is to work with. I was really struggling to find a good abstraction while I originally built it, and it’s been append only code since. It’s not made better by this inherently being very finicky programming. If anything is even the slightest bit off, everything falls apart in deeply inscrutable ways. Very loosely, the shape of the algorithm was something like this: highestWordId = findHighestWordId(); long[] counts = new long[highestWordId]; for each word in each document: counts[word]++; // offsets[i] = sum(counts, 0, i); long[] offsets = turnCountsToOffsets(counts); write offsets to file long[] documents = memory map max(offsets) longs in a file for each word in each document: documents[offsets[word]++] = document // draw the rest of the owl constructIndices(documents, offsetsfile) We need a lexicon because of this part. We’re relying on the domain of word ids to be densely packed. long[] counts = new long[highestWordId]; Other than requiring an absurd amount of RAM, there’s a subtle farther down in the code: for each word in each document: documents[offsets[word]++] = document This part writes about a terabyte of data out of order to a memory mapped file. Since it is almost completely out of order, most of these changes are constantly being committed to disk. You may have heard that SSDs deal with random access much better than mechanical hard drives. For read access this is largely true, for small writes it is not, due to an effect called write amplification. In brief, every time an SSD updates a single byte anywhere on disk, it needs to erase and re-write that entire page. To avoid this it has caches that gather adjacent writes into a single operation, but these caches aren’t terabyte sized, and do nothing in this scenario. So while we’re writing a terabyte, the hard drive is writing something like half a petabyte. This is understandably slow and puts an insane amount of wear on the disk. For a long time a stopgap has been in placed called a RandomWriteFunnel, which buckets the writes into smaller files first, and then writes the larger file in-order. This is very slow, but not as slow as spraying and praying like the original algorithm did. I’ve understood for a long time that this is not the civilized way of transposing index data. What you do instead is to create a series of smaller indexes where everything fits in memory, and then you merge them. Merging sorted lists is fast and even mechanical hard drives agree with the operation. Still a bit finicky though, especially since we’ll merge sorted lists of sorted lists that need merging. If you construct the index this way, you no longer need the lexicon! It’s possible to use the 64 bit string hashes for term ids instead! Initially a few head-scratchers cropped up: The input to the index construction is compressed. How can parts of it be read quickly? — Don’t. Create multiple smaller files instead, and read them one by one. What is a good way to merge indexes? — Don’t. Merge the data before the indexes are created. An abstraction called a preindex is introduced, which is basically what was constructed in the code sample above. Two arrays, one with wordIds, and one with counts; both indexing a third array with document data. index-reverse/…/ReversePreindex index-reverse/…/ReversePreindexDocuments index-reverse/…/ReversePreindexWordSegments Since the inputs are small, these preindexes are easy to construct as we can do most of it in RAM. It’s so much easier when you can do you can assume the data fits in RAM. We can then commit them to disk as we generate them, and add a subsequent merging step to construct one final preindex. The preindex is finally turned into the reverse index by adding static btree indices to the words table and each document block like before. This is a relatively quick process. This does not only require much less RAM since the lexicon is out, it’s also quite a bit faster than the original algorithm. But wait, there’s more! The lexicon had the unfortunate side-effect of giving each set of processed data its own dialect, a word might be given one ID in one run, but probably another ID in another run. This meant that you needed to process all data at the same time. Foregoing the lexicon, it’s possible to merge disparate sets of data, and e.g. reuse the output of processing a large set of seldom-changing data (say Wikipedia), and join it with more frequently changing index data. In closing This set of changes has been absurdly successful. The system RAM requirement has been halved, almost every single known scaling problem and operational paper cut has been addressed. It’s also had unexpected benefits I’ve only begun to consider. I wish I knew what happened, or how to replicate it. It’s involved more upfront design than I normally do, by necessity. I like feeling my way forward in general, but there are problems where the approach just doesn’t work. This is squarely within that domain. Sometimes you just tug at the right yarn I guess, and then problems unravel one by one.

For raw flash it’s not, provided you are overwriting “empty” all-ones values or otherwise only changing 1s to 0s. Writing is orders of magnitude slower than reading, but still a couple orders of magnitude faster than erasing (resetting back to “empty”), and only erases counts against your wear budget.

It&#x27;s because very few individual pieces of software nowadays are hitting any limits (in isolation). So each individual piece is terribly inefficient but with the latest M2 Pro and GiB connection you can just keep ahead of the curve where it becomes a problem.Anyways, turned into a rant; but the conclusion might be to limit yourself, and you (and e everyone else) will be better off long term. reply crote 3 hours agoparentIt is mostly a matter of priorities.For most applications it simply does not make any sense to spend this much time on relatively small optimizations. If you can choose to either buy 32GiB of RAM for your server for less than $50 or spend probably over 40 hours of developer time at at least $20 &#x2F; hour, it is quite obvious which one makes more sense from a business perspective. Not to mention that the website was offline for an entire week - that alone would&#x27;ve killed most businesses!A lot of tech people really like doing such deep dives and would happily spend years micro-optimizing even the most trivial code, but endless \"yak shaving\" isn&#x27;t going to pay any bills. When the code runs on a trivial number of machines, it probably just isn&#x27;t worth it. Not to mention that such optimizations often end up in code which is more difficult to maintain.In my opinion, a lot of \"software bloat\" we see these days for apps running on user machines comes from a mismatch between the developer machine and the user machine. The developer is often equipped with a high-end workstation as they simply need those resources to do their job, but they end up using the same machine to do basic testing. On the other hand, the user is running it on a five-year-old machine which was at best mid-range when they bought it.You can&#x27;t really sell \"we can save 150MB of memory\" to your manager, but you can sell \"saving 150MB of memory will make our app&#x27;s performance go from terrible to borderline for 10% of users\". reply vincnetas 3 hours agorootparentSo i guess that is the point GP is making. From practical perspective one would just spend 50$ on RAM and forget about it. But you miss opportunity to make something great in terms of algorithm improvements for example.

They only care that the service is offline for a week while the developer is having fun implementing their new toy algorithm.Working on improvements like this makes a lot of sense in academia, when you are running thousands of servers, or when you need so much memory that you can&#x27;t buy a big enough server. It&#x27;s a nice backlog item for when there is literally nothing else to do.I have definitely fallen into this rabbit hole myself. Solving difficult problems with clever solutions is a lot of fun!

What if it’s baggage that we didn’t need in the first place? reply marginalia_nu 1 hour agorootparentI say this having worked in the software business for coming on 15 years: I don&#x27;t think an organization where business is calling the shots would be capable of building an Internet search engine.The entire project a fractal of this type of business-inscrutable engineering, and in any organization where engineers aren&#x27;t calling the shots, that engineering isn&#x27;t going to get done, and the project is going to be hideously slow and expensive as a result.In a parallel universe where I had gone the classic startup route and started out using the biggest off-the-shelf pieces I could find, gluing them together with python (instead of building a bespoke index); then thrown VC money at hardware at when it started struggling; even more when it struggled again; I&#x27;d be absolutely dumbfounded when it yet again hit a brick wall and my hardware cost is tens of thousands every month (as opposed to $100&#x2F;mo now).Since I&#x27;ve instead built the solution from scratch, I&#x27;ve also built a deep understanding of both the domain and the solution, and when I&#x27;m faced with scaling problems, they&#x27;re solvable in software rather than hardware. I can just change how the software works until it does. It&#x27;s a slower route, but it&#x27;s also able to take you places where conventional-wisdom-driven-development does not. reply crote 10 minutes agorootparentprev> We sometimes get trapped in this belief that any form of performance improvement somehow costs us somethingBut it does always cost you something. Developer time isn&#x27;t free, after all.If we only cared about performance, we would be handwriting SIMD intrinsics for baremetal applications. But we don&#x27;t, because it is easily worth a 20% performance penalty to write code in a modern programming language. We&#x27;re willing to trade 10% performance for a well-tested framework and library ecosystem which greatly reduces development time. Nobody cares how efficient your application is when it never ships.Even \"bloated\" and \"slow\" do not always mean the same thing. Just look at something like database indexes: they take up space (bloated), but make your application faster. Often that&#x27;s a worthwhile tradeoff, but creating indexes for literally everything isn&#x27;t a good idea either. It is all about finding the right balance.I do agree that a lot of user-facing applications have gone way too far, though. Even completely trivial Android apps are 150MB+ binaries these days, and the widespread use of memory-hogging Electron tools is a bit worrying. When your app runs on millions of devices, you should care about resource usage! reply stavros 2 hours agorootparentprev> over 40 hours of developer time at at least $20I think maybe you dropped a zero. reply crote 47 minutes agorootparentI intentionally underestimated the cost to provide a lower bound.In reality the listed changes once you consider all team members are likely going to run closer to 80-120 hours at $150 &#x2F; hour - but that only confirms the final conclusion. reply stavros 46 minutes agorootparentAgreed, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to add some cheap hardware rather than spend two orders of magnitude more to fix the inefficient code. reply pjerem 3 hours agoparentprevOh yes !

These questions tend to come much later when profit needs to be ironed out. reply tkgally 4 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;m wondering if humans are mostly incapable of producing great things without (artifical) restrictions.Here is an opinion to support your hypothesis from a couple of different domains: poetry and music.While some people prefer free verse and avante-garde music, what stays most in my mind, and what seems to endure longest overall, are poetry with regular rhyme and meter and music that follows standard patterns of melody, rhythm, and harmony. Having to force their creativity into those sometimes rigid frameworks seems to enable many artists to produce better works. reply nottheengineer 4 hours agorootparentMaybe a counterexample to it, not sure if it can be applied:I write software in ABAP, which is a weird and ridiculously complicated language that has inline SQL and type checking against the database and has never had a major version that breaks old stuff, so code from 30 years ago will (and does) still run.I used to have fun working around the quirks of it and finding solutions that work within the limitations, but now I&#x27;m just frustrated by having to solve problems that haven&#x27;t been around for the past 15 years in the rest of world and looking at terrible code that can&#x27;t be made any nicer because of those limitations or because customers don&#x27;t give a shit as long as it works most of the time. reply cglee 4 hours agoparentprevInteresting observation and aligns with my experience of really enjoying small focused tools and apps. This website is a good example.Further, it feels like there&#x27;s a corollary here to companies, where financially constrained companies who are smaller and more focused provide better customer experience than cash-flush competitors. reply globular-toast 10 minutes agoparentprevIt would probably help if the whole \"developer spec\" thing would go away. I never understood why people think they need 32GB of RAM and top of the line CPU to write code. If you&#x27;re compiling a lot (especially C++ I guess) then you need a build server. I wonder how much better things would be if \"developer spec\" actually meant something close to median or representative spec. reply uoaei 1 hour agoparentprevI completely agree. Every creative I&#x27;ve ever trusted has the same philosophy: freedom through constraints. I&#x27;ve found in my life, too, I can focus more closely on elegant solutions when they become (perhaps artificially) necessary, not merely aesthetically pleasing. I&#x27;m actually having a similar experience of insane efficiency improvements in a personal project, much smaller in scope, that came down to using bit operations and as-branchless-as-possible methods for an Arduino Nano. reply isaacremuant 2 hours agoparentprevWithout going about efficiency and priorities. I think it&#x27;s easy enough to claim that a great way to spark creativity or great solutions is putting constraints.It&#x27;s about specialization around the usage of few elements to achieve a goal vs a paradox of choice or going through common and known patterns.Jams can be great for this and people realize they can work so much more efficiently and focus on the core of their idea. reply nicbou 5 hours agoprevI always love seeing marginalia.nu updates here.

I can&#x27;t really see why people argue for databases which have the \"relationality\" feature deliberately removed. reply jaggederest 1 hour agorootparentprevMaybe I&#x27;m old school but I would just stuff that kind of data in a struct. It should be real, real small as a packed binary tree. just mmap the file and be there. If you&#x27;re never writing to it, or only write to it via filesystem full-file overwrites, you can lay it out most conveniently in memory. We did a similar thing with the sparse matrix data for the Netflix prize back in the day - in a database it was 6gb, in C structs it was ~600mb.Of course I do respect the encapsulation of the existing SQL query basis but there is sometimes a time for something even more compact. reply marginalia_nu 1 hour agorootparentYeah tempting for sure. I tried to resist it on the basis that I already have a bunch of similar solutions in the system, and while they&#x27;re fast and effective, they&#x27;re also always a bit of a headache to maintain and debug; and this isn&#x27;t something that is extremely space constrained. reply janvdberg 5 hours agoprevI love this as another example where restriction breeds innovation.

These are semi-rough notes that I basically wrote for myself in case I ever needed to revisit this fix, so keep that in mind. I recently bought an LG ULTRAGEAR monitor secondhand off of a coworker. I really love it and it's been great so far, but I ran into some minor issues with it in Linux. It works great on both Mac and Windows, but on Linux it displays just a black panel until I use the second monitor to go in and reduce the refresh rate down to 60 Hz. This has worked decent so far but there's some issues: It doesn't work while linux is booting up. The motherboards boot sequence is visible just fine, but as soon as control is handed over to Linux and I'd normally see a splash screen while I'm waiting for my login window, I see nothing. It doesn't work on the login screen. This would be fine if login consistently worked on my second screen, but I need to manually switch the cables between my work computer and the desktop for the second screen and sometimes I don't feel like doing that. Even when I switch the cables, the second screen seems to be moody and doesn't always show the login screen either. Once I've logged in and fixed the settings on my second screen it seems to go fine, unless I actually unplug the second screen. If I do, it looks like the graphics settings go reset back to default (settings that don't work) and I lose the main monitor too. Debugging Since I was able to fix the issue by manually reducing the refresh rate, my guess is that the issue is really about Linux insisting on defaulting the monitor to a mode that it doesn't support: 3440 x 1440 143.923 Hz. I started looking online to do some research and I found a lot of articles and forum posts about how to sync up your logged-in display preferences with your boot sequence preferences & your greeter preferences, but that was mostly around fixing resolution, position, and orientation of monitors and it only worked for specific monitor connections. In my case, it wasn't so much about the positioning of the monitors, the default mode that my monitor seemed to want to be in just didn't seem to work at all. Regardless, I tried the suggestions around creating an xrandr script and having it run when the greeter starts, but it seems that my monitor didn't care and the xrandr script wasn't doing anything at all. I also tried updating my version of Linux Mint and my Linux kernel to the latest versions, neither of those solved the issue. Since this monitor did work out of the box when hooked up to the Macbook or when I boot this computer into Windows, I knew it was possible for this monitor to work properly. EDID I landed on the arch wiki for xrandr, xorg, and kernel mode setting and started to get the idea that my monitor was possibly reporting the wrong mode to the OS. This eventually lead me to this mailing list post which had me start to look closer at the EDID.

Actually the only place where I saw the mode that Linux Mint was defaulting to was in that last block: Block 2, DisplayID Extension Block: ... DTD: 3440x1440 143.923 Hz 64:27 217.323 kHz 799.750 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred) My hypothesis now was that if there was some way for me to change the EDID so that that last block had 60 Hz instead of 143.923 Hz, that could fix everything. I started by trying to read the specs for EDID and DisplayID. Ultimately these were helpful to have on the side, but actually reading and understanding the details of every byte was beginning to confuse me and was starting to take me too long. I started thinking about a faster way to grok this bytestring when I realized there was a program I just used that was really great at parsing edids: edid-decode. Edid-Decode I found the git repo and cloned it locally. Thankfully, the build instructions were super easy, just one make later and I had a development build of parse-edid on disk. git clone git://linuxtv.org/edid-decode.git cd edid-decode make ./edid-decode /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/drm/card0/card0-DP-2/edid Looking at the output, I wanted to hone in on that DisplayID Extension Block section. I popped the source open in VSCode and started searching around. DisplayID Extension Block shows up as a constant in the block_name function, so looking at usages of that brought me to edid_state::parse_extension. This clearly was a DisplayID block, so I clicked into parse_displayid_block. At this point I wanted to orient myself a bit. The function was using things like x[1] and x[2] but I knew we weren't thinking about the second and third bytes of the whole EDID. I added a print statement to print out the first 5 bytes of x, just so that I could compare with my hex editor and see where we were. printf(\"-- %x %x %x %x %x\", x[0], x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]); This gave us 70 12 79 00 00 and I could find where that sequence was in my hex editor. In fact, I could also see that the variable assignments lined up with the structure table in the DisplayID Wikipedia page (version, length, prod_type, ext_count). Continuing to trace the code, we moved the pointer forward by 5 and then jumped into edid_state::displayid_block. We know that the next byte tag is 0x03 which matches the fact that Video Timing Modes Type 1 - Detailed Timings Data Block is the next section that's printed out. Later down the function, there's a function call to edid_state::parse_displayid_type_1_7_timing that we enter and this is where the code starts to get exciting. Actually, the start of the function isn't that bad, but scroll down halfway and you'll find this: t.hact = 1 + (x[4](x[5] > 7) & 0x1) t.pos_pol_hsync = true; t.vact = 1 + (x[12](x[13] > 7) & 0x1) t.pos_pol_vsync = true; if (x[3] & 0x10) { t.interlaced = true; t.vfp /= 2; t.vsync /= 2; t.vbp /= 2; } Oh no, there's no way I'm going to be able to figure out all this byte manipulation in my head. I probably don't need to care about most of this just to figure out how to fix the refresh rate, and I wish there was a way I could just see what all these values get set to in the end. Actually debugging now I don't do much C or C++ development, but I've used gdb in the past for schoolwork and a really great capture the flag I did once. I probably can remember enough about it to get some useful info out. First I worked to try and get debug symbols enabled. Turns out this Makefile already has debug symbols turned on, so that wasn't actually necessary. If you ever do need to turn on debug symbols, the flag to remember is -g for the compiler although in this Makefile I just tossed it onto the WARN_FLAGS variable since I didn't see an obvious other place for it. I fired up gdb ./edid-decode did some quick googling to figure out that setting a breakpoint is break filename.cpp:line-number and running with arguments is run arg1 arg2 and I landed in the right place. Breakpoint 1, edid_state::parse_displayid_type_1_7_timing (this=0x5555555b3940 , x=0x5555555b4408\"f8\\001\\206o\", , type7=false, block_rev=1, is_cta=false) at parse-displayid-block.cpp:368 368print_timings(\" \", &t, name.c_str(), s.c_str(), true); (gdb) Ok, we just got through that wild bit where we set up t. I'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting since a C struct is just a bunch of bytes, but lets try to print it out: (gdb) p t $1 = {hact = 3440, vact = 1440, hratio = 64, vratio = 27, pixclk_khz = 799750, rb = 0, interlaced = false, hfp = 48, hsync = 32, hbp = 160, pos_pol_hsync = true, vfp = 3, vsync = 10, vbp = 57, pos_pol_vsync = false, hborder = 0, vborder = 0, even_vtotal = false, no_pol_vsync = false, hsize_mm = 0, vsize_mm = 0, ycbcr420 = false} Oh wow, that's a lot more readable than I expected. I guess debug symbols go a long way! Some of these values I recognize (3440 and 1440 are the resolution), but I'm not seeing the one most important value I need to fix: the refresh rate of 143.923. Let's step forward and see if we can figure out how that's calculated: (gdb) n DTD: 3440x1440 143.922761 Hz 64:27 217.323 kHz 799.750000 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred) Hfront 48 Hsync 32 Hback 160 Hpol P Vfront 3 Vsync 10 Vback 57 Vpol N 369if (is_cta) { (gdb) Oops, we went way too far, all the calculations for the refresh rate just got done without us. I had to go look up the difference between s and n and realized that I stepped over all the interesting stuff (n = next line, s = step into). Well at least we know the interesting stuff is inside the print_timings function. Back in my editor, we go looking and we find another relatively dense function. At this point, I'm looking for other strategies to take shortcuts and I realize that there's a Hz right after the refresh rate. I do a quick search and I find this printf: printf(\"%s%s: %5ux%-5s %10.6f Hz %3u:%-3u %8.3f kHz %13.6f MHz%s\\n\", prefix, type, t->hact, buf, refresh, t->hratio, t->vratio, out_hor_freq_khz, pixclk / 1000000.0, s.c_str()); That actually makes things a lot clearer. We're really looking at where the refresh variable is set. The definition for that is a bit like this: double refresh = t->pixclk_khz * 1000.0 / (htotal * vtotal); if (options[OptNTSC] && fmod(refresh, 6.0) == 0) { refresh *= ntsc_fact; } Ah, so that pixclk_khz from the struct earlier is actually pretty key. Let me try to see if I do that math, do I get the same number? 799750 ⋅ 1000 3440 ⋅ 1440 = 161.44 … What if we add in ntsc_fact which is 1000.0 / 1001.0 799750 ⋅ 1000 3440 ⋅ 1440 ⋅ 1000 1001 = 161.28 … Huh, 161 is close to 143, but neither of these are quite right. I must be missing something. After a lot of searching, it turned out that htotal and vtotal aren't just the resolution as I had first assumed. Here's the relevant bits, with comments added based on what stuff ended up evaluating out to: if (t->interlaced) // false vact /= 2; unsigned hbl = t->hfp + t->hsync + t->hbp + 2 * t->hborder; // 240 unsigned vbl = t->vfp + t->vsync + t->vbp + 2 * t->vborder; // 70 unsigned htotal = t->hact + hbl; // 3680 double vtotal = vact + vbl; // 1510 if (t->even_vtotal) // false vtotal = vact + t->vfp + t->vsync + t->vbp; else if (t->interlaced) // false vtotal = vact + t->vfp + t->vsync + t->vbp + 0.5; Ok, trying our math again: 799750 ⋅ 1000 3680 ⋅ 1510 = 143.922 … There we go! Finally, we understand roughly how that refresh rate that Linux Mint was erroneously using was being derived. Now let's see what we can do to fix things. Working backwards At this point, we're trying to work backwards from the end result we want to figure out what bytes need to be updated in the EDID. First, we want that fraction to evaluate out to 60 instead, and we don't want to muck with either of the resolution values. That basically means we should change the pixclk_khz value: 𝑥 ⋅ 1000 3680 ⋅ 1510 = 60 This is really easy math, but I already have the whole thing plugged into WolframAlpha so it's easy to just change that to an x and set the whole thing equal to 60: 𝑥 = 333408 Computers are great, aren't they? Ok, so we need t->pixclk_khz to be 333408. Where does that get set? // edid_state::parse_displayid_type_1_7_timing // type7 = false t.pixclk_khz = (type7 ? 1 : 10) * (1 + (x[0] + (x[1] << 8) + (x[2] << 16))); It took me a bit longer than I'd like to admit to realize that this is really just 10 times 1 plus the first 3 bytes of the DisplayID section payload in little endian (look, I don't work with bit manipulation that often). Those bytes in decimal are 102, 56, and 1 so let's double check our understanding 10 ⋅ ( 1 + 102 + 56 ⋅ 2 8 + 1 ⋅ 2 16 ) = 799750 Great, that was the value for pixclk_khz that our debugger showed us earlier. So if we want that to instead be 333408, what are the values we need for those three bytes? 10 ⋅ ( 1 + 𝑥 0 + 𝑥 1 ⋅ 2 8 + 𝑥 2 ⋅ 2 16 ) = 333408 Rearranging a bit: 𝑥 0 + 𝑥 1 ⋅ 2 8 + 𝑥 2 ⋅ 2 16 = 33339.8 It looks like we're gonna have to add a bit of imprecision since we're working with whole numbers here. I'm not entirely sure how this is typically handled, but lets just round up to 33340 and hope that nothing blows up. There's lots of ways to solve this, but at the core it's a base change to base 8. I like to do this with division and remainders. To get the most significant digit 𝑥 2 we divide our number by the value of that place and look at the whole number. 33340 2 16 = 0.5 It turns out 33340 < 2 16 so 𝑥 2 is 0. Since it's zero, we use the same number with the next place value: 33340 2 8 = 130.234375 So we know that 𝑥 1 needs to be 130. We can look at the remainder there by multiplying just the decimals by the place value: 0.234375 ∗ 2 8 = 60 and we've already made it to our 1s place so 𝑥 0 just needs to be 60. 60 + 130 ⋅ 2 8 + 0 ⋅ 2 16 = 33340 Making the change We've got our new 3 bytes, so let's use a hex editor to fix the file. 60 130 0 is 0x3c 0x82 0x00 in hex, so we go in and update the first line of our 3rd EDID block: -70 12 79 00 00 03 01 14 **66 38 01** 86 6f 0d ef 00 +70 12 79 00 00 03 01 14 **3c 82 00** 86 6f 0d ef 00 Let's save and run edid-decode on the new file. Hopefully it agrees with the change that we made. Block 2, DisplayID Extension Block: Version: 1.2 Extension Count: 0 Display Product Type: Extension Section Video Timing Modes Type 1 - Detailed Timings Data Block: DTD: 3440x1440 60.000 Hz 64:27 90.601 kHz 333.410 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred) Hfront 48 Hsync 32 Hback 160 Hpol P Vfront 3 Vsync 10 Vback 57 Vpol N Checksum: 0x0b (should be 0xec) Checksum: 0x90 (should be 0x71) I do not have the language to explain how excited I was when I saw that 60.000 Hz in the output! You will have to trust me when I tell you I shouted in excitement! One slight issue which probably isn't a big deal, but I'm going to fix it anyways: those checksums are off since we modified the file. I think fixing this with math wouldn't be that difficult (based on the spec, the checksums should be chosen such that the sum of all the bytes in the section modulo 256 is 0), but edid-decode was so kind as to just tell us what they should be, so we can just go and update those lines in the file directly: -00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0B 90 +00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 EC 71 Just a quick check to make sure: Block 2, DisplayID Extension Block: Version: 1.2 Extension Count: 0 Display Product Type: Extension Section Video Timing Modes Type 1 - Detailed Timings Data Block: DTD: 3440x1440 60.000 Hz 64:27 90.601 kHz 333.410 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred) Hfront 48 Hsync 32 Hback 160 Hpol P Vfront 3 Vsync 10 Vback 57 Vpol N Checksum: 0xec Checksum: 0x71 (should be 0x90) Doh! The checksum for Block 2 is part of the bytes considered for the overall checksum, so by fixing it we've caused issues for the final checksum. No matter, we can fix that real quick: -00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 EC 71 +00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 EC 90 Astute readers might notice that the final checksum changed back to 90 just now. This is an interesting artifact of the way that the checksum for EDID works, where all the bytes of a section must be congruent to 0 mod 256. When we fixed the checksum for Block 2, we made the sum of that whole section (including our only changes) cancel out to 0, just like it must have done before for the checksums to be valid. The moment of truth At this point, we've got a valid updated EDID which seems to pass the parse test for edid-decode. The real question is if this EDID would work for the monitor or not. Fortunately, it seems that there's a way to force the Linux kernel to ignore the EDID that the monitor self reports and override it with a custom firmware (very convenient for this very situation). Very briefly, the steps seem to be: Copy the new firmware to /usr/lib/firmware (call it desktop_edid.bin for compatibility with the scripts below) Create this file: /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/desktop_edid.sh #!/bin/sh # Copy local EDID monitor description data PREREQ=\"\" prereqs() { echo \"$PREREQ\" } case $1 in prereqs) prereqs exit 0 ;; esac . /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hook-functions EDID_DATA=\"/usr/lib/firmware/desktop_edid.bin\" if [ ! -f \"$EDID_DATA\" ]; then exit 0 fi add_firmware \"$(basename $EDID_DATA)\" exit 0 Make it executable: sudo chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/desktop_edid.sh Rebuild your initramfs: sudo update-initramfs -u -v If all goes well, you should see a log line about copying firmware desktop_edid.bin. This means that when you next reboot, you can force the kernel to use that firmware. Let's do a quick test first before making any permanent changes: Reboot When you get to grub, use e to edit the boot configuration for the current boot Find the linux line which should have something like quiet splash at the end of it. Update that line to instead end in quiet splash drm.edid_firmware=desktop_edid.bin Press F10 and boot! After all this I saw a sight I've never seen before. The loading spinner for Linux Mint was showing up on my new monitor. A few seconds later, I was greeted with an even more impressive sight: the login screen popped open on the new monitor. To be honest, I wasn't sure that I believed it would work from the start, but I'm amazed that it actually worked in the end. Follow ups: One issue is that now my second monitor isn't displaying anything. When I go into Display Settings, it seems like my computer thinks that both monitors are sending this EDID so it's put the second monitor into the wrong mode. There is a way to override the firmware for only one connector according to the Arch wiki: drm.edid_firmware=VGA-1:edid/your_edid.bin so I'm going to need to explore that a bit. Once I get it working, I'll update the grub files for real and make it permanent. One last thing I might consider doing at some point would be to try to overwrite the EDID on the monitor itself. I'd probably want to confirm that my changes are 100% safe and correct before doing this, but that would mean that my system doesn't need any special configuration for this monitor. Any Linux laptop that I plug it into or any port that I plug it into should just work. I've found docs on this online, but it's pretty risky because if I write a bad EDID I can brick the monitor, and if I do the process wrong it sounds like I could actually brick any of the components in my computer... not good!

I've never used one, but maybe it would help you in your situation: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/ That page links to a few different EDID boxes. nyanpasu64 commented I can confirm on my machine that overriding EDID for a specific connector using drm.edid_firmware=DP-2:edid/your_edid.bin works as expected. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_mode_setting#Forcing_modes_and_EDID says that you can do it for multiple connectors using commas to separate values, though I have not tried. Though one gotcha is that on my RX 570, ls -ld /sys/class/drm/*/edid prints HDMI-A-1 and -2, which is also the name of the display outputs on Wayland, but on X11 xrandr identifies these outputs as HDMI-1 and HDMI-2. (I think you have to use HDMI-A-1 in the kernel command line, but I have not tried.) Other people have commented: I'm wondering if the real issue is the user doesn't have a DisplayPort 1.4 supporting cable or equipment. The speeds, color (10bit) and the resolution suggest to me that could be the real problem. I doubt the monitor would intentionally ship with such out of spec edid, especially since the monitor claims support from 48Hz to 144hz, likely for variable refresh rate. Well… this monitor and its EDID are actually correct. The monitor supports 3440x1440 @ 144hz and in the EDID it’s setting that mode as preferred. I checked online and LG market the monitor with those specs, so it’s not an error. It would probably have been easier to flip the bit in the EDID that says the 60hz rate is preferred rather than messing about with the timings - since there is a perfectly good 60hz timing in the EDID. To me (without any other evidence presented or investigation on my part) this is more an issue with the graphics card driver on Linux than an issue with LG. cingozce commented exciting experience bro , congratulations :)) dreamlayers commented In the past I've used https://github.com/akatrevorjay/edid-generator to create EDID with a custom mode based on an X modeline. This would force Linux to use that mode. Though that program can create invalid EDID in case of overflow, and probably couldn't handle such a high resolution. The EDID only needs to be in initramfs if you use early KMS, Typically, early KMS is not done, so this is not necessary. repentsinner commented Does this not work with your EDID? https://www.analogway.com/emea/products/software-tools/aw-edid-editor/ Sign up for free to join this conversation on GitHub.

Usually there&#x27;s a service menu hidden somewhere you can enable so that the EDID EEPROM becomes writable. That doesn&#x27;t seem to work in my case, so I ended up opening the monitor and hard wired the write enable pin. This happens so often (it&#x27;s an old monitor I got for free) I drilled a hole and put a switch on the pin lol. reply nyanpasu64 12 hours agoparentprevWhy doesn&#x27;t macOS use the ports that monitors are connected to, to determine their layout (only treating a monitor as having moved if its port&#x27;s EDID doesn&#x27;t match the EDID in that port from before sleeping)? reply xoa 11 hours agorootparentAlmost certainly the most common use case for multiple screens on Macs at this point is notebooks connected to an external monitor, some of the time. On modern Macbooks it&#x27;s mostly all just Thunderbolt ports too, which are supposed to be interchangeable, people can plug in whatever wherever without thinking about. People may also run a monitor via a TB dock, which again may plug in wherever. Though even with desktops in general, tying meatspace spatial information to port plugin fundamentally seems like a bad idea. Physical screens are much less likely to be moved then a cable, and the number of people who&#x27;d prefer to be able to treat the same type of port as functionally identical vs those who want that mental overhead seems low. reply namibj 7 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a poor excuse for shuffling screens that, like rather many (so not a rare bug), don&#x27;t have unique serial numbers in their EDIDs, just because the user folded the laptop to sleep, and unfolded it the next day after breakfast to continue working&#x2F;using.Resolving assignments of cloned screens in the absence of physical-plugging-involving hotplug (that thus only comes from the monitor(s) also turning off when the laptop goes to sleep) by random instead of remembering physical ports&#x2F;paths to them, across sometime as tame as a suspend-to-RAM, is frankly terrible UX.Trying to use uniqueness features to be sticky across port swaps is good.... but I&#x27;d not be surprised if my grandparents would actually assume the way to swap them is by swapping the ports they are plugged into. Especially I&#x27;d expect them to be confused&#x2F;surprised by swapping the plugs _not_ resulting in swapped content. reply seb1204 4 hours agorootparentDocks with numbered ports make me want to have all things aligned. First monitor left to right needs to connect to port 1 and have number 1 in the system. I know this is not required but feels untidy if not done. replynumpad0 16 hours agoprevApparently there are $5-15 EDID \"emulator\" devices that are just an HDMI passthrough adapter with a fake EDID ROM that always reports common modes as 4K60&#x2F;2K60&#x2F;VGA. Apparent purpose is to get PS5 to work with quirky 4K TVs. A similar device called HDMI \"dummy plug\" allows GPU acceleration on quirky PCs without having a display, but the latter has no passthrough port at the back.If that&#x27;s all the author needs, that might be the path of least resistance. reply thomastjeffery 15 hours agoparentMy favorite use case is Looking Glass.Want to play video games that only run in Windows, but don&#x27;t want to leave Linux? You can run Windows in a virtual machine and \"passthrough\" your GPU&#x27;s PCIe slot. The advantage is that Windows can get the full performance of your GPU. The disadvantage is that it took the whole GPU away from your Linux host, along with whatever display it&#x27;s attached to. You can use a second GPU for your Linux host (i.e. your integrated CPU one), but that needs its own physical display.You can use Looking Glass to copy the framebuffer from your Windows guest so that you can redraw it on your Linux host. That way you can have your Windows guest in a window, and never have to leave your Linux desktop again. The big caveat is that your Windows guest needs a valid display connected, or it will never draw any frames to begin with. You can plug in a spare monitor that you never actually look at, or you can spoof one. reply nullwarp 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll add that this setup works great, ran it for a good couple of years before finally dropping it (not for any looking glass reasons, eventually just didn&#x27;t need it anymore with proton).Also loved that it integrated so well into OBS directly to stream from! reply Cloudef 3 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty cool, of course the need for this kind of setup has become pretty rare as proton runs pretty much everything nowadays (apart from those pesky anti-cheat games). reply Roark66 4 hours agorootparentprevSo this is what those non-pass through \"displayport edid emulators\" are for! reply cevn 13 hours agorootparentprevWow this is so cool… might have to try it!! The real hacker news is in the comments! reply hsbauauvhabzb 10 hours agorootparentprevCan you commit that to the looking glass readme.md - having skimmed their GitHub, it was unclear what it actually did.Out of curiosity, what is the performance like? Presumably good for desktop use, but how about fps sensitive games? reply namibj 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d expect vsync-to-host to be the default, though something more like triple buffering should also work (with the host atomically grabbing the latest completed buffer to compose just-in-time for composing to finish before the RAMDAC starts the first line... so roughly grabbing at the start of blank, spending vblank compositing, and no tearing after vblank).So in total, on the order of a millisecond additional latency if you pass vsync timing alignment down, and no variable refresh rate.But the latter is barely compatible with compositing in general. All techniques for handling a VFR video stream in a window should also apply to the uncompressed&#x2F;shared memory looking glass stream. reply davkan 7 hours agorootparentprevLatency is like a couple milliseconds i believe. Looking glass uses shared memory between the host and guest for the framebuffer. reply Dalewyn 7 hours agorootparentprevGenuine question, but are multiple inputs on the monitor not a consideration for your scenario? Or are multiple inputs on a single monitor unsuitable for this purpose? reply davkan 7 hours agorootparentMultiple inputs works fine with gpu pass through, but regularly switching monitor inputs is honestly a pain depending on your monitor. Its like a 10 second process for my monitor.Also people running a setup like this are using the Linux host as their main desktop. If you only have one monitor and are switching inputs you lose your whole workflow on Linux host when using the vm.

For example, say 0.5% of monitors out there have dodgy edid values like this. For a commercial OS, that&#x27;s a lot of unhappy people, many of whom have social media accounts, so \"When displaying a new resolution, always start at max(60Hz, lowest available refresh rate) so if something&#x27;s wrong people can at least see what&#x27;s going on\" might be a good rule of thumb for a commercial OS.For Linux, however, the equivalent might be \"report the bug so an exception can be made for this specific monitor\".

In the meantime perhaps Win&#x2F;Mac continue to look at the classic EDID data, and if they do, it likely gets less test coverage from manufacturers.Pure speculation.Edit: From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows-hardware&#x2F;design&#x2F;co...> Windows does not support DisplayID 1.x blocks, and always ignores them.No explanation is given.The LG display sends a DisplayID 1.2 block. reply nyanpasu64 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s odd, I was definitely able to add a DisplayID 1.3 extension block (128 extra bytes appended) to a CRT monitor&#x27;s 128-byte EDID data using CRU, then have Windows 11 see those extra resolutions (when the CRT was plugged into a DP-to-VGA adapter). Though I ended up switching to CTA-861 (HDMI extension blocks) with all the HDMI YCbCr&#x2F;audio nonsense turned off, because 010Editor and edid2json could understand CTA-861 but not DisplayID (though I learned from this article that git:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxtv.org&#x2F;edid-decode.git, or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.linuxtv.org&#x2F;edid-decode.git, has better support for EDID standards than the other tools).Another oddity is that when I run edid-decode on the DisplayID 1.3 file created by CRU, edid-decode reports the block as \"Version: 1.2\" instead.

The display port would advertise binary garbage for the EDID that wouldn&#x27;t checksum, so no OS would try and use it. AOC registered some \"drivers\" with Windows, so it would automatically download and apply a patch that would make that port usable, but they also included a CD with the stuff on it.However they patched this on the Windows side was quite fragile, because it kept breaking after OS updates.

The monitor is advertising Freesync&#x2F;GSync variable refresh rate. The Ultragear monitors are high end gaming monitors so they come with 48-240Hz VRR on some monitors. That’s the 48-144hz extension in the EDID of this monitor.Based on debugging some issues I was having in macOS, I discovered from various Reddit and forums that Linux doesn’t handle that well depending on your driver stack&#x2F;how you connect. If you’re on very modern hardware, kernels, and the OEM drivers it’s a better situation. macOS also has partially broken support for Freesync (or ProMotion as Apple brands it) at the moment on Intel machines.I have an Asus GSync monitor with 48-144hz compatibility. This works over DisplayPort on my M2 Pro MacBook. On my RX6800 equipped Intel Mac I get 100Hz over DisplayPort 1.4 and 120Hz over HDMI 2.0 due to a DSC bug affecting Intel Macs. Even without that bug, 120Hz sometimes presents the OP’s issues between startup and login so I use 100Hz. The betas for the next macOS apparently fix this.Either way, it’s a fun patch reply teawrecks 14 hours agorootparentprevWe don&#x27;t know that though. The fact that it presumably works everywhere except Linux makes me think there&#x27;s still a bug in that `edid-decode` path.And as far as I can tell from the article, OP just assumed the display supported 60hz because it happened to show an image when they set it to that. reply whalesalad 17 hours agoparentprevFunny...

Chances are, even over HDMI, it’s using YPbPr. Every mac I’ve ever used (20 or more over the past 10 years), and every Dell monitor (at least 5), the mac is sending the the display signal as YPbPr instead of RGB. Just Google, “Macos Dell YPbPr” and you can find complaints going back 10+ years.I get a lot of computers to use for a brief period of time (consultant), and fixing that on Macbooks every couple months is non-trivial.

The CTA-861 (HDMI metadata) block contains a mode \"3440x1440 99.990 Hz\", or 1440p100 with a pixel clock of 543.5 MHz. I don&#x27;t know if this 100hz mode functions on Windows or not. The DIsplayID block instead contains a 144hz mode with a pixel clock of 799.750 MHz. Both of these modes may be within DisplayPort bandwidth limits or not, depending on the link rate and bits per pixel (this EDID says \"Bits per primary color channel: 10\"), and may also be supported by the display or not.I do know that Linux X11 (amdgpu kernel driver, modesetting X11 driver) tends to drive my DVI 1080p display with too high of a pixel clock (too large blanking intervals) when connected over a HDMI-to-DVI cable from my GPU. I believe this is because there&#x27;s actually a duplication of mode selection logic between the amdgpu kernel driver and X11.

I have two LG monitors and they both have weird quirks.On the first one (a 34\" ultrawide), all of its inputs lose connection for a moment whenever it wakes from standby (including the USB ports, making them useless for external drives). This also has the effect of causing my computer to occasionally lock up on resume from hibernation unless I tap the power button on the monitor before I wake the system. Additionally, at refresh rates above 60Hz the gamma gets progressively lower making the image darker the higher you go, even though the gamma setting in its menu is exactly the same, and black frame insertion and game mode are both off. Others online have reported the same thing.The other monitor I got second-hand and it mostly works. It has a horrid HDR implemenation however that just washes out everything. I also tried to use brightness and input control via DDC&#x2F;CI, which is a fairly well known standard, but this causes it to shut off abruptly and I have to unplug the power cord it to get it back. reply sotix 12 hours agoparent> This also has the effect of causing my computer to occasionally lock up on resume from hibernation unless I tap the power button on the monitor before I wake the system.Wow you just off-handedly resolved an issue I’ve been dealing with for months on my Linux desktop. I lost an hour of Baldur’s Gate progress the other night after this happened after I hadn’t saved the game. Thank you!Your fix also resolves a similar issue I have on the Mac side when using my work laptop. If I tap the keyboard to resume from sleep, my LG monitor wakes up but doesn’t display an image. I have to wait for it to go through the motions until it finally displays “no input” before tapping on my keyboard to make it display the lock screen. Meanwhile, my second monitor works from the get go.I somehow never thought to hit the power button first. I wish there were a way to make the LG monitor work like my other one and not have to do that. reply fellerts 17 hours agoprevI was expecting a tale of how the author managed to overwrite whatever part of the monitor&#x27;s firmware was responsible for spitting out the EDID. While interesting, the title is a bit misleading: it&#x27;s an ugly but effective hack to inject a custom EDID. reply Arnavion 17 hours agoparentI wouldn&#x27;t really call it \"an ugly hack\" since the kernel has had this procedure (to load EDID overrides from &#x2F;lib&#x2F;firmware) since forever.

So it may be possible to just re-program it. I don&#x27;t know what they do on newer monitors, it could just be something listening to the I2C in the HDMI connector and pretending to be an EEPROM. reply jauntywundrkind 17 hours agorootparentprevAnd the author downloaded the monitor&#x27;s edid & bitwrenched it around to make their hack.I definitely had the same expectation, & was most way through reading, expecting my expectation wasnt going to be mentioned, but I was far from upset. I was quite happy to hear there&#x27;s kernel workarounds for exactly this kind of thing.The main shortcoming I feel right now is that this only works if you only have one specific monitor you want to hack, or you are ok rebooting. If the kernel had some way to dynamically override the edid that would be excellent. Maybe a eBPF filter? reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agoprevI have two identical ASUS 1920x1200 monitors.

The monitor is exposing a bad ID in its configuration block. Monitor says \"I support 140Hz at 4k\", so Linux (strictly the kernel framebuffer driver in use) says \"OK then, that&#x27;s the best one, give me that\". And it doesn&#x27;t work, because the Monitor lied.And the reason it works on Windows or (sometimes) MacOS is just that those systems have arbitrarily different default choices (e.g. \"see if it has 60 Hz and use that\"). And it happens to work with Windows because the monitor manufacturer bothered to test with windows (and, sometimes, MacOS), where they didn&#x27;t with Linux.This happens everywhere in the tech industry. No one does QA to the standards. It&#x27;s 100% routine to see devices with PCI capabilities advertised that don&#x27;t work, to see phantom ACPI entries for hardware that doesn&#x27;t exist, to see EFI BIOSes exposing function tables for capabilities that never worked and weren&#x27;t tested, USB devices which advertise a standard class but which only work with a proprietary driver, etc...And the only reason anything works anywhere is that, at the end of the day, they plug it in and test. And on Linux they don&#x27;t. reply DrammBA 7 hours agorootparentOP is using an LG Ultragear gaming monitor which support the preferred resolution reported in the EDID \"3440x1440 143.923 Hz\", so this definitely has something to do with linux doing something different than windows&#x2F;macos. reply deathanatos 5 hours agorootparentWe don&#x27;t know that. OP never states what monitor he has, and \"LG Ultragear\" isn&#x27;t a model.

It&#x27;s rarely an actual fault of anything in Linux. However the outside effect to me as a user is that I need to debug my monitor&#x27;s EDID to get it to work correctly.

The first script I used, and would still use if DisplayPort over USB-C got it wrong[0]. The particular thing that I was correcting wasn&#x27;t resolution&#x2F;refresh but rather the color mode to use RGB rather than YPbPr which can be blurry on lower-than-retina displays.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;adaugherity&#x2F;7435890 reply tonymillion 16 hours agoprevWell… this monitor and its EDID are actually correct.The monitor supports 3440x1440 @ 144hz and in the EDID it’s setting that mode as preferred. I checked online and LG market the monitor with those specs, so it’s not an error.It would probably have been easier to flip the bit in the EDID that says the 60hz rate is preferred rather than messing about with the timings - since there is a perfectly good 60hz timing in the EDID.To me (without any other evidence presented or investigation on my part) this is more an issue with the graphics card driver on Linux than an issue with LG. reply AshamedCaptain 14 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s the same reason I have to patch the Radeon drivers on Linux. They just pick the highest mode available without regards whether it will work at all. E.g. if the EDID shows the monitor supports 10bpc, they will pick it even if there&#x27;s not enough bandwidth to suppport it (e.g. bad cable or already daisy chaning something else), resulting in an empty screen.They will also pick 10bpc even if it results in power consumption increasing by 30W (hello stupid AMD GPUs idle power consumption heuristics).I have the impression (untested) that Windows seem to be less excited to select modes outside of the common ones, even if they are advertised in the EDID. reply bombela 13 hours agorootparentI have this monochrome hi-res LCD with an HDMI controller for some lithography project.The EDID advertises YCBR colors. But in reality it only accepts RGB.The amdgpu driver in my AMD laptop is the only machine I own that actually sends YCBR, and I had to add an EDID override for it. It&#x27;s a pain to do. It&#x27;s confusing. And then the HDMI port is now only capable this specific screen.Thankfully the amdgpu driver has now be fitted with few knobs allowing you to override some of the settings at runtime. reply tonymillion 13 hours agorootparentprevI agree, from memory windows will prefer a 60hz rate at the highest resolution until the user (or “monitor .inf file) overrides it.I kind of feel MacaOS does the same - indeed a quick test shows my monitor at 60hz even though there is a free sync range from 40-90 in the refresh rate. But of course this is a weird situation since it’s a free sync thing too, so I couldn’t apply it to everything.So on that note, I go back to my original theory that it’s the graphics driver (or xrand or one of those x-things) screwing the timings up. reply deathanatos 5 hours agoparentprev> The monitor supports 3440x1440 @ 144hz and in the EDID it’s setting that mode as preferred.
