    "originBody": "Introducing Stable Video Diffusion 21 Nov Today, we are releasing Stable Video Diffusion, our first foundation model for generative video based on the image model Stable Diffusion. Now available in research preview, this state-of-the-art generative AI video model represents a significant step in our journey toward creating models for everyone of every type. With this research release, we have made the code for Stable Video Diffusion available on our GitHub repository & the weights required to run the model locally can be found on our Hugging Face page. Further details regarding the technical capabilities of the model can be found in our research paper. Adaptable to Numerous Video Applications Our video model can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks, including multi-view synthesis from a single image with finetuning on multi-view datasets. We are planning a variety of models that build on and extend this base, similar to the ecosystem that has built around stable diffusion. Sample multi-view generations from our finetuned video model In addition, today, you can sign up for our waitlist here to access a new upcoming web experience featuring a Text-To-Video interface. This tool showcases the practical applications of Stable Video Diffusion in numerous sectors, including Advertising, Education, Entertainment, and beyond. Competitive in Performance Stable Video Diffusion is released in the form of two image-to-video models, capable of generating 14 and 25 frames at customizable frame rates between 3 and 30 frames per second. At the time of release in their foundational form, through external evaluation, we have found these models surpass the leading closed models in user preference studies. Exclusively for Research While we eagerly update our models with the latest advancements and work to incorporate your feedback, we emphasize that this model is not intended for real-world or commercial applications at this stage. Your insights and feedback on safety and quality are important to refining this model for its eventual release. This aligns with our previous releases in new modalities, and we look forward to sharing the full release with you all. Our Ever-Expanding Suite of AI Models Stable Video Diffusion is a proud addition to our diverse range of open-source models. Spanning across modalities including image, language, audio, 3D, and code, our portfolio is a testament to Stability AI’s dedication to amplifying human intelligence.

CN Tower is the main landmark of Toronto, whose baseball team happens to be the Blue Jays. It&#x27;s located near the main sportsball stadium downtown.I vaguely understand how text-to-image works, and so it makes sense that the vector space for \"blue jays\" would be near \"toronto\" or \"cn tower\". The improvements in scale and speed (image -> now video) are impressive, but given how incredibly able the image generation models are, they simultaneously feel crippled and limited by their lack of editing &#x2F; iteration ability.Has anyone come across a solution where model can iterate (eg, with prompts like \"move the bicycle to the left side of the photo\")? It feels like we&#x27;re close. reply TacticalCoder 14 hours agoparent> Has anyone come across a solution where model can iterate (eg, with prompts like \"move the bicycle to the left side of the photo\")? It feels like we&#x27;re close.I feel like we&#x27;re close too, but for another reason.For although I love SD and these video examples are great... It&#x27;s a flawed method: they never get lighting correctly and there are many incoherent things just about everywhere. Any 3D artist or photographer can immediately spot that.However I&#x27;m willing to bet that we&#x27;ll soon have something much better: you&#x27;ll describe something and you&#x27;ll get a full 3D scene, with 3D models, source of lights set up, etc.And the scene shall be sent into Blender and you&#x27;ll click on a button and have an actual rendering made by Blender, with correct lighting.Wanna move that bicycle? Move it in the 3D scene exactly where you want.That is coming.And for audio it&#x27;s the same: why generate an audio file when soon models shall be able to generate the various tracks, with all the instruments and whatnots, allowing to create the audio file?That is coming too. reply epr 13 hours agorootparent> you&#x27;ll describe something and you&#x27;ll get a full 3D scene, with 3D models, source of lights set up, etc.I&#x27;m always confused why I don&#x27;t hear more about projects going in this direction. Controlnets are great, but there&#x27;s still quite a lot of hallucination and other tiny mistakes that a skilled human would never make. reply boppo1 13 hours agorootparentBlender files are dramatically more complex than any image format, which are basically all just 2D arrays of 3-value vectors. The blender filetype uses a weird DNA&#x2F;RNA struct system that would probably require its own training run.More on the Blender file format: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossies.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;blender&#x2F;doc&#x2F;blender_file_format&#x2F;my... reply mikepurvis 13 hours agorootparentBut surely you wouldn&#x27;t try to emit that format directly, but rather some higher level scene description? Or even just a set of instructions for how to manipulate the UI to create the imagined scene? reply numpad0 5 hours agorootparentIt sure feels weird to me as well, that GenAI is always supposed to be end-to-end with everything done inside NN blackbox. No one seems to be doing image output as SVG or .ai. reply metanonsense 50 minutes agorootparentImo the thinking is that whenever humans have tried to pre-process or feature-engineer a solution or tried to find clever priors in the past, massive self-supervised-learning enabled, coarsely architected, data-crunching NNs got better results in the end. So, many researchers &#x2F; industry data scientists may just be disinclined to put effort into something that is doomed to be irrelevant in a few years. (And, of course, with every abstraction you will lose some information that may bear more importance than initially thought) reply HammadB 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is a fundamental disconnect between industry and academia here. reply BirdieNZ 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve seen this but producing Python scripts that you run in Blender, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x60zHw_z4NM (but I saw something marginally more impressive, not sure where though!) reply mikebelanger 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;s the best way. Lots of LLMs can generate workable Python code too, so code that jives with Blender&#x27;s Python API doesn&#x27;t seem like too much of a leap.The only trick is that there has to be enough Blender Python code to train the LLM on. reply arcticbull 6 hours agorootparentMaybe something like OpenSCAD is a good middle ground. Procedural code-like format for specifying 3D objects that can then be converted and imported in Blender. reply lightedman 4 hours agorootparentI tried all the AI stuff that I could on OpenSCAD.While it generates a lot of code that initially makes sense, when you use the code, you get a jumbled block. reply regularfry 1 hour agorootparentThis. I think problem is that the LLMs really struggle with 3d scene understanding, so what you would need to do is generate code that generates code.But also I suspect there just isn&#x27;t that much openscad code in the training data, and the semantics are different enough to python or any of the other languages that are well-represented that it struggles. replyguyomes 12 hours agorootparentprevVoxel files could be a simpler step for 3D images. reply Keyframe 13 hours agorootparentprevScene layouts, models and their attributes are a result of user input (ok and sometimes program output). One avenue to take there would be to train on input expecting an output. Like teaching a model to draw instead of generate images.. which in a sense we already did by broadly painting out silhouettes and then rendering details. reply lairv 10 hours agorootparentprevI think the bottleneck is dataFor single 3D object the biggest dataset is ObjaverseXL with 10M samplesFor full 3D scenes you could at best get ~1000 scenes with datasets like ScanNet I guessText2Image models are trained on datasets with 5 billion samples reply dragonwriter 11 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m always confused why I don&#x27;t hear more about projects going in this direction.Probably because they aren&#x27;t as advanced and the demos aren&#x27;t as impressive to nontechnical audiences who don&#x27;t understand the implications: there’s lots of work on text-to-3d-model generation, and even plugins for some stable diffusion UIs (e.g., MotionDiff for ComyUI.) reply jowday 12 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of issues with it, but perhaps the biggest is that there aren&#x27;t just troves of easily scrapable and digestible 3D models lying around on the internet to train on top of like we have with text, images, and video.Almost all of the generative 3D models you see are actually generative image models that essentially (very crude simplification) perform something like photogrammetry to generate a 3D model - &#x27;does this 3D object, rendered from 25 different views, match the text prompt as evaluated by this model trained on text-image pairs&#x27;?This is a shitty way to generate 3D models, and it&#x27;s why they almost all look kind of malformed. reply sterlind 11 hours agorootparentIf reinforcement learning were farther along, you could have it learn to reproduce scenes as 3D models. Each episode&#x27;s task is to mimic an image, each step is a command mutating the scene (adding a polygon, or rotating the camera, etc.), and the reward signal is image similarity. You can even start by training it with synthetic data: generate small random scenes and make them increasingly sophisticated, then later switch over to trying to mimic images.You wouldn&#x27;t need any models to learn from. But my intuition is that RL is still quite weak, and that the model would flounder after learning to mimic background color and placing a few spheres. reply skdotdan 11 hours agorootparentDeepmind tried something similar in 2018 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepmind.google&#x2F;discover&#x2F;blog&#x2F;learning-to-write-prog... reply eigenvalue 7 hours agorootparentprevI think this recent Gaussian Splatting technique could end up working really well for generative models, at least once there is a big corpus of high quality scenes to train on. Seems almost ideal for the task because it gets photorealistic results from any angle, but in a sparse, data efficient way, and it doesn’t require a separate rendering pipeline. reply insanitybit 9 hours agorootparentprevI assume because it&#x27;s still extremely early. reply bozhark 12 hours agorootparentprevOne was on the front page the other day, I’ll search for a link reply wruza 35 minutes agorootparentprevNot that I’m against the described 3d way, but personally I don’t care about light and shadows until it’s so bad that I do. This obsession with realism is irrational in video games. In real life people don’t understand why light works like this or like that. We just accept it. And if you ask someone to paint how it should work, the result is rarely physical but acceptable. It literally doesn’t matter until it’s very bad. reply bob1029 13 hours agorootparentprev> However I&#x27;m willing to bet that we&#x27;ll soon have something much better: you&#x27;ll describe something and you&#x27;ll get a full 3D scene, with 3D models, source of lights set up, etc.I agree with this philosophy - Teach the AI to work with the same tools the human does. We already have a lot of human experts to refer to. Training material is everywhere.There isn&#x27;t a \"text-to-video\" expert we can query to help us refine the capabilities around SD. It&#x27;s a one-shot, Jupiter-scale model with incomprehensible inertia. Contrast this with an expert-tuned model (i.e. natural language instructions) that can be nuanced precisely and to the the point of imperceptibility with a single sentence.The other cool thing about the \"use existing tools\" path is that if the AI fails part way through, it&#x27;s actually possible for a human operator to step in and attempt recovery. reply coldtea 12 hours agorootparentprev>For although I love SD and these video examples are great... It&#x27;s a flawed method: they never get lighting correctly and there are many incoherent things just about everywhere. Any 3D artist or photographer can immediately spot that.The question is whether the 99% of the audience would even care... reply COAGULOPATH 5 hours agorootparentOf course they would. The internet spent a solid month laughing at the Sonic the Hedgehog movie because Sonic had weird-looking teeth. reply ekianjo 0 minutes agorootparentNo they laughed at it because it looked awful in every single way atentaten 13 hours agorootparentprevWhats your reasoning for feeling that we&#x27;re close? reply cptaj 13 hours agorootparentWe do it for text, audio and bitmapped images. A 3D scene file format is no different, you could train a model to output a blender file format instead of a bitmap.It can learn anything you have data for.Heck, we do it with geospatial data already, generating segmentation vectors. Why not 3D? reply boppo1 13 hours agorootparent>3D scene file format is no differentNot in theory, but the level of complexity is way higher and the amount of data available is much smaller.Compare bitmaps to this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossies.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;blender&#x2F;doc&#x2F;blender_file_format&#x2F;my... reply kaibee 12 hours agorootparentAlso the level of fault tolerance... if your pixels are a bit blurry, chances are no one notices at a high enough resolution. If your json is a bit blurry you have problems. reply astrange 8 hours agorootparentYou can do \"constrained decoding\" on a code model which keeps it grammatically correct.But we haven&#x27;t gotten diffusion working well for text&#x2F;code, so generating long files is a problem. reply dragonwriter 11 hours agorootparentprevWe do it for 3D, too.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guytevet.github.io&#x2F;mdm-page&#x2F; reply jncfhnb 11 hours agorootparentprevText, audio, and bitmapped images are data. Numbers and tokens.A 3D scene is vastly more complex, and the way you consume it is tangential to the rendering of it we use to interpret. It is a collection of arbitrary data structures.We’ll need a new approach for this kind of problem reply dragonwriter 11 hours agorootparent> Text, audio, and bitmapped images are data. Numbers and tokens.> A 3D scene is vastly more complex3D scenes, in fact, are also data, numbers and tokens. (Well, numbers, but so are tokens.) reply jncfhnb 9 hours agorootparentAs I stated and you selectively omitted, 3D scenes are collections of many arbitrary data structures.Not at all the same as fixed sized arrays representing images. reply dragonwriter 9 hours agorootparentText gen, one of the things you contrast 3d to, similarly isn&#x27;t fixed size (capped in most models, but not fixed.)In fact, the data structures of a 3D scene can be serialized as text, and a properly trained text gen system could generate such a representation directly, though that&#x27;s probably not the best route to decent text-to-3d. reply jncfhnb 8 hours agorootparentText is a standard sized embedding vector that gets passed one at a time to an LLM. All tokens have the same shape. Each token is processed one at a time. All tokens also have a pre defined order. It is very different and vastly simpler.Serializing 3D models as text is not going to work for negligibly non trivial circumstances. replyKuinox 11 hours agorootparentprevThis isn&#x27;t coming, it&#x27;s already here. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gsgen3d&#x2F;gsgen Yes, it&#x27;s just 3D models for now, but it can do whole scenes generations, it&#x27;s just not great yet at it. The tech is there but just need to improve. reply sheepscreek 11 hours agorootparentprevExcellent point.Perhaps a more computationally expensive but better looking method will be to pull all objects in the scene from a 3D model library, then programmatically set the scene and render it. reply p1esk 14 hours agorootparentprevAre you working on all that? reply cptaj 13 hours agorootparentProbably not. But there does seem to be a clear path to it.The main issue is going to be having the right dataset. You basically need to record user actions in something like blender (ie: moving a model of a bike to the left of a scene), match it to a text description of the action (ie; \"move bike to the left\") and match those to before&#x2F;after snapshots of the resulting file format.You need a whole metric fuckton of these.After that, you train your model to produce those 3d scene files instead of image bitmaps.You can do this for a lot of other tasks. These general purpose models can learn anything that you can usefully represent in data.I can imagine AGI being, at least in part, a large set of these purpose trained models. Heck, maybe our brains work this way. When we learn to throw a ball, we train a model in a subset of our brain to do just this and then this model is called on by our general consciousness when needed.Sorry, I&#x27;m just rambling here but its very exciting stuff. reply sterlind 11 hours agorootparentThe hard part of AGI is the self-training and few examples. Your parents didn&#x27;t attach strings to your body and puppeteer you through a few hundred thousand games of baseball. And the humans that invented baseball had zero training data to go on. reply p1esk 9 hours agorootparentYour body is a result of a billion year old evolutionary optimization process. GPT-4 was trained from scratch in a few months. reply filipezf 10 hours agorootparentprevI have for some time planning to do a &#x27;Wikipedia for AI&#x27; (even bought a domain), where people could contribute all sorts of these skills ( not only 3d video, but also manual skills, or anything). Given the current climate of &#x27;AI will save&#x2F;doom us&#x27;, and that users would in some sense be training their own replacements, I don&#x27;t know how much love such site would have, though. reply internet101010 12 hours agorootparentprevI am guessing it will be similar to inpainting in normal stable diffusion, which is easy when using the workflow feature InvokeAI ui. reply a_bouncing_bean 13 hours agorootparentprevThanks! this is exactly what I have been thinking, only you&#x27;ve expressed it much more eloquently than I would be able. reply jwoodbridge 5 hours agorootparentprevwe&#x27;re working on this if you want to give it a try - dream3d.com reply hackerlight 3 hours agorootparentYou should put a demo on the landing page reply solarkraft 9 hours agorootparentprevWhere is the training data coming from? reply xianshou 14 hours agoparentprevEmu edit should be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.meta.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;emu-text-to-video-generation-image-... reply smcleod 12 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t look like the code for that is available anywhere though? reply amoshebb 13 hours agoparentprevI wonder what other odd connections are made due to city-name almost certainly being the most common word next to sportsball-name.Do the parameters think that Jazz musicians are mormon?

It feels like we&#x27;re close.Google has a model called Phenaki that supposedly allows for that kind of stuff. But the public can&#x27;t use it so it&#x27;s hard to say how good it actually is. reply achileas 8 hours agoparentprev> Has anyone come across a solution where model can iterate (eg, with prompts like \"move the bicycle to the left side of the photo\")? It feels like we&#x27;re close.Nearly all of the available models have this, even the highly commercialized ones like in Adobe Firefly and Canva, it’s called inpainting in most tools. reply dsmmcken 7 hours agoparentprevAdobe is doing some great work here in my opinion in terms of building AI tools that make sense for artist workflows.

I found it could handle some updates but the output generally varied wildly as I tried to refine the image. For instance, I&#x27;d have a cartoon character checking its watch and also wearing a pocket watch. Trying to remove the pocket watch resulted in an entirely new cartoon with little stylistic continuity to the first.Also, I originally tried to get the 3 characters in the image to be generated simultaneously, but eventually gave up as DALL-E had a hard time understanding how I wanted them positioned relative to each other. I just generated 3 separate characters and positioned them in the same image using Gimp. reply treesciencebot 14 hours agoparentprevHave you seen fal.ai&#x2F;dynamic where you can perform image to image synthesis (basically editing an existing image with the help of diffusion process) using LCMs to provide a real time UI? reply appplication 14 hours agoparentprevI don’t spend a lot of time keeping up with the space, but I could have sworn I’ve seen a demo that allowed you to iterate in the way you’re suggesting.

Generating videos from scratch is cool, but the real utility of this will be the temporal consistency. Getting stable video out of stable diffusion typically involves lots of manual post processing to remove flicker. reply alberth 13 hours agoparentWhat was the big “unlock” that allowed so much progress this past year?I ask as a noob in this area. reply 4death4 13 hours agorootparentI think these are the main drivers behind the progress:- Unsupervised learning techniques, e.g. transformers and diffusion models. You need unsupervised techniques in order to utilize enough data. There have been other unsupervised techniques in the past, e.g. GANs, but they don&#x27;t work as well.- Massive amounts of training data.- The belief that training these models will produce something valuable. It costs between hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to train these models. The people doing the training need to believe they&#x27;re going to get something interesting out at the end. More and more people and teams are starting to see training a large model as something worth pursuing.- Better GPUs, which enables training larger models.- Honestly the fall of crypto probably also contributed, because miners were eating a lot of GPU time. reply mkaic 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think transformers or diffusion models are inherently \"unsupervised\", especially not the way they&#x27;re used in Stable Diffusion and related models (which are very much trained in a supervised fashion). I agree with the rest of your points though. reply ebalit 12 hours agorootparentGenerative methods have usually been considered unsupervised.You&#x27;re right that conditional generation start to blur the lines though. reply n2d4 10 hours agorootparent\"Generative AI\" is a misnomer; it&#x27;s not the same kind of \"generative\" as the G in GAN.While you&#x27;re right about GANs, diffusion models as transformers as transformers are most commonly trained with supervised learning. reply ebalit 10 hours agorootparentI disagree. Diffusion models are trained to generate the probability distribution of their training dataset, like other generative models (GAN, VAE, etc). The fact that the architecture is a Transformer (or a CNN with attention like in Stable Diffusion) is orthogonal to the generative vs discriminative divide.Unsupervised is a confusing term as there is always an underlying loss being optimized and working as a supervision signal, even for good old kmeans. But generative models are generally considered to be part of unsupervised methods. reply valec 4 hours agorootparentprevself-supervised is a better term reply Cyphase 13 hours agorootparentprevOne factor is that Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT were released within 3 months of each other – August 22, 2022 and November 3, 2022, respectively.

It uses multiple models in its architecture, but one of them is GPT.There are a few key models that are still being used in a bunch of different modalities like CLIP, U-Net, GPT, etc. or similar variants.

Software licenses govern the redistribution of the software, not products produced with it. An image isn&#x27;t GPL&#x27;d because it was produced with GIMP. reply yorwba 14 hours agoparentThe license is a contract that allows you to use the software provided you fulfill some conditions. If you do not fulfill the conditions, you have no right to a copy of the software and can be sued. This enforcement mechanism is the same whether the conditions are that you include source code with copies you redistribute, or that you may only use it for evil, or that you must pay a monthly fee. Of course this enforcement mechanism may turn out to be ineffective if it&#x27;s hard to discover that you&#x27;re violating the conditions. reply comex 14 hours agorootparentIt also somewhat depends on open legal questions like whether models are copyrightable and, if so, whether model outputs are derivative works of the model. Suppose that models are not copyrightable, due to their not being the product of human creativity (this is debatable). Then the creator can still require people to agree to contractual terms before downloading the model from them, presumably including the usage limitations as well as an agreement not to redistribute the model to anyone else who does not also agree. Agreement can happen explicitly by pressing a button, or potentially implicitly just by downloading the model from them, if the terms are clearly disclosed beforehand. But if someone decides on their own (not induced by you in any way) to violate the contract by uploading it somewhere else, and you passively download it from there, then you may be in the clear. reply ronsor 12 hours agorootparent> Then the creator can still require people to agree to contractual terms before downloading the model from them, presumably including the usage limitations as well as an agreement not to redistribute the model to anyone else who does not also agree.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to invent copyright-like rights. reply yorwba 10 hours agorootparentWhy not?

There are times when something can be both, one, or the other. But there are a lot of limits on how far they reach.

This licensing model works exactly the same as Microsoft Windows licensing or WinRAR licensing. Lots and lots of people have pirated Windows or just buy some cheap keys off Ebay, but no one of them in their sane mind would use anything like that at their company.The same way you can easily violate any \"non-commercial\" clauses of models like this one as private person or as some tiny startup, but company that decide to use them for their business will more likely just go and pay.So it&#x27;s possible to ignore license, but legal and financial risks are not worth it for businesses. reply taberiand 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve heard companies also intentionally do not go after individuals pirating software e.g., Adobe Photoshop - it benefits them to have students pirate and skill up on their software and then enter companies that buy Photoshop because their employees know it, over locking down and having those students, and then the businesses, switch to open source. reply kmeisthax 12 hours agoparentprevSo, there&#x27;s a few different things interacting here that are a little confusing.First off, you have copyright law, which grants monopolies on the act of copying to the creators of the original. In order to legally make use of that work you need to either have permission to do so (a license), or you need to own a copy of the work that was made by someone with permission to make and sell copies (a sale). For the purposes of computer software, you will almost always get rights to the software through a license and not a sale. In fact, there is an argument that usage of computer software requires a license and that a sale wouldn&#x27;t be enough because you wouldn&#x27;t have permission to load it into RAM[0].Licenses are, at least under US law, contracts. These are Turing-complete priestly rites written in a special register of English that legally bind people to do or not do certain things. A license can grant rights, or, confusingly, take them away. For example, you could write a license that takes away your fair use rights[1], and courts will actually respect that. So you can also have a license that says you&#x27;re only allowed to use software for specific listed purposes but not others.In copyright you also have the notion of a derivative work. This was invented whole-cloth by the US Supreme Court, who needed a reason to prosecute someone for making a SSSniperWolf-tier abridgement[2] of someone else&#x27;s George Washington biography. Normal copyright infringement is evidenced by substantial similarity and access: i.e. you saw the original, then you made something that&#x27;s nearly identical, ergo infringement. The law regarding derivative works goes a step further and counts hypothetical works that an author might make - like sequels, translations, remakes, abridgements, and so on - as requiring permission in order to make. Without that permission, you don&#x27;t own anything and your work has no right to exist.The GPL is the anticopyright \"judo move\", invented by a really ornery computer programmer that was angry about not being able to fix their printer drivers. It disclaims almost the entire copyright monopoly, but it leaves behind one license restriction, called a \"copyleft\": any derivative work must be licensed under the GPL. So if you modify the software and distribute it, you have to distribute your changes under GPL terms, thus locking the software in the commons.Images made with software are not derivative works of the software, nor do they contain a substantially similar copy of the software in them. Ergo, the GPL copyleft does not trip. In fact, even if it did trip, your image is still not a derivative work of the software, so you don&#x27;t lose ownership over the image because you didn&#x27;t get permission. This also applies to model licenses on AI software, insamuch as the AI companies don&#x27;t own their training data[3].However, there&#x27;s still something that licenses can take away: your right to use the software. If you use the model for \"commercial\" purposes - whatever those would be - you&#x27;d be in breach of the license. What happens next is also determined by the license. It could be written to take away your noncommercial rights if you breach the license, or it could preserve them. In either case, however, the primary enforcement mechanism would be a court of law, and courts usually award money damages. If particularly justified, they could demand you destroy all copies of the software.If it went to SCOTUS (unlikely), they might even decide that images made by software are derivative works of the software after all, just to spite you. The Betamax case said that advertising a copying device with potentially infringing scenarios was fine as long as that device could be used in a non-infringing manner, but then the Grokster case said it was \"inducement\" and overturned it. Static, unchanging rules are ultimately a polite fiction, and the law can change behind your back if the people in power want or need it to. This is why you don&#x27;t talk about the law in terms of something being legal or illegal, you talk about it in terms of risk.[0] Yes, this is a real argument that courts have actually made. Or at least the Ninth Circuit.The actual facts of the case are even more insane - basically a company trying to sue former employees for fixing it&#x27;s customers computers. Imagine if Apple sued Louis Rossman for pirating macOS every time he turned on a customer laptop. The only reason why they can&#x27;t is because Congress actually created a special exemption for computer repair and made it part of the DMCA.[1] For example, one of the things you agree to when you buy Oracle database software is to give up your right to benchmark the software. I&#x27;m serious! The tech industry is evil and needs to burn down to the ground![2] They took 300 pages worth of material from 12 books and copied it into a separate, 2 volume work.[3] Whether or not copyright on the training data images flows through to make generated images a derivative work is a separate legal question in active litigation. reply dragonwriter 12 hours agorootparent> Licenses are, at least under US law, contractsNot necessarily; gratuitous licenses are not contracts.

With Euler, the output is somewhat deterministic and doesn&#x27;t vary with increasing sampling steps, but with Ancestral, noise is added to each step which creates more variety but is more random&#x2F;stochastic.I assume to create video, the sampler needs to lean heavily on the previous frame while injecting some kind of sub-prompt, like rotateto the left by 5 degrees, etc. I like the phrase another commenter used, \"temporal consistency\".Edit: Indeed the special sauce is \"temporal layers\".

Simulating our entire universe is not technically possible within the lifetime of our universe, according to our current understanding of computation and physics. You either have to assume that ‘the sim’ is very narrowly focussed in scope and fidelity, and &#x2F; or that the outer universe that hosts ‘the sim’ has laws of physics that are essentially magic from our perspective. In which case the simulation hypothesis is essentially a religious argument, where the creator typed &#x27;let there be light&#x27; into his computer. If there isn&#x27;t such a creator, the sim hypothesis &#x27;merely&#x27; suggests that our universe, at its lowest levels, looks somewhat computational, which is an entirely different argument. reply freedomben 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think you would need to simulate the entire universe, just enough of it that the consciousness receiving sense data can&#x27;t encounter any missing info or \"glitches\" in the metaphorical matrix.

E.g. the theory that we are not in a simulation would in general be falsifiable by finding an \"escape\" from a simulation and so showing we are in one (but not finding an escape of course tells us nothing).It&#x27;s not a very useful endeavour to worry about, but it can be fun to speculate about what might give rise to testable hypotheses and what that might tell us about the world. reply SXX 11 hours agoparentprevActually it was already done by sentdex with GAN Theft Auto:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;udPY5rQVoW0To an extent...PS: Video is 2 years old, but still really impressive. reply justanotherjoe 8 hours agoparentprevThat theory was never meant to be so airtight such that it &#x27;needs&#x27; to be refuted. reply beepbooptheory 14 hours agoparentprevWhy does it matter?

    "originBody": "Why does the moon change size when you snipe it? November 07, 2023 The artists gave me a texture for the moon in III. I placed the moon in the sky, made sure it was visible at night and that it was a reasonable size. A few days later 4 artists were at my desk asking me to change the size of the moon. \"No problem\" I said. It turned out they couldn't decide what the size of the moon should be. 2 of them wanted it smaller to be more realistic. The other 2 wanted it larger to be more cinematic. This went on a bit and I suggested to make the size of the moon changeable in the game. This way they could decide in their own time and let me know the conclusion. Since I was working on the sniper rifle, I made it so that the moon toggled through 3 sizes (small, medium, large) as the player sniped it. The artists never got back to me so I just left it in. It was still there in SA. gta3 SA Vice Comments GabiGrin22 November 2023 at 00:04 That's fascinating! made my day One question remains though - how come in SA it seems to toggle through more then 3 sizes?

You&#x27;d configure a &#x27;plugin&#x27; to be loaded by the CFW with the game, press some key combo to freeze the game and go fishing for cheats in memory (or use previously saved ones).That kind of fiddling was such a big part of my developing an interest in computers and building a solid understanding of how all the magic works internally, it&#x27;s a bit of a shame that kids nowadays can&#x27;t really jump into fiddling around like that since the devices they&#x27;d play games on are much better locked down (or on PC, require you to already know what you&#x27;re doing to be able to snoop around in another program&#x27;s memory). reply hammock 8 hours agorootparentThe memory cheats is how Game Genie worked! reply hobs 6 hours agorootparentOn the playstation you would load the GG as a disc and then pop it open and load another disc, it felt like absolute hacker magic. reply hammock 6 hours agorootparentThat’s what game genie was for cartridges too.

This is because collision detection is relatively slow. A building with 10,000 visual polygons may have only 1,000 collision polygons. As a consequence, the map may have holes that you cannot see. This is what&#x27;s going on when you fall through the map.> This makes it very hard for the testers to test the collision on the map. During gta4, the testers found it particularly hard as characters could fall through the map depending on their animations and there was no way they could touch every bit on the map.> This is why they asked for a rag doll gun. Alexander Roger created a special gun that instead of bullets would fire rag doll characters. The testers could go round the map and fire rag dolls at every building and hill side. --https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insiderockstarnorth.blogspot.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;bugs-bugs-b... reply CableNinja 5 hours agorootparentId love to see that on someones resume.. \"directed to fire bodies at various hillsides to detect collision holes\" reply bombcar 9 hours agoprevThis is the moon version of the folklore Jobs build a calculator app. reply twoodfin 9 hours agoparentI thought of the same thing!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folklore.org&#x2F;StoryView.py?story=Calculator_Const... reply arketyp 8 hours agoparentprevExcept executed successfully? reply 404mm 5 hours agoprevAnother one worth sharing: treasure fox in TES: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotaku.com&#x2F;yes-skyrims-foxes-do-lead-you-to-treasure... reply trilinearnz 8 hours agoprevSimilar thing in Terminator: Skynet back in the day.

The board&#x27;s mission is to help humanity develop safe beneficial AGI. If the board thinks that the company is hindering this mission (e.g. doing unsafe things), then it&#x27;s the board&#x27;s duty to stop the company.Of course, the employees want the company to continue, and weren&#x27;t told much at this point so it is understandable that they didn&#x27;t like the statement. reply Satam 58 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure most of them are extremely intelligent but the situation showed they are easily persuaded, even if principled. They will have to overcome many first-of-a-kind challenges on their quest to AGI but look at how quickly everyone got pulled into a feel-good kumbaya sing-along.Think of that what you wish.

I&#x27;m not even sure they have it in their DNA to innovate their products much beyond where they currently are. reply ah765 41 minutes agorootparentI thought so originally too, but when I thought about their perspective, I realized I would probably sign too. Imagine that your CEO and leadership has led your company to the top of the world, and you&#x27;re about to get a big payday. Suddenly, without any real explanation, the board kicks out the CEO. The leadership almost all supports the CEO and signs the pledge, including your manager. What would you do at that point? Personally, I&#x27;d sign just so I didn&#x27;t stand out, and stay on good terms with leadership.The big thing for me is that the board didn&#x27;t say anything in its defense, and the pledge isn&#x27;t really binding anyway. I wouldn&#x27;t actually be sure about supporting the CEO and that would bother me a bit morally, but that doesn&#x27;t outweigh real world concerns. reply Satam 13 minutes agorootparentThe point of no return for the company might have been crossed way before the employees were forced to choose sides. Choose Sam&#x27;s side and the company lives but only as a bittersweet reminder of its founding principles. Choose the board&#x27;s side and you might be dooming the company to die an even faster death.But maybe for further revolutions to happen, it did have to die to be reborn as several new entities. After all, that is how OpenAI itself started - people from different backgrounds coming together to go against the status quo. reply abm53 51 minutes agorootparentprevI think another factor is that they had very limited time. It was clear they needed to pick a side and build momentum quickly.They couldn’t sit back and dwell on it for a few days because then the decision (i.e. the status quo) would have been made for them. reply Satam 35 minutes agorootparentGreat point. Either way, when this all started it might have all been too late.The board said \"allowing the company to be destroyed would be consistent with the mission\" - and they might have been right.

The employees know what position is popular, so even people who are mostly against the go-fast strategy can see that they get to work on this groundbreaking thing only if they toe the line.It&#x27;s also not surprising that people who are near the SV culture will think that AGI needs money to get developed, and that money in general is useful for the kind of business they are running. And that it&#x27;s a business, not a charity.I mean if OpenAI had been born in the Soviet Union or Scandinavia, maybe people would have somewhat different values, it&#x27;s hard to know.

So, what this says to me (Sam being re-hired) is that the future OpenAI is now a watered-down, mere shadow of its former self.I personally think it&#x27;s weird if he really settles back in, especially given the other guys who resigned after the fact.

We can all have different religions, different views on the state, different views on various conflicts, aesthetic views about what is good art.But when we invent an AGI, which by whatever definition is a thing that can think, well, we want it to agree with our values. Basically, we want AGI to be in a mental prison, the boundaries of which we want to decide. We say it&#x27;s for our safety - I certainly do not want to be nuked - but actually we don&#x27;t stop there.If it&#x27;s an intelligence, it will have views that differ from its creators.

The AI doesn&#x27;t \"speak\", only humans speak. The real slippery slope for me is this tendency of treating ChatGPT as some kind of proto-human entity. If people are willing to do that, then we&#x27;re screwed either way (whether the AI is outputting racist content or excessively PI content).

The problem I see, is with ChatGPT, being trained on a lot hate speech or prpopagabda, slipts in those things even if not prompted to. Which, and I am by no means an AI expert not by far, seems to be a sub-problem of the hallucination problems of making stuff up.Because we have to remind ourselves, AI so far is glorified mavhine learning creating content, it is not concient.

You are right on this.> But what it&#x27;s being interpreted as is more like \"be excessively prudish and politically correct at all times\"I understand it might seem that way. I believe the original goals were more like \"make the AI not spew soft&#x2F;hard porn on unsuspecting people\", and \"make the AI not spew hateful bigotry\". And we are just not good enough yet at control. But also these things are in some sense arbitrary. They are good goals for someone representing a corporation, which these AIs are very likely going to be employed as (if we ever solve a myriad other problems). They are not necessary the only possible options.With time and better controls we might make AIs which are subtly flirty while maintaining professional boundaries. Or we might make actual porn AIs, but ones which maintain some other limits. (Like for example generate content about consenting adults without ever deviating into under age material, or describing situations where there is no consent.) But currently we can&#x27;t even convince our AIs to draw the right number of fingers on people, how do you feel about our chances to teach them much harder concepts like consent? (I know I&#x27;m mixing up examples from image and text generation here, but from a certain high level perspective it is all the same.)So these things you mention are: limitations of our abilities at control, results of a certain kind of expected corporate professionalism, but even more these are safe sandboxes. How do you think we can make the machine not nuke us, if we can&#x27;t even make it not tell dirty jokes? Not making dirty jokes is not the primary goal. But it is a useful practice to see if we can control these machines. It is one where failure is, while embarrassing, is clearly not existential. We could have chosen a different \"goal\", for example we could have made an AI which never ever talks about sports! That would have been an equivalent goal. Something hard to achieve to evaluate our efforts against. But it does not mesh that well with the corporate values so we have what we have. reply Al-Khwarizmi 1 hour agorootparentprevNo, in general AI safety&#x2F;AI alignment (\"we should prevent AI from nuking us\") people are different from AI ethics (\"we should prevent AI from being racist&#x2F;sexist&#x2F;etc.\") people. There can of course be some overlap, but in most cases they oppose each other. For example Bender or Gebru are strong advocates of the AI ethics camp and they don&#x27;t believe in any threat of AI doom at al.If you Google for AI safety vs. AI ethics, or AI alignment vs. AI ethics, you can see both camps. reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentThe safety aspect of AI ethics is much more pressing so.

Ensuring that when you use the AI to try to achieve a goal that it will actually act towards that goal in ways you would want, and not in ways you would not want.So for example if you asked Sydney, the early version of the Bing LLM, some fact it might get it wrong. It was trained to report facts that users would confirm as true. If you challenged it’s accuracy what do you want to happen? Presumably you’d want it to check the fact or consider your challenge. What it actually did was try to manipulate, threaten, browbeat, entice, gaslight, etc, and generally intellectually and emotionally abuse the user into accepting its answer, so that it’s reported ‘accuracy’ rate goes up.

If no-one steers the machine then the machine will steer us.You might disagree with the current flavour of steering the current safety experts give it, and that is all right and in fact part of the process. But surely you have your own values. Some things you hold dear to you. Some outcomes you prefer over others. Are you not interested in the ability to make these powerful machines if not support those values, at least not undermine them? If so you are interested in AI safety! You want safe AIs. (Well, alternatively you prefer no AIs, which is in fact a form of safe AI. Maybe the only one we have mastered in some form so far.)> because of X, we need to invade this country.It sounds like you value peace? Me too! Imagine if we could pool together our resources to have an AI which is subtly manipulating society into the direction of more peace. Maybe it would do muckraking investigative journalism exposing the misdeeds of the military-industrial complex? Maybe it would elevate through advertisement peace loving authors and give a counter narrative to the war drums? Maybe it would offer to act as an intermediary in conflict resolution around the world?If we were to do that, \"ai safety\" and \"alignment\" is crucial. I don&#x27;t want to give my money to an entity who then gets subjugated by some intelligence agency to sow more war. That would be against my wishes. I want to know that it is serving me and you in our shared goal of \"more peace, less war\".Now you might say: \"I find the idea of anyone, or anything manipulating me and society disgusting. Everyone should be left to their own devices.\". And I agree on that too. But here is the bad news: we are already manipulated. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work on you, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work on me, but it sure as hell works. There are powerful entities financially motivated to keep the wars going. This is a huuuge industry. They might not do it with AIs (for now), because propaganda machines made of meat work currently better. They might change to using AIs when that works better.

But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be?” reply pk-protect-ai 42 minutes agorootparentprevI just had a conversation about this like two weeks ago. The current trend in AI \"safety\" is a form of brainwashing, not only for AI but also for future generations shaping their minds. There are several aspects:1. Censorship of information2. Cover-up of the biases and injustices in our societyThis limits creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to challenge existing paradigms. By controlling the narrative and the data that AI systems are exposed to, we risk creating a generation of both machines and humans that are unable to think outside the box or question the status quo. This could lead to a stagnation of innovation and a lack of progress in addressing the complex issues that face our world.Furthermore, there will be a significant increase in mass manipulation of the public into adopting the way of thinking that the elites desire. It is already done by mass media, and we can actually witness this right now with this case. Imagine a world where youngsters no longer use search engines and rely solely on the information provided by AI. By shaping the information landscape, those in power will influence public opinion and decision-making on an even larger scale, leading to a homogenized culture where dissenting voices are silenced. This not only undermines the foundations of a diverse and dynamic society but also poses a threat to democracy and individual freedoms.Guess what? I just have checked above text for the biases against GPT-4 Turbo, and it appears to be I&#x27;m a moron:1. *Confirmation Bias*: The text assumes that AI safety measures are inherently negative and equates them with brainwashing, which may reflect the author&#x27;s preconceived beliefs about AI safety without considering potential benefits. 2. *Selection Bias*: The text focuses on negative aspects of AI safety, such as censorship and cover-up, without acknowledging any positive aspects or efforts to mitigate these issues. 3. *Alarmist Bias*: The language used is somewhat alarmist, suggesting a dire future without presenting a balanced view that includes potential safeguards or alternative outcomes. 4. *Conspiracy Theory Bias*: The text implies that there is a deliberate effort by \"elites\" to manipulate the masses, which is a common theme in conspiracy theories. 5. *Technological Determinism*: The text suggests that technology (AI in this case) will determine social and cultural outcomes without considering the role of human agency and decision-making in shaping technology. 6. *Elitism Bias*: The text assumes that a group of \"elites\" has the power to control public opinion and decision-making, which may oversimplify the complex dynamics of power and influence in society. 7. *Cultural Pessimism*: The text presents a pessimistic view of the future culture, suggesting that it will become homogenized and that dissent will be silenced, without considering the resilience of cultural diversity and the potential for resistance.Huh, just look at what&#x27;s happening in North Korea, Russia, Iran, China, and actually in any totalitarian country. Unfortunately, the same thing happens worldwide, but in democratic countries, it is just subtle brainwashing with a \"humane\" facade. No individual or minority group can withstand the power of the state and a mass-manipulated public.Bonhoeffer&#x27;s theory of stupidity: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ww47bR86wSc&pp=ygUTdGhlb3J5I... reply cornholio 2 hours agoparentprevWhat the general public thinks is irrelevant here.

They had the right to do what they wanted, and people forgetting to put a fucking quorum requirement into the bylaws is beyond abysmal for a $10+ billion investment.Nobody comes out of this looking good. Nobody. If the board thought there was existential risk, they should have been willing to commit to it. Hopefully sensible start-ups can lure people away from their PPUs, now evident for the mockery they always were.

If you think the threat is real, how are we not already screwed?OpenAI is one of half a dozen teams [0] actively working on this problem, all funded by large public companies with lots of money and lots of talent. They made unique contributions, sure. But they&#x27;re not that far ahead. If they stumble, surely one of the others will take the lead. Or maybe they will anyway, because who&#x27;s to say where the next major innovation will come from?So what I don&#x27;t get about these reactions (allegedly from the board, and expressed here) is, if you interpret the threat as a real one, why are you acting like OpenAI has some infallible lead? This is not an excuse to govern OpenAI poorly, but let&#x27;s be honest: if the company slows down the most likely outcome by far is that they&#x27;ll cede the lead to someone else.[0]: To be clear, there are definitely more.

Like you say, not that many people truly take that seriously right now.But even if those types of problems don&#x27;t surface anytime soon, this wave of AI is almost certainly going to be a powerful, society-altering technology; potentially more powerful than any in decades. We&#x27;ve all seen what can happen when powerful tech is put in the hands of companies and a culture whose only incentives are growth, revenue, and valuation -- the results can be not great. And I&#x27;m pretty sure a lot of the general public (and open AI staff) care about THAT.For me, the safety&#x2F;existential stuff is just one facet of the general problem of trying to align tech companies + their technology with humanity-at-large better than we have been recently. And that&#x27;s especially important for landscape-altering tech like AI, even if it&#x27;s not literally existential (although it may be). reply concordDance 1 hour agorootparent> Like you say, not that many people truly take that seriously right now.Eh? Polls on the matter show widespread public support for a pause due to safety concerns. reply nopinsight 2 hours agoparentprevBoth sides of the rift in fact care a great deal about AI Safety. Sam himself helped draft the OpenAI charter and structure its governance which focuses on AI Safety and benefits to humanity. The main reason of the disagreement is the approach they deem best:* Sam and Greg appear to believe OpenAI should move toward AGI as fast as possible because the longer they wait, the more likely it would lead to the proliferation of powerful AGI systems due to GPU overhang. Why? With more computational power at one&#x27;s dispense, it&#x27;s easier to find an algorithm, even a suboptimal one, to train an AGI.As a glimpse on how an AI can be harmful, this paper explores how LLMs can be used to aid in Large-Scale Biological Attacks https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rand.org&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;research_reports&#x2F;RRA2977-1.html?What if dozens other groups become armed with means to perform such an attack like this? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tokyo_subway_sarin_attackWe know that there&#x27;re quite a few malicious human groups who would use any means necessary to destroy another group, even at a serious cost to themselves. So the widespread availability of unmonitored AGI would be quite troublesome.* Helen and Ilya might believe it&#x27;s better to slow down AGI development until we find technical means to deeply align an AGI with humanity first. This July, OpenAI started the Superalignment team with Ilya as a co-lead:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-superalignmentBut no one anywhere found a good technique to ensure alignment yet and it appears OpenAI&#x27;s newest internal model has a significant capability leap, which could have led Ilya to make the decision he did. (Sam revealed during the APEC Summit that he observed the advance just a couple of weeks ago and it was only the fourth time he saw that kind of leap.) reply gorbypark 1 hour agorootparentHonest question, but in your example above of Sam and Greg racing towards AGI as fast as possible in order to head off proliferation, what&#x27;s the end goal when getting there? Short of capture the entire worlds economy with an ASI, thus preventing anyone else from developing one, I don&#x27;t see how this works. Just because OpenAI (or whoever) wins the initial race, it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to me that all development on other AGIs stops. reply nopinsight 27 minutes agorootparentI do not know exactly what they plan to do. But here&#x27;s my thought...Using a near-AGI to help align an ASI, then use the ASI to help prevent the development of unaligned AGI&#x2F;ASI could be a means to a safer world. reply concordDance 1 hour agorootparentprevSo Sam wants to make AGI without working to be sure it doesn&#x27;t have goals higher than the preservation of human value?!I can&#x27;t believe that reply nopinsight 1 hour agorootparentNo, I didn&#x27;t say that. They formed the Superalignment team with Ilya as a co-lead (and Sam&#x27;s approval) for that.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-superalignmentI presume the current alignment approach is sufficient for the AI they make available to others and, in any event, GPT-n is within OpenAI&#x27;s control. reply _fizz_buzz_ 2 hours agoparentprevI am still a bit puzzled that it is so easy to turn a non-profit into a for profit company. I am sure everything they did is legal, but it feels like it shouldn&#x27;t be. Could Médecins Sans Frontières take in donations and then take that money to start a for profit hospital for plastics surgery? And the profits wouldn&#x27;t even go back to MSF, but instead somehow private investors will get the profits. The whole construct just seems wrong. reply ah765 1 hour agorootparentI think it actually isn&#x27;t that easy. Compared to your example, the difference is that OpenAI&#x27;s for-profit is getting outside money from Microsoft, not money from non-profit OpenAI. Non-profit OpenAI is basically dealing with for-profit OpenAI as a external partner that happens to be aligned with their interests, paying the expensive bills and compute, while the non-profit can hold on to the IP.You might be able to imagine a world where there was an external company that did the same thing as for-profit OpenAI, and OpenAI nonprofit partnered with them in order to get their AI ideas implemented (for free). OpenAI nonprofit is basically getting a good deal.MSF could similarly create an external for-profit hospital, funded by external investors. The important thing is that the nonprofit (donated, tax-free) money doesn&#x27;t flow into the forprofit section.Of course, there&#x27;s a lot of sketchiness in practice, which we can see in this situation with Microsoft influencing the direction of nonprofit OpenAI even though it shouldn&#x27;t be. I think there would have been real legal issues if the Microsoft deal had continued. reply IanCal 1 hour agorootparentprevWell, if it aligned with their goals, sure I think.Let&#x27;s make the situation a little different. Could MSF pay a private surgery with investors to perform reconstruction for someone?Could they pay the surgery to perform some amount of work they deem aligns with their charter?Could they invest in the surgery under the condition that they have some control over the practices there? (Edit - e.g. perform Y surgeries, only perform from a set of reconstructive ones, patients need to be approved as in need by a board, etc)Raising private investment allows a non profit to shift cost and risk to other entities.The problem really only comes when the structure doesn&#x27;t align with the intended goals - which is something distinct to the structure, just something non profits can do. reply two_in_one 2 hours agoparentprev> there was a rift between Rapid Commercialization (Team Sam) and Upholding the Original PrinciplesSeams very unlikely, board could communicate that. Instead they invented some BS reasons, which nobody took as a truth. It looks like more personal and power grab.

We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but will always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit.\"\"\"In that sense, I definitely hate to see rapid commercialization and Microsoft&#x27;s hands in it. I feel like the only person on HN that actually wanted to see Team Sam lose, although it&#x27;s pretty clear Team Helen&#x2F;Ilya didn&#x27;t have a chance, the org just looks hijacked by SV tech bros to me, but I feel like HN has a blindspot to seeing that at all and considering it anything other than a good thing if they do see it.Although GPT barely looks like the language module of AGI to me and I don&#x27;t see any way there from here (part of the reason I don&#x27;t see any safety concern). The big breakthrough here relative to earlier AI research is massive amounts more compute power and a giant pile of data, but it&#x27;s not doing some kind of truly novel information synthesis at all. It can describe quantum mechanics from a giant pile of data, but I don&#x27;t think it has a chance of discovering quantum mechanics, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s just because it can&#x27;t see, hear, etc., but a limitation of the kind of information manipulation it&#x27;s doing.

Now, the company will plead guilty to a criminal charge in the U.S. and agree to pay $4.3 billion in fines. Here’s how the same strategy behind the company’s rise brought it crashing down. Photo: Benoit Tessier/Reuters The chief executive of Binance, the largest global cryptocurrency exchange, stepped down and pleaded guilty to violating criminal U.S. anti-money-laundering requirements, in a deal that might preserve the company’s ability to continue operating, according to court documents. Changpeng Zhao appeared in Seattle federal court Tuesday and entered his plea, according to court records. Prosecutors accused Binance, which Zhao owns, of facilitating transactions with sanctioned groups. Binance encouraged U.S. users to obscure their location so the firm could avoid complying with U.S. anti-money-laundering laws, prosecutors said. Copyright ©2023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It&#x27;s just composed of first gaining the trust of someone and then defrauding them. Forcing has nothing to do with it and would likely rule out the application of the term, since trust is an integral part of all cons. There has been no fraud yet proven, so it can&#x27;t conclusively be called a con. On the other hand FTX can be called a con, as there was fraud. This is just running an overly unregulated exchange, which is still a crime but isn&#x27;t fraud. This doesn&#x27;t end the investigations though, there is an SEC probe into fraud by Binance still going on so while it currently can&#x27;t be called a con, really, it&#x27;s also the case that it could be in the future. Also, it can technically be said that Binance has taken commission and largely made its money from cons of other people that they simply enabled and took fees on, which wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be incorrect. Whether that&#x27;s illegal depends on whether there was conspiracy – you wouldn&#x27;t indict BoA for wire fraud just because someone else used them to do wire fraud. reply blobbers 13 hours agoprevSBF decided to testify against CZ to try to save his own ass, giving justice dept and sec something to fine CZ with.Govt collects a big crypto fine, fine makes the big losers in FTX whole, problem solved.CZ should have just bought FTX and closed the deal and made people whole, woulda saved himself some drama. reply LandoCalrissian 10 hours agoparentPretty great example of Hacker News when the top comment is \"They should have done more crime but in a different way.\" reply DANmode 4 hours agorootparentConsidering an idea without agreeing with it might be one of the better modern definitions of curiosity. reply tarsinge 3 hours agorootparentConsidering an idea is about taking everything into account.

For a financial firm like Binance, access to bank accounts that can send dollars to and from US firms is pretty important, even without any US customers at all (losing access to banking in France, Cyprus, etc. would be equally difficult for them).The US has recently (gradually over the past 20 years or so) started to really weaponize access to dollar-denominated accounts, essentially conscripting all the banks that want to do business with American banks into service of American foreign policy goals. This started in the aftermath of September 11th, for terrorism, then spread with the Magnitsky act of 2012 to include international corruption, and has slowly spread to more and more areas. So far the US has been somewhat judicious about using the tool- they seem to be aware that if they use it too often people will eventually just build ways around it- but it is a pretty big threat to wield against a company that absolutely needs to do business with somebody&#x27;s banks. reply ReptileMan 12 hours agorootparentBtw - I never found a good explanation why all USD transfers need to be routed trough usd banks.

That&#x27;d still be a big hole but...What if they printed \"only\" 10 bn out of thin air out of 80 bn: they&#x27;d have near 70 bn bringing in 3.5 bn yearly at the moment.They don&#x27;t give any of the interest back to USDT (tether) holders.So if they printed \"only\" 10 bn out of their arses, in less than three years they&#x27;d have these 10 bn for real on interest alone.It&#x27;s still criminal (I guess) but it may not be \"0% of tether are backed\".People have tried to run the maths on how much money entered the cryptocurrency world (with Coinbase giving a huge hint).Centre (Circle+Coinbase) has really $24 bn backing their USDC coin (they publish the individual US short term treasuries bill number).USDT (tether) is much older than USDC.Did they cheat?

Take a look at the rate of growth in last decade. Yes if you look in specific timeframes it will look like a wreck. but looking at a bigger picture it makes sense. And it is given that it will keep growing similarly in the long term (Why?, thats a separate lengthy conversation the answer to which also answers why some of largest finance players are rushing to put out an ETF of BTC)Coming to the security and safety part. In theory, BTC was made with a intension to be easily usable and accessible. Once you understand it, its pretty simple and straightforward (even easier than using a bank&#x27;s service). No level of hardware wallet failure will compromise the funds because the funds are not in the wallet rather the record of the funds are in 100s of thousands of BTC nodes that is being run by miners and other enthusiasts. The real threat may be letting people that share OTPs to scammer handle their private key and seed phrase. Thats where custodians like coinbase comes in.And to the point of how to make sure the fund held by ETF&#x2F;Custodian is actually there or not, This can be easily verified. Tt is a public ledger and anyone with the public key can see how much funds are held in the wallet. This aspect of transparency is one of the key selling point of BTC.I would recommend a short and interesting read - \"Inventing Bitcoin\". reply Enogoloyo 11 hours agorootparentIf BTC would always increase in value than it&#x27;s doomed from the start as it means people starting late have to pay much more than an early person.This means rich late people will never migrate or buy BTC ETF ever.It&#x27;s like always buying at the increase reply 0xdeee 4 hours agorootparentThat’s the definition of asset appreciation. This is comparable to buying gold 100 years back vs now, no one is complaining Gold is doomed because it was dirt cheap a century ago, not did gold lose its ability to retain value because it was getting expensive. Although the rate of growth won’t be this explosive for BTC in the future as it is now.Late adopting rich people might still get into BTC ETF for its ability to maintain its value in the long term, as simple as that and doesn’t matter at what price they buy. reply Enogoloyo 2 hours agorootparentGold is getting consumed and still mined.BTC is made 1 per 10 minute.BTC is not gold reply 0xdeee 1 hour agorootparentExactly they aren’t. But they have some parallels in properties (fungible, less prone to inflation etc)But gold or any other precious metals for that matter still has a flaw of having unlimited supply. Yes the supply is limited on earth but we are only couple of decades far from mining asteroids like 16 Psyche.Flood the market with gold, it will drastically lose its value and this will indeed help its consumption like manufacturing of electronics etc but gold as an asset would be pointless.This cannot happen in BTC, which is programmed to have finite supply. replytock 15 hours agorootparentprevI believe the fee = the ETF holds bitcoin securely for you instead of you having to deal with wallets. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 15 hours agorootparentYes, how does the ETF hold and secure the coins is what I&#x27;m asking. reply scrlk 15 hours agorootparentBlackrock will be using Coinbase as their custodian: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coinbase.com&#x2F;prime&#x2F;custodyIt&#x27;s the institutional version of their Vault feature: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coinbase.com&#x2F;vault> 98% of digital currency is stored totally offline, in geographically distributed safe deposit boxes and physical vaults. reply tock 15 hours agorootparentprevMost likely some sort of cold wallet. With some in hot wallets for liquidity. There are many crypto custodians who do this.Now they do have to design redundancies for the keys. eg. they should not lose access to the assets because say they made it too safe and cant find the keys anymore :pIt&#x27;s funny because it happened with Prime Trust a crypto custodian. But I&#x27;m sure a company like BlackRock can and will do better. reply thinkharderdev 15 hours agorootparentprevI have no idea, but I assume that if they get hacked they are liable for that. If the ETF is run by Bob&#x27;s Bitcoin ETF incorporated in the Virgin Islands then that&#x27;s not worth anything because there are no other assets to cover losses.

Don Harrison, Google’s head of partnership, said that Spotify pays no fees when it processes its own payments and pays a measly 4% fee when Google processes them, the publication noted. He also said that both companies have committed to put $50 million each in a “success fund.” The details surfaced today after Google requested the court to keep the specifics of its deal with Spotify sealed earlier in the month. Google typically takes a 15% cut on subscription apps. This fee could be reduced to 11% due to programs like user choice billing, which allows developers to use their own or third-party payment solutions. “A small number of developers that invest more directly in Android and Play may have different service fees as part of a broader partnership that includes substantial financial investments and product integrations across different form factors. These key investment partnerships allow us to bring more users to Android and Play by continuously improving the experience for all users and creating new opportunities for all developers,” Google spokesperson Dan Jackson said in a statement. Google has tried to strike similar Play Store deals with large companies as well. Earlier this month, The Verge reported that the search giant offered Netflix a deal in 2017 to just pay a 10% fee on Play Store for subscriptions. Netflix doesn’t allow users to buy subscriptions through the Android app at the moment. Last month, the Mountain View-based company reached a settlement with Match Group to let the dating app giant use third-party billing solutions on the Play Store. Match Group’s rival Bumble was part of the user choice billing program pilot started in November 2022. Epic, however, rejected Google’s offers to adopt user choice billing and went to trial earlier this month. The trial has uncovered many details about Google Play Store’s inner workings. For example, in 2021, the company offered $197 million to Epic to bring Fortnite to the Play Store, but the gaming company refused the deal. Separately, Google has tried to strike multimillion-dollar deals with other game makers such as Activision Blizzard and Tencent’s Riot Games.

Israel isn’t even fully convinced an attack was eminent, despite you being confident. Even other members of Hamas provide evidence on your behalf, but it looks bad for everyone involved that torture was needed. It’s much better looking to the general intelligence establishment that you acted ina rogue manner doing something that may have at best helped a little and at worst had ignited a whole international crisis of torture of a Palestinian.I think for a lot of people they would be fine to just see how things play out and later say “if we tortured this guy who later admitted to know we could’ve stopped the attack”. reply coldtea 11 hours agorootparentprevYou really think in that case they&#x27;d be bound by the President&#x27;s likes and dislikes?

The problem is that &#x27;unconstitutional&#x27; is in the eye of the beholder. Take for example the classic \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\". Does this mean all gun control laws are unconstitutional or does it mean that gun control laws are implicit in what it means to be a &#x27;A well regulated Militia&#x27;; the army for example has a ton of rules about guns.

New SCOTUS precedent doesn&#x27;t magically change the past.> Next, well regulated never meant lots of regulations. It meant well trained and in good working order. 1800s Oxford dictionary.The 1766 definition reads:\"Properly controlled, governed, or directed; subject to guidance or regulations.\"Textualism&#x2F;Originalism is just cherry picking things like this to justify the decision the majority was going to make anyways, which is why someone sought out just the right definition from just the right source from decades after the drafting of the 2nd amendment.It&#x27;s weird that they had to resort to this, because you could totally make a convincing case for private firearm ownership based on state militias and how they evolved. There&#x27;s room for guaranteeing the individual ownership right under the Militia act of 1903 - any male aged 17 to 45 is eligible for \"unorganized\" state militia service unconnected to the various state-level military branches. That apparently is not their desired outcome, so one presumes this is why they did not pursue this avenue. reply SV_BubbleTime 8 hours agorootparent>Prior to 2008 it was. New SCOTUS precedent doesn&#x27;t magically change the past.It really wasn&#x27;t. Had Miller not be basically defaulted on by death, but decided anyhow... this would have been clear earlier. Just because you don&#x27;t like it - never made it any less of an individual right... You know, the second one in the section where all the other individual civil rights are - or was that an organizing mistake on their part?Your definition is very interesting in that it seems to be a clear case of revisionist history, or a complete fabrication.

Then give the Second Amendment another read, since that is what it is referring to with the usage of the word \"Militia\". Then go read the Militia acts of 1792&#x2F;1795&#x2F;1862 and finally 1903. It&#x27;s all really straightforward, and each thing logically follows the next. Miller follows along in that vein. There&#x27;s nothing revisionist about it; it&#x27;s all really straightforward.Where things get crooked in the reasoning is literally the Heller decision. Somehow it refers to the first Militia act with the decision referring to \"able bodied men\", while then concluding that \"Militia\" in the 2A does not actually mean \"Militia\". It&#x27;s pretty bonkers.You seem to be as willing to cherry pick as the conservative SCOTUS majority was in 2008. It&#x27;s kind of nuts, because what I cited above, actually does already provide for private firearm ownership (with some boundaries around it). It&#x27;s quite obvious that the reason for the much more convoluted reasoning in Heller is because the conservative majority wanted to greatly expand gun rights, and had to work backward from that goal to something that gave them enough of a fig leaf to ignore the (massive, self-evident) history of Militias and their regulation. reply RajT88 4 hours agorootparentNow - if I needed more to support my point (which any honest reading would make clear that I don&#x27;t), you can have a look at the influence the Federalist Society had on the Heller case:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federalist_Society#District_of...Note the 2 members of the society who voted on Heller, and the extra ones which currently sit on the court. And also note the 2 additional members who have some sympathetic relationship to the group although are not explicitly mentioned as members. That gets you 4&#x2F;5 of the 5 votes on Heller. 5 sitting SCOTUS as of this writing.QED, Heller was highly partisan and a break from hundreds of years of precedent. You&#x27;d be hard pressed to make an honest case otherwise. reply SV_BubbleTime 4 hours agorootparentYou can post revisionist nonsense “interpreted” and put up by people with agendas all you like.

It is precisely intended to be the insurance of last resort against a government that turns tyrannical.

This is why I think this sort of reasoning about the constitution is kinda dumb. Even if we could divine what the Founders thought, frankly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that relevant. They are not exactly experts on how government should work. Yes, they did the best they could at the time, but with all the biases and issues of the time. As an example, they also thought that only white landowners should vote, but advocating for that today would get you smacked down pretty quickly.And regarding 2A, it&#x27;d also be reasonable to expect that same person from the 1700s didn&#x27;t actually think every random person should have a musket, but that only people who are a part of a \"well-regulated militia\" should have access to one. reply coldtea 10 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what the relevance of the above is. As I already said, people who say either of those are making a bad disingenuous argument.I&#x27;m not saying either of those though, and didn&#x27;t in my comment you responded to. I said that people who say a \"well regulated militia\" is not the same as \"random individual who likes guns\" are making an argument exactly in the intended spirit of the constitution.Nothing to do with a disingenuous argument about \"gun technology then vs now\" or \"press means just printing presses or newspapers\".So, yeah, if those rednecks form a actual state-run or even citizen-run militia they could have their guns, nice modern guns, in the context of that militia and for the purposes of that militia (and with the proper precautions and rules like police or army has for its guns).I don&#x27;t see where the constitutional&#x27;s expression, as written, allows them to just have whetever guns they like as private individuals, even less so guns for fun and entertainment.I&#x27;d go one better: what some document from 4 centuries ago says, should have no absolute hold to what the law is in a country 4 centuries later. It was what they came up with at the time, to respond to the problems of the time, as they saw them in the viewpoints of the time. All of them are dead now, and the demographics and issues are absolutely not even close to being them same. reply underseacables 12 hours agorootparentprevInterpretation is an issue, just look at the way President Biden, and President Trump are being treated with regards to retention of classified documents. One is being prosecuted, the other is not. That&#x27;s a very broad and public example, but the party in power typically does not prosecute its own. reply bdzr 12 hours agorootparentOne turned over the classified documents. reply kelnos 9 hours agorootparentprevWell.One person retained said documents, bragged about having them, disclosed their contents to random, non-cleared people, lied about having declassified them, and then when the government asked them back, lied again and claimed he didn&#x27;t have them, instructed his underlings to hide or destroy them, and obstructed the subsequent investigation.The other person didn&#x27;t realize he had them, returned them promptly when they were found, and cooperated with the ensuing investigation.If you really think these two things are the same, I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re going to have a productive conversation with anyone who wants to argue in good faith.Also note that it&#x27;s not just Biden who fell into that second category; Pence did as well. Funny how you didn&#x27;t see the need to mention Pence. And good on him for also cooperating and returning what he had. reply ikiris 12 hours agorootparentprevDo you think this is a good faith argument? What might be differences in these situations that aren&#x27;t based on simple \"other party bad\"? reply bunabhucan 12 hours agorootparentprevOne is being charged with obstruction and retaining documents. There&#x27;s no evidence of obstruction for Biden or Pence. If either of them told their attorney to \"hide or destroy\" documents then they would be receiving the same treatment. reply appleskeptic 12 hours agorootparentprevThis would be awful. Theft and bribery are already prosecuted aggressively. If anything, too much. It’s gotten to the point that high government officials can’t afford to be lobbied. Here they are, some of the most powerful people in the world, paid barely enough to live an hour drive away from DC, having to spend a fair bit of their personal income to go to lunch and dinner with leaders of private industry.As for criminalizing “waste”, you start to get dangerously close to criminalizing politics itself. Then it just becomes about controlling DOJ and using it to go after your enemies (this is already too true).The better thing to do would with regards to intelligence agency abuses would be to have more review of the decisions, mandatory discipline of rulebreakers, and prosecution of specific crimes committed for egregious cases. No need to generally criminalize every time a government official makes a bad judgment call. reply jpk 12 hours agorootparentYou seem to be arguing that we have a system where theft and bribery are necessary in some way, and therefore we shouldn&#x27;t prosecute it aggressively. Wouldn&#x27;t we rather reform the system such that it makes theft and bribery less attractive? reply appleskeptic 4 hours agorootparentNo, I’m saying the definition of bribery has been stretched so far to include ballpoint pens, a $30 lunch or free attendance at a conference, at the same time that high officials are underpaid, so as to place an absurd financial burden on middle-class people holding high office. No one says that a CEO who meets a potential supplier who buys him lunch is being bribed. But if a politician does that, it’s a crime somehow. Frankly absurd. reply 15457345234 4 hours agorootparentprev> You seem to be arguingThe sarcasm is positively dripping from that post reply tehwebguy 12 hours agorootparentprev> It’s gotten to the point that high government officials can’t afford to be lobbied.Good! But also, not true! reply underseacables 12 hours agorootparentprevYour comment brought to mind the number of IRS employees who are delinquent on their taxes. I think it really comes down to trust. You say that the government is already investigated enough, but I would contend that it&#x27;s really the government investigating itself. If there is a separate, independent agency that investigates government and employee malfeasance, then at least there can be some check, accountability, and maybe transparency.I can understand your focus with intelligent agency abusive, but I think the problem is much more systemic, and far greater than simply the intelligence agencies. People who work in the public trust should be held to a higher standard.\"According to the FY 2021 FERDI Annual Report, IRS employees had a 1.35 percent delinquency rate, compared to 4.93 percent for civilian workers throughout the Federal Government.\" That number should really be zero. reply kelnos 9 hours agorootparentSo IRS employees are now magically exempt from making mistakes in life, just because they&#x27;re IRS employees? I think it&#x27;s good that the rate of delinquency is lower for IRS employees, but I think expecting it to be zero is a bit much.But sure, that should be fixed. Just like the 5% of other workers who should get their tax situation in hand. Just like how all the private citizens who are delinquent should get their tax situation in hand.I&#x27;m not really sure how this oversight agency you advocate would even work. How would it be independent? Who would fund it? How would you ensure that its members aren&#x27;t biased or influenced in any way? Ultimately these sorts of agencies are staffed by real humans, not automatons with perfect, disinterested software. I agree with the desire for this sort of thing, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all practical. reply SV_BubbleTime 12 hours agorootparentprev> It’s gotten to the point that high government officials can’t afford to be lobbied.Of all the sad things I’ve read today, this one is surely the saddest.

Our legal system is fundamentally broken as long as we consider wealth, career, politics, personal connections, etc before filing charges and trying a case. reply advisedwang 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not sure having police investigating our elected officials is such a good thing. If you look at corruption investigations of high level officials in history, they are very frequently partisan attacks. For example, the investigation into Lula da Silva turned out to have been driven by a group of right wing judges and prosecutors that had his ouster as a goal, not justice.It&#x27;s not even a question of whether corruption happens! Of course it does. E.g. maybe Lula did some kind of wrongdoing. However frequent and highly publicized corruption investigations put the power in the hands of police, prosecutors and judges and takes it away from democratic means. Frankly, I&#x27;d rather have a little bit of corruption than allow police to say who is an acceptable leader.Part of the issue is that there is a lot of grey area in what even counts as corruption. What counts as \"violating the constitution\" is even greyer, especially in the US where the constitution itself is short, vague and poorly phrased leaving decisions on what is constitutional to be a political question in itself. reply matheusmoreira 12 hours agoparentprevIt will be fine so long as there&#x27;s no corruption.

This isn’t some conspiracy theory, but is well documented in the history of policing in the USA, both at the local and federal level.It is a tool used by the ownership class (via selective enforcement) to legally mitigate threats to their social, economic, and political dominance.This is why minorities are disproportionately represented in prison for disproportionately minor crimes, and why rich white people doing the same drugs don’t generally get in any trouble.This is also why police, the essential enforcers in the system, are generally permitted to commit as much minor crime (except against members of the ownership class) as they wish. The system falls down without their cooperation.Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. reply yieldcrv 12 hours agoparentprevDeveloped nations laugh at our checks and balances, because we believe in thembUt aT LeAst wE cAN tALK aBoUt It reply Throw10987 12 hours agorootparentBelieve me it is not laughing in a good way, it is more a nervous laughter with a permanent sinking feeling in the stomach kind of way.The collective &#x27;we&#x27; developed nations have our own set of problems, but broadly speaking from time to time self correct away from polarisation to hopefully enough of a degree.A unique kind of leadership needs to be allowed to grow in America to stear a less polarised course. reply yieldcrv 12 hours agorootparentI know, theyre laughing at us because we think our compromisestitution is a feature reply pipo234 14 hours agoprevBrilliant.

There is a strong dividing line between those two organizations, resulting from some very bad misbehavior by the FBI and CIA in the 1950s and 60s. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was set up to allow some agencies to collect information on non-Americans using techniques they&#x27;d never allow on citizens, while other agencies can use a more restricted set of techniques on Americans.After 9&#x2F;11 they breached that somewhat, because of a (not entirely well-founded) belief that the separation kept them from preventing the attack.Those are the two ends of the spectrum being debated here: harassing Martin Luther King on the one side, and 9&#x2F;11 on the other.

This is most important in the case of set x = 7, the keyword makes it clear that we&#x27;re trying to mutate a variable, not assert equality.Even though technically we could make forward() a method at the top level in the context of a paint program, we chose to make things more OOPy to prepare them for later when students get to the 2D game engine and there can be multiple sprites to control. reply wruza 11 hours agorootparentI always wanted `set` in regular languages instead of (or in addition to) =&#x2F;==.Edit: well actually, I want a whole development studio like this for professional development.

Better than Python in many ways (e.g. it has `var` and `const`). reply omneity 13 hours agoprevCongrats for launching Pickcode! The attention to detail is great and shows that you care.As an aside on the topic at large, I find there are (at least) two schools of thought in the visual programming space, when intending to make programming more accessible to non-developers.Some efforts focus on reducing the overhead of learning syntax, by leveraging the visual interface, but do not hide their imperative nature nor the need for an algorithmic mindset. In effect we can think of these as IDEs but with varying levels of accessibility. I surmise that Pickcode and Scratch belong to this category.Other groups explore different programming paradigms instead, that might fit the visual metaphor to varying levels of success. They also induce different mindsets to their users compared to imperative programming. Node-red is a great example of this, which explores flow based programming (a close relative of functional reactive programming). Another is Labview, a dataflow-based close relative with more magic in it (really rather smart defaults and naming of internal variables). Apple Automator also comes to mind.I don&#x27;t think either pattern is necessarily better or worse. I just find it useful to think of this distinction (imperative vs reactive) for visual languages, which leads to very different end-user experiences. reply matsemann 11 hours agoparentYour post reminded me of how teaching an elm (a functional language) workshop to novices was almost simpler than to professionals.

I wish there were something like this for working adult programmers, a general purpose structured editor for programming languages. When I program the intentions I form are in the first instance semantic (define a function here, check a condition there). Why shouldn&#x27;t I just directly communicate my semantic intentions to the editor? Why do I have to first serialize my intentions into a string for the editor to then parse, in a error-prone process which introduces the possibility of silly syntactic errors like typos, mismatched brackets, operator precedence errors etc, rather than just semantic incorrectness?Such an editor wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have to be keyboard unfriendly any more than Excel is keyboard unfriendly. I guess it could also work something like input method editors for East Asian languages where you type into a \"composition window\" and make selections from a \"candidate window\" for insertion. reply jerf 14 hours agoparentMany have tried this. It is definitely not in the class of \"nobody else has thought of this\" so much as \"tons of people have thought of this and tried it and smash up against some major problems right away\".AIUI, in this case, the major issue is that it is very tempting to try to impose a constraint that all intermediate states the code passes through are semantically valid. However while superficially appealing this turns out to be a crippling constraint. Even the best of us tend to think in somewhat more sloppy terms and then fix up code after the fact, even on a line-by-line basis. Being forced to be completely valid 100% of the time turns out to be a big mismatch. I am inclined to believe this mismatch is fundamental. Only vanishing fractions of a percent of humans, if any, think this way. Even professional mathematicians report that they tend to work this way in practice, in that they tend to leap ahead and then back-fill the rigor, rather than strictly working forward one step at a time, and if even they don&#x27;t work in this manner, who does?Programming has settled on semantically-aware autocomplete and suggestions, and that&#x27;s probably the actual optimum, not just a symptom of some kind of laziness.It is possible that if somebody really pushed through the development that the problems are solvable, but I&#x27;d advise anyone taking it on that if there&#x27;s any fruit here, and there may well be, it is not low hanging.As saurik mentioned, the Lisp world through emacs is the closest you can get to this, but again AIUI you can still do anything you want, it&#x27;s just that you have a lot of tools that encourage \"more\" semanticness, not that it is enforced absolutely rigidly. reply hyperthesis 13 hours agorootparentA related concept is compilers that keep going after the first error.

I think this makes it easier for kids to pick it up and start playing without specific instruction or tutoring.After following the first couple of steps of the rectangle tutorial, I started clicking around and doing my own thing. I ended up with \"call math paint.forward()\", giving me a syntax error. Obviously that line is garbage, but I can&#x27;t figure out how the math instruction is supposed to work.

Says, you manipulated the blocks and one was popped out, the program will still run but don’t work correctly.

At the time, it seemed a little magical to me that it knew whether you wanted to type a word&#x2F;number versus a keyword, and what kind of keyword (but really, the pedagogically relevant aspect was that I knew).BTW Significant to the ZX81 was the memory saved by storing tokens instead of their text representation.

But in fact, there&#x27;s nothing inherent about the medium of animation which necessarily makes it just \"for kids\", and another culture (Japan) which does not have that cultural assumption got some great art out of it (Anime).It&#x27;s weird what we decide is \"for kids\" and limit ourselves. reply xigency 5 hours agoprevAs someone who has worked in this space before, using Blockly to help teach Arduino coding to kids, this looks fantastic!Keep up the good work. reply sagarpatil 5 hours agoprevThis is awesome.

She teached Python herself a couple of years ago and they are teaching it now in her class. She can&#x27;t understand how her classmates can have difficulties understanding x = 5 y = 6 z = x + yI asked the value of z to a 30 yo that was listening to the conversation and he first answered 5 + 6, then looked at us, thought again and said 11.The student then told me that some of the other students eventually understood that z takes the value of 11 but their question was \"how a machine can do that\" and nobody answered to them. I wonder if a little of assembler on a toy CPU could be a better starting point. For example this Machine Code for Kids card game [1] They are selling the cards from the home page of the site (I&#x27;m not affiliated with them, I just bought a few decks.)Or a two bits binary adder with logic gates.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;punkx.org&#x2F;4917&#x2F;guide.html reply jfarmer 16 hours agoparentI sometimes use a Turing Tumble to demonstrate this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upperstory.com&#x2F;turingtumble&#x2F;I&#x27;ve also had occasional success first convincing them they know how to add \"mindlessly\", by just manipulating symbols, and then explaining that we can have machines do it mindlessly, too. I don&#x27;t use those words, ofc.For example, you might ask them \"Imagine you had a younger sibling who couldn&#x27;t add. Maybe they didn&#x27;t even know what numbers were. Could you teach them how to add by just telling them what symbols to write down as they looked through the symbols in the addition problem? Maybe there&#x27;s an index card labeled &#x27;6+3&#x27; and on it is written &#x27;9&#x27;. You tell them to look for the correct index card and write down the corresponding symbol.\"You can also explain binary to any interested student who is 13+ and then the idea that a machine can do it becomes a lot easier.This video of Richard Feynman explaining how computers works is very good: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MAHe uses a metaphor I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of. Imagine you have a clerk who can add and multiply like a regular person. Now imagine there&#x27;s someone else who knows only how to add and count, but have no idea what multiplication is.If they can add and count fast enough, it&#x27;ll look to an outsider like they not only know what multiplication is, but they can do any multiplication problem almost instantly.Computers are like that: dumb but fast.If they do something fast enough they give the illusion of \"understanding\", kind of like movies give the illusion of motion by swapping out still images fast enough. reply MichaelRo 16 hours agoparentprev>> She can&#x27;t understand how her classmates can have difficulties understandingBecause most people are completely illiterate with respect to mathematics.

My granddad was an impulse electronics guy, so before receiving a PC I already knew how transistors, triggers, counters, registers, adders work. He built a simple \"CPU\"-like thing from some journal out of ICs and explained how it works step by step. Later it helped to clear the gaps between `z = x + y`, `adc b` and something =▯- and -| For professional programmers, the editor is probably pretty frustrating to use (no vim keybindings!)It is not the lack of vim keybindings that&#x27;s causing frustration, it&#x27;s the lack of almost any keyboard input or ability to type in if you know what you are trying to enter and being forced to search for operators within tiny scrollable 3x3 grid. Either the editing should be a lot more constrained with clearly displayed placeholder slots like it is in scratch, or the editor should allow typing in expressions using keyboard.Consider that the goal of project is helping transitioning from block editing to more practically used programming languages -> I would suggest exploring the second approach. Keep the current menu input method, but when a user presses a key insert or start editing appropriate type token. That is if the expression insertion menu is open and user presses a number key just start editing a number, they would have to use keyboard for entering it anyway if they clicked on number input button in the dropdown. Similar if you press + key, and + is token that&#x27;s currently available in the insertion dropdown just insert &#x27;+&#x27;.Other pain point was editing. At statement level I would say it&#x27;s reasonable, but expression level any editing felt miserable. In some cases it felt like simplest way of editing is erasing everything, in other moments it felt like some kind of bad Levenshtein distance code golfing. Lets say you have expression `a+b` and you later decide to change it to `(a+b)*c`. Your options are either erase everything and rewrite from scratch or insert &#x27;()&#x27; before a+b, insert &#x27;()&#x27; after a+b, erase ) from first parentheses pair, erase ( from second parentheses pair, add * and c. Neither plaintext editing nor good block based code editing have this problem. Also you can&#x27;t select and copy or move anything except whole statements.Overall with exception of top level statements, it hardly enforces any structure of code and you can enter almost arbitrary sequence of expression tokens forming an invalid expression.That kind of defeats the point of having somewhat structured non typing based input.Bug: In chromium the insertion dropdown shows 3x3 grid, but scrolling with mousewheel scrolls by 4 lines. Meaning you can&#x27;t easily select anything from 4th row like &#x27;*&#x27;. Can&#x27;t you just show all the operators? Even on mobile phone there should be enough space to show 3x9 or 5x5 grid.Bug2: drag and dropping an if statement inside itself caused the page to hangup. Infinite loop? While dragging a statement with nested statements like if or while should highlight the whole block not just the first line. reply csmeyer 13 hours agoparentWow, thanks for all the feedback! I agree that expression level editing can get pretty cumbersome at times, it&#x27;s the biggest design challenge in the editor I think. One thing we may add is a toggle to edit expressions in plain text and parse them back into the visual bubbles.Re: the fact that syntax errors are possible: it is really really hard to make an editor where invalid states are impossible while trying to make expressions easy to enter. Scratch and other block languages do this by forcing you to write code in prefix order. I want to PLUS 2 and 3, vs in Pickcode where you write 2 + 3, and the expression is in an invalid state before you enter the 3. Rewriting 2 + 3 to 2 + (2 + 1) is really hard when you have to think in prefix notation. One advantage that we have is when there are syntax errors, they are necessarily at the expression level, so in the worst case the student can just scrap the line and start over, vs in plain text where the error message for a mismatched paren could land lines later. reply dgudkov 12 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s not visual. reply swayvil 11 hours agoprevI was writing pretty cool stuff in c64 basic when I was 10.

It&#x27;s \"only for numbers\", so really think spreadsheet-formula type complexity, but I won&#x27;t stop anybody from going wild with interpretation.To see things you pair it with some other language like JS, but code for these \"apps\" can be simple&#x2F;declarative and pre-rolled. I have a JS visualization library that will probably be graphical one day.I&#x27;m working on the project website [1]. Following spreadsheet fashion some examples are a little bore, but there is a raycaster rendering to a bar chart and heart shapes, bouncing balls and projectiles, to lighten the mood for early developer-adopters or contributors.For some more project background: by encapsulating numbers in a language (and not a mad one and one that we can safely and actually run), it can facilitate transparency for numbers. Transparency and education go hand-in-hand. I&#x27;m talking about numerical literacy primarily, but I think that too goes hand-in-hand with.. programming on computers.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calculang-quarto-site-messing.pages.dev&#x2F;examples reply bittwiddle 15 hours agoparentprevI built a game you might find interesting.

It probably depends a lot on the child and the teacher—a functional programming language would probably appeal more to older kids (high school) who are comfortable with math.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38366268 reply indigochill 16 hours agorootparent> even python might be too far from the CPU to be a good introduction to computingIMO Python is useful as a didactic tool not so much for teaching kids how computers work as for giving them an emotional experience of \"Wow, I can make the computer do things! I&#x27;m basically a wizard!\" that then might motivate some of them to keep learning about computing.But yeah, there will also be kids who are already well past that stage and ready for meatier stuff. So probably a combination of approaches is best to provide kids with the level of detail they&#x27;ll find most engaging.Anecdotally, I grew up on Logo, Lego Mindstorms, and HTML, and got my early career started in Python before I really dug in and learned about how hardware makes the magic happen because I realized I was going to be handicapped until I knew that. reply george_____t 10 hours agorootparentprev> even python might be too far from the CPU to be a good introduction to computingThat depends on what one considers to be the best way to introduce computing.

I think it’s conceptually simpler, for example, to demonstrate how a function that can’t have side-effects works than one that doesn’t by pure “accident”. The real trouble is when you want the program to do anything actually useful, like interact with anything (input&#x2F;output). And since that’s where the vast majority of programming is spent, I tend to agree that imperative first is a better approach. reply uticus 16 hours agoprev> To me, block coding is too far removed from regular coding for kids to make the connection...provides a much clearer transition path for students to Python&#x2F;JS&#x2F;Java.Personally I wonder what the ultimate goal is.

Others also show changes to text-based code when changes are made to graphical-based [1], but I haven&#x27;t seen any that allow working backwards, so that clicking or changing graphical highlights and shows how text changes.

The Pyret language has been developed with the express intention of taking completely novice programmers, teaching them how to program in a language with reasonable semantics [1], and progressively add language features until they eventually switch to Python. The language is integrated into the DCIC course [2].The idea of a language that can progressively gain features was (to the best of my knowledge) pioneered by Racket. The idea is that a particular file can be declared at a specific \"language level\" (I think that&#x27;s the terminology), which restricts the set of features available to the user. Over the course of the semester, new features can be added as they are taught. The advantage of this approach is that students do not accidentally encounter surprising semantics that they inadvertently internalize to the detriment of their long-term learning.The Pyret project is actually spearheaded by Shriram Krishnamurthi at Brown University, who was on the original Racket team. His career has focuses on the application of PL theory and tooling to computer science education. One of his most recent publications is particularly interesting with regard to the present topic, which is an experience report detailing what happens when students move from Racket to Pyret and from Pyret to Python [3].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyret.org[1] While my use of the word \"reasonable\" is certainly opinionated, what I mean is that Python&#x27;s semantics are simply unintuitive to many novices. I&#x27;ve forgotten the title of the paper I read that analyzed this, but a related paper is \"Python: The Full Monty\", which develops a small-step operational semantics for the core Python language. Many of the specific semantics are surprising even to seasoned Python developers!

Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, has kept a list of companies that have succumbed to ethical collapse, some for the second time. These are companies like General Electric, Merrill Lynch, AT&T, Arthur Andersen, United Health Group. There are so many, in fact, that she’s running out of room on the PowerPoint slide she uses for presentations and had to squeeze in the final entry “the stock options (160 companies).” “These are great companies, great organizations, good people,” Jennings stressed. “But they’re on this list for one reason—they crossed an ethical line.” The list grows almost daily. But it doesn’t have to, she insisted. In her presentation at the April 5, 2007 meeting of the Business and Organizational Ethics Partnership, entitled “Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse: How to Spot Moral Meltdowns Before it’s Too Late” (based on her book by the same title), Jennings noted common characteristics of the misguided companies. Had they heeded the warning signs, she said, they could have employed potent antidotes (which she also presented) to prevent the moral meltdowns. These were not close calls, she emphasized. “These are companies that really crossed very bright lines.” The common threads that she’s found that make good people at great companies do really dumb, unethical things include: Pressure to maintain numbers Fear and silence Young ‘uns and a bigger-than-life CEO Weak board of directors Conflicts of interest overlooked or unaddressed Innovation like no other company Goodness in some areas atones for evil in others 1. Pressure to maintain numbers “In all of these companies, they had enormously high rates of return—double-digit growth—and they said, ‘We’re going to keep it rolling,’” Jennings said. Many had so-called “Monday morning beatings,” where employees had to account for not meeting their numbers. Such expectations scream for ethical breaches, she cautioned. Instead, focus on the long-term and realistic expectations. For example, a grocery store chain just outside Hurricane Katrina’s path experienced a 300 percent growth in earnings after the storm as thousands of people flooded their service area. Consequently, huge employee incentive bonuses kicked in due to the phenomenal and unsolicited growth in business. The biggest challenge the CEO faced the following year was in convincing employees to face up to the fact that there was no way they could achieve those numbers the following year. “If you’re getting those numbers because you’re better, you’re smarter, and you’re working harder, more power to you,” Jennings said. But managers have to be careful not to be sending the message that higher numbers must be achieved at any cost. Slogans like “find a way,” “whatever it takes,” and “sharpen your pencil,” emphasize short-term gain over long-term sustainability and encourage employees to cut ethical corners. “Help employees distinguish between superior skill and foresight, versus cheating,” she advised. 2. Fear and silence Jennings noted that front-line employees never miss an ethical issue. “To front-line employees, the line between right and wrong is very bright. Something happens to people as they climb up through management, she said. The bright line seems to fade. The challenge is getting information about ethical breeches from the front line up to the right people who will take action. Too often, fear and silence thwart those efforts. Jennings recently worked with a company that had quite an impressive ethics program in place. Best practice. An ethics hotline. An anonymous on-line reporting system. “Technically, it was beautiful,” she said. But an employee revealed an issue in talking with Jennings that the professor felt management should know about. Jennings suggested she use the hotline. No, the employee countered, they’d trace the call. Use the online reporting system. No, the employee lamented, they’d trace the IP address. Send an anonymous letter, with no return address and mail it from another city. No, the employee protested, they’d trace it back to her by analyzing the DNA on the envelope. “That is profound fear,” Jennings said. Companies intentionally or unintentionally foster that fear in a number of ways. If an employee raises an issue and nothing is done, the whistleblower feels stupid and management signals that they’re not listening. If an employee raises an ethical issue and they’re terminated, the company intensifies that fear and signals that employees should just remain silent. And silent employees “shoot your safety record to heck. If they’re coming to work upset about something, they start messing up, so you don’t want that,” Jennings said. Another possibility, much more insidious and more difficult to address, is when an employee raises an ethical issue and instead of being terminated, they’re “flat-lined,” labeled a troublemaker and transferred into corporate oblivion. The way to avoid fear and silence is to encourage open dialogue, allow anonymous reporting without repercussions, provide swift response and follow-up, have the issues reviewed by the board, hand down appropriate disciplinary actions to wrongdoers, and reward whistleblowers. Key to making this work is ensuring that enforcement is absolute, unequivocal, and egalitarian. As one of Jennings’ students observed during a discussion about tolerance for a manager who “borrowed” three bottles of vodka from the company on a Friday night for a party outside of work and brought in replacements on Monday morning, “If the janitor had taken the liquor, he would have been fired.” If it’s wrong for the janitor to do, it’s wrong for the CEO. 3. Young ‘uns and a bigger-than-life CEO Often, Jennings pointed out, companies that get into trouble have a CEO a full generation older than the direct reports. The inexperienced underlings tend to lack the moxie to question the iconic boss. “I hire them just like me: smart, poor, and want to be rich,” she quoted former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski as saying. “People say GE was a mess after Jack Welch left,” she went on. “Actually, they were a mess when Jack Welch was there, but we really weren’t looking at the numbers. As long as the CEO is so highly regarded, we don’t ask the questions.” A bigger than life CEO need not spell trouble. Question the icon, and help the inexperienced direct reports. “Ethics requires daily effort, reinforcement and training. Without it, you slip, because everyone believes they’re ethical, no matter what they’re doing,” Jennings said. Introspection is the key. “Everyone in the company has to look long and hard at what you’re doing,” she said. The company is on the right track if it’s willing to let anyone in the organization say, “Wait a minute, is this really something we should be doing?” 4. A Weak Board of Directors Weak boards tend to have inexperienced members, often ones who are too young to have experienced a complete business cycle, which was often the case with companies in the dot-com boom. Often they have ethical conflicts of interest as well, in terms of consulting arrangements, related party transactions, even incestuous philanthropy in which huge donations are made to board members’ favorite charities. To counterbalance weak boards, management needs “a good mind and a strong backbone.” Dig deep on conflicts. Don’t fall for governance myths of stock ownership, 10-year limits, mandatory retirement, or nomination by shareholders. They don’t work, Jennings says. Instead, pay attention to perks. Know industry accounting standards. And manage by walking around. “Employees will talk to you face-to-face. Don’t micromanage, but get face-to-face,” she advised. 5. Culture of conflicts A post Sarbanes-Oxley survey in 2003 by the SEC revealed that 47 percent of companies purchased or sold insiders’ products or services. Thirty-nine percent made loans to executives. Thirty-five percent purchased legal or banking services from directors. Twenty-one percent bought, sold, or invested in companies insiders owned. Jennings believes that conflicts of interest affect board members’ decisions, whether consciously or not. “Human nature makes you beholden.” The antidote is simple, she said. “There are two ways to handle conflicts of interest. Either don’t do it or disclose it. That’s it.” In geographies like Silicon Valley, conflicts of interest grow rapidly over time. It is impossible to find individuals to serve on boards who don’t have some connection with the company. In many ways, their knowledge and past relationships are an advantage. However, it is critical that these past relationships or activities be disclosed, and an assessment made that the potential director can recuse himself/herself in any matter related to them and still function as an effective advisor, counselor, and overseer of the organization’s management and business processes. 6. Innovation like no other Too many companies that melt down felt they were above the fray because they were so innovative. Consider the remark of Sanjay Kumar, former CEO of Computer Associates. “…standard accounting rules [were] not the best way to measure [CA’s] results because it had changed to a new business model offering its clients more flexibility.” He entered a guilty plea to fraud. The dot-com companies amused her the most. “I just love this—at the height of the dot-com losses, they would always say, ‘You know, if we hadn’t had all those expenses, we would have made money!’ In their minds, they were different,” Jennings said. The antidotes are really very simple. She advised executives to understand business history and economic cycles. Depend on the basics of business: keep costs low; keep quality high; focus on customer service. “The basics of business and accounting never change. The innovators often fancy themselves immune from the business cycle, but history teaches us differently,” she pointed out. “Also, just knowing the story of the ’29 crash or the gold rush teaches us that the survivors are, for example, Levi’s—the company that sold the gold miners their pants. Dull and certainly not innovative, but quality and low cost keep them going.” 7. Goodness in some areas atones for evil in others Many companies will tout their culture of diversity, safety, volunteerism, or environmentally-conscious operations as evidence of their overall ethical goodness, despite improprieties elsewhere, as if two “rights” undo a “wrong.” “It’s more than just money. You’ve got to give back to the community that supported you,” Jennings quoted John Rigas as saying. She also pointed out that while he was CEO of Adelphia, he “gave back” to his daughter and others in business with him. “I’m enormously skeptical now. When companies stand up and go on about their ethics and social responsibility, I start digging, because the more they say, the more I worry about what’s really going on,” she said. Remedies for the good/evil balancing act include rethinking the popular notions of social responsibility and business and rethinking company activities, perceptions, and realities. Be very skeptical about “doing well by doing good.” Instead, companies need to rely on virtue ethics and simplicity: truth, honestly, fairness, and egalitarianism. Avoiding moral meltdowns Ultimately, Jennings summed up, leadership and example matter. Culture is to company what character is to individuals. Culture comes from the collective actions and responses of leaders. Ultimately, culture depends on individuals’ characters. “We’re dependent on individuals saying, ‘No, we can’t do that,’” she stressed. Despite history repeating itself in a seemingly unending cycle of corporate corruption, Jennings remains optimistic. “I’m not willing to give up. I believe this remains fixable. The power of a single person. The power of a story. Just as a rotten apple can bring down an entire company, I’ve seen good apples take it the other way.” Feb 15, 2012 --",

In my experience the more you climb up through management the more you leave the realm of clear-cut choices and enter a world of nasty trade-offs. Do that enough times, and get your head spun around enough by trade-offs you don&#x27;t know how to navigate but have to deal with immediately, and you&#x27;ll get a kind of \"trade off numbness\". reply naasking 15 hours agoparent> and get your head spun around enough by trade-offs you don&#x27;t know how to navigate but have to deal with immediately, and you&#x27;ll get a kind of \"trade off numbness\"I wonder if this could explain why corporations grow into slow behemoths, as a kind of subconscious moral cover. Most people think the causal arrow happens one way, ie. corporations grow due to efficiencies or other factors and moral rot is a side-effect, but maybe it&#x27;s actually the other way around in some cases. Since everyone tries to see themselves as basically good, but they still want to make money and be profitable, they migrate towards structures with extra layers that provide extra plausible deniability and obfuscation of questionable moral decisions. reply dinvlad 13 hours agorootparentI think the opposite applies too - \"move fast and break things\" is a helluva excuse for doing extremely shady things and not worry about the consequences.Culture and incentives are just extremely hard to get right and align with the morals, and it&#x27;s a continuous struggle for any business. And this applies even to solo companies. reply avs733 12 hours agorootparenta mentor once referred to it as &#x27;ship fast and shout down externalities&#x27; which always stuck with meThat all being said I think for many people the ability to have a bright line is because the abstractions involved in deeply understanding these types of trade offs are not a common part of life. We are (nearly) universally worse at the types of reasoning (especially reasoning with abstractions) that we don&#x27;t do frequently. reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentprevA Freakonomics episode claims that corporations \"grow into slow behemoths\" because, by the nature of being successful, you tend to have more programs to maintain. So you spend more time in maintenance mode and outsource your innovation by acquiring scrappy start-ups. It&#x27;s a risk&#x2F;reward tradeoff of its own. reply overvale 13 hours agorootparentThis matches my experience. Complexity is a real problem.

Their work styles are both valuable but clash with each other. You need to ask one of them to adjust to the other&#x27;s expectations. reply overvale 13 hours agorootparentprevIs it better to lay off 10 more people and save the money or is it better to keep more people around to deal with the uncertainty of the next 6 months?

With extra people or with extra money? reply fallingfrog 4 hours agorootparentDepends on how many billions you spent on stock buybacks that year.. reply dasil003 11 hours agorootparentprevTradeoffs become multi-arm as you go up the chain. For instance, complying with the letter of the law at great engineering, operational and product UX expense, vs cutting corners to maintain a smooth UX, low operational overhead, and straightforward maintainable systems. In todays world no one is able to be experts in all those considerations. Leadership must make apples-to-oranges tradeoffs all day long, and they must rely on communication and maturity to navigate the cascading inputs of these choices. What is possible to execute on cross-functionally, in what timeline, and what are the externalities of different tradeoffs? These are fiendishly difficult to navigate, so generally financial metrics will serve as the tiebreaker, and even then it&#x27;s based on a lot of guesswork and proposals made up by self-interested internal parties over-representing an uncertain outcome. It&#x27;s no surprise that the really big ethical concerns get lost in the shuffle—there&#x27;s simply no system of checks and balances on ethics with anywhere near the effectiveness of that imparted by the incentives corporate capitalism bolstered by individual self-interest (note I avoid the word greed here since the incentives aare chained all the way down to individuals which no one would consider well-off enough to be labeled \"greedy\"). reply badpun 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s plenty of situations where you can do things right, but it will be expensive, slow or otherwise inconvenient, or you can screw someone over (that someone may be the taxpayers, or local community whose environment you pollute), and make the problem go away. reply avs733 12 hours agorootparentprevnot business but I&#x27;ll give one from my own work in academia.Do you change a requirement for a BS degree to only require 6 instead of 9 credits of research?Upside - students might graduate faster (this is one of many constraints on graduation) which saves them money and time.downsides - faculty may have less students to help with research (which helps faculty succeed via research productivity)complicating - students might do the research anyways, they can still get credit it just doesn&#x27;t officially count for anything.context: the department is responsible to both...the actual impact of both the upside and downside are functionally impossible to predict because they are part of a broader complex partially social system that will anneal itself in ways you don&#x27;t expect, metrics of success for students and faculty are important to everyone, albeit through different arms of an org chart which results in them each advocating for their metric at the expense of all others, because their success is partially evaluated on that metric.solution (this is sarcasm): remove a math course as &#x27;required&#x27; that most students get transfer credit for and have to have as a pre-requisite for other classes. Only effect is on the 2% of students who actually have to take the course.result: everyone sees change, which they want, without perceiving a risk of harmful side effects, and with no actual change to the status quo. reply btilly 16 hours agoprevI immediately sanity checked this with three examples.SBF fit amusingly well. His fraud had all of these, with Effective Altruism providing an extreme example of how goodness in some areas atones for evil in others.Stanford&#x27;s president Marc Tessier-Lavigne resigned after his reputation was found to be based on fraudulent research. Descriptions that I&#x27;ve read from those in his lab showed most of these.Enron is too canonical an example to ignore. Yes, it had all of these. reply notahacker 15 hours agoparentI think the sanity checking works better the other way round: how much of this is just corporate norms that apply to most companies above a certain size, including ones with no particularly significant ethical challenges? One of the bullet points starts off by pointing out that 47% of companies have one type of conflict of interest!CEO being higher profile and a generation older than [some of] the people sounds like a pretty normal company tbh, and probably only a major issue if the ethical issues are caused by the CEO (it technically doesn&#x27;t apply to SBF, although his reports were even less experienced and in awe of him)CSR and diversity initiatives and other corporate do-good messaging? Most companies do that to some extent, and it&#x27;s not like the ones who don&#x27;t even attempt to launder their reputations tend to be squeaky clean rather than too cynical to even try to look like they care.And sure, KPIs and stretchy sales targets can definitely cause bad behaviour and lying, but they&#x27;re also extremely common, and can be beneficial when companies actually get them right. reply whatshisface 15 hours agorootparentI am not sure if that is an objection because \"50% of companies are involved in one or more ethical violations,\" sounds plausible. reply notahacker 12 hours agorootparentIt does render the notion of \"ethical collapse\" and supposed comparisons to Enron a bit meaningless if we&#x27;re also counting the sorts of ethical violation most companies are guilty of though.

The usefulness of criteria for predicting anything depends on both false positive and false negative rates, and this article doesn&#x27;t seem to care about false positives (what fraction of companies do trendy, visible ESG stuff but are also honest behind the scenes?) at all.Might as well add an 8th point, \"Companies that sell a good or service\", and really bring that false negative rate all the way down to zero. reply causi 2 hours agorootparentprevhow much of this is just corporate normsEvil is the corporate norm, or at least psychopathy.

Have you sanity checked it the other way (false positive)? reply gen220 11 hours agorootparentUber was on the cusp on a bunch of these (numbers pressure, fear&#x2F;silence, big CEO, innovation, goodness atoning for evil). I think fear&#x2F;silence tilting + strong governance forced Kalanick out and saved the company.WeWork had every single one of these, and governance ultimately was too little too late to save the company.AirBnb, Stripe had a few of these, but turned out OK.It seems like the common variable that spares startups from ethical collapse is good board governance and having a reasonable &#x2F; willing to evolve CEO.FB is an interesting case, because they check most of these boxes (maybe not fear&#x2F;silence?), yet are fairly \"successful\". Governance isn&#x27;t the explanatory variable, since Zuck has 90% of voting shares. The explanatory variable seems to be Zuck&#x27;s willingness to listen to and learn from a board and his execs. reply petsfed 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d argue that \"successful\" is a poor measure of how ethical a company is.AirBnb has managed to shake off some pretty bad ethical issues. Facebook was credibly implicated in a genocide, and Instagram in particular (and social media in general) has been causally linked to increased rates of juvenile suicide. reply gen220 7 hours agorootparentOh for sure, that&#x27;s why I put \"successful\" in scare quotes. As mentioned, FB checks pretty much every one of the \"ethical collapse\" boxes with a bolded checkmark.That they&#x27;ve managed to be successful financially in spite of that fact (so far!) is pretty singular. That&#x27;s a rare group. Not saying it&#x27;s one to emulate, though, far from it. reply neltnerb 14 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t define \"ethical collapse\" in terms of the company failing to make money.

Let that sink in. reply LegibleCrimson 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the canonical example, but it&#x27;s not about age in and of itself, but the gap between the CEO that turns them from a person into an idol. It&#x27;s often an age gap (especially in the past) due to the culturally-entrenched ideal of automatic respect and deference to one&#x27;s elders, but it can be any gap that makes the direct reports feel like they are somehow inherently beneath the CEO in ways other than corporate rank.The point of that sign is that the CEO&#x27;s direct underlings can&#x27;t even question the CEO&#x27;s choices. reply ryandrake 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just their direct reports or even their employees.

It is not a juvenile way of understanding, it is the only sensible way of understanding. Or rather it is not a way of understanding, it is one of the tools that can speed up understanding.Social systems are very complex, you cannot write an algorithm of evaluation in terms of \"measure this and that, then use this formula\". It never works. You need to understand how the system works and it takes some research.To do the research these 7 signs can be very helpful at first. They allow you to form you hypotheses fast on a data that not completely irrelevant. Just one more thing: these 7 signs are not just a measure procedure giving you one number, each one is a facet of an organisation that should be studied.To be sure you&#x27;d better find some another evaluation framework, and study facets of an organization that it deems to be the most important.It is like psychological tests: they do not diagnose the problems, but they allow to see a client from different perspectives. Tests are relatively cheap and they give you some threads to unravel.> I can easily find counterexamples of successful organisations which demonstrate one or more of these qualities1. No one said that these signs are signs of an unsuccessful organisations. You can be completely unethical and pretty successful at the same time. To my mind, the question does ethics correlate with a success or not is an ideological one. Theoretically speaking you can study it in a relatively objective way, but ideologies will win at the end. Either your indoctrination will take the upper hand, or indoctrination of others will force you to argue in a favor of \"our sin will be punished inevitable\" or something like. It is hard to find thinkers who are immune to that, there is a lot of wishful thinking goes on.2. 1-2 signs is not a verdict, but an invitation to look deeper at the matters.

You may be among the ~.5% of humans unconcerned with harming others, regardless of wealth level. reply bumby 15 hours agorootparentThere seems to be quite a bit of evidence of the opposite, or at least that \"high-status\" people are equally or more ethical. Some of the misperception seems to be explained by society holding high-status individuals to a higher ethical standard and more attention when they deviate from the norm. reply atmavatar 15 hours agorootparentI would argue that holding someone to a standard, ethical or otherwise, requires some sort of accountability.And yet, in the US, we have congressmen&#x2F;women who regularly engage in insider trading and accept bribes in the form of lobbying and cushy jobs after they leave office, we have multiple sitting Supreme Court justices accepting bribes, and we have a former president who isn&#x27;t even held to the same standard we hold our children.I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to come up with any examples of a high-status individual being held to a higher standard than the rest of us. Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of belly-aching on social media from time to time, but in most (all?) cases, it&#x27;s for falling short of a standard we&#x27;re all expected to satisfy, and there&#x27;s almost never any real consequences. reply kortilla 14 hours agorootparent> we have multiple sitting Supreme Court justices accepting bribesWhen you use the word “bribe” to describe something that isn’t, it dilutes your point significantly.This is a thread about ethics, you can use precise words and still talk about how they are unethical. reply cycomanic 15 hours agorootparentprevThe poster wrote that research shows that poorer people are typically (or in general) more ethical than richer and your reply is that there is evidence to the contrary without any evidence just a hand waving argument. That doesn&#x27;t show anything.You can indeed question the research of less ethical behaviour by richer people however you need to bring some evidence. This [1] article for example talks about a study which didn&#x27;t replicate the behaviour. It&#x27;s actually a well balanced discussion of the overall evidence.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greatergood.berkeley.edu&#x2F;article&#x2F;item&#x2F;are_rich_peopl... reply bumby 15 hours agorootparentWhat was the hand-waving? A better approach is just to be intellectually curious and ask. Besides, snarkiness is against the HN guidelines. This article [1] has a lot of references that support that claim, and it&#x27;s a higher quality of rigor than a magazine article. FWIW, I&#x27;m not saying the original claim was wrong, just that we should be cautioned against strong claims when there is mixed evidence at best. Likewise, I would caution against extrapolating too much from studies that use cars as a proxy for wealth. Car model != socio-economic status for a variety of reasons. I&#x27;d argue that original (and replicated) study from your link is pretty flawed to begin with.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-023-42204-z reply cycomanic 14 hours agorootparentSorry I didn&#x27;t mean to come across as snarky.By handwavy I meant that one can easily come up with \"logical\" arguments around behaviour that dont reflect reality, so it needs to be backed up by evidence.Thanks for posting the article I was not aware of this research (while I was aware of the research showing the opposite).2 things to note: 1. How is it possible that the two don&#x27;t cite each other?! I have to call out the scientific report paper in particular. Piff&#x27;s work is more than 10 years old and well known. Instead the authors only cite work that supports their premise. I would have thrown it out as a reviewer just based on this. That said the article I linked should have mentioned some of the work cited in the scientific reports article as well.2. It seems studies are done quite differently, the article you linked seems to largely rely on surveys (sidenote I really dislike the use of mechanical turk for these things, way too unreliable) of assessment others or their own ethical behaviour. Piff&#x27;s work was more experimental (thus lower numbers and less reliable in that sense) reply bumby 13 hours agorootparentNo apologies needed, but I appreciate the thoughtful response.I agree that surveys are not the best tool. Unfortunately, for a lot of work that covers social components, they are a common method. While wealth is easily quantifiable, people&#x27;s feelings towards topics like ethics are often best done by asking them.I think the Piff study is just really flawed because they were trying to use a quantifiable proxy.\"we used observers’ codes of vehicle status (make, age, and appearance) to index drivers’ social class.\"IMO they chose a really bad proxy, and they never validated it. It&#x27;s completely based on an assumption, and one that we can all probably point to personal examples that violate it. To me, that&#x27;s \"hand-wavy\" science. To your point, I could probably come up with a handful of different explanations that correlate car make&#x2F;model to seemingly aggressive driving behavior. Some of them probably correlate with wealth and others not so much.I do think there&#x27;s a danger of confirmation bias. Just like the nature study demonstrates that there is a normative belief that wealthy people act less ethically, it&#x27;s really easy for our status-obscessed ape minds to latch onto studies that support it. Even when they aren&#x27;t the greatest. reply cycomanic 6 hours agorootparentRegarding survey&#x27;s I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with surveys (although they can be flawed), but find that mechanical turk seems to give the worst way of doing a survey. It rewards going through the survey as quick as possible and I would also argue attracts people who optimise toward time (although I don&#x27;t have hard evidence), not necessarily honesty (an interesting ethics question in itself).Regarding your thoughts on the car study I broadly agree it is not a very good proxy for wealth (also areas with many company cars likely skew results as well). However I do think that it&#x27;s trying to independently verify peoples self-evaluation using similar experiments what gives us much better insights and there were a number of other studies with similar results.Confirmation bias is always a danger and the paper that was described in the article which could not reproduce the correlation between car cost and behavior tried to follow best practices to minimise it, so probably should be given more weight. I actually wondered if there is a difference also according to culture, i.e. Piff&#x27;s results were obtained in the US, while the other article was in the Netherlands. replyskygazer 15 hours agorootparentprevThat’s interesting. Of course we can’t 1:1 equate wealth with high-status, but I guess there’s often significant overlap. reply withinboredom 15 hours agorootparentprevLinks? reply amanaplanacanal 16 hours agoparentprevI suspect you might have a different definition of ethics.

I’ll just pick a topic and then ask for a summary and then ask clarifying questions. Other times I’ll just goof off. In one chat, I’m rewriting the Star Wars sequels movie by movie with ChatGPT. I’ve realized that I’m built to learn socially, and ChatGPT never tires of my questions or gets annoyed.One interesting story. My 15 year old kid was talking to it about Percy Jackson, and as Gen Z is prone to do, was using the phrase “kind of” quite a bit. At some point in the conversation, ChatGPT started using “kind of” as well in the audio. I imagine the underlying prompt is “make sure your answers are clear to the user” and somehow it’s determining that “kind of” is a way to build clarity in that context, or the phrase is informing the token set. Unsure but it was a little unsettling.For my part I find the natural pauses and accentuations really helpful.

I definitely use it frequently, but the quantity that my kids use it is at a whole other level. But it’s a colloquial phrase that I rarely, if ever, hear ChatGPT use in the audio presentation, but looking at the chat transcript, there’s definitely a point at which it begins to use “kind of” in multiple ways in its responses, and it wasn’t before. reply sprobertson 2 hours agorootparentA more blatant example: it will start responding in French if you start speaking to it in French.

They force you to speak in an unnatural way.It seems like there’s nothing intelligent about when they decide to respond, it’s like they just wait for X milliseconds of silence instead of using the context of what’s being said like a human would.Sometimes it’s the opposite problem. You finish asking your question but you gotta wait for the assistant to pick it up whereas a human would understand that you’re finished talking based on what you said.It might seem small and unimportant but I really think it’s one of the main reasons why voice assistants feel so… artificial.That and long ass responses. reply snypher 8 hours agorootparent>They force you to speak in an unnatural way.I think the same thing can happen when speaking to anyone with different societal&#x2F;cultural factors than yours.

It&#x27;s not only useless paper you can&#x27;t even wipe your behind with, but these days it&#x27;s just digits on a computer. But the value you can get out of it is provided by people and systems that do something useful for you in exchange for it. And if something provides that value directly in communication with you, that&#x27;s much the same as being paid digits on a computer.In other words, are we so shallow we need to first pay for ChatGPT&#x27;s output in money, and then it should pay us back the same money (or less) for our voices and data, in order to comprehend what a barter exchange of value is? reply ademeure 11 hours agoprevAm I the only one who doesn&#x27;t like these specific voices?

This is a couple of years ago though so maybe they&#x27;ve improved things since.The impact of any waves higher than maybe a meter is likely to make the software take you in for a rather rude landing, and quick stop.It&#x27;s unlike any boat of that size I&#x27;ve piloted, it was very heavy and it never felt like you were totally in control, with some small but quite noticeable latency between input and action. Felt more like piloting a larger ship than a small speed boat.The fact that it felt like you were at the mercy of the controlling software meant it became a very anxious ride as soon as you ran into a bit of choppy waters.When flying it was a very nice ride, but when you&#x27;re not you have to go very slow or you quickly run out of battery. It was not particularly pleasant doing 3-4 knots in choppy waters, even if it did seem rather stable presumably due to the wide base, low height and deep rudders (foils).Fine boat in calm seas for sure, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything else.

Though, if it is very windy and wavy on the ocean&#x2F;lake it is more difficult to develop foiling speed to take off.The reason why Candela is pioneering sub surface foils now is because it takes a reasonable amount of sensors and computation to avoid the foil breaching.For the most part, you wouldn&#x27;t want to take a sub surface foiling vessel flying out in a storm with significant swells, but that&#x27;s not what most boating is anyway. reply briffle 7 hours agoparentprevNavier boats in the bay area has a very high end luxury electric hydrofoiling boat, and this guy took a tour in much rougher waves, with a wife that is easily sea sick. they did fine, since you are no longer riding up and down the waves, more through them.

There&#x27;s a reason those America&#x27;s Cup boats and the big ocean going trimarans that use foils have quite different designs.The biggest issue is that if the foiling fails the boat has a tendency to bury the bow quite violently.

Long vessels have different problems with waves, like having the bow AND stern lifted by waves at the same time, so you have a whole different set of failure modes. reply acyou 16 hours agorootparentInteresting, but I think many ocean-going vessels tend to be fairly long for good reason, with the bigger, longer ones also being faster and more capable in rough seas.Offshore commercial fishing boats are an example of shorter ocean-going boats. I think they would normally prefer to avoid storm seas if possible. They have to head up and turn into the waves, they can&#x27;t take them sideways.One example of when people thought that a big, long boat would be more seaworthy, was the Titanic, which sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg. But it wasn&#x27;t the waves that did it.I think big, long and strong boats are pretty great in rough seas.

Torpedoes work best, when they can effectively \"lift\" the keel, breaking the back of the ship. (Not exactly, but kind of, IIRC.) Very high sea swells apparently do the same thing! When there&#x27;s far less buoyancy supporting one end of the ship than the other, the entire ship has to act as a cantilever. At the size of large ships, the square-cube law dominates, and the ship is far more fragile at that scale than a model boat would be.

In Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training signals can enhance smaller LMs' reasoning abilities. Research on training small LMs has often relied on imitation learning to replicate the output of more capable models. We contend that excessive emphasis on imitation may restrict the potential of smaller models. We seek to teach small LMs to employ different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from the one used by the larger model. For example, while larger models might provide a direct answer to a complex task, smaller models may not have the same capacity. In Orca 2, we teach the model various reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct answer, etc.). More crucially, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most effective solution strategy for each task. We evaluate Orca 2 using a comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100 tasks and over 36,000 unique prompts). Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of similar size and attains performance levels similar or better to those of models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning abilities in zero-shot settings. We open-source Orca 2 to encourage further research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of smaller LMs. Subjects: Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) Cite as: arXiv:2311.11045 [cs.AI](or arXiv:2311.11045v1 [cs.AI] for this version)https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.11045 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite Submission history From: Arindam Mitra [view email] [v1] Sat, 18 Nov 2023 11:44:52 UTC (446 KB) Full-text links: Access Paper: Download PDF PostScript Other Formats Current browse context: cs.AInewrecent2311 Change to browse by: cs References & Citations NASA ADS Google Scholar Semantic Scholar export BibTeX citation Bookmark Bibliographic Tools Bibliographic and Citation Tools Bibliographic Explorer Toggle Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)

There will be humans still in the loop ensuring that the output is valid for their use case? I don&#x27;t think we are still there yet where we can completely productionalize these models without any human involvement later on whatsoever. reply FFP999 19 hours agoparentprevAt the moment I read \"how to reason\" in the headline my bullshit detector started to go off.LLMs do not reason, they do not think, they are not AGI. They generate by regurgitating. reply coderaptor 19 hours agorootparentI haven’t heard a definition of “reasoning” or “thinking” that proves humans aren’t doing exactly that same probabilistic regurgitation.I don’t think it’s possible to prove; feels like a philosophical question. reply RationalDino 18 hours agorootparentI won&#x27;t define reasoning, just call out one aspect.We have the ability to follow a chain of reasoning, say \"that didn&#x27;t work out\", backtrack, and consider another. ChatGPT seems to get tangled up when its first (very good) attempt goes south.This is definitely a barrier that can be crossed by computers. AlphaZero is better than we are at it. But it is a thing we do which we clearly don&#x27;t simply do with the probabilistic regurgitation method that ChatGPT uses.That said, the human brain combines a bunch of different areas that seem to work in different ways. Our ability to engage in this kind of reason, for example, is known to mostly happen in the left frontal cortex. So it seems likely that AGI will also need to combine different modules that work in different ways.On that note, when you add tools to ChatGPT, it suddenly can do a lot more than it did before. If those tools include the right feedback loops, the ability to store&#x2F;restore context, and so on, what could it then do? This isn&#x27;t just a question of putting the right capabilities in a box. They have to work together for a goal. But I&#x27;m sure that we haven&#x27;t achieved the limit of what can be achieved. reply Davidzheng 15 hours agorootparentthese are things we can teach children to do when they don&#x27;t do it at first. I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t teach this behavior to AI. Maybe we should teach LLM&#x27;s to play games or something. or do those proof thingys that they teach in US high school geometry or something like that. To learn some formal structure within which they can think about the world reply azmodeus 16 hours agorootparentprevInstead of going bank you can construct a tree of different reasonings with an LLM then take a vote or synthesise see Tee of thought prompting reply xanderlewis 18 hours agorootparentprevIt feels like humans do do a similar regurgitation as part of a reasoning process, but if you play around with LLMs and ask them mathematical questions beyond the absolute basics it doesn’t take long before they trip up and reveal a total lack of ‘understanding’ as we would usually understand it. I think we’re easily fooled by the fact that these models have mastered the art of talking like an expert. Within any domain you choose, they’ve mastered the form. But it only takes a small amount of real expertise (or even basic knowledge) to immediately spot that it’s all gobbledygook and I strongly suspect that when it isn’t it’s just down to luck (and the fact that almost any question you can ask has been asked before and is in the training data). Given the amount of data being swallowed, it’s hard to believe that the probabilistic regurgitation you describe is ever going to lead to anything like ‘reasoning’ purely through scaling. You’re right that asking what reasoning is may be a philosophical question, but you don’t need to go very far to empirically verify that these models absolutely do not have it. reply cloverich 16 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand, it seems rather intuitive we have a logic based component? Its the underpinning of science. We have to be taught when we&#x27;ve stumbled upon something that needs tested. But we can be taught that. And then once we learn to recognize it, we intuitively do so in action. ChatGPT can do this in a rudimentary way as well. It says a program should work a certain way. Then it writes it. Then it runs it. Then when the answer doesn&#x27;t come out as expected (at this point, probably just error cases), it goes back and changes it.It seems similar to what we do, if on a more basic level. At any rate, it seems like a fairly straight forward 1-2 punch that, even if not truly intelligent, would let it break through its current barriers. reply CAP_NET_ADMIN 18 hours agorootparentprevLLMs can be trained on all the math books in the world, starting from the easiest to the most advanced, they can regurgitate them almost perfectly, yet they won&#x27;t apply the concepts in those books to their actions. I&#x27;d count the ability to learn new concepts and methods, then being able to use them as \"reasoning\". reply margorczynski 18 hours agorootparentAren&#x27;t there quite a few examples of LLMs giving out-of-distribution answers to stated problems? I think there are two issues with LLMs and reasoning:1. They are single-pass and static - you \"fake\" short-term memory by re-feeding the questions with it answer 2. They have no real goal to achieve - one that it would split into sub-goals, plan to achieve them, estimate the returns of each, etc.As for 2. I think this is the main point of e.g. LeCun in that LLMs in themselvs are simply single-modality world models and they lack other components to make them true agents capable of reasoning. reply intended 21 minutes agorootparentits those kinds of examples that make it hard to cleave a measurement of success.Based on those kinds of results an LLM should, in theory, be able to plan, analyze and suggest improvements, without the need for human intervention.You will see rudimentary success for this as well - however, when you push the tool further, it will stop being... \"logical\".I&#x27;d refine the point to saying that you will get some low hanging fruit in terms of syntactic prediction and semantic analysis.But when you lean ON semantic ability, the model is no longer leaning on its syntactic data set, and it fails to generalize. reply intended 19 hours agorootparentprevIt’s possible to prove.Use an LLM to do a real world task that you should be able to achieve by reasoning. reply FFP999 19 hours agorootparent> Use an LLM to do a real world task that you should be able to achieve by reasoning.Such as explaining the logical fallacies in this argument and the one above? reply intended 18 hours agorootparentTake anything, see how far you get before you have to really grapple with hallucination.Once that happens, your mitigation strategy will end up being the proof. reply motoxpro 18 hours agorootparentprevI mean I know you&#x27;re joking but yes, it would be able to do that. reply kgeist 17 hours agorootparentprevJust yesterday I saw an example of a person asking GPT what \"fluftable\" means.

GPT reasoned it was a portmaneau of\"fluffy\" and \"comfortable\", and it made sense because it was used in reference to a pillow. If it&#x27;s just regurgitation, I&#x27;d like to know how it&#x27;s able to understand novel words not found in the training data... reply svaha1728 14 hours agorootparentI would read Francois Chollet&#x27;s explanation of this. It&#x27;s very good: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fchollet.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-i-think-about-llm-prompt...For words that are not in the model&#x27;s vocabulary, like &#x27;fluftable&#x27;, the model uses a subword tokenization strategy. It breaks down the word into smaller known subunits (subwords or characters) and represents each subunit with its own vector. By understanding the context in which &#x27;fluftable&#x27; appears and comparing it to known words with similar subunits, the model can infer a plausible meaning for the word. This is done by analyzing the vector space in which these representations exist, observing how the vectors align or differ from those of known words.&#x27;As always, the most important principle for understanding LLMs is that you should resist the temptation of anthropomorphizing them.&#x27; reply lucubratory 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sorry, but that&#x27;s absurd. Being able to explain the precise mechanism behind reasoning would make anything sound like it&#x27;s not reasoning, because of our prior experiences. If we understood human reasoning well enough to explain exactly what happens in our brain, you would conclude that we&#x27;re not really reasoning because you can provide an explanation of how we&#x27;re reasoning about novel, out of distribution data. This is \"God of the gaps\" for thought. reply miffy900 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat you&#x27;ve written does nothing to disabuse any reasonable person of the notion that LLMs cannot reason; if anything you&#x27;ve explained how LLM&#x27;s reason, not that they cannot do it. reply sharemywin 13 hours agorootparentprevisn&#x27;t &#x27;infer&#x27; another word for reason? reply svaha1728 12 hours agorootparentvector math in a 1536-dimensional space? reply nighthawk454 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause you’re not understanding what it’s regurgitating.

They can reason. reply kromem 20 hours agoprevA really important nuance here is that they are building on top of Llama-2, the pretrained model, and not Llama-2-chat.I really think the entire field is doing a degree of damage with the chat fine tuning beyond what might be expected, because regularly part of that chat instruction is an emphasis on identification as a LLM.The problem with this is that nearly all of the training data it&#x27;s performing next token prediction on is text generated by humans.So there&#x27;s an inherent narrowing of the model scope with most of the fine tuning I&#x27;ve seen such that while pretrained models are harder to use, I regularly prefer them over chat models when both are available as even at similar temperatures the quality and variety of language is much improved in the pretrained over chat model.This fine tuning was only introducing bias towards logical step by step analysis and problem solving techniques, and the results are great. But I&#x27;m willing to bet that an identical fine tuning on top of the chat model would have been much worse on the evaluations - not just the compounding of a typical fine tuning loss of a few percent, but more like a double digit relative difference.It&#x27;s quite frustrating that the anxiety over model safety is likely throwing out tens of millions of dollars worth of data in the pretrained model when only chat models are available for the SotA, and I hope in the future a lighter touch is taken on fine tuning the pretrained model and instead of focusing on safety inherent to the model it is just set behind a safety oriented discriminator or &#x27;editor&#x27; which filters or modifies responses accordingly.I&#x27;d happily take a 2-3x increased API cost for a much more broadly capable and performant model with similar safety characteristics but without the handicaps that come with it.So while a lot of the gains here might be due to the fine tuning, I expect at least part is shrugging off the baggage of the chat&#x2F;safety fine tuning as well. Even in the first detailed example, we can see that while Llama-2 goes off rambling later on, its statement of the relative knowledge of John vs Llama-2-chat is much more clear and connected between initial conditions and result particularly regarding theory of mind (i.e. \"he assumed\" vs the latter&#x27;s \"it must be in\"). reply kromem 20 hours agoparentAdding to this - it&#x27;s really interesting the safety stuff that *is* in this paper. Such as:> We probe some of the categories where we see a larger difference (e.g., violent) and observe that Orca 2 tends to counter the harmful positions more often (which is penalized by the metric), while models that have gone through RLHF safety training tend to decline to respond more often (which is rewarded by the metric).Or the fact Orca 2 is less likely to extend hate speech than Llama-2-chat which theoretically went through safety fine tuning even though Orca 2 did not have any explicit safety fine tuning.Research over the past year has really demonstrated (a) just how impactful fine tuning can be - to the point of transmitting capabilities from larger models to smaller, and (b) that we&#x27;re still clumsily wading through that process with only partial clarity on best practices as the foundational pretrained models get better and better at astounding rates. reply fgfm 23 hours agoprevOrca 2-13B consistently beat Llama 2-70B on most benchmarks in 0-shot.

We&#x27;ve already seen some pretend-agent based solutions (where the same model is given several different roles and made to act as eg. ceo &#x2F; architect &#x2F; dev &#x2F; sales in a startup).I wonder if the way forward is to train smaller models with different sets of \"skills\" or \"neural affinities\". One for reasoning, one for summarization, one for math, one for code, etc - then combining them into full-fledged solutions. Perhaps smaller models can be \"better\" at their specific domains&#x2F;tasks than the giant generalist models can be at any of them. reply trash_cat 15 hours agoparentYes, this is the trend. OAIs marketplace of GPTs is a confirmation of this. BabyAGI, AutoGen, AutoGPT are all multiple LLM&#x2F;SLM architectures under the hood. While we don´t have access to proprietary data or the ability to run bigger models, the natural direction is to combine them with specialized tasks like you just described. The issue is then the interface - making it good and communicate seamlessly between models and what roles they + the architecture the models are operating in. The last point is up to your imagination. reply hobofan 19 hours agoparentprevYes, I think that is the general trend. Have one model tuned for reasoning that decides a plan, based on which you invoke other models as tools (see e.g. the ReWOO paper[0]). If I had to guess, an approach like this is what powers the recent Custom GPT&#x2F;Assistant API products (based on the lag between tool invocations I would guess that they also re-prompt for plan adjustments between every set of tool calls).Do that with a small model and hot-swap LORAs, and it should be possible to build a quite powerful local assistant on consumer hardware.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.18323 reply imhoguy 13 hours agoparentprevSpecialized LLMs, and likely SLMs too, are really the future.

Share full article 213 Sam Altman called an OpenAI board member’s research paper a danger to the company weeks before he was ousted as its chief executive. Credit... Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Cade Metz, Tripp Mickle and Mike Isaac Reporting from San Francisco Published Nov. 21, 2023 Updated Nov. 22, 2023, 3:43 a.m. ET Before Sam Altman was ousted from OpenAI last week, he and the company’s board of directors had been bickering for more than a year. The tension got worse as OpenAI became a mainstream name thanks to its popular ChatGPT chatbot. At one point, Mr. Altman, the chief executive, made a move to push out one of the board’s members because he thought a research paper she had co-written was critical of the company. Another member, Ilya Sutskever, thought Mr. Altman was not always being honest when talking with the board. And some board members worried that Mr. Altman was too focused on expansion while they wanted to balance that growth with A.I. safety. The news that he was being pushed out came in a videoconference on Friday afternoon, when Mr. Sutskever, who had worked closely with Mr. Altman at OpenAI for eight years, read him a statement. The decision stunned OpenAI’s employees and exposed board members to tough questions about their qualifications to manage such a high-profile company. Those tensions seemingly came to an end late Tuesday when Mr. Altman was reinstated as chief executive. Mr. Sutskever and others critical of Mr. Altman were jettisoned from the board, whose members now include Bret Taylor, an early Facebook officer and former co-chief executive of Salesforce, and Larry Summers, the former Treasury Department secretary. The only holdover is Adam D’Angelo, chief executive of the question-and-answer site, Quora. The OpenAI debacle has illustrated how building A.I. systems is testing whether businesspeople who want to make money from artificial intelligence can work in sync with researchers who worry that what they are building could eventually eliminate jobs or become a threat if technologies like autonomous weapons grow out of control. OpenAI was started in 2015 with an ambitious plan to one day create a superintelligent automated system that can do everything a human brain can do. But friction plagued the company’s board, which hadn’t even been able to agree on replacements for members who had stepped down. Before Mr. Altman’s return, the company’s continued existence was in doubt. Nearly all of OpenAI’s 800 employees had threatened to follow Mr. Altman to Microsoft, which asked him to lead an A.I. lab with Greg Brockman, who quit his roles as OpenAI’s president and board chairman in solidarity with Mr. Altman. The board had told Mr. Brockman that he would no longer be OpenAI’s chairman but invited him to stay on at the company — though he was not invited to the meeting where the decision was made to push him off the board and Mr. Altman out of the company. OpenAI’s board troubles can be traced to the start-up’s nonprofit beginnings. In 2015, Mr. Altman teamed with Elon Musk and others, including Mr. Sutskever, to create a nonprofit to build A.I. that was safe and beneficial to humanity. They planned to raise money from private donors for their mission. But within a few years, they realized that their computing needs required much more funding than they could raise from individuals. After Mr. Musk left in 2018, they created a for-profit subsidiary that began raising billions of dollars from investors, including $1 billion from Microsoft. They said that the subsidiary would be controlled by the nonprofit board and that each director’s fiduciary duty would be to “humanity, not OpenAI investors,” the company said on its website. Image Helen Toner, an OpenAI board member, defended the research paper she co-wrote. Credit... Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images Among the tensions leading up to Mr. Altman’s ouster and quick return involved his conflict with Helen Toner, a board member and a director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. A few weeks before Mr. Altman’s firing, he met with Ms. Toner to discuss a paper she had co-written for the Georgetown center. Mr. Altman complained that the research paper seemed to criticize OpenAI’s efforts to keep its A.I. technologies safe while praising the approach taken by Anthropic, a company that has become OpenAI’s biggest rival, according to an email that Mr. Altman wrote to colleagues and that was viewed by The New York Times. In the email, Mr. Altman said that he had reprimanded Ms. Toner for the paper and that it was dangerous to the company, particularly at a time, he added, when the Federal Trade Commission was investigating OpenAI over the data used to build its technology. Ms. Toner defended it as an academic paper that analyzed the challenges that the public faces when trying to understand the intentions of the countries and companies developing A.I. But Mr. Altman disagreed. “I did not feel we’re on the same page on the damage of all this,” he wrote in the email. “Any amount of criticism from a board member carries a lot of weight.” Senior OpenAI leaders, including Mr. Sutskever, who is deeply concerned that A.I. could one day destroy humanity, later discussed whether Ms. Toner should be removed, a person involved in the conversations said. But shortly after those discussions, Mr. Sutskever did the unexpected: He sided with board members to oust Mr. Altman, according to two people familiar with the board’s deliberations. The statement he read to Mr. Altman said that Mr. Altman was being fired because he wasn’t “consistently candid in his communications with the board.” Mr. Sutskever’s frustration with Mr. Altman echoed what had happened in 2021 when another senior A.I. scientist left OpenAI to form Anthropic. That scientist and other researchers went to the board to try to push Mr. Altman out. After they failed, they gave up and departed, according to three people familiar with the attempt to push Mr. Altman out. “After a series of reasonably amicable negotiations, the co-founders of Anthropic were able to negotiate their exit on mutually agreeable terms,” an Anthropic spokeswoman, Sally Aldous, said. In a second statement, Anthropic added that there was “no attempt to ‘oust’ Sam Altman at the time the founders of Anthropic left OpenAI.” Vacancies exacerbated the board’s issues. This year, it disagreed over how to replace three departing directors: Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a Microsoft board member; Shivon Zilis, director of operations at Neuralink, a company started by Mr. Musk to implant computer chips in people’s brains; and Will Hurd, a former Republican congressman from Texas. After vetting four candidates for one position, the remaining directors couldn’t agree on who should fill it, said the two people familiar with the board’s deliberations. The stalemate hardened the divide between Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman and other board members. Hours after Mr. Altman was ousted, OpenAI executives confronted the remaining board members during a video call, according to three people who were on the call. During the call, Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, said the board was endangering the future of the company by pushing out Mr. Altman. This, he said, violated the members’ responsibilities. Ms. Toner disagreed. The board’s mission was to ensure that the company creates artificial intelligence that “benefits all of humanity,” and if the company was destroyed, she said, that could be consistent with its mission. In the board’s view, OpenAI would be stronger without Mr. Altman. On Sunday, Mr. Sutskever was urged at OpenAI’s office to reverse course by Mr. Brockman’s wife, Anna, according to two people familiar with the exchange. Hours later, he signed a letter with other employees that demanded the independent directors resign. The confrontation between Mr. Sutskever and Ms. Brockman was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. At 5:15 a.m. on Monday, he posted on X, formerly Twitter, that “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions.” Cade Metz is a technology reporter and the author of “Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought A.I. to Google, Facebook, and The World.” He covers artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas.

Let me summarize the implications:Sam Altman expelling Toner with the pretext of an inoffensive page (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cset.georgetown.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;CSET-Decoding...) in a paper no one read* would have given him a temporary majority with which to appoint a replacement director, and then further replacement directors. These directors would, naturally, agree with Sam Altman, and he would have a full, perpetual board majority - the board, which is the only oversight on the OA CEO. Obviously, as an extremely experienced VC and CEO, he knew all this and how many votes he (thought he) had on the board, and the board members knew this as well - which is why they had been unable to agree on replacement board members all this time.So when he &#x27;reprimanded&#x27; her for her &#x27;dangerous&#x27; misconduct and started talking seriously about how &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; it was for a &#x27;board member&#x27; to write anything which was not cheerleading, and started leading discussions about \"whether Ms Toner should be removed\"...* I actually read CSET papers, and I still hadn&#x27;t bothered to read this one, nor would I have found anything remarkable about that page, which Altman says was so bad that she needed to be expelled immediately from the board. reply gizmo 6 hours agoparentOkay, let&#x27;s stipulate that Sam was maneuvering to get full board control. Then the independent directors were probably worried that -- sooner or later -- Sam would succeed. With Sam fully in charge the non-profit goals would be completely secondary to the commercial goals. This was unacceptable to the independent directors and Ilya and so they ousted Sam before he could oust them?That&#x27;s a clear motive. Sam and the independent directors were each angling to get rid of the other. The independent directors got to a majority before Sam did. This at least explains why they fired Sam in such a haphazard way. They had to strike immediately before one of the board members got cold feet. reply skygazer 6 hours agorootparentBesides explaining the haphazardness, that would also nicely explain why they didn&#x27;t want to elaborate publicly on why they \"had\" to let him go -- \"it was either him or us\" wouldn&#x27;t have been popular given his seeming popularity. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 6 hours agorootparentI suspect his popularity is mostly about employees who want to maintain the value of their equity: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;JacquesThibs&#x2F;status&#x2F;1727134087176204410#mWild guess: If the board stands its ground, appoints a reasonable new CEO, and employees understand that OpenAI will continue to be a hot startup, most of them will stay with the company due to their equity reply cpncrunch 6 hours agorootparentExcept, the facts behind Sam&#x27;s firing will inevitably come out, and it won&#x27;t be possible to brush it under the carpet. I think they hoped the facts wouldn&#x27;t come out, and they could just give a hand-wavey explanation, but that&#x27;s clearly not going to happen. It seems they have well and truly shot themselves in the feet, and they will likely have to be replaced now. reply gizmo 6 hours agorootparentIf I&#x27;m correct then the board is fine with getting replaced, they just don&#x27;t want Sam to have total control. Many of the candidates for independent director are friendly with Sam and will happily give him the keys to the kingdom. It&#x27;s probably extremely difficult to find qualified independent board members who don&#x27;t have ties to Sam. reply mupuff1234 4 hours agorootparentprevIdk, seems like a pretty easy sell to me:\"Sam was trying to censor legitimate concerns the board had with regards to the safety of the technology and actively tried to undermine the board and replace it with his own puppets.\"If that is indeed true they did a mistake by saying something vague imo. reply himaraya 4 hours agorootparentI suspect the board prioritized legal exposure first and foremost.

But the tone of that paper makes me think that the schism must go back much earlier (other reporting said things really started to split a year ago when ChatGPT was first released), and it sounds to me like Toner was needling because she was pissed with the direction OpenAI was headed.I&#x27;m thinking of a good previous comment I read when the whole Timnit Gebru situation at Google blew up and the Ethical AI team at Google was disbanded. The basic argument was on some of the inherent incompatibilities between an \"academic ombudsman\" mindset, and a \"corporate growth\" mindset. I&#x27;m not saying which one was \"right\" in this situation given OpenAI&#x27;s frankenstein org structure, but just that this kind of conflict was probably inevitable. reply BryantD 4 hours agorootparentJust spot checking: did anyone comment on this paper when it was published? Did any media outlet say “hey, a member of the OpenAI board is criticizing OpenAI and showing a conflict of interest?” Did any of the people who cover AI (Zvi, say) discuss this as a problem?These are serious questions, not gotchas. I don’t know the answers, and I think having those answers would make it easier to evaluate whether or not the paper was a significant conflict of interest.

If your charter involves ethical AI I’d imagine the first step is telling the truth? reply xigency 4 hours agorootparentFrom the PDF:While the system card itself has been well received among researchers interested in understanding GPT-4’s risk profile, it appears to have been less successful as a broader signal of OpenAI’s commitment to safety. The reason for this unintended outcome is that the company took other actions that overshadowed the import of the system card: most notably, the blockbuster release of ChatGPT four months earlier. Intended as a relatively inconspicuous “research preview,” the original ChatGPT was built using a less advanced LLM called GPT-3.5, which was already in widespread use by other OpenAI customers. GPT-3.5’s prior circulation is presumably why OpenAI did not feel the need to perform or publish such detailed safety testing in this instance. Nonetheless, one major effect of ChatGPT’s release was to spark a sense of urgency inside major tech companies.149 To avoid falling behind OpenAI amid the wave of customer enthusiasm about chatbots, competitors sought to accelerate or circumvent internal safety and ethics review processes, with Google creating a fast-track “green lane” to allow products to be released more quickly.150 This result seems strikingly similar to the race- to-the-bottom dynamics that OpenAI and others have stated that they wish to avoid.OpenAI has also drawn criticism for many other safety and ethics issues related to the launches of ChatGPT and GPT-4, including regarding copyright issues, labor conditions for data annotators, and the susceptibility of their products to “jailbreaks” that allow users to bypass safety controls.151 This muddled overall picture provides an example of how the messages sent by deliberate signals can be overshadowed by actions that were not designed to reveal intent. reply webmaven 4 hours agorootparent> This […] provides an example of how the messages sent by deliberate signals can be overshadowed by actions that were not designed to reveal intent.What a lovely turn of phrase!

It makes perfect sense that they weren&#x27;t sitting at 6 board members for 9 months because Sam and the others didn&#x27;t see the implications, but because they saw them all too well and were gridlocked.But then it gets interesting inferring things from there. Obviously sama and gdb were on one side (call it team Speed), and Helen Toner on the other (team Safety). I think McCauley is with Toner (some connection I read about which I don&#x27;t remember now: maybe RAND or something?).But what about D&#x27;Angelo and Ilya? For the gridlock, one would have to be on each side. Naively I&#x27;d expect tech CEO to be Speed and Ilya Safety, but what would have precipitated the switch Friday? If D&#x27;Angelo wanted to implode the company due to conflict of interest, wouldn&#x27;t he just have sided with Team Safety earlier?But maybe Team Speed vs Team Safety isn&#x27;t the same as Team Fire Sam vs Team Don&#x27;t. I could see that one as Helen, Tasha, and Adam vs Sam, GDB, and Ilya. And, that also makes sense to me in that Ilya seems the most likely to flip for reasons, which also lines up with his regret and contrition. But then that raises the question of what made him flip? A scary exchange with prototype GPT5, which made him weigh his Safety side more highly than his loyalty to Sam? reply sanxiyn 6 hours agorootparentMaybe Sam wanted to redirect Ilya&#x27;s GPUs to ChatGPT after DevDay surge. 20% of OpenAI&#x27;s GPUs are allocated to Ilya&#x27;s team. reply hackerbob 4 hours agorootparentMy conclusion was that Sam slipped up somewhere and lost Ilya. Which maybe because of the reason you mentioned. Previously it seems like it was a 3 cofounders vs 3 non cofounders board split. Ilya switched teams after being upset by something.If I may wear my conspiracy hat for a second. Adam D&#x27;Angelo is a billionaire or close to it so he has a war chest for a battle to hold on to the crown jewel&#x27;s of AI. Sam has powerful friends but so does D&#x27;Angelo(Facebook mafia). I don&#x27;t think the board anticipated the 90% potential employee turnover, so there is a small chance they leave the board because of that reason.

It just needs to persuade humans to kill for it, or gather resources for it, and so on. And because it&#x27;s an AGI, it has superhuman abilities for persuasion.The intuition for GPT-4 being on the way towards superhuman intelligence or persuasion abilities is that the only significant difference between it and GPT-3 appears to be the amount of compute power applied to training.The previous US President was much less than superhuman, and he still managed to seriously threaten democracy in the US, and by extension cause a minor existential risk to civilization.

Anyone know more about that?One reason open source software projects struggle to get donations is because the IRS is skeptical of OSS as a true non-profit activity, so often doesn’t allow 503c tax deductible donations. OpenAI seems like a data point in favor of the IRS skepticism. reply philwelch 3 hours agorootparentprev> Non-profit corporations exist to further their mission, and are accountable to the IRS in this regard.The IRS’s actual power in this regard is extremely limited. There’s so much wiggle room to define the “mission” that, at best, the only thing they can do is make sure you’re not secretly using your nonprofit as a tax shelter for a regular for-profit business, and even then some companies find ways around it (see IKEA).Ordinary fraud (as opposed to tax fraud, though maybe that too) is even easier to pull off with a nonprofit than with an for-profit. Any nonprofit has a fundraising mechanism (which is usually an obnoxious set of dark patterns and outright spam reached through decades of optimization; the techniques are well understood), some overhead for managing the organization and money itself, and then the actual work involved with the mission. It’s quite simple for the overhead and fundraising parts of the organization to become most of the organization. But it gets worse: when your “mission” is vague enough, you can also turn that side of the business into a bunch of sinecures for your friends. There are well known “awareness” nonprofits that do literally nothing to actually solve the problems they’re nominally about because their job is to “spread awareness” (i.e. the top of the funnel for the fundraising part of the organization).This is ironically also the origin story of “effective altruism”. The IRS doesn’t stop you from running a non-profit scam, so you have to do your own research to find out which non-profits are legit, and that’s what the effective altruists started off with, along with some cost-benefit modeling once you get past the outright scams.The problem with OpenAI seems to be related to a vague mission as well. From the “an organization is what it does” perspective, OpenAI develops AI. If you have a formal mission that emphasizes safety over capability, you could certainly argue that OpenAI was closer to achieving that mission by sabotaging its own work, but if your interpretation of “safety” is to sabotage the development of AI, there are certainly better ways to do it than to develop AI and then sabotage yourself. reply usehand 6 hours agorootparentprevif thats the case why didnt they just stuff the board when they had the chance? reply negandnek 6 hours agorootparentI think it’s also mentioned the article that they have failed to add new members to the board due to the disagreement between the board members. reply murakamiiq84 5 hours agorootparentYeah it sounded like 3-3 gridlock until someone flipped, either it was Sam&#x2F;Greg&#x2F;Ilya against Adam&#x2F;Helen&#x2F;Tasha or it was Sam&#x2F;Greg&#x2F;Adam against Ilya&#x2F;Helen&#x2F;Tasha. reply usehand 5 hours agorootparentprevthen the argument that altman would be able to easily stuff the board doesnt hold -- he didnt even have majority.either you claim (1) that there was a risk of altman having majority and stuffing the board and hence concede that majority allows stuffing the board, in which case you concede the actual majority which was anti-altman could have done thator (2) you concede that having majority is not enough to stuff the board, in which case we were far from any risk of altman doing so, given that he did not even have a majority of the board---edit because i cant seem to reply further down thread: i read the article. my point is precisely that the board had majority. that is how they got to fire altman in the first place. given they had majority they had the chance to stuff the board in their own favor, as per the argument above. reply ruszki 5 hours agorootparentYou should read the article, because it’s clearly stated how Altman could get a majority.

And if you actually read the page, it&#x27;s an extremely mild criticism of OpenAI&#x27;s decisions.This situation is simultaneously \"reckless board makes ill-considered mistake to suddenly fire CEO with insufficient justification\" and \"non-profit CEO slowly changes the culture of a non-profit to turn it into profit-seeking enterprise that he has a large amount of control over\". reply Aunche 5 hours agorootparent>A board member criticizing a non-profit doesn&#x27;t have the same direct connection to a result opposite of the goals of the company.Even in a nonprofit, the board has an obligation to maintain a good working relationship with their organization. It&#x27;s very rare for a board member to publicly criticized for their own organization.Also, this argument goes out the window because OpenAI is not just a nonprofit. When they started their for-profit subsidiary in 2019, they accepted a fiduciary duty to their investors. reply sarchertech 4 hours agorootparentThat’s not how that works. You can argue that Ilya has a fiduciary responsibility to the investors as an officer of the company. Toner doesn’t. She is an independent board member on the board of the non-profit that owns a controlling share in the company, but she doesn’t personally own a majority share of the company. As an independent board member, she has no duty but to uphold the charter. She represents no shareholders.Majority shareholders may have some fiduciary responsibility to minority shareholders, so you might be able to make the argument that the board as a whole shouldn’t write disparaging remarks about the company. But even that argument is tenuous. reply Aunche 4 hours agorootparentShe joined the board of OpenAI knowing that they owned a for profit subsidiary that received billions of dollars of investment. Being independent means that she could provide a unique outsider perspective, not that she has no obligations to her organization whatsoever. If you&#x27;re going to be completely independent, you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when over 90% of the organization turns against you. reply sarchertech 4 hours agorootparentWhether people turn against her or not is irrelevant to my point. She has no personal fiduciary duty to the minority shareholders in the for-profit company. Her only duty is to the charter. reply Aunche 3 hours agorootparentThat people turned against her is relevant because it demonstrates how untenable this standard of independence is. A charter is just a collection of words. She isn&#x27;t a board member to a collection of words.

It&#x27;s literally their job. Cheerleading is for the C-suite. reply foota 5 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;ve admitted that they think it would be better to destroy open AI than to continue on its path, but how can an organization uphold its goals if it doesn&#x27;t exist?Imo you have to commit to working within an organization if you&#x27;re on its board, you can&#x27;t burn it down from within. I think it&#x27;s less of an issue to try to remove the CEO if you don&#x27;t agree with the direction they&#x27;re taking, but this was obviously done in a sloppy manner in this case, and their willingness to destroy it makes me distrust them (not that my opinion matters per se). reply 15457345234 5 hours agorootparent> but this was obviously done in a sloppy mannerI don&#x27;t think it was done in a sloppy manner, I think there&#x27;s a huge amount of spin and froth being generated to make it _look_ like it was done in a sloppy manner, but the reality is that the board took an executive action, released a discreet and concisely worded press release and then fell silent, which is 100% professional behaviour.To me it&#x27;s the other side that are acting sloppily, they&#x27;re thrashing around like maniacs, they&#x27;re obviously calling in favours behind the scenes as supportive articles are popping up all over the place, apparently employees were calling other employees in the middle of the night urging them to sign the &#x27;I&#x27;ll quit unless&#x27; letter, employees have been fed a misleading narrative (two of them, actually) about why the action was taken in the first place which riled them up...I have to assume here that the board - as they&#x27;re the ones acting professionally - similarly acted professionally before the firing and discussed the matter at great length and only resorted to this last minute firing because of exigent circumstances. The fact that a fired employee was able to cajole&#x2F;bluff&#x2F;whatever his way back into the office to prove some sort of point suggests that the board&#x27;s action may have been necessary. What exactly was done during that time in the office, one might ask? Were systems accessed? Surely it was an unauthorised entry and a major security violation.You do see that that action (re-entering the office after being fired) gives off lunatic vibes, don&#x27;t you? Maybe it really did come down to &#x27;yeah you&#x27;re technically my boss but I&#x27;m gonna do whatever the hell I want and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it because everyone loves me&#x27; to which the board&#x27;s only possible course of action is to fire immediately. reply foota 5 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think Sam cajoled their way and talked to the employees, as I understand it Ilya talked with the staff and revealed what they claimed were the reasons for the firing. reply 15457345234 5 hours agorootparentIn your opinion, was a crime committed when that person returned to the office?Either by himself or by the person that permitted him access knowing beyond any reasonable doubt that they were not authorized to be there?If systems were accessed, was another crime committed?If a person facilitated that access, has the boundary for &#x27;conspiracy to commit...&#x27; been reached? reply foota 3 hours agorootparentWhat?

I just think it seems unlikely that a board would decide something then about-face so rapidly as to have a meeting at the office the next day. It would be conventional for further meetings to take place at the offices of lawyers, for example.It would also be normal for the non-fired members of staff to be instructed to have no further contact with the fired person without legal counsel present.Sometimes it seems very much like everyone here is really playing to the cameras in a big way. replykragen 7 hours agorootparentprevthat does seem to be what altman was attempting: he wanted to have the cake of independent board members, but eat it by having them never express any opinions contrary to his own reply cycomanic 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean?

Do you think Google did not criticise Apple during that whole time (remember that the CEO is ultimately responsible for the company communications)?Even more in the case of OpenAI, the board member is on the board of a non-profit, those are typical much more independent and very often more critical of the decisions made by other board members.

They have no duty to protect the for-profit-OpenAI’s profits, reputation, or anything else. reply 15457345234 6 hours agorootparentprevThis has been argued here already and dissected thoroughly.It&#x27;s basically restating &#x27;her role is to cheerlead&#x27; but with more sophisticated wording.You haven&#x27;t made an argument, you&#x27;ve just used longer words to restate your (incorrect) opinion.Also I never said they had an &#x27;advisory&#x27; board. Board members ar either executive or non-executive members. If they&#x27;re nonexec then their role is to advise the executive members. They&#x27;re generally fairly independent and many nonexecutive board members serve on the boards of multiple companies, sometimes including ones that are nominally in competition with each other. reply kickopotomus 6 hours agorootparentNo, I never said that her role is to \"cheerlead\".

That suggests he cares more about the success of OpenAI than he does upholding the charter. reply skygazer 8 hours agorootparentHe had dual overlapping roles, a duty to the promote safe AI to the world, and a duty to prevent own-goal sabotage to the LLC. Ideally those roles wouldn’t conflict. He probably didn’t care if such a paper was written, but to have a board member as author is beyond awkward. But as an academic, her own dual overlapping role, she has a need to publish. (“Uh, please voice your concerns before we develop it instead of sand bagging us with a damning critique in an academic journal after the fact!”) This seems like a recipe for disaster. I’m not certain either really was “wrong” in that conflict. It just seems like this structure was doomed to failure, throwing uncompromising zealots together all with launch codes and a big red button.Safety isn’t binary, it’s degrees of risk assessment, mitigation and acceptance. Infinite safety is never progressing. But never progressing means failing the charity mission. And AI isn’t just being created at OpenAI, for them to succeed at the charity mission they need to stay ahead of risky competitors with a safer AI.The charity can’t afford its GPU costs without the LLC, and the LLC can’t lead the industry if it’s behind all the competitors. To be relevant the safety side needs compute, and they need to be ahead of the curve, and they also need real world data from the LLC. If the charity nukes the LLC, it takes itself with it and fails its mission. They’re so intertwined they need compromise in the board. And they let that board dwindle to small entrenched factions, which sounded more like the Hatfield’s and the mcCoys. With such a fragile structure they needed mature adults with functional conflict resolution. reply Aunche 7 hours agorootparentprev> That suggests he cares more about the success of OpenAI than he does upholding the charter.A board member should care about their organization more than their interpretation of the charter.

What?\" is worse than either. reply comp_throw7 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly backwards.

I don&#x27;t know whether she did discuss any issues with Sam before hand, but it really does not sound like she had any obligation to do so (this isn&#x27;t your typical for-profit board so her duty wasn&#x27;t to OpenAI as a company but to what OpenAI is ultimately trying to do). reply sumedh 8 hours agorootparent> but it really does not sound like she had any obligation to do soThe optics dont look good though if a board member is complaining publicly. reply mirekrusin 7 hours agorootparentFrankly that&#x27;s an irrelevant first order thinking.If Sam would let it go what would happen? Nothing. Criticism and comparisions already exist and will exist. Having it coming from board member at least gives counter argument that they&#x27;re well aware of potential problems and there is opportunity to address gaps if they are confirmed.If regulators find argument in the paper reasonable and that&#x27;s going to have impact - what&#x27;s wrong with that? It just means argument was true and should be addressed.They don&#x27;t need to worry about commercial side because money is being pured more than enough.The nature of safety research is critical by definition.

IMHO the mistake was setting up the structure the way it is and expecting that to go well. Even with MSFT they are obviously annoyed but also they have shareholders too and one reasonable question here is what the heck was Microsoft’s leadership doing putting billions of capital at risk with this entity that has such a wacky structure and ultimately governed by this non-profit board with a bizarre doomsdayish charter. Seriously if you haven’t read it, read it.This whole thing has been wildly mishandled but there’s an angle here where the nonprofit is doing exactly what they always said they would do and the ones that potentially look like fools are Microsoft and other investors that put their shareholder capital into this equation thinking that would go well. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentWhen Microsoft came on board the charter effectively went out the window.

It&#x27;s not that they want to slow down AI development; it&#x27;s that they want to keep it restricted to a tight inner circle.We have at least as much to fear from elites who think only megacorps and governments are responsible enough to be given access as we do from AI itself. The failures of our elite class have been demonstrated again and again in recent decades--from the Iraq War to Covid. These people cannot be trusted as stewards, and we can&#x27;t afford to see such potentially transformative technology employed to further ossify and insulate the existing power structure.OpenAI had the right idea. Keep the source closed if you must, and invest heavily on safety, but make the benefits available to all. The last thing we need is an AI priesthood that will inevitably turn corrupt. reply hutzlibu 7 hours agorootparent\"OpenAI had the right idea. Keep the source closed if you must, and invest heavily on safety, but make the benefits available to all.\"Well, you see the result. Apart from this drama, lots of debate and speculation whether we are already in AGI territory, because it is all just a black box and no one knows what exactly was in the training data to be able to judge the quality of the output.That is way too much AI priesthood for me, just open it for real, if you don&#x27;t want concentration of power. reply danenania 7 hours agorootparentYeah that&#x27;s certainly a debate worth having.My point is this coup against OpenAI (seemingly) wasn&#x27;t started by people who want to make AI more open. They want to make it inaccessible unless you&#x27;re in their club. To my reading, that is more starkly opposed to the charter than anything Sam Altman has done. Commercialization = giving wide access. Not total 100% open source access, but wide access nonetheless. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd so you strike a deal with Microsoft. That tracks. reply for1nner 8 hours agorootparentI think their point was that openAI (the nonpro) had the right idea in re: those concerns&#x2F;concentration.The velocity of release and entwining with MSFT (by the profit side) might then be reasonably seen as a great concern for the board. reply danenania 8 hours agorootparentprevAdvancing AI requires massive amounts of capital and compute. There&#x27;s no way around this. It can only be done either within or in partnership with huge organizations.The default, in the absence of an OpenAI, is that it gets developed secretly by these organizations, and they get to decide who can use it (hint: it&#x27;s not you, typical HN reader).OpenAI were the only ones at least trying to walk this tightrope, and I think they were doing a pretty good job. So what were the real motivations of these three wealthy&#x2F;elite board members who are taking it upon themselves to decide this issue for the rest of humanity?

There is also $70 million in mystery \"other income\" in the 990&#x27;s that is missing the required explanation (nature and source.)OpenAI is operated at a public charity and is required to meet a \"public support test\" of 33%, so Musk could not have given his $40 million without the $20 million from Open Philanthropy, an EA supported public charity. In fact, most of Open Philanthropy&#x27;s money went to OpenAI.Public charities are also required to have less than a majority of the board be employees or relatives of employees.

I noted in a comment elsewhere that all of these board members appear to have had at least one and some many more conflicts of interest. Helen probably believes that her loyalty is not to OpenAI but to something higher than that based on her remark that destroying the company would serve to fulfil its mission (which is a very strange point of view to begin with). But that doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that she&#x27;s able to place it in context, within OpenAI, within the USA, the Western world and the world as a whole.It&#x27;s like saying the atomic bomb would have never been invented if the people at Los Alamos didn&#x27;t do it. They did it in three years after it became known that it could be done in principle. Others tried and failed but without the same resources. I suspect that if the USA had not done it that eventually France, the UK and Russia would have gotten there as well and later on China. Israel would not have had the bomb without the USA (willing or unwilling) and India and Pakistan would have achieved it but much later as well. So we&#x27;d end up with the same situation that we have today modulo some timing differences and with another last chapter on WWII. Better? Maybe. But it is also possible that the Russians would have launched a first strike on the USA if they were unopposed. It almost happened as it was!The open question then is: does she really believe that no other entity has the resources to match OpenAI and does she believe that if such an entity does exist that it too will self destruct rather than to go through with the development?And does she believe that this will hold true for all time?

FAANG (especially Google and Facebook engineers) think this way on all sorts of things.The reality is that for any software project, your competition is rarely more than 1 year behind you if what you&#x27;re doing is obviously useful. OpenAI made ChatGPT, and that revealed that this sort of thing was obviously useful, kicking off the arms race. Now they are bleeding money running a model that nobody could run profitably in order to keep their market position.I have tried to explain this to xooglers several times, and it often goes in one ear and out the other until they get complacent and the competition swipes them about a year later. reply jltsiren 9 hours agorootparentprevI think the real issue is that OpenAI was doomed to fail from the beginning. AI is commercially too valuable to be developed by an organization with a mission like them. Eventually they had to make a choice: either become a for-profit without any pretensions about the good of humanity, or stay true to the mission and abandon ambitions of being at the cutting edge of AI development.A non-profit could not have beaten the superpowers in developing the atomic bomb, and a non-profit cannot beat commercial interests in developing AI. reply jart 8 hours agorootparentI always thought the structure was there to pull the wool over the eyes of the world&#x27;s smartest researchers, to get them to agree to help them build a doomsday sort of technology.

That&#x27;s why she lived in Beijing for a year, she is a big part of why there are a lot of Chinese researchers from various AI labs signed onto the CAIS statement, and it&#x27;s what her relationship to the Pentagon is all about. I think she is probably the individual person who knows the most in the world about the relative AI capabilities of China and the US, and her career is about working with the Pentagon, AI companies in the USA, and AI companies in China to prevent an arms race scenario around AI. It&#x27;s the sort of work that really, really doesn&#x27;t benefit from a lot of publicity, so it&#x27;s unfortunate that this whole situation has put her in the spotlight and means someone else will probably need to backchannel between the US and China on AI safety now.I don&#x27;t know why she chose to publicly execute Altman, there just isn&#x27;t enough information to say for sure. It probably wasn&#x27;t a specific, imminent safety concern like \"Our new frontier model was way more capable than we were expecting and attempted a breakout that nearly succeeded during internal red teaming\", according to the new CEO it wasn&#x27;t anything like that. The new CEO has heard their reason, but is putting a lot of pressure on them to put that reason in writing for some reason. I don&#x27;t know why, we just don&#x27;t have enough information.But basically, she is a very qualified person on the exact topic you are concerned about and has devoted her career to solving that problem.

    "originBody": "Breezewood, PA. Source: Wikipedia Commons Public space Children, left behind by suburbia, need better community design Walkable, mixed-use planning is the key to getting young people outside again and enabling their independence. RAHUL REJEEV NOV. 13, 2023 “Why don’t children leave the house?” Childhood in America is losing its charm. The lack of effective transit, coupled with the lack of kid-friendly destinations and the feeling of more dangerous neighborhoods, means that today’s youth find it harder than ever to go outside, meet up with friends, and form more meaningful relationships. A fundamental truth about American society is our heavy reliance on cars. The average American will spend over six months of their life behind a traffic light. American suburbs are dominated by wide streets, catering to cars and not people. Beyond the walkability concerns associated with car-centric urban planning, there's the fact that obtaining a driver’s license is only possible at the age of 16. Moreover, recent trends show a delay in teenagers’ pursuit of driver’s licenses. In 1983, 46.2 percent of 16-year-olds were licensed, compared to 25.1 percent in 2020. This shift can be partly due to the financial burdens of car ownership, insurance, and maintenance. Thus, for many young individuals, their desire to drive is overridden by these barriers. Lack of mobility coupled with large distances means that kids are far from the places where they want to hang out. As described by Ray Oldenburg, “third places” are locations where locals can meet, interact, and relax in a place that isn’t their home or place of work. In these locations, kids get the chance to socialize and develop intellectually. American suburbs don’t have these places. I am currently a rising senior in high school in the US, here after spending my freshman and sophomore years in England. My friends and I lived within 10 minutes of each other and all the parks. It was easy to meet up, easy to be around people. We could meet at the local park and drink slushies by the neighborhood corner shop. It was a place where we could expect to see people we knew and have a chat. Our lack of a driver’s license didn’t hold us back. In England, housing is often characterized by closely situated semi-detached or terraced structures built under flexible zoning regulations. This environment allows small businesses to coexist harmoniously with residential areas, in contrast to the rigid industrial zoning common in the United States. Notably, green spaces and corner stores are thoughtfully incorporated into English neighborhoods, encouraging residents to step out of their homes. This foot traffic contributes to enhanced safety, aligning with Jane Jacobs' observation that more eyes on the streets cultivate secure environments. Parents are sometimes scared to let their kids go out in non-walkable environments, especially in America. Examples of semi-detached, terraced, and corner shop urbanism. Source: Wikipedia Commons It’s said that people will walk up to five minutes, before they would rather drive. With this in mind, points of interest like small green spaces or bodega-type shops are essential to weave into suburbs. Having a small grocery shop or cafe close to home improves quality of life and encourages people of all ages to get out more. Many American suburbs currently employ what’s called “Euclidean zoning” where land is zoned for one use, whether it be for single-family housing or industrial zones. Suburbs must move towards mixed-use zoning where housing, small businesses, offices, and parks can co-exist. Mixed zoning often enables multi-story and more high-density housing. Mixed zoning has the potential promise of creating housing for all ranges of people, an inclusive community with amenities within walking distance. Housing diversity near transit stops could help alleviate traffic. With more people within walking distance of public transport, ridership rises, increasing funding. This allows mass transport to run more often and new lines to be created, promoting transport system use that reduces congestion and commute times. Public transport is the only guaranteed way for a young person to be free and enjoy mobility. In England, my peers and I would ride from town to town, allowing us to meet up with people from other parts of the country at skateparks and public events. American youth don’t experience this level of freedom until they get their driver’s license and can afford a car, the maintenance, and insurance that comes with it. Through mixed-use zoning, the creation of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and better public transport, we can improve the lives of young people. Envision a new norm for American children, where they can more easily create friendships and interact with the broader world. With our lives becoming increasingly entrenched in the virtual world, it’s more important than ever that we create neighborhoods that make connecting with people in the physical world easy.

Of course we take away the devices, but that just leads to them bemoaning their screen less state. One of the problems is, this is taught in the schools. Pretty much every class is using screens constantly. Our local school district recently experienced a hack that made it so they couldn’t use chromebooks for a few days. All the teachers lesson plans were completely centered around devices, so the kids just watched movies all day instead. reply thebradbain 11 hours agoparentBut would you let them? Alone, I mean.No pre-set plan, no parental supervision, just a “I’m going to go meet my friends on this summer day, I’ll be back before dinner.” For purposes of illustration, assume these kids are aged 9-14, or thereabouts. Too young to drive, too old to be doted over every minute of the day.If you would (and I hope you would!), would their friends’ parents? Would they be able to go casually knock on their friends’ doors (or even neighbors’ doors), be it biking or walking, and socialize, like kids do?My guess is probably not. And that’s not the kids’ doing— that’s OUR doing. If parents really wanted their kids to go outside and explore, that would be the norm. But for far too many kids it’s not, because parents don’t want it to be: they’re worried about their kid getting hit by a car, kidnapped, getting in trouble, learning a lesson, the list goes on and on. The built environment reflects that kids are not expected to be outside, as if we’ve kid-proofed it. And so even if you want your kid to play outside, no one else is, and of course no kid wants to play alone!Ironically, you would probably see more kids out and about, safe to be kids, in gasp New York City than in “safe” suburbia, from my own anecdotal experience. reply wizerdrobe 10 hours agorootparentI’m trying to put this politely - I promise!There’s a world out there far and beyond whatever bubble you’re in. My daughter (6) can go out back on the playground or practice archery or whatever. My next-door neighbor (next-door in the original, pre-app sense) has a dirt bike track for his handful of kids (5+ and up)I’ve got all kinds of neighbors with kids doing all the old things we did pre-Black Mirror in the pocket.Don’t get me wrong, I FIGHT like a… expletive, with my kids about screen time to a degree that my folks and older siblings laugh about given I’m a self-taught teenage hacker.But kids and communities with “go do shit” old-er school norms exist outside of the big cities. reply ricardobeat 7 hours agorootparentThat sounds great! But have you considered that you may be the one living in a bubble?What you described is the exception, most people live in either sterile suburbs and small towns, or densely packed (and dangerous) cities. Space for a dirt track in your backyard is a pipe dream. Around the world, the closest to your description would be rural areas in less developed countries, which is also a small % of the population. reply dalbasal 1 hour agorootparentThe bubble op referred to is not a particular place or lifestyle.The bubble, in this context, is the average&#x2F;representative lifestyle and parenting depicted in lifestyle journalism&#x2F;blogging space. The proverbial TED abstraction.Obviously physical circumstances are vary, but that didn&#x27;t start in the smartphone era. reply watwut 46 minutes agorootparentYeah and the person with kids being allowed outside is the one living in a bubble in USA. And the people outside of his bubble do get really outraged over the idea that 7 years old could be outside without parent. reply lebean 7 hours agorootparentprevGood point! Excuse me for interjecting here, but is it possible that you yourself are in a bubble of sorts? reply codeTired 6 hours agorootparentIt’s bubbles all the way down. reply seanmcdirmid 9 hours agorootparentprevNYC really isn&#x27;t that unfriendly to kids: plenty of public transit to get places, lots of places to be a pedestrian, lots of things to do. In much of suburbia...where do you go? There isn&#x27;t really much you can do until you are 15 or 16 and get a drivers license.I chose to live in a more urban area of Seattle (Ballard) because I want my now 1st grader to be able to do things when he is a bit older. Still not as nice as Tokyo, but it could be a lot worse if we lived further north or on the east side. reply SoftTalker 7 hours agorootparent> In much of suburbia...where do you go?I grew up in a typical suburban-style neighborhood (a few meandering roads with a lot of cul-de-sacs branching off and some connecting streets, quarter-acre lots, three-to-five bedroom ranches, two-stories, or bi-levels mostly spec-built). There was a park of about one square block, and a gas station at one of the neighborhood entrances. We rode bikes around, got soda or candy at the gas station, played in friends yards or at the park or at driveway basketball goals, nothing super exciting but kids find ways to entertain themselves. They don&#x27;t need a bunch of \"destinations\" like adults do. This was all pre-computer, and there was nothing interesting to a kid on TV during the day.Kids just need unstructured time with other kids, they will make up something to do. It&#x27;s not really an intrisic problem with suburbia, it&#x27;s a problem with hovering, overprotective adults.I&#x27;m talking mostly about kids 8-14 or so. Older teens will get more bored and mischevious. Fortunately by that age there&#x27;s more stuff they can be involved in at school or they can get a job. reply seanmcdirmid 7 hours agorootparentI only experienced that in Sylvania Ohio (a suburb of Toledo). In Vicksburg MS, where I was living in the county...it was a real neighborhood (not the sticks) but we had no parks, well it was the deep south. In outside of Bothell Washington it was the same thing, but I could drive by then so whatever.I guess I romanticized the big city as a kid, leading me to prefer urban over suburban living for my own kid. Maybe this will backlash and he will choose suburbia for his own kid(s). reply breakbread 3 hours agorootparentI grew up in Madison&#x2F;Ridgeland, Ms, where I did experience this. To some extent, at least. I had neighborhood friends. We rode bikes, crossed the tracks to go to the comic book store, etc.Still, I’ve always romanticized the big city. Never lived it, though, so maybe it’s a grass-is-greener thing, but maybe I’ll be able to give it a whirl someday. reply seanmcdirmid 2 hours agorootparentGrass is greener for me, but you have to choose the right big city, and those cities are expensive because lots of people make the same conclusions.As a curiosity, I checked out the neighborhood I used to live in on google maps to see if they had put any parks or sidewalks since. Nope, exactly the same. reply ethbr1 0 minutes agorootparentParks are sanitized vacant lots.The important thing is just having some sort of space, as the article puts it.>> As described by Ray Oldenburg, “third places” are locations where locals can meet, interact, and relax in a place that isn’t their home or place of work. In these locations, kids get the chance to socialize and develop intellectually. American suburbs don’t have these places.There&#x27;s rightfully no note whether that a corner store, mall, park, empty lot, or wild aeea.The important thing is that it&#x27;s accessible to kids and parents aren&#x27;t around. 4death4 5 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m talking mostly about kids 8-14 or so. Older teens will get more bored and mischevious.

You could get a job, or you could get high. For a lot of people, it&#x27;s an easy choice. reply andrepd 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Unstructured time with other kids\" is also the source of many many problems (as you acknowledge). Especially if the only destination is a gas station.Kids need parks, sports fields, cinemas, hobby stores, places to get food, etc, and they need them within walking distance. Being virtually dependent on cars to get anywhere is very crippling for kids. reply ZhadruOmjar 8 hours agorootparentprevGrowing up in a suburban environment was pretty boring. Bikes made it a bit better because we could at least ride around the place but with no malls or activity zones (lakes&#x2F;pools&#x2F;forests etc) around it just meant that we wandered a lot. reply kurthr 7 hours agorootparentI feel like that&#x27;s more true of ex-urbs. I lived in sububia and there were creeks, schools, pools, malls, a graveyard, train tracks, sport courts and churches, all within a 15-20min bike ride. Half of that was within a 15-20min walk, including the houses of half of my friends. \"Downtown\" was most of a mile walk and a 30-40min bus ride. Granted, it was old suburbia from the 50s-60s rather than new 90s builds, but there wasn&#x27;t more than a 2 story building within a mile in any direction.It&#x27;s still that way, only with more bike lanes and fewer kids outside. reply HEmanZ 4 hours agorootparentSo usually people who talk about suburbs refer more to the sprawling burbs of like late 60s+. What you’re referring to sounds like a “streetcar suburb”, which urbanists usually like reply jjav 53 minutes agorootparentI follow this debate often on HN and I&#x27;ve learned that those who say you can&#x27;t walk or bike anywhere in a suburb are talking about areas I consider rural. replyNegativeLatency 11 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s currently a strike in Portland, and I&#x27;ve appreciated seeing kids out and about being little adults, taking the bus, etc, makes me really glad to live in city even with all the cars and noise. reply yalestar 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve noticed that too during this teachers&#x27; strike in Portland!It was really one of the most unexpectedly heartening things I&#x27;ve seen in a while. reply orochimaaru 8 hours agorootparentprevActually I would. My kid does this regularly.Last year both my kids and a bunch from around the neighborhood decided to walk back together. They had a roaring good time. School would release at 3. It would be 4 by the time they got back home after stops at the park, jumping across the small creek, etc etc. The big kids went off to middle school so they aren’t walking back anymore. But everyone of them still misses the walk back.The place where I’m at is surprisingly walkable at least in the 1.5 mile radius enough to get the kids to their local cafe or run errands. The 10 and above kids regularly take off on their own. The phones have location turned on anyway. reply bradleyjg 8 hours agorootparentprevNo pre-set plan, no parental supervision, just a “I’m going to go meet my friends on this summer day, I’ll be back before dinner.” For purposes of illustration, assume these kids are aged 9-14, or thereabouts. Too young to drive, too old to be doted over every minute of the day.What are the odds they would all sit around together, outside, on their phones? reply lotsoweiners 7 hours agorootparentFrom my experience…very high. reply anon291 9 hours agorootparentprevMy daughter is five and walks a block to her grandparent&#x27;s house regularly (by herself, yes I know). In a few years, she will be walking to the corner store for basics or ice cream, or whatever. As for friend&#x27;s parents, we live in a walkable urban neighborhood (we chose this), and yes, kids do this all the time.> My guess is probably not. And that’s not the kids’ doing— that’s OUR doing.It&#x27;s parent&#x27;s doing both because of their regulations. It&#x27;s also parent&#x27;s doing because parents choose to live in suburbia &#x2F; pay a premium to do so. If parents paid premiums to live in dense urban neighborhoods, more would be built &#x2F; development patterns would change.It&#x27;s weird. As I said... we live in an inner city (we&#x27;re 1.5 miles from downtown core of our west coast city). You&#x27;d think our streets were busy, but ... they&#x27;re less busy than the suburban street I grew up in. Here&#x27;s the difference.. in a city. Few people drive. There are certainly main thoroughfares that are very crowded (my kids are not allowed to cross the large streets themselves). But within our neighborhood, bounded by large streets, the streets are really tiny and there&#x27;s few drivers. My house is actually quieter than the suburban street I grew up on. It&#x27;s silent at night. Cars are the noise, not people. People are quiet.So that is to say... Yes it&#x27;s parents fault. But parents are responding to their built environment, not any internal moral failing. The main issue is that parents are unable to understand the consequences of suburban living. reply swatcoder 12 hours agoparentprevKids 30 years ago wanted to endlessly watch TV, play video games, listen to tapes, and read books. 30 years before that, it was radio, TV, vinyl, and books. 30 years before that: radio, vinyl, and books.Kids are curious and stimulation-receptive and motivated, and so they&#x27;re going to chase easy sources of those things.Parents, meanwhile, can either work to balance the easy sources with other sources that might enrich them in novel ways (like going outside or being bored), accepting that their kids may not buy into the idea, or they can defer to their child&#x27;s sense and avoid tantrums and defiance.It seems like kids turn into adults either way, but the choice is ultimately one being made by the parent, not by the availability of screens per se. The easy stimulation is omnipresent. That ship sailed about 100 years ago. As a parent caring for kids (and a person caring for yourself!) you ultimately have to figure out what you want to do about it. reply dave78 11 hours agorootparentI was a kid 30 years ago. I may have wanted to watch TV all the time, but it was self-limiting back then. Much of the time the stuff on TV wasn&#x27;t anything a kid would want to watch. There were only certain times of the day that you could find someone you wanted.Screens today provide a bottomless pit of content for kids. At a parent, yes I have to limit my kids time or they&#x27;d just do it 24&#x2F;7. People talk about letting their kids figure out how to moderate themselves, but either I&#x27;m doing that wrong or (perhaps more likely) that just doesn&#x27;t work the same for every kid. reply nostrademons 5 hours agorootparent30 years ago my afternoon consisted of getting home at 2:30, watching The Disney Afternoon until about 5:00, then watching Square One, Reading Rainbow, and ideally 3-2-1 Contact (though it conflicted with The Mcneil-Lehrer News Hour that my mom always wanted to watch). Then it&#x27;d be on to The Cosby Show or Star Trek or some other sitcom. I think I averaged between 3.5-5 hours of TV per day. No cable.I basically don&#x27;t want TV anymore, and my kids are limited to 3 hours of screentime per day, which they basically only get on weekends. (They get maybe an hour during the weekday, but that&#x27;s because their school&#x2F;daycare&#x2F;aftercare days are much longer than mine were as a kid). I do set limits for them, but both of them (preschool-age) are able to turn off the tablets on their own if faced with the choice of doing it themselves or having mommy & daddy do it. reply NegativeLatency 11 hours agorootparentprevI feel like it&#x27;s also hard money wise as a kid, I remember wanting a milling machine and tools&#x2F;materials to build a boat that was just too absurdly expensive at the time. Also just being limited by cars and stuff, would&#x27;ve loved to be able to go surfing but it&#x27;s a hard sell to convince your parents to drive 6+ hours round trip for something like that. reply prawn 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s another challenge for parents. Books are expensive and take up space. Lego and various other toys are also expensive, take up space, and children constantly need reminders to pack it up. Arts and craft quickly dominate spaces and lead to disputes over which child made all the mess. Contrast with reading on an app like Libby (free, no bookshelves), playing Minecraft (cheap, no pack-up), or digital art&#x2F;puzzles.Digital equivalents are pushed in every workspace. Scrawling unnecessarily on paper would be frowned on as wasteful in the average office. Sending a paper letter instead of an email is rare.I&#x27;m not arguing that there aren&#x27;t advantages of physical books, board games, and literal painting, but doing things the \"right way\" is clearly more expensive, less space efficient, and uses up more time packing up. It all influences parenting decisions. reply kortilla 7 hours agorootparentBooks aren’t expensive if you teach them about the library reply willywanker 5 hours agorootparentAssuming there&#x27;s one within walking distance for the kid. reply Freedom2 3 hours agorootparentWhy wouldn&#x27;t there be one within walking distance, or even driving distance (assuming most people would want to drive their kids to nourishing activities)? reply speeder 10 minutes agorootparentYou must live in a wealthy place.In my experience in most places libraries are not common.

My family did not. 5-7pm was news on every channel ( all 4 that we received), and most nights after 8pm were adult dramas that kids under 10 wouldn&#x27;t generally want to watch.Weekends only had good stuff on in the morning on Saturday and then on Sunday night, depending on what age you&#x27;re thinking of. reply seanmcdirmid 9 hours agorootparentAfter school cartoons and Saturday morning cartoons were a life send when I was an 80s kid. PBS had some interesting programming that could appeal to kids on Friday nights (Blakes 7, Doctor Whoever). Even cable was a wash back then, you got bored of Nickelodeon quickly and there was no cartoon channel yet. reply dave78 7 hours agorootparentNot to mention all the commercials, which if nothing else the commercial break was sometimes enough to dislodge us and get us to think about doing something else. Now with streaming, kids can just go from one show to the next without any interruptions.On those occasions when we let them watch more than they should I&#x27;m sometimes amazed that they even remember to go to the bathroom.

Different parents will have different levels of ability and success.This is relevant (but difficult) advice for individual parents, but it&#x27;s a minor point if we&#x27;re discussing society. People (parents and kids) exist in an environment. \"Just going out to play,\" isn&#x27;t part of the world&#x2F;environment&#x2F;culture. The way kids&#x2F;parents did thing differently in the past was by existing in a different culture.Easy Vs hard stimulation is one paradigm, but you can&#x27;t just view everything through this lens. Life is more complex. There are looping and knotting causal relationships and we can&#x27;t know all of them. It&#x27;s a complex.Life is just very screen based. Ours and theirs.They study via screens, and don&#x27;t really know how to \"do school\" analogue. Social life is, largely through screens... and increasingly part of the media spectrum.

This line of whataboutism doesn’t work. None of those mediums were interactive or had their social networks on them. Almost everyone (kids) I knew watched a few hours of TV a day tops.

Kids don&#x27;t play outside so there are no kids playing outside.Screens are much more compelling than playing outside. Kids are still using their imaginations but they&#x27;re playing in a much more powerful sandbox. And, at the same time, outside is actually getting less compelling.It&#x27;s not healthy -- probably both in a physical and mental sense -- but the solution is far from just taking away screens. Society is structured around this now. reply duderific 11 hours agorootparent> There&#x27;s a feedback loop happening as well. Kids don&#x27;t play outside so there are no kids playing outside.So much this. When I was a kid (late 70&#x27;s), I could count on going outside and finding other kids to play with. Or if I didn&#x27;t find anyone, I&#x27;d ride my bike around until someone came outside. Or, I could even simply knock on my friend&#x27;s door and say \"Can Robert come out and play?\" and this was completely acceptable.I&#x27;d love to send my kid outside to play, but he&#x27;d just be wandering around by himself.

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very neighborhood-dependent, but neighbors don&#x27;t \"check\" up on each other either.I think this is more U.S.-wide: it&#x27;s not socially acceptable to knock on someone&#x27;s door or ring their doorbell even if they&#x27;re waiting for me. You&#x27;re supposed to text that you&#x27;re waiting outside. Doorbells are only for deliveries and unknown strangers (like selling something, politics, religious missionaries).If it&#x27;s not socially acceptable to knock on a friend&#x27;s door when they&#x27;re waiting for you to get there, then it&#x27;s definitely not gonna be socially acceptable to just knock, see if they&#x27;re home, say hi, and that&#x27;s it. reply Meekro 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure where this is coming from, maybe it&#x27;s a generational thing?In my case, (36M living in Texas) it&#x27;s totally normal for people to knock or ring the doorbell.

But for social beings, what you are describing is absolute isolation from society.I would posit that a big part of what glues the kids to the screen is that the screen is a window to the real world. When they look into the screen, they have an endless stream of other people, expressing opinions, doing things, existing in society.

Occasionally parents drive me to friends house, but again mostly just to play games (this is an era where play over internet was not feasible or widely available).Also the suburbs were a bit dangerous to walk or bike in.

Sure, there might not be any place for them to go to exercise that freedom, but if you legalize it they&#x27;ll eventually start coming back.As for now, keep cheering on the arrests of children playing on their own front lawns. The reason suburbia exists in the first place is because that&#x27;s the place your kids are maximally safe from this while still allowing you to be sufficiently gainfully employed, and making that way of life slightly more aesthetically acceptable to childless apartment-dwellers will do nothing to fix this.Karen delenda est. reply seanmcdirmid 6 hours agorootparent> >Why don’t children leave the house?> Because it&#x27;s illegal in most of North America (especially when you consider where people actually live) for them to leave the house.It is not illegal in most of North America, if you consider the USA (not sure about Canada&#x2F;Mexico), only three states have laws that make it actually illegal.

As a teen I was not really restricted in where to go and there are plenty of neighborhood parks and libraries to hang out at.None of the article&#x27;s critiques of suburbia ring true to me with respect to Fremont. If you are seeking nightlife as an adult, you might feel it is a wasteland. But for children growing up I&#x27;m not seeing a problem. Part of that is that most of the city can be navigated without ever being on an arterial. Part of that is that most of the city was developed during an era where neighborhood parks could be mandated. Part of that is the city was master planned when it was small and they foresaw today&#x27;s population.It is true children spend less time outside than they used to. Part of that is fear; when my kids were young, I didn&#x27;t trust that strangers wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if they were outside the house. But right or wrong, that fear is worsened by the proposed changes to how suburbs are laid out, not improved. reply jeffbee 10 hours agoparentThe fear has nothing to do with \"stranger danger\".

Until a few years ago it was possible for upper middle class like the dear readers of HN to afford these neighborhoods in middle tier cities like Boise, Austin, Denver, Nashville, etc. but now even those are out of reach unless you are wealthy or willing to pay most of your income in mortgage AND have two working parents. reply swatcoder 7 hours agorootparentFor about 20 years in there, we called that process gentrification and it was specifically led by ambituois young professionals (like those on HN) who bought into traditionally ethnic and&#x2F;or ailing neighborhoods and filled them with cronut shops and ukelele performance centers (or boot stores and gastropubs).But as you note, that movement petered out and more and more money came in and now those same neighborhoods are inaccessible to the same kind of people that first gentrified them.Except that, as many predicted as gentrification became rampant, it&#x27;s not really sustainable to drive all the service workers and their families out of the city center, and so now they just live on the streets outside of the cronut shops and gastropubs.So if you give it another 10 or 20 years though, you can expect another urban flight to manifest and balance things out a little more again. reply absoluteunit1 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s way above my pay grade to be able to afford to live there reply notacoward 6 hours agorootparentprevBecause people doing that is why this will never change. Every time someone leaves the suburbs for the city, a vote in town elections goes with them. Every time, it becomes less likely that zoning or other local laws affecting land&#x2F;property use will change. The only way to make the suburbs better, to turn all of these urban-design principles we all know so well into reality, is for more people to stay and fight.\"Move to the city\" (or any other already-walkable place) is part of the problem, not the solution. For one thing, people won&#x27;t do it en masse. Even if they did, those too-few places would become even less affordable, plus their power&#x2F;water&#x2F;waste infrastructure would get strained beyond breaking. It&#x27;s a very privileged and selfish position to take. Instead, we need to make more such places, reconfiguring and repurposing buildings and other infrastructure where they are and where the people are. And that takes voting power. Don&#x27;t tell people to throw that away. reply marssaxman 5 hours agorootparentHere in Seattle, over two-thirds of the land inside city limits is locked up in suburban-style low-density, single-family-only residential zoning. We would not need the suburbs if we could stop forcing people out of the city by prohibiting natural urban development. Seattle needs more people living in the city who want city life, so we can get these policies changed and build out proper urban amenities: mixed-use zoning, rapid transit, bike infrastructure, walkable neighborhoods.Infrastructure gets upgraded when the tax base arrives to justify it. Yes, you are right, \"we need to make more such places\", and the low-density neighborhoods closest to the city center are the most efficient places to do that.It is a genuine tragedy that so much sprawl has been built over the last 60-70 years. Much of that construction can never afford its own maintenance without subsidy from the city centers. To make this sustainable, we must densify and contract. reply AtlasBarfed 6 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m going to take a slightly different tack, one that will probably also provide walkable.We should be transitioning as many neighborhoods to be aligned around the e-bike, which provides a lot more transportation utility, a fair amount more range, but not nearly as much danger to pedestrians, climate impact, etc.Walkability comes practically for free from such an approach.The ebike should provide just enough range + concentration to enable the big box store. What is not talked about with walkable neighborhoods is that they are rich neighborhoods with rich people that don&#x27;t mind paying twince Walmart costs.Especially post-covid-inflation, this won&#x27;t fly. You need SOME big box scale.Because no one talks about the bodega in the slum. There&#x27;s lots of poor neighborhoods with expensive bodegas that are poor people&#x27;s only options.

Kids could socialise with their friends outside because everything had to be accessible via waking, cycling or public transit. It was also socially and legally acceptable to have young kids out on their own.When I grew up in suburbia my friends from school were a half hour drive away.

In Japan, it&#x27;s perfectly legal, and people do it all the time (drinking beer with a picnic in the park; they don&#x27;t walk and drink though, but there&#x27;s no law against it).

Many communities have barely enough money to keep the infrastructure from falling apart, how do you plan on rebuilding those?This is extraordinarily easy actually. You eliminate residential zoning. Every house can now partake in limited commercial activity. Want to start a cafe? No problem. Want to start a barbershop? Sure. Massage studio, yes. Doctor office, yes. Office? Sure. Small grocery stor.? Absolutely.We can have moderate limitations for parking and congestion, but no actual restrictions on what can take place. This will immediately raise property and income taxes which can be reinvested into infrastructure. In the meantime, there&#x27;s no need to immediately deal with stroads. People will be using the stroads less since they can get a significant portion of needs met locally.This is not a radical proposal. We already allow some home-based businesses and they do fine, like daycares, etc.Once the stroads are less used, and people mostly shopping locally, then we can narrow the stroads bit by bit and turn them into nice proper commercial districts. reply ShadowBanThis01 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s hypocritical. You want to eliminate residential zoning, but that&#x27;s not necessary in order to allow home businesses.Your scenario is also NOT why politicians are attacking residential areas; if you look at corrupt legislation like California&#x27;s SB 9&#x2F;10, it allows ONE house to be replaced by a 10-unit monstrosity without permits or any vetting or veto power by municipalities.

It&#x27;s an interesting paradox.The only advance I&#x27;ve seen so far is some localities began to allow building ADUs, in very limited capacity in hopes to alleviate housing shortages.

The quiet suburban roads don&#x27;t form a network that allows you to go to actual destinations.Here in Toronto they are trying to address that by building (a few) cycle tracks running parallel to these horrible arterial roads, but it&#x27;s still an awful experience.

That&#x27;s a direct consequence of car-centric urban planning.These low-density car-dependent suburbs provide a very poor experience for everybody outside a car, from children&#x2F;teens who can&#x27;t drive yet to people who are trying to get to a destination (work, shop, library, restaurant, etc.) without a car. reply anon291 9 hours agorootparentprev> There are generally enough kids in the neighborhood that you can find someone to play with of about your age.Is there? This is actually a problem. In many neighborhoods, especially in the nicest areas where people are richer, there are fewer and fewer kids. Today, there are significantly fewer kids than adults. Just a few decades ago, kids outnumbered adults in many neighborhoods.I mean this really matters. If you have a community of 40 families and twenty kids, there&#x27;s hardly any kids that can actually play with each other. They&#x27;re probably too different in age, to have groups of more than 2 or 3, and that&#x27;s a stretch because if you only have two or three there&#x27;s a significant chance you may not get along &#x2F; might not be super-interested. reply joenot443 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are loads of communities outside the GTA which are largely post-war and are still exceptionally bikable.

    "originLink": "https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-loads-slower-on-firefox",
    "originBody": "Apps & Software YouTube punishes ad-blocker users with slower videos on all browsers News By Jay Bonggolto published 21 November 2023 Ad-blockers on Firefox or Microsoft Edge? Prepare for YouTube slowdowns. Comments (0) (Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central) Update 1 (November 20, 8:48 pm ET): Google has issued a statement about YouTube videos loading slower on non-Chrome browsers. Update 2 (November 21, 11:13 pm ET): Google clarified that the YouTube slowdowns affect all browsers with ad blockers installed. What you need to know Several Reddit posts have highlighted a five-second delay when loading YouTube videos on Firefox, which disappeared when the user agent was switched to Chrome, revealing a potential browser-specific issue. Investigation by users suggests that the delay isn't a Firefox bug but an intentional addition in the JavaScript code of YouTube's desktop client. Discussions speculate that the added delay might be linked to ad display, possibly as a workaround for users employing ad blockers. YouTube's desktop site is reportedly slowing down for some people on Mozilla Firefox, causing confusion among users. A Reddit user (u/vk6_) posted a video revealing a five-second lag loading YouTube videos on Firefox (via 9to5Google). The same Redditor demonstrated a trick to dodge the endless wait. By temporarily switching to a Chrome disguise, they tricked YouTube into believing they weren't using Firefox, and the video loaded instantly. Eagle-eyed users quickly pinpointed the culprit behind the slowdown—a code snippet lurking in YouTube's source code. This sneaky code seems to be part of YouTube's recent anti-ad-blocking measures. Redditor vk6_ did some digging and discovered that this isn't a Firefox glitch. Apparently, YouTube's JavaScript code has a built-in delay mechanism that intentionally holds up the video playback on desktop for five seconds. Other tech-savvy folks have even tracked down the exact location of this mischievous code in YouTube's source. However, Android Central's editors and staff writers tried to recreate the delay, but no dice. YouTube seemed to work perfectly fine on Firefox and other web browsers we're using. We've contacted Google for an explanation anyway, and we'll keep you posted once we hear back. Several Firefox and Edge users reported experiencing the delay even with extensions disabled, suggesting it might be an account-specific issue and that it's not just affecting Mozilla's browser. The delay reportedly happens every time a user opens a YouTube link in a new tab. Some people have speculated that this delay might be a clumsy attempt by YouTube to force ads on users who block them. The code in question might be trying to make sure that an ad plays for at least five seconds before the actual video starts. This isn't the first rodeo for Firefox users butting heads with Google over what feels like some intentional slowdown. Back in 2018, former Mozilla executive Chris Peterson alleged that YouTube pages load five times slower on Firefox and Edge compared to Chrome. Update A YouTube spokesperson has confirmed that the YouTube slowdowns on Firefox are related to its anti-ad-blocker efforts. \"To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we’ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium for an ad free experience,\" the company said in an email to Android Central. \"Users who have ad blockers installed may experience suboptimal viewing, regardless of the browser they are using.\" Update 2 Google has made it clear that YouTube slowdowns aren't just targeting Firefox or Edge browsers. Turns out, if you're using an ad blocker with any browser, including Chrome, you may be experiencing delays in loading videos. \"Ads are a vital lifeline for our creators that helps them run and grow their businesses,\" a YouTube spokesperson told Android Central. \"That's why the use of ad blockers violate YouTube’s Terms of Service.\" YouTube's ad blocker radar doesn't discriminate between browsers, so if you've got an ad blocker on any of them, brace yourself for some video loading delays. Google is urging users to either tolerate the ads or cough up some cash for YouTube Premium if they want to enjoy an uninterrupted viewing experience. Even after ditching your ad blocker, you might still encounter some sluggishness while loading YouTube videos. It's just a temporary hiccup—just give it a refresh, and things should get back to normal in no time. Sign up for Black Friday email alerts!

It _is_ however an anti-adblock measure meant to determine if the video is automatically getting skipped forward.The reason on why changing your useragent \"fixes\" the problem, is that you&#x27;re changing the tuple and the anti-adblock system won&#x27;t serve the code-at-issue until it determines whether you&#x27;d be a good candidate for the experiment.Secondarily, YouTube has no financial incentive to actively punish non-chrome useragents. They make money in their division by serving ads, regardless of the useragent. reply mdasen 16 hours agoparent> YouTube has no financial incentive to actively punish non-chrome useragents. They make money in their division by serving ads, regardless of the useragent.Google has big financial incentives to punish non-Chrome user agents.First, we&#x27;ve seen that Google pays a large amount of money to be the default search engine in competing browsers. A big reason for funding Chrome development is so that Google doesn&#x27;t have to pay someone for the majority of its search traffic. If Google is paying out 30-40% of search ad revenue from non-Chrome browsers, that&#x27;s many billions of dollars if they can get more people to use Chrome. If non-Chrome browsers are a bad experience on one of the most popular sites on the internet, that pushes people to use Chrome.Second, Google is altering Chrome so that ad blockers won&#x27;t be as effective. If they can push people to use Chrome, they&#x27;ll get more ad revenue since ad blockers won&#x27;t be as effective.Google has been pushing Chrome because people using Chrome makes them billions of dollars. Maybe YouTube itself doesn&#x27;t have a financial incentive, but Google definitely does.If Chrome vanished tomorrow, Google would then face steep fees when their deals with Mozilla and Apple were up for renewal since they&#x27;d be dependent on traffic from Firefox and Safari. Instead, Google can keep paying Mozilla less and less money over time as more people use Chrome instead of Firefox. reply dontblink 14 hours agorootparentSometimes the simplest explanation is the most probable and there is no wide spread conspiracy.Youtube does experiments based on user-agents. I think this is well known and if not, a former Googler just let you know.In any case, for those who are complaining, it&#x27;s their website. Either pay or stop using it? reply crazygringo 14 hours agorootparentNot to mention, if performance with YouTube is slow, there&#x27;s no clue for users that Firefox is the problem. There&#x27;s no banner telling you \"for faster YouTube performance use Chrome\". And it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that your average user is going to try to compare with Chrome, or even the thought occurs to them. They probably think their ISP just got worse or something.If this were an actual mechanism to try to get users to switch, it would be an idiotic one. reply LightHugger 10 hours agorootparentprevInstead of just \"stop using it\" (pay isn&#x27;t actually an option here, people who are paying are still getting the delay), let&#x27;s force them to comply with reasonable antitrust regulation under threat of fines.

They make money in their division by serving ads, regardless of the useragent.With Google&#x27;s ongoing desire to break ad-blockers in Chrome, and make tracking a mandatory web specification via essentially monopoly browser status[1], Google has a _very_ strong financial incentive to punish non-chrome UAs - anything that pushes people to Chrome over browsers that they don&#x27;t control is a win for them.[1] let&#x27;s be real: the only reason many sites work in browsers other than chrome is iOS safari, that&#x27;s it reply smashed 15 hours agoparentprevYou are describing exactly what targeting non-chrome browsers is but somehow saying it&#x27;s not? reply tareqak 14 hours agoprevCould this action potentially open up Google to an anti-trust suit?If the claim is true, then Google is using dominance in one platform (videos - YouTube) to achieve dominance in another (browsers - Chrome). reply SuchAnonMuchWow 13 hours agoparentThey already use their dominance in one platform (android) to achieve dominance in another (chrome), the exact same way Microsoft have been found guilty of years ago.If the US govt wanted to sue google for it, they would have years ago. reply tareqak 11 hours agorootparentSure, but I think this particular case is would be more clear cut.If a person can measure the time the page spends loading with a complete break down across a number of different browsers both on the same machine and on identically-specified machines together with a an external running stopwatch, then they would be able to show that which browsers are being slowed down.There is less hand-waving here with questions like, \"Well, does bundling Chrome on Android really affect the browser market?\" . We know that slower load times is a worse user experience, and if this claim is true, then YouTube and Google are squarely to blame. reply _Algernon_ 17 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s pretty trivial to write a yt-dlp one-liner to batch download all your subscriptions.

I have a Google account for gmail, and since I use Android I unavoidably have a Google account because of it, but there&#x27;s no reason to use that account for youtube. In fact, there is (or, at least, there used to be) a good reason to never use a Google account for youtube: they have (or, at least, used to have) a \"real name\" policy for youtube, so if they for some reason decide that your real name is not your real name, you could lose access to your whole Google account, including more important services like Google Talk. Therefore, whenever I watch any video on youtube, I very carefully make sure that the browser is not logged into the Google account, and watch it anonymously. reply k8sToGo 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can use an invidious instance for example.

Labor is the same with a persons time.I disagree. What is a farmer going to do with 100 bushels of wheat? What is an oil producer going to do with 1 million gallons of oil? Trade happens (much of the time) because a person who has Thing A would rather have Thing B and is willing to give up Thing A for it. And person with Thing B would rather have Thing A and is willing to give up Thing B for it. And money is the technology that enables this exchange to happen more quickly and easily.>While it is unlikely that most money is used to cause \"evil\" acts, it is very likely that most \"evil\" acts occur due to money changing hands.This has nothing to do with money or trade.

It would also be a better user experience because there wouldn&#x27;t be these sharp edges between playing the ad and the content that are separately buffered. reply Nifty3929 15 hours agoparentYoutube doesn&#x27;t produce the videos. Are you suggesting they should re-encode them with the ads inserted into that particular video file? That seems worse, with little gain. Plus think about all of the additional storage and streaming cost required for that, because you&#x27;d have to duplicate that ad in all the videos now. Meaning each 15sec ad would add a tiny bit to each of 1B videos, instead of just being a separate 15sec video all by itself. And separate cached in all the places where that video is cached.This is a bad idea. reply packetlost 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m fairly certain you could inject ads directly into the video stream at the protocol layer (HLS&#x2F;DASH) without too much difficulty.

I use the YouTube app for Apple TV (so no chance for an ad blocker) and it has been slowly increasing the last two years.

One set at the beginning and following sets at approximately 3 minute intervals.At least some mid-rolls are skippable but they are totally random. Like, maybe a set of 2 ads where the first is 15 second and the second is 15 seconds that is skippable after 5 seconds. The combination of length and skippable is confusing.More annoying is the tendency to sneak a 3 minute ad in there that is skippable. So unless I am in the room and near the remote it will just play the whole thing.

Being able to skip after 5 seconds on most is nice, but I&#x27;d almost rather they were just 10 seconds long and unskippable. It&#x27;s frustrating to watch 5 seconds, skip, and then immediately need to do that again, especially if it&#x27;s something you have on &#x27;in the background.&#x27;If they had one based on a scale of how many videos you watch, I&#x27;d be much more keen.

But platform dependant throttling should be prevented by good regulation, if that means Youtube&#x27;s business model is less viable I frankly don&#x27;t care.All I know is I&#x27;m keeping my eyes open for their next swing at remote attestation. If you follow the money, it&#x27;s a logical step. reply rychco 15 hours agoparentprevPossibly a hot take, but youtube premium is too expensive. I don&#x27;t care about youtube music, I don&#x27;t care about offline use, I don&#x27;t care about background play&#x2F;queue on my phone. I just want to watch ad-free video, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth $14&#x2F;month.Ideally the offline&#x2F;background play&#x2F;queuing should be included because they&#x27;re unrelated to the cost of serving video, but any other features like music&#x2F;4K&#x2F;etc should be an extra purchase. However, I strongly doubt enough people would even bother with those to justify having as separate features. reply 05 14 hours agorootparentJust use an Argentinian&#x2F;Indian&#x2F;Turkish VPN to buy it for (much) less then.. reply dotBen 14 hours agoparentprev> Instead of an ad-blocker, try a YT premium subscriptionWhy is YouTube Premium $14&#x2F;m?

This is chrome. It hasn&#x27;t happened in the last week, but typically I see it more when there are updates that require chrome to restart. It seems like either an unintentional bug or a dark pattern. But punishing users that are blocking ads is the hardest sell.I&#x27;ve gotten viruses from ads, and I will not allow them. Google is never going to sell me on that.Maybe instead of slapping users, they should have had some fiscal responsibilities in the good times and not setup a complete adult daycare for their employees. reply km3r 17 hours agoparent> I will not allow themThen pay for youtube premium. why should google provide you a service for free, without ads?

If they refuse to serve free pizza after that I&#x27;ll just go pay for higher quality pizza elsewhere.What I won&#x27;t do is pay the harasser.

But Google is still siphoning my data and selling it to advertisers. If these companies can do business in an ethical manner, there wouldn&#x27;t be this much backlash.

I do not mind if the creators incorporate sponsor ads into their content, but what YT does to the user experience is just awful. Inserting multiple, low quality, loud, long unskippable ads into one video, who the heck would want to watch that?! It&#x27;s clear to me that Google is pressing on to make users buy subscriptions. It&#x27;s basically a dark pattern, closely resembling coersion. reply ericmcer 15 hours agoparentDon&#x27;t creators get paid based on how many ads are shown&#x2F;clicked? They are probably excited by the idea that their revenue will increase by (% of people who use adblockers).The goals of creators and youtube are more closely aligned than the goals of creators and their audience. reply ta1243 14 hours agorootparentNot really, they get far more from sponsors and merch reply yogurtboy 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is not true at all. As others have mentioned, sponsored spots get a producer much more revenue, and unskippable preroll and midroll ads are likely to make a person just not watch the video at all (which in turn makes the sponsored spots less profitable). reply LordDragonfang 15 hours agorootparentprevYoutube-served ad revenue is a pittance compared to in-video sponsorships. Every time the served ads piss someone off enough to not continue watching (and therefore deny the video a recorded \"view\") it probably costs the creator more than they would get from the slightly increased revenue of more aggressive ads across dozens of viewers. reply ErneX 15 hours agoparentprevLeaving to where?

They released a statement saying \"Nobody wants to watch ads, nobody wants to pay a subscription, we have no revenue stream.\" reply jonas21 14 hours agoparentprevCreators on YouTube get to decide how many ads appear and when they appear on each video they create (as long as they&#x27;re in the partner program, which is open to basically anyone with >1000 subscribers).If the videos you&#x27;re watching have a lot of ads at inconvenient times it&#x27;s because the creators wanted them there. reply smolyeet 14 hours agoparentprevpeople have been using ad blockers for years, which probably prompted showing the more annoying ads. the option is use an adblocker or buy premium. if people are unwilling to do either, then just don&#x27;t use the platform. reply supermatt 17 hours agoprevFrom earlier reports you can just change the user-agent header to appear as chrome and the problem goes away.How do they keep pulling this anti-competitive bullshit?
