Does GMT-8 to GMT+1 mean that you are okay with active hours being pretty much standard of these timezones, or that you literally require that applicants' place of residence would be considered in one of these timezones? This can make a huge difference for people who prefer at least slightly unusual circadian rhythms (night owls and similar ; I definitely have history of such preference). And I'm mostly thinking about borderline cases like people in GMT+2 to GMT+4.

Today, when a new food brand starts to take off (think “startup” but for something like a hot sauce), they spend 12-18 months establishing a partnership with a manufacturer to produce their product at scale. The pain point is so high, they typically pay consultants $60k to solve the problem. Our cofounder (former Dir of Ops @ Trader Joes) did this as a consultant and now we are turning her expertise into software. We are building a mix of a marketplace + Turbotax style functionality to bring automation and scalability to the industry. With great traction and paying customers, we just closed a $2M seed round. We are now ready and excited to bring on our first engineer. As part of an early-stage company, you’ll have real and tangible impact on the business and our users. Along with our CTO, you will write code and ship product to a growing number of paying customers. We prioritize a developer-friendly environment by being remote first, having low infrastructure/configuration overhead, autonomy in your work, and getting rid of webpack. As with any startup, product requirements and direction can change. And we strive to always provide clarity around “what did we learn” + “how that changes our thinking”. We feel the added transparency and sense of ownership results in keeping us closer to our customers and delivers a better end product. ---- Ideal requirements * A love for Ruby on Rails * Rspec or Minitest * View Components * Tailwind * Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus) * Postgres * Bonus: payments integration experience (like Stripe), accounting systems integration (like Quickbooks), or fintech experience (like lending) We have a fully remote team and culture, including: home office setup stipend and optional bi-weekly in-person (Boston area) working days for local candidates.

How can one expect markets to work without price transparency?

You probably know a lot of things I don't, and some things that I can never know. That does not allow me to compel you to tell them to me. Yes, even if I really want to make some impossible to define metric, like efficiency, look better. reply 9question1 10 hours agorootparentThis was a really remarkable way to undermine your argument. It's possible to make a strong philosophical argument that government regulation of salary transparency is unnecessary or harmful. This is not that. The fact that there exist some types of private information for which we recognize a right to maintain privacy does not at all imply it is morally wrong for the government to recognize a public right for some other type of information (salary ranges). In the US there exist both the Freedom of Information Act and the Fourth Amendment guarding against warrantless search. It's obviously clear that the government recognizes the right to demand public transparency for some types of information and the right to protect privacy for other information. You've made no attempt whatsoever to explain why this type of information should fall in one category or the other, just gestured to the existence of one of the categories and implied that this proves that the information in question belongs there. reply oDot 9 hours agorootparentI did not make any claim for or against transparency, but did say that OPs claim for transparency is weak. Lack of knowledge does not imply you can coerce transparency. Not sure how your reply related to it. reply lotsofpulp 11 hours agorootparentprev> Not having access to something does not grant you rights to it. The California law I referenced grants me rights to the pay range information. > You probably know a lot of things I don't, and some things that I can never know.

We're a generally Bayesian group, and so we're looking for someone who has experience with some Bayesian tools.

So \"depends on the qualifications of the individual applicant\" is kind of besides the point; a wide range can account for that. \"I'm not the King of Hiring\" is fair though, if you're in a jurisdiction where there is no transparency law and you're not setting policy for your company, you may well be required not to provide this information publicly and that's just how it is. reply 0xEF 14 hours agorootparentprev> I think it really depends on the qualifications of the individual.

Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested the Federal Trade Commission investigate major automakers for breaking a pledge to protect their customers’ location data, in a letter to Chair Lina Khan sent today. The automakers had deceptively pledged that they would insist on warrants or other court orders before turning over location data from their customers’ connected automobiles to law enforcement agencies. The letter comes in response to an inquiry by Sen. Wyden’s office, which asked the association representing automakers how their members respond to law enforcement requests for location information collected from internet-connected cars and trucks. He found that only five — GM, Ford, Honda, Stellantis and Tesla — require a warrant to provide location data to law-enforcement. And only Tesla notifies auto owners about government demands. “Automakers have not only kept consumers in the dark regarding their actual practices, but multiple companies misled consumers for over a decade by failing to honor the industry’s own voluntary privacy principles. To that end, we urge the FTC to investigate these auto manufacturers’ deceptive claims as well as their harmful data retention practices,” Wyden and Markey wrote. Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge’s approval. Volkswagen indicated that it will require a warrant for more than seven days of location data, but will disclose six days or less in response to a subpoena. Volvo, which is owned by Geely, a Chinese company, did not respond to the request. These responses directly contradict a public pledge by the auto industry, that the companies signed onto, committing to require that “requests or demand from governmental entities for geolocation information, must be in the form of a warrant or court order,” except in emergency situations or with the owner’s consent. Wyden and Markey warned that failing to protect Americans’ privacy could have dangerous consequences, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which allows states to criminalize abortion and places other reproductive health choices at risk of criminalization. Vehicle location data can reveal intimate details of a person’s life, including for those who seek care across state lines, attend protests, visit mental or behavioral health professionals or seek treatment for substance use disorder.

So, if the truth is being told, then some car manufacturers are breaking promises. Vote your car purchases accordingly? reply mdp2021 20 hours agoparent> Vote your car purchases accordingly? And wait for the next internal administration to change policy. The issue is with the car being connected! reply bell-cot 20 hours agorootparentTrue. But if: #1 - You need a new car and #2 - All your new car options are connected then #3 - See #1 Or, maybe those cheap new Chinese EV's I've been hearing about will not be connected, nor connectable, \"because cost-cutting\". That trick might also save the Chinese manufacturers a load of legal headaches and issues. reply highcountess 20 hours agorootparentThat has also crossed my mind in the past. The Chinese government being the source of conserving privacy from an acceleratingly authoritarian, western world dominating centralized government is rather ironic. I could see it happen just for the Chinese to enter the U.S. market. It would also at the same time cause massive rifts in the west’s self-image of openness, equality, non-discrimination, anti-racism, etc (just like the TikTok ban is exposing) and the public will become painfully aware of the false and fake nature of our governments, if they block cars/Chinese companies without a legitimate justification. If I were the Chinese I would do just that, not only offer cars that are not connected other than if one wants to connect their phone, but even make it a major issue and part of their identify and advertisement campaigns. reply 4bpp 19 hours agorootparentThere is nothing particularly ironic about that - it's in the Chinese government's interest to control its own citizens and subvert its adversaries' control over theirs, and vice versa. See also Russia granting asylum to Snowden, and the myriads of Chinese, Russian, Middle Eastern etc. dissidents sheltered by the Western bloc. I imagine we would see more of the converse were it not for the language barrier, too. If anything, we should be grateful for this situation; in a worse world all these governments would abide by gentlemen's agreements to not act against each other when it comes to controlling their subjects, notwithstanding their differences. reply toast0 19 hours agorootparentprevYou probably don't need a new car. A lightly used connected car with a 3g modem is no longer a connected car. I've got two now; one of which had a 3g modem added as a factory recall because 2g was shutdown and the connected features stopped working. reply ale42 18 hours agorootparentDepends in which country you drive. Germany has still 2G enabled (at least for some networks) while they removed 3G. Other countries did the opposite, but many European countries will still have 2G or 3G for a few years. reply joecool1029 18 hours agorootparentprev> 2g was shutdown On T-Mobile it's still operational, they cancelled the sunset indefinitely. (3G is shut down though) reply toast0 18 hours agorootparentUS car sellers seem to like ATT and Verizon. My personal experience with T-Mobile was that 2G became unavailable; maybe it worked in some places, but my 2G only phone would never connect anymore. reply joecool1029 16 hours agorootparentThe coverage footprint was never as large as LTE or NR. They also never added new 2G coverage later on, some markets started with LTE-only. If your device is 2G only, needs an older SIM containing the SIM application that T-Mobile doesn't activate anymore. (I only have one of these still working). However 3G phones with 2G fallback will work on new sim cards through the USIM application (technically even esim through stuff like esim.me). reply philsnow 20 hours agorootparentprev> maybe those cheap new Chinese EV's I've been hearing about will not be connected, nor connectable, \"because cost-cutting\". TCL TVs are so cheap because they sell ads and information about what you’re watching to anybody who will buy it.

Or how to modify them to not phone home. Happy to pull fuses or connectors. reply ryandrake 19 hours agorootparentYea, it's gotten to the point where recent cars are such a minefield of misfeatures and unwanted features. Traditional car buying sites like Autotrader need to offer better filters. I should be able to check a box that says \"No touchscreen,\" \"No microphone,\" \"No cellular connectivity,\" \"No telemetry,\" \"No account[1] required\" and so on. Without this, you need to filter by year, but that's not really precise. 1: Aside: The idea of having to have an online account with the manufacturer in order to use a car is so ridiculous, I can't even believe I'm typing it. reply 7thaccount 18 hours agorootparentAt this point I've considered building a mostly finished kit car. These privacy violations should absolutely be illegal. I shouldn't have to deal with GM selling my driving data to my insurance provider. I can't just buy a different car either as they ALL do it now. Also, a car should not be like setting up an iPad. Dedicated buttons are superior and safer, but it won't happen again at this point outside of an act of Congress as the manufacturers found out it's cheaper to make just a single touchscreen. reply chasd00 18 hours agorootparentprev> The idea of having to have an online account with the manufacturer in order to use a car is so ridiculous, I can't even believe I'm typing it. Where is this the case? I haven't heard of this before, granted i haven't bought a car in about 8 years. My 2016 4runner has the little mayday button and gps aftermarket thing but you have to pay for the service, if you don't pay then my assumption is it's not transmitting anything. I know Tesla does OTA updates so they must be connected 24x7 but I haven't heard of that requirement for any other cars. Is it just an EV thing? I know there are still plenty of places in the US with absolutely no cell phone much less data service, i'm assuming these cars are drivable there with maybe a \"no connection\" indicator. I wonder if there's a way to disable the ability to get a reliable connection without actually removing power to a component. On the other hand, if you're driving a car with your phone in your pocket then it's a moot point. Your phone is the best citizen tracking device ever invented. edit: i want to be clear and I agree, having to have an online account to operate a car is _absolutely_ ridiculous! reply wakawaka28 9 hours agorootparentprevOf course not! The Chinese will surely connect their EVs and report everything back to China if they can. We're talking about a country with mandatory PC (and probably phone) spyware. reply J_Shelby_J 20 hours agorootparentprev#3 - Move somewhere you don't need a car. lol jk, Vancouver is too expensive, and there is no where else in NA where car ownership is optional for parents. reply vegetablepotpie 20 hours agorootparentprevAnd also that car ownership is de facto required to live as a productive citizen in most places in the US. reply Justsignedup 20 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is there are zero laws controling data collection.

However, apparently Honda US operates semi-independently vs Honda Japan/Global. (Highlighting this because I'm a huge Honda fan and didn't know of the US/Global separation till I read up. Please correct me if I said something inaccurate, I'm going off memory here.) reply croes 19 hours agorootparentprev>Volvo, which is owned by Geely, a Chinese company, did not respond to the request.

Their ownership of semi truck / marine engine / ... divisions is irrelevant. reply nimbius 20 hours agoparentprevspeaking as a diesel auto mechanic, these systems exist in the big 4 truck makers as well. The premise for them is useless. no one uses the SoS button, you have towing and repair service you pay for through your company or as part of your owner/operator insurance (probably similar for regular cars too.) everyone hits this button by mistake though, because its next to your sunglass holder and other buttons you actually use. ive pulled dozens of these things out for customers. For people looking to gut the spyware from their car, The \"phone box\" as professional drivers call it is separate from the rest of the vehicle and often located in or near the glovebox. it typically contains a riser board you can remove to disable the cellular communications for the vehicle. barring this, it has a SIM card you can physically remove as well. note that removing either will trigger a dashboard light. you can ignore it so long as you get regular maintenance, or occasionally pop the board back in to verify youre not throwing other codes for the engine/etc... edit: customer support scumbags for truck companies will often warn you this will \"disable\" your hands-free calling. it absolutely does not, as handsfree is a feature of the info-tainment and NOT the modem. reply bonton89 19 hours agorootparentDo they make any dummy boards that can stop the light? I've noticed my smart TV has a separate wifi module on a card that I've been meaning to yank. reply batch12 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat do these devices use for an antenna? Do they have their own or do they reuse the radio antenna? reply blackeyeblitzar 20 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that this triggers a light is infuriating. I assume disabling this also voids warranties? reply vegetablepotpie 19 hours agorootparentThe Magnuson Moss warranty act says that manufacturers have to prove that something you did damaged the vehicle to deny a warranty claim. A manufacturer merely observing that you modified the vehicle does not mean that the warranty was voided. Of course the manufacturer will claim this every time, even if it’s not consistent with the law. reply ultrarunner 18 hours agorootparentprevIn emissions control areas it possibly prevents the vehicle registration from being updated, depending on the light, the policy, and the interpretation by the guy working the booth that day reply czbond 20 hours agoparentprevI drive a Jeep. Jeep owners tend to skew libertarian & DIY. Owners have found you can bypass or cut power to the modules via fuse pulls. I bet you can do this on other makes. If anybody cares, I can post more. I have not done this myself. reply mdp2021 20 hours agorootparent> If anybody cares, I can post more Please do. Information circulated that attempting to disable modules (e.g. the e-call) resulted in the vehicle returning a \"cannot start\" or \"degraded mode\", \"core component missing\" (or similar). reply czbond 14 hours agorootparentJeep Wranglers & Gladiators are very similar. This thread has links from how to opt out, where Stellantis is selling data, to potential module pulls, and possibly faraday cloth attempts, attaching resistive dummy loads for antennas, pulling 4g modem.

Anyway, the head unit in my JK stopped turning off when I took the key out - so that was a fun battery-draining episode. I've been waiting for the weather to get nice to pull the head unit and put something else in there, so in the mean time I just pulled the fuse. Of course the head unit is responsible for publishing outside temperature to the CAN. I don't care that the dashboard says --F instead of a temperature now, but on a cold start, the ECU doesn't know if the oil pressure is high because of a fault of just because the oil is cold. So if I get on the throttle even a little before the engine is warm, I get a CEL now. The joys of Jeep ownership. reply SkyPuncher 7 hours agorootparentI’m extremely skeptical that the head unit pushes to the ECU. To me, it sounds like you might have a faulty coolant thermostat. This part physically expands as engine temperatures increase. It’s essentially an analogue part. reply czbond 14 hours agorootparentprevI think those electronics are in the head unit mainly to provide interior weather resistance - just a feature other car designers don't generally need to worry about. JK may have more CEL's than a CJ, but a lot more comfortable ;) but probably slower than the CJ reply spacemanspiff01 19 hours agorootparentprevWhy in the world does the head unit manage temp readings. Did they just wire the temp sensor all the way to the console? reply michaelrpeskin 16 hours agorootparentIt's the ambient temperature sensor, not the engine temperature sensor. My guess is that the head unit either contains the sensor or is responsible for broadcasting it. The head unit talks to the dashboard to redisplay nav instructions, I'm guessing it's also responsible for sending the temperature info to the dashboard. And since I pulled the fuse, all I get is --F, so the information isn't available on the CAN. Don't know why - I'm not an automotive engineer :) reply Infernal 19 hours agorootparentprevI also have not done this myself but I see lots of folks asking for more info.

The relevant module is the DCM, or Data Communication Module. It is physically located behind the infotainment system (what was once called the radio). There is a fuse that you can pull which will disable it (#9 I believe), but it will also disable the front speakers and microphone. This will break in-car navigation and Bluetooth phone calls. Alternatively, if you're willing to disassemble the dash, you can remove the DCM entirely and replace it with a dumb plug that just reconnects the front speakers and mic directly to the infotainment system. One more caveat - some cars are missing a 5V power supply for the microphone, which is otherwise generated by the DCM. The signal exists on the head unit but is missing a pin, probably to save the $0.001 that this pin costs in quantity. You need to either add this pin, acquire that 5V supply from elsewhere, or install a voltage regulator that steps the 12V IGN supply down to power the microphone. It seems that very slightly older Subarus have a problem with the 3G shutdown where the DCM goes into a braindead loop, trying to establish connectivity continuously and draining the battery. As a result, many shops are familiar with the procedure of finding and removing the DCM (to replace it with a newer one or reflash it, not sure which). Perhaps I'll see how much my local independent auto repair place would charge to remove it and replace it with the dummy plug.

Planes could arguably operate just as safely before those transponders -- they just couldn't be tracked publicly by anyone (or each other) in real time.

    "originBody": "Inside Precision Medicine Oncology mRNA Cancer Vaccine Reprograms Immune System to Tackle Glioblastoma mRNA Cancer Vaccine Reprograms Immune System to Tackle Glioblastoma May 1, 2024 Share Credit: peterschreiber.media / iStock / Getty Images Plus Researchers at the University of Florida report they have developed an mRNA cancer vaccine that quickly reprograms the immune system to attack glioblastoma in a first-ever human clinical trial of four adult patients. Their results published in Cell mirror those from preclinical mouse studies, and from a newly reported trial with the mRNA vaccine in 10 pet dogs that developed spontaneous brain tumors. The dogs’ owners had approved their animals’ treatment using the new vaccine as there were no other therapy options. The researchers say the aim is to progress the mRNA vaccine into an expanded Phase I clinical trial involving adult and pediatric brain cancer patients. The new strategy uses the patient’s own tumor cells to create a personalized vaccine, and also harnesses an engineered complex lipid particle (LP) delivery mechanism, generating multi-lamellar LP aggregates (LPA) that can simultaneously function as vaccines and as immunomodulating agents. “Instead of us injecting single particles, we’re injecting clusters of particles that are wrapping around each other like onions, like a bag full of onions,” said Elias Sayour, MD, PhD, a UF Health pediatric oncologist who pioneered the new vaccine. “And the reason we’ve done that in the context of cancer is these clusters alert the immune system in a much more profound way than single particles would.” Results from the canine trial showed how the vaccine reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment (TME) within days, allowing the activated immune system cells to fight the tumor. Among the most impressive findings from the reported study was how quickly the new vaccine, delivered intravenously, triggered a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor, said Sayour, who is principal investigator of the RNA Engineering Laboratory within UF’s Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy and a UF Health Cancer Center and McKnight Brain Institute investigator. “In less than 48 hours, we could see these tumors shifting from what we refer to as ‘cold’—immune cold, very few immune cells, very silenced immune response—to ‘hot,’ very active immune response. That was very surprising given how quick this happened, and what that told us is we were able to activate the early part of the immune system very rapidly against these cancers, and that’s critical to unlock the later effects of the immune response.” In their paper, the team stated, “In a first-in-human trial, RNA-LPAs elicited rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, and glioma-specific immune responses in glioblastoma patients … These data support RNA-LPAs as a new technology that simultaneously reprograms the TME while eliciting rapid and enduring cancer immunotherapy.” Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal type of brain tumor, with a median survival time of around 15 months. Current standard of care involves surgery, radiation, and some combination of chemotherapy. The new publication is the culmination of promising translational results over seven years of studies, starting in preclinical mouse models and then progressing to a study involving 10 pet dogs that had spontaneously developed terminal brain cancer and had no other treatment options. Dogs offer a naturally occurring model for malignant glioma because they are the only other species that develops spontaneous brain tumors with some frequency, said Sheila Carrera-Justiz, DVM, a veterinary neurologist at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine who is partnering with Sayour on the clinical trials. Gliomas in dogs are universally terminal, she noted. The canine study yielded promising results, the team reported. “In client-owned canines with terminal gliomas, RNA-LPAs improved survivorship and reprogrammed the TME, which became ‘hot’ within days of a single infusion.” After treating the pet dogs with personalized mRNA vaccines, Sayour’s team then advanced the research to a small FDA-approved clinical trial in four human patients with primary MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma. The study was designed to ensure safety and test feasibility before expanding to a larger trial. The vaccine was personalized to each patient, with the aim of maximizing immune system response. To generate each vaccine RNA was first extracted from each patient’s own surgically removed tumor, and then the messenger RNA was amplified and wrapped in the newly designed packaging of biocompatible lipid nanoparticles, to make tumor cells “look” like a dangerous virus when reinjected into the bloodstream and prompt an immune-system response. “In a first-in-human accelerated-dose titration [ADT] study (n = 3), we show that RNA-LPAs elicit rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, and expansion of T cell immunity in immunotherapy-refractory MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma patients,” the team stated. “In the first subject treated on the expanded Phase I trial, we observed significant immunologic response after the fourth vaccine, including tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, supporting the ability of RNA-LPAs to act as both the peripheral and intratumoral immunomodulators while simultaneously eliciting antigen-specific immunity against glioma-associated antigens.” Co-author Duane Mitchell, MD, PhD, director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the UF Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program, further stated, “The demonstration that making an mRNA cancer vaccine in this fashion generates similar and strong responses across mice, pet dogs that have developed cancer spontaneously, and human patients with brain cancer is a really important finding, because oftentimes we don’t know how well the preclinical studies in animals are going to translate into similar responses in patients. And while mRNA vaccines and therapeutics are certainly a hot topic since the COVID pandemic, this is a novel and unique way of delivering the mRNA to generate these really significant and rapid immune responses that we’re seeing across animals and humans.” The authors acknowledged that it is too early in the trial to assess the clinical effects of the vaccine, but the canine patients lived a median of 139 days, compared with a median survival of 30–60 days typical for dogs with the condition. The authors also noted that one limitation is continued uncertainty about how best to harness the immune system while minimizing the potential for adverse side effects. “Although innate and adaptive responses are critical for cancer immunotherapy, it is not clear how to time the administration of RNA-LPAs (neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment) and booster infusions (weekly, biweekly, monthly), or the associated frequency (number of total vaccines), all while reconciling these administrations with standard-of-care approaches including chemoradiation,” they added. With this knowledge, they suggested, it may be possible to develop mRNA backbone constructs that then balance innate and adaptive immunity to maximize the effects. But despite the noted limitations, the authors wrote, “The work herein reports a distinct approach to reprogram innate immunity while simultaneously polarizing adaptive immune responses. These data highlight the importance of innate immunity in overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, which is essential for the long-term success of adaptive immunotherapy in many immunologically ‘‘cold’’ tumors.” The results, they pointed out, “… show that RNA-LPAs rapidly reprogram the TME in less than 24 h, allowing simultaneously activated T cells to exert their effector functions. This approach overcomes the first step necessary for successful cancer immunotherapy, tumor immunosuppression and systemic tolerance, allowing effector cells to compete in a hostile immunoregulatory host system to engender rapid and long-lasting immunologic responses across murine, canine, and human cancer.” The next step will be an expanded Phase I clinical trial, including up to 24 adult and pediatric patients, to validate the initial findings. Once an optimal and safe dose is confirmed, an estimated 25 children would participate in Phase II, said Sayour, an associate professor in the Lillian S. Wells Department of Neurosurgery and the department of pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine, part of UF Health. For the new clinical trial, Sayour’s lab will partner with a multi-institution consortium, the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, to send the immunotherapy treatment to children’s hospitals across the country. They will do this by receiving an individual patient’s tumor, manufacturing the personalized vaccine at UF and sending it back to the patient’s medical team, said Sayour, co-leader of the Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program at the UF Health Cancer Center. The researchers are hopeful that this could be a new paradigm for how patients are treated and a new platform technology for how the immune system can be modulated. “I am hopeful for how this could now synergize with other immunotherapies and perhaps unlock those immunotherapies,”concluded Sayour. “We showed in this paper that you actually can have synergy with other types of immunotherapies, so maybe now we can have a combination approach of immunotherapy.” News & FeaturesCancer immunotherapyCancer vaccineGlioblastomaImmune systemMessenger RNAPediatric oncologyPhase I clinical trials (Clinical trial) Share Also of Interest News & FeaturesThe Human Immunome Project Plans to Unlock the Immune System’s Secrets News & FeaturesVitamin D May Improve Cancer Immunity by Altering the Gut Microbiome News & FeaturesDo COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Boost Mucosal Immunity?

The FDA should be stepping back from restricting the use of these on INFORMED patients who have limited other choices and mandating the long term study that we need for this class of treatments.

Consider that if 4 billion people get a vaccine with a 1/10,000 (0.01%) chance of causing myocarditis / blood clots / other side effects resulting in sudden death, that would still mean 400,000 dead, and those deaths aren't meaningless to the families they affect.

And as a consequence has problems dealing with heat. The protein transport mechanism by which immune surveillance is conducted is shared with cells surviving heat increases via ejection of heat shock proteins. I once tried to find if there were any studies about incidence of cancer plotted against incidence of high fever in the same individuals but wasn't able to find anything. It may also point to the incidence of cancer actually rising due to suppression of other diseases. This is plausible due the fact that diseases are a constant in nature and therefore evolution would take their presence as a given as much as the seasons or the sun. It would be very unfortunate if numerous anti-cancer adaptions simply haven't evolved because regular fevers took care of those cancer precursors. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The Brainfuck Dialect 7.1. The Dialect Dialect 8. Theoretical Musings 9. Conclusion 1. The problem Lisp programmers claim that their system of s-expression code in addition to its featureful macro system makes it a metaprogrammable and generalized system. This is of course true, but there's something very broken with lisp: metaprogramming and programming aren't the same thing, meaning there will always be rigid syntax within lisp (its parentheses or the fact that it needs to have characters that tell lisp to read ahead). The left parenthesis tells lisp that it needs to keep on reading until the right parenthesis in order to finish some process that allows it to stop and evaluate the whole expression. This makes the left and right parenthesis unchangable from within the language (not conceptually, but under some implementations it is not possible), and, more importantly, it makes the process of retroactively changing the sequence in which these tokens are delimited impossible, without a heavy amount of string processing. Other langauges have other ways in which they need to read ahead when they see a certain token in order to decide what to do. This process of having a program read ahead based on current input is called syntax. And as long as you read ahead, or assume a default way of reading ahead, you fall into the trap of having some form of syntax. Cognition is different in that it uses an antisyntax that is fully postfix. This has similarities with concatenative programming languages, but concatenative programming langauges also suffer from two main problems: first, the introduction of the left and right bracket character (which is in fact prefix notation, as it needs to read ahead of the input stream), and the quote character for strings. This is unsuitable for such a general language. You can even see the same problem in lisp's C syntax implementation: escape characters everywhere, awkward must-have spaces delimit the start and end of certain tokens (and if not, it requires post-processing). The racket programming language has its macro system, but it is not runtime dynamic. It still utilizes preprocessing. So, what's the percise solution to this connundrum? Well, it's beautiful; but it requires some cognition. 2. Introduction Cognition is an active research project that Matthew Hinton and I have been working on for the past couple of months. Although my commit history for this project has not been impressive, we came up with a lot of the theory together, working alongside each other in order to achieve one of the most generalized systems of syntax we know of. Let's take a look at the conceptual reason why cognition needs to exist, as well as some baremetal cognition code (you'll see what I mean by this later). There's a paper about this language available about the language in the repository, for those interested. Understanding cognition might require a lot of background in parsing, tokenization, and syntax, but I've done my best to write this in a very understandable way. The repository is available at https://github.com/metacrank/cognition, for your information. Figure 1: The Cognition programming language, logo designed by Matthew Hinton 3. Baremetal Cognition Baremetal cognition has a couple of perculiar attributes, and it is remarkably like the Brainfuck programming language. But unlike its look-alike, it has the ability to do some serious metaprogramming. Let's take a look at what the bootstrapping code for a very minimal syntax looks like: ldfgldftgldfdtgl df dfiff1 crank f And do note the whitespace (line 2 has a whitespace after df, line 3 has a whitespace, and the newlines matter). Erm, okay. What? So, our goal in this post is to get from a syntax that looks like that to a syntax that looks like Stem. But how on earth does this piece of code even work? Well, we have to introduce two new ideas: delimiters, and ignores. 3.1. Tokenization Delimiters allow the tokenizer to figure out when one token ends and another begins. The list of single character tokenizers is public, allowing that list to be modified and read from within cognition itself. Ignored characters are characters that are completely ignored by the tokenizer in the first stage of every read-eval-print loop; that is, at the start of collecting the token, it fist skips a set of ignored characters. By default, every single character is a delimiter, and no characters are ignored characters. The delimiter and ignored characters list allows you to toggle a flag to tell it to blacklist or whitelist the given characters, adding brevity (and practicality) to the language. Let's take the first line of code as an example: ldfgldftgldfdtgl because of the delimiter and ignored rules set by default, every single character is read as a token, and no character is skipped. We therefore read the first character, l. By default, Cognition works off a stack-based programming language design. If you're not familiar, see the Stem blogpost for more detail (in fact if you're not familiar this won't work as an explanation for you, so you should see it, or read up on the Forth programming language). Though, we call them containers, as they are more general than stacks. Additionally, in this default environment, no word is executed except for special faliases, as we will cover later. Therefore, the character l gets read in and is put on the stack. Then, the character d is read in and put on the stack. But f is different. In order to execute words in Cognition, we must take a look at the falias system. 3.2. Faliases Faliases are a list of words that get executed when they are put on the stack, or container as we will call it in the future. All of them in fact execute the equivalent of eval in stem but as soon as they are put on their container. Meaning, when f, the default falias, is run, it doesn't go on the container, but rather executes the top of the container which is d. d changes the delimiter list to the string value of a word, meaning that it changes the delimiters to blacklist only the character l as a delimiter. Everything else by default is a delimiter because everything by default is parsed into single character words. 3.3. Delimiter Caveats Delimiters have an interesting rule, and that is that the delimiter character is excluded from the tokenized word unless we have not ignored a character in the tokenization loop, in which case we collect the character as a part of the current token and keep going. This is in contrast to a third kind of tokenization category called the singlet, which includes itself into a token before skipping itself and ending the tokenization collection. In addition, remember what I said about the blacklist? Well, you can toggle between blacklisting and whitelisting your list of delimiters, singlets, and ignored characters. By default, there are no blacklisted delimiters, no whitelisted singlets, and no whitelisted ignored characters. We then also observe that all other characters will simply skip themselves while being collected as a part of the current token, without ending this loop, therefore collecting new characters until the loop halts via delimiter or singlet rules. 3.4. Continuing the Bootstrap Code So far, we looked at this part of the code: ldf which simply creates l as a non-delimiter. Now, for the rest of the code: gldftgldfdtgl df dfiff1 crank f gldf puts gl on the stack due to d being a delimiter, and f is called on it, meaning that now g and l are the only non-delimiters. Then, tgl gets put on the stack and they become non-delimiters with df. dtgl gets put on the stack, and the newline becomes the only non-delimiter with df (yes, the newline is actually a part of the code here, and spaces need to be as well in order for this to work). Then, the space character, due to how delimiter rules work (if you don't ignore, the first character is parsed normally even if it is a delimiter) and gets put on the stack. Then, another \\ word is tokenized (you might not see it, but there's another space on line 3). The current stack looks like this (bottom to top): 3. dtgl 2. [space char] 1. [space char] df sets the non-delimiters to \\ . if sets the ignores to \\ , which ignores these characters at the start of tokenization. f executes dtgl, which is a word that toggles the dflag, the flag that stores the whitelist/blacklist distinction for delimiters. Now, all non-delimiters are delimiters and all delimiters are non-delimiters. Finally, we're put in an environment where spaces and newlines are the delimiters for tokens, and they are ignored at the start of tokenizing a token. Next, 1 is tokenized and put on the stack, and then the crank word, which is then executed by f (the 1 token is treated as a number in this case, but everything textual in cognition is a word). We are done our bootstrapping sequence! Now, you might wonder what crank does. That we will explain in a later section. 4. Bootstrapping Takeaways From this, we see a couple principles: first, cognition is able to change how it tokenizes on the fly and it can do it programmatically, allowing you to program a program in cognition that would theoretically automate the process of changing these delimiters, singlets, and ignores. This is something impossible in other languages, being able to program your own tokenizer for some foreign language from within cognition, and have future code be tokenized exactly like how you want it to be. This is solely possible because the language is postfix and doesn't read ahead, so it doesn't require more than one token to be parsed before an expression is evaluated. Second, faliases allow us to execute words without having to have prefix words or any default execution of words. 5. Crank The metacrank system allows us to set a default way in which tokens are executed on the stack. The crank word takes a number as its argument and by effect executes the top of the stack for every n words you put on the stack. To make this concept concrete, let's look at some code (running from what we call crank 1 as we set our environment to crank one at the end of the bootstrapping sequence): 5 crank 2crank 2 crank 1 crank unglue swap quote prepose def the crank 1 environment allows us to stop using f in order to evaluate tokens. Instead, every 1 token that is tokenized is evaluated. Since we programmed in a newline and space-delimited syntax, we can safely interpret this code intuitively. The code begins by trying to evaluate 5, which evaluates to itself as it is not a builtin. crank evaluates and puts us in 5 crank, meaning every 5th token evaluates from here on. 2crank, 2, crank, 1 are all put on the stack, leaving us with a stack that looks like so (notice that crank doesn't get executed even though it is a bulitin because we set ourselves to using crank 5): 4. 2crank 3. 2 2. crank 1. 1 crank is the 5th word, so it executes. Note that this puts us back in crank 1, meaning every word is evaluated. unglue is a builtin that gets the value of the word at the top of the stack (as 1 is used up by the crank we evaluated), and so it gets the value of crank, which is a builtin. What that in effect does is it gets the function pointer associated with the crank builtin. Our new stack looks like this: 3. 2crank 2. 2 1. [CLIB] Where CLIB is our function pointer that points to the crank builtin. We then swap: 3. 2crank 2. [CLIB] 1. 2 then quote, a builtin that quotes the top thing on the stack: 3. 2crank 2. [CLIB] 1. [2] then prepose, a builtin like compose in stem, except that it preposes and that it puts things in what we call a VMACRO: 2. 2crank 1. ( [2] [CLIB] ) then we call def. This defines a word 2crank that puts 2 on the stack and then calls a function pointer pointing us to the crank builtin. Now, we still have to define what VMACROs are, and in order to do that we might have to explain some differences between the cognition stack and the stem stack. 5.1. Differeneces In the stem stack, putting words on the stack directly is allowed. In cognition, words are put in containers when they are put on the stack and not evaluated. This means words like compose in stem work on words (or more accurately containers with a single word in them) as well as other containers, making the API for this language more consistent. Additionally, words like cd as we will make use of this concept. 5.1.1. Macros Macros are another difference between stem quotes and cognition containers. When macros are evaluated, everything in the macro is evaluated, ignoring the crank. If bound to a word, evaluating that word evaluates the macro which will ignore the crank completely and will only increment the cranker by one, while evaluating each statement in the macro. They are useful for making crank-agnostic code, and expanding macros is very useful for the purpose of optimization, although we will actually have to write the word expand from more primitive words later on (hint: it uses recursive unglue). 5.2. More Code Here is te rest of the code in bootstrap.cog in coglib/: getd dup _ concat _ swap d i _quote_swap_quote_compose_swap_dup_d_i eval 2crank ing 0 crank spc 2crank ing 1 crank swap quote def 2crank ing 0 crank endl 2crank ing 1 crank swap quote def 2crank ing 1 crank 2crank ing 3 crank load ../coglib/ quote 2crank ing 2 crank swap unglue concat unglue fread unglue evalstr unglue 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast def 2crank ing 1 crank 2crank ing 1 crank getargs 1 split swap drop 1 split drop 2crank ing 1 crank 2crank ing 1 crank epop drop 2crank ing 1 crank INDEX spc OUT spc OF spc RANGE 2crank ing 1 crank concat concat concat concat concat concat = 2crank ing 1 crank 2crank ing 1 crank missing spc filename concat concat dup endl concat 2crank ing 1 crank swap quote swap quote compose 2crank ing 2 crank print compose exit compose 2crank ing 1 crank 2crank ing 0 crank fread evalstr 2crank ing 1 crank compose 2crank ing 1 crank 2crank ing 1 crank if Okay, well, the syntax still doesn't look so good, and it's still pretty hard to get what this is doing. But the basic idea is that 2crank is a macro and is therefore crank agnostic, and we guarantee its execution with ing, another falias (because it's funny). Then, we execute an n crank, which standardizes what crank each line is in (you might wonder what ing and f's interaction is with the cranker. It actually just guarantees the evaluation of the previous thing, so if the previous thing already evaluated f and ing both do nothing). In any case, this defines words that are useful, such as load, which loads something from the coglib. It does this by compose-ing things into quotes and then def-ing those quotes. The crank, and by extension, the metacrank system is needed in order to discriminate between evaluating some tokens and storing others for metaprogramming without having to use f, while also keeping the system postfix. Crank is just one word that allows for this type of behavior; the more general word, metacrank, allows for much more interesting kinds of syntax manipulation. We have examples of metacrank down the line, but for now I should explain the metacrank word. 5.3. Metacrank n m metacrank sets a periodic evaluation m for an element n items down the stack. The crank word is therefore equivalent to 0 m metacrank. Only one token can be evaluated per tokenized token, although every metacrank is incremented per token, where lower metacranks get priority. This means that if you set two different metacranks, only one of them can execute per token tokenized, and the lower metacrank gets priority. Note that metacrank and, by extension, crank, don't just depend on tokenized words; they also work while evaluating word definitions recursively, meaning if a word is evaluated in 2 crank, one out of two words will execute in each level of the evaluation tree. You can play around with this in the repl to get a sense of how it works: run ../crank bootstrap.cog repl.cog devel.cog load in the coglib folder, and use stem like syntax in order to define a function. Then, run that function in 2 crank. You will see how the evaluation tree respects cranking in the same way that the program file itself does. Metacrank allows for not only metaprogramming in the form of code building, but also direct syntax manipulation (i.e. I want to execute this token once I have read n other token(s)). The advantages to this system compared to other programming languages' systems are clear: you can program a prefix word and undef it when you want to rip out that part of syntax. You can write a prefix character that doesn't stop at an ending character but always stops when you read a certain number of tokens. You can feed user input into a math program and feed the output into a syntax system like metacrank. The possibilities are endless! And with that, we will slowly build up the stem programming language, v2, now with macros and from within our own cognition. 6. The Stem Dialect, Improved In this piece of code, we define the comment: 2crank ing 0 crank ff 1 2crank ing 1 crank cut unaliasf 2crank ing 0 crank 0 2crank ing 1 crank cut swap quote def 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 0 crank # 2crank ing 0 crank geti getd gets crankbase f d f i endl s 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose 2crank ing 0 crank drop halt crank s d i 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast quote compose 2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing 1 quote ing metacrank 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast 2crank ing 1 crank def 2crank ing 2 crank # singlet # delim 2crank ing 1 crank #comment: geti getd gets crankbase '' d '' i '' s ( drop halt crank s d i ) halt 1 1 metacrank and it is our first piece of code that builds something truly prefix. The comment character is a prefix that drops all the text before the newline character, which is a type of word that tells the parser to read ahead. This is our first indication that everything that we thought was possible within cognition truly is. But before that, we can look at the first couple of lines: 2crank ing 0 crank ff 1 2crank ing 1 crank cut unaliasf 2crank ing 0 crank 0 2crank ing 1 crank cut swap quote def 2crank ing 0 crank which simply unaliases f from the falias list, with ing being the only remaining falias. In cognition, even these faliases are changeable. Since we can't put f directly on the stack (if we try by just using f, it would execute), we instead utilize some very minimal string processing to do it, putting ff on the stack and then cutting the string in half to get two copies of f. We then want f to mean false, which in cognition is just an empty word. Therefore, we make an empty word by calling 0 cut on this string, and then def-ing f to the empty string. The following code is where the comment is defined: 2crank ing 0 crank # 2crank ing 0 crank geti getd gets crankbase f d f i endl s 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose 2crank ing 0 crank drop halt crank s d i 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast quote compose 2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing 1 quote ing metacrank 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast 2crank ing 1 crank def 2crank ing 2 crank # singlet # delim 2crank ing 1 crank #comment: geti getd gets crankbase '' d '' i '' s ( drop halt crank s d i ) halt 1 1 metacrank Relevant: halt just puts you in 0 for all metacranks, and VMACRO cast just turns the top thing on the stack from a container to a macro. geti, getd, gets gets the ignores, delims, and singlets respectively as a string; drop is dsc in stem. singlet and delim sets the singlets and delimiters. endl is defined withint bootstrap.cog and just puts the newline character as a word on the stack. crankbase gets the current crank. we call a lot of compose words in order to build this definition, and we make the # character a singlet delimiter in order to allow for spaces after the comment. We put ourselves in 1 1 metacrank in the # definition while altering the tokenization rules beforehand in order to tokenize everything until a newline as a token while calling # on said word in order to effectively drop that comment and get ourselves back in the original crank and metacrank. Thus, the brilliant # character is written, operating on a token that is tokenized in the future, with complete default postfix syntax. With the information above, one can work out the specifics of how it works; the point is that it does, and one can test that it does by going into the coglib folder and running ../crank bootstrap.cog repl.cog devel.cog load, which will load the REPL and load devel.cog, which will in turn load comment.cog. 6.1. The Great Escape Here, we accelerate our way out of this primitive syntax, and it all starts with the great escape character. We make many great leaps in this section that aren't entirely explained for the sake of brevity, but you are free to play around with all of these things by using the repl. In any case, I hope you will enjoy this great leap in syntax technology; by the end, we will have reached something with real structure. Here we define a preliminary prefix escape character. Also you will notice that 2crank ing 0 crank is used as padding between lines: 2crank ing 2 crank comment.cog load 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 1 crank # preliminary escape character \\ 2crank ing 1 crank \\ 2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing crank 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose 2crank ing 2 crank VMACRO cast quote eval 2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing dup ing metacrank 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose 2crank ing 2 crank VMACRO cast 2crank ing 1 crank def 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 0 crank This allows for escaping so that we can put something on the stack even if it is to be evaluated, but we want to redefine this character eventually to be compatible with stem-like quotes. We're even using our comment character in order to annotate this code by now! Here is the full quote definition (once we have this definition, we can use it to improve itself): 2crank ing 0 crank [ 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 1 crank # init 2crank ing 0 crank crankbase 1 quote ing metacrankbase dup 1 quote ing = 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 1 crank # meta-crank-stuff0 2crank ing 3 crank dup ] quote = 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose 2crank ing 16 crank drop swap drop swap 1 quote swap metacrank swap crank quote 2crank ing 3 crank compose dup quote dip swap 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose 2crank ing 3 crank compose dup quote dip swap 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose \\ if compose 2crank ing 1 crank \\ VMACRO cast quote quote compose 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 1 crank # meta-crank-stuff1 2crank ing 3 crank dup ] quote = 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose 2crank ing 16 crank drop swap drop swap 1 quote swap metacrank swap crank 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose 2crank ing 3 crank compose dup quote dip swap 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose \\ if compose 2crank ing 1 crank \\ VMACRO cast quote quote compose 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 1 crank # rest of the definition 2crank ing 16 crank if dup stack swap 0 quote crank 2crank ing 2 crank 1 quote 1 quote metacrank 2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose 2crank ing 1 crank compose \\ VMACRO cast 2crank ing 0 crank 2crank ing 1 crank def Um, it's quite the spectacle how Matthew Hinton ever came up with this thing, but alas, it exists. Then, we use it in order to redefine itself, but better as the old quote definition can't do recursive quotes (we can do this because the definition is used before you redefine the word due to postfix def, a development pattern seen often in low level cognition): \\ [ [ crankbase ] [ 1 ] quote compose [ metacrankbase dup ] compose [ 1 ] quote compose [ = ] compose [ dup ] \\ ] quote compose [ = ] compose [ drop swap drop swap ] [ 1 ] quote compose [ swap metacrank swap crank quote compose ] compose [ dup ] quote compose [ dip swap ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose [ dup dup dup ] \\ [ quote compose [ = swap ] compose \\ ( quote compose [ = or swap ] compose \\ \\ quote compose [ = or ] compose [ eval ] quote compose [ compose ] [ dup ] quote compose [ dip swap ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose [ if ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose [ if ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote quote [ dup ] \\ ] quote compose [ = ] compose [ drop swap drop swap ] [ 1 ] quote compose [ swap metacrank swap crank ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose [ dup dup dup ] \\ [ quote compose [ = swap ] compose \\ ( quote compose [ = or swap ] compose \\ \\ quote compose [ = or ] compose [ eval ] quote compose [ compose ] [ dup ] quote compose [ dip swap ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose [ if ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote compose [ if ] compose \\ VMACRO cast quote quote compose compose [ if dup stack swap ] compose [ 0 ] quote compose [ crank ] compose [ 1 ] quote dup compose compose [ metacrank ] compose \\ VMACRO cast def Okay, so now we can use recursive quoting, just like in stem. But there are still a couple things missing that we probably want: a good string quote implementation, and probably escape characters that work in the brackets. Also, since Cognition utilizes macros, we probably want a way to notate those as well, and we probably want a way to expand macros. We can do all of that! First, we will have to redefine \\ once more: \\ \\ [ [ 1 ] metacrankbase [ 1 ] = ] [ halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank quote compose [ dup ] dip swap ] \\ VMACRO cast quote quote compose [ halt [ 1 ] crank ] VMACRO cast quote quote compose [ if halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank ] compose \\ VMACRO cast def This piece of code defines the bracket but for macros (split just splits a list into two): \\ ( \\ [ unglue [ 11 ] split swap [ 10 ] split drop [ macro ] compose [ 18 ] split quote [ prepose ] compose dip [ 17 ] split eval eval [ 1 ] del [ \\ ) ] [ 1 ] put quote quote quote [ prepose ] compose dip [ 16 ] split eval eval [ 1 ] del [ \\ ) ] [ 1 ] put quote quote quote [ prepose ] compose dip prepose def We want these macros to automatically expand because it's more efficient to bind already expanded macros to words, and they functionally evaluate identically (isdef just returns a boolean where true is a non-empty string, false is an empty string, if a word is defined): \\ ( ( crankbase [ 1 ] metacrankbase dup [ 1 ] = [ ( dup \\ ) = ( drop swap drop swap [ 1 ] swap metacrank swap crank quote compose ( dup ) dip swap ) ( dup dup dup \\ [ = swap \\ ( = or swap \\ \\ = or ( eval ) ( dup isdef ( unglue ) [ ] if compose ( dup ) dip swap ) if ) if ) ] [ ( dup \\ ) = ( drop swap drop swap [ 1 ] swap metacrank swap crank ) ( dup dup dup \\ [ = swap \\ ( = or swap \\ \\ = or ( eval ) ( dup isdef ( unglue ) [ ] if compose ( dup ) dip swap ) if ) if ) ] if dup macro swap [ 0 ] crank [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank ) def and you can see that as we define more things, our language is beginning to look more or less like it has syntax! In this quote.cog file which we have been looking at, there are more things, but the bulk of it is pretty much done. From here on, I will just explain the syntax programmed by quote.cog instead of showing the specific code. As an example, here is expand: # define basic expand (works on nonempty macros only) [ expand ] ( macro swap ( [ 1 ] split ( isword ( dup isdef ( unglue ) ( ) if ) ( ) if compose ) dip size [ 0 ] > ( ( ( dup ) dip swap ) dip swap eval ) ( ) if ) dup ( swap ( swap ) dip ) dip eval drop swap drop ) def # complete expand (checks for definitions within child first without copying hashtables) [ expand ] ( size [ 0 ] > ( type [ VSTACK ] = ) ( return ) if ? ( macro swap macro ( ( ( size dup [ 0 ] > ) dip swap ) dip swap ( ( ( 1 - dup ( vat ) dip swap ( del ) dip ) dip compose ) dip dup eval ) ( drop swap drop ) if ) dup eval ( ( [ 1 ] split ( isword ( compose cd dup isdef ( unglue pop ) ( pop dup isdef ( unglue ) ( ) if ) if ) ( ) if ( swap ) dip compose swap ) dip size [ 0 ] > ) dip swap ( dup eval ) ( drop drop swap compose ) if ) dup eval ) ( expand ) if ) def Which recursively expands word definitions inside a quote or macro, using the word unglue. We've used the expand word in order to redefine itself in a more general case. 7. The Brainfuck Dialect And returning to whence we came, we define the Brainfuck dialect with our current advanced stem dialect: comment.cog load quote.cog load [ ] [ ] [ 0 ] [ > ] [[ swap [[ compose ]] dip size [ 0 ] = [ [ 0 ] ] [[ [ 1 ] split swap ]] if ]] def [ <+-,.[] dup ( i s itgl f d ) eval test with ../crank -s 2 bootstrap.cog helloworld.bf brainfuck.cog. You may of course load your favorite brainfuck file with this method. Note that brainfuck.cog isn't a brainfuck parser in the ordinary sense; it actually defines brainfuck words and tokenizes brainfuck, running it in the native cognition environment. It's very profound, as well, how our current syntax allows us to define an alternate syntax with great ease. It might make you wonder if it's possible to specifically craft a syntax whose job is to write other syntaxes. Another interesting observation you might have is that Cognition defines syntax by defining a prefix character as a word that uses metacrank, rather than reading symbols and deciding what to do based on symbols. It's almost as if the syntax becomes inherent to the word that's being defined. These two ideas synthesize to create something truly exciting, but that hasn't yet been implemented in the standard library (though we very much know that it is possible). Introducing: the dialect dialect of Cognition… 7.1. The Dialect Dialect Imagine a word mkprefix, that takes two input words (say for example [ and ]), and an operation, and automatically defines [ to apply said operation until it hits a ] character. This is possible because constructs like metacrank and def are all just regular words, so it's possible to use them as words to metaprogram with. In fact, everything is just a word (even d, i, and s), so you can imagine a hyperabstract dialect that includes words like mkprefix, using syntax to automate the process of implementing more syntax. Such a construct I have not encountered in any other programming language. Yet, in your own Cognition, you can make nearly anything a reality. Such creative things Matthew Hinton and I have discussed as possibilities regarding the standard library. Right now, the standard library has metawords that generate abstract words automatically and call them. This is possible through string concatenation and using def in the definition of another word also (this is also possible in my prior programming language Stem). We have discussed the possibility of a word that searches for word-generators to abstract its current wordlist automatically, and we have talked about the possibility of directing this abstraction framework for the purpose of solving a problem. These are conceptually possible words to write within cognition, and this might give you an idea of how powerful this idea is. 8. Theoretical Musings There are a couple of things about Cognition that make it interesting beyond its quirks. For instance, string processing in this language is equivalent to tokenizer postprocessing, which makes string operations inherently extremely powerful in this language. It also has potential applications in Symbolic AI and in syntax and grammar research, where prototypes of languages and metalanguages can be tested with ease. I'd imagine that anyone configuring a program that reads a configuration file would really want their configuration language to be something like this, where they can have full freedom over the syntax (and metasyntax) in which they program in (think about a Cognition based shell, or a Cognition based operating system!). Though, the point of working on this language was never its applications; its intrinsic beauty is its own philosophical statement. 9. Conclusion You can imagine cognition can program basically any syntax you would want, and in this article, we demonstrate the power of the already existing code that makes cognition work. In short, the system allows for true syntax as code, as my friend Andrei put it; one can dynamically program and even automate the production of syntax. In this article, we didn't have the space to cover other important Cognition concepts like the Metastack and words like cd, but this can be done in a part 2 of this blog post. For now, let's leave off here, and we can meet here once more for a part two. Copyright © 2024 Preston Pan",

Take the introduction (which is, bizarrely, not the Introduction that comes three paragraphs later.) There are over 300 words before the actual project, Cognition, is mentioned (second sentence of second paragraph). All this stuff about Lisp is great, but is that the most important part of the project? Should it not be something about the project itself? When I'm reading something informational (rather than recreational) I'm always asking myself \"is this worth my time?\" You should address this as soon as possible, by telling the reader what the document is about right at the start. \"Cognition is a new language exploring user modifiable syntax\" or something similar. I didn't get past the first four paragraphs because I couldn't determine it was worth continuing. reply ordu 41 minutes agoparent> When I'm reading something informational (rather than recreational) I'm always asking myself \"is this worth my time?\" It doesn't.

Really why some people believe that all the content of Internet must be attuned to their personal quirks? Why they believe that it is better to change internet, than to adapt to what is already here? It is a text, not video or something sequential. You could scan it diagonally looking for something that is interesting for you. You could reject it if nothing was found. Or you could return to the beginning and read sequentially from there. And these features are available for a text structured in any way. I highly recommend to learn the technique, it could deal with whole books, by selecting useful pages to read and rejecting most of other pages, which tell you nothing new. I'd argue that diverse article styles are much better, because they force you to consciously and actively sort through information you are consuming. You shouldn't do it passively, becouse your mind becomes lazy and stop thinking while consuming. OTOH I would agree with you if it was not a text but a video.

This lets you create, for example, an embedded Datalog implementation [2] that uses Datalog syntax but interops with other Racket modules. (The underlying data model doesn't change.) This gives you the ability to metaprogram without being confined to S-expressions, but it does so in a high-level way. It is very neat to see this kind of syntax bootstrapping. I think there's some value (in a researchy-sense) to being able to do that. But I'm not sure if there's something fundamentally \"better\" about this approach over Racket's approach. Postscript: Lisp (and Scheme and Racket) macros typically operate on AST (typically because Lisp has reader macros and Racket has a full-bodied reader extension) but Rhombus [3] operates on a \"shrubbery\", which is like an AST but it defers some parsing decisions until later. This gives macros a little flexibility in extending the syntax of the language. Another interesting point in the design space!

See Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, ISLISP. A Lisp macro gets only passed some data and returns some data. There is nothing like an AST.

The &rest list of ITEMS gets reversed. ITEMS is the list of source arguments in the macro call. We can then write: (rev 1 2 3 4 +) (rev (rev 10 n -) (+ a 20 b) (rev 30 a *) list) Example: CL-USER 7 > (let ((n 4) (a 3) (b 2)) (rev (rev 10 n -) (+ a 20 b) (rev 30 a *) list)) (90 25 -6) There is no syntax tree. All the macro does, is to reverse the list of its source arguments. If I let the macro describe the thing it gets passed, then we get this: CL-USER 8 > (defmacro rev (&rest items) (DESCRIBE items) (reverse items)) REV CL-USER 9 > (rev 1 2 3 4 +) (1 2 3 4 +) is a LIST 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 + 10 As a side effect, we can see that the macro gets a simple list passed. A list of numbers and a symbol (\"symbol\" is also a data type). Not text. Not an AST. Also data which is possibly not read, but computed by other code. We can compute the arguments of the macro REV and pass the thing to EVAL. Works the same as above. CL-USER 10 > (eval (append '(rev) (loop for i from 1 to 4 collect i) '(+))) (1 2 3 4 +) is a LIST 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 + 10 The macro only gets that data and can do anything with it. There is no idea of Abstract Syntax Tree: it does not need to be a tree, it does not need to be valid Lisp code and it carries no syntactical information. Generally, it also does not need to return valid Lisp code. To be computed all we need is that the evaluator eventually sees valid Lisp code, not the individual macro. In Lisp the \"reader\" by default only parses a data layer: symbolic expressions. EVAL, macros and other Lisp functionality gets mostly data passed. EVAL has to figure out, what (a b c) actually is as a program. It can traverse it in an interpreter or compile it. A compiler may internally create AST representations -> but that free to the implementation. The Lisp language then typically is not defined over text syntax, but data syntax. A Lisp interpreter processes during execution not text, but s-expressions. It's a \"List Processor\", not a Text Processor. Lisp not Texp. ;-) The function COMPILE gets an s-expression passed, not text. Racket and Scheme have other macro systems. reply ndr 2 hours agorootparentHow is a list (of nested lists) not a tree? reply lispm 1 hour agorootparentIt could theoretically be a graph. For example I can make a circular list being a part of the source and the macro may process it. Get the first two items from a list and add them: CL-USER 21 > (defmacro add-2 (a) (list '+ (first a) (second a))) ADD-2 Now we construct a circular list and use the macro: CL-USER 22 > (add-2 #1=(1 2 3 . #1#)) 3 The circular list is really a part of the source code: CL-USER 23 > '(add-2 #1=(1 2 3 . #1#)) (ADD-2 #1=(1 2 3 . #1#)) Another example: One could pass in a string and have the macro parse the string... reply agumonkey 1 hour agorootparentprevFrom my limited understanding, it seems like lispers means AST in an ad-hoc way. There's no statically predefined solid structure describing what an if-node or a lambda-node is. We all agree to squint and look at ( ) as an ast in spirit. Scheme did implement actual syntax objects and other lisps may have a concrete ast (pun slightly intended) layer but it's not required to enjoy the benefits of sexp as code and data. my two cents reply lispm 1 hour agorootparentAn \"AST in spirit\" is in our mind, but not the machine. (let ((s (s s))) (flet ((s (s) (declare (type s s)) s)) (tagbody (s) s (go s)))) The function READ has no idea what S is: variable, operator name, data symbol, type, go tag, function name, macro name, ...? For each above we don't know what s is. We would need to parse it according to some syntax (and possibly know the current state of the runtime. An AST would be the product of a parser and the parse would parse the code above according to some provided syntax. The AST then would encode a tree built from some syntax, where the nodes would be classified. In Lisp symbols and lists have multiple uses and the s-expression does not encode which uses it is: is it data, is it some kind of syntactical element. There is also no defined parser and no syntax it encodes on that level. READ is at best an s-expression reader, where it has zero knowledge what the lists and symbols supposed to mean in Lisp. For the reader (+ a b), (a + b), (a b +) are just s-expressions, not Lisp code. reply nabla9 1 hour agoprevHis premise is not true. Common Lisp has reader macros. You can change the syntax to anything you like. There is even Fortran compiler written using reader macros to lead Fortran syntax. Common lisp has 1. reader macros for read time, 2. macros 3. compiler macros for compile time Macro language for all these is Common Lisp. Metaprogramming has little to do with macros or syntax. Term refers to ability to manipulate semantics and meaning of of types, interfaces, classes, methods, etc. CLOS (Common Lisp Metaobject Protocol) for that if CL itself is not strong enough. reply gabesullice 1 hour agoprevI think cognition programs' ability to define and redefine and even step into and out of syntax structures at runtime is really beautiful. Particularly because the machinery is so minimal. I'm not a language expert so I don't know if that's novel or not. Reading the article was really enjoyable. As a reader, I could feel the authors' excitement and recognize the joy they've felt as they've climbed over hilltops only to realize a new range of possibilities. If I understand it correctly, what's really being said here is that, with Cognition, you can build truly \"thinking\" machines. Programs can write and execute their own novel subroutines, based on new input and without ever being halted and restarted with new instructions. And that means the program can learn and adapt by building new abstractions and possibly connect itself to new APIs. To me, that's more exciting than a bigger neural network or a new training technique. reply kibwen 6 hours agoprevThis is an interesting article, and I hope the authors ignore the snarky comments here and aren't discouraged from pursuing their dark magic rituals.

That all its syntax is always represented as a tree makes it very easy to edit and manipulate in an editor which supports operations on that tree. What's more, you could add routines in your editor to display the code in any format you like and translate back to the lisp format when writing to the disk. This is much more difficult in most other programming languages. reply trwm 6 hours agoprev>This is of course true, but there's something very broken with lisp: metaprogramming and programming aren't the same thing, Metaprogramming and programming are the same thing. It's just that no language, including all lisp, (but hilariously not m4) get quotation wrong. Lisp gets around this with macros which let you ignore quotation and deal with meta language statements expressed as object language statements when they clearly should not be. This issue stems from the fact space in the object and meta language is treated as the termination of an atom without distinction between the two. >Cognition is different in that it uses an antisyntax that is fully postfix. This has similarities with concatenative programming languages Postfix languages are a dual of prefix languages and suffer from the same issue.

As I remember it being taught to me the importance of being able to do this — with a Turing machine, lambda calculus, etc. — is to show that the high level language is equivalent to the fundamental language and therefore whatever can be reasoned about the former can be applied to the latter. The first and only example I can think of is the halting problem. On a practical scale one might prove that the base language doesn’t have memory leaks, so neither can the derived language?

I suspect the reception of it being suspected to be a joke, is the mention of lisp and brainfuck priming them for a joke, combined with examples and concepts that seem to require a much stronger than normal technical background. So for the average Joe it ends up in the “turbo encabulator” zone where it’s not quite clear if what’s going on is real or in jest. The prerequisites for understanding just aren’t there.

I think the bootstrapping code might've bitten us. Of course there's no practical reason why we _needed_ to not have the delim flag flipped and a couple of delimiters defined, but there's a conceptual symmetry in it being the way it is. Still, I agree in large part with your point. It seems as though you've read the entire article and understood a decent portion of it. I'm impressed because I think I explained this suboptimally. reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparentI think it's fine to show that you can do it, I think the main thing is to flip the order a bit. E.g. \"here's a cool thing thing we can do \" to hook people, \"here's how \", \"and if you really want to know how to bootstrap this from basics \". Maybe compare how e.g. Forth is often introduced, with how people describe bootstrapping of a simplistic Forth like Jonesforth or Sectorforth [2]. Showing people how they can define their own words and it fundamentally changes how they work with the language afterwards is cool to a lot of people who have no interest in details like how you an implement even numbers with a minimal set of primitives (e.g. Sectorforth relies on that - it doesn't have builtin numbers[3]). Both are interesting to me, but I'm weird, and I think for most people it'd be easier to maintain their interest if those two aspects are either separate articles or at least if the bootstrapping is relegated to a standalone section they're clearly told they can skip. [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31368212 [2] https://github.com/cesarblum/sectorforth [3] The Sectorforth Hello world defines every numeric constant it needs like this: : -1 ( x -- x -1 ) dup dup nand dup dup nand and ; : 0 -1 dup and ; : 1 -1 dup + dup and ; : 2 1 1 + ; : 4 2 2 + ; : 6 2 4 + ; Which is fun if you're a language geek.

Your post sounds like an interesting research project, but the examples given in the blog post seem somewhat discouraging to me. When I gaze at one of your examples, they seem obtuse and while I am sure I could understand the examples by not just skimming the article, this does tell me that the grammars you used are not very self-explanatory: Your syntax expresses meaning relative to the specific grammar as opposed to expressing meaning relative to the English language or pre-existing, well-established programming languages. Is there some example of self-explanatory grammars and self-explanatory bootstrapping code in your language? reply ret2pop 3 hours agoparentSelf explanatory grammars: there's the stem-like syntax that I showcase and you could write a lisp like syntax in it pretty easily. I'd imagine you don't want to use this in production yet. As for self explanatory bootstrap code: the bootstrap code is the way it is because cognition doesn't want to assume some complex syntax from the start. reply bradley13 3 hours agoprev\"the trap of having some form of syntax\" Syntax provides structure.

That just gives you arbitrary input. You can write your own interpreter for a language and do the input in that language, but that’s not “arbitrary metaprogramming” in the host language, at least as most people understand it. Or you can leverage whatever metaprogramming facilities are offered by the host via an external DSL you implement, which may be a more ergonomic way of metaprogramming the host language, but still is limited to the metaprogramming facilities exposed by the host language, so it’s only “arbitrary metaprogramming” to the extent that the host language already exposes arbitrary metaprogramming. reply dmead 4 hours agoprevIs this a joke? reply bschmidt1 6 hours agoprev [–] The first words of the article Lisp programmers claim that You already know you're in for a fun ride lol reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

It's really encouraging to see people, especially in your generation, thinking seriously about the problem of misinformation. There are fundamental challenges you all will face in this idea: - most current LLMs are trained on large amounts of web data that itself contains facts, opinions, and misinformation. These things are treated equally, so I would expect the LLM to get common facts right, but also to represent opinions or misinformation as facts when they are pervasive. - LLMs \"hallucinate\" and tend not to know when to say \"I don't know\" or to not try to fact-check something that is not factual in nature. ...in short, I would expect LLMs to be an unreliable fact checker, which has the potential to do as much harm as good. reply helloduck1234 16 hours agoparentYea, thank you for your feedback! reply reaperman 13 hours agorootparent> “…which has the potential to do as much harm as good.” I find this is one of the more difficult things for people to learn to fully integrate into their psyche.

Nobody cares about you so don’t think others are doing anything but prioritizing themselves. I mean look at the world. Essentially everybody puts themselves first and it’s clear as day. Don’t trick yourself into being the sap doing things for the greater good. And who cares if there’s equal potential for harm and good? The harm might be less than we imagine and the good might be better than we think it could be. “This might be bad” is a terrible reason to not do something. Nearly everything might be bad!

Don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm or nothing, but in my experience most people are hoping to make the world better where they can. This sort of hustle culture belief is definitely present in the world, especially among finance and us techie types, but there's tons of examples of people Not acting like this. Teachers don't do it for the pay, etc. There's a reason meaningful jobs tend to pay less, and its because so many people want to do useful helpful things that badly.

Yeah don't let fear of doing the wrong thing paralyze you but also think through the consequences reply paulcole 7 hours agorootparent> most people are hoping to make the world better where they can. Are they actually making the world better or just hoping they can? Everybody in the developed world, if they wanted to make the world better, would live drastically differently because of their impact on the environment/climate change. But it’s more fun to just say that we’re hoping to make the world better so we don’t have to acknowledge how selfish we actually are. I’m not talking about hustle culture here. I’m talking about the selfishness we all partake in and do our best to ignore. reply bruce511 7 hours agorootparentI agree that most (privileged) people behave selfishly. You don't have to look far to see that. That doesn't make it good. Which is why advice to be explicitly selfish is jarring. We don't need advice yo do that, we excel at it naturally. There are however great rewards to be had from being unselfish. We can see that around us too. Being at least aware of our proclivities is the first step in discovering the benefits of countering them. reply paulcole 7 hours agorootparentIf people are naturally selfish and they’re giving you advice to not be selfish, why aren’t they taking their own advice?

Selfishness is not a binary characteristic. There are degrees of selfishness - and spheres of selfishness. Just because something is in our nature, it does not mean we have to behave that way all the time. Most people are neither purely selfish, nor purely unselfish. To answer your question though, since selfishness exists on a scale, your assumption that people offering advice are not also practicing it is, at best, a conclusion without data. reply softsound 5 hours agorootparentprevSometimes the best one can do is try. It's worse to give up. And are you a good judge on if it's better? Better can be very complicated, it could be better in part and worse in another but it's not wrong to try... (Unless well it really becomes really corrupted) We as people tend to overcorrect and so life will always swing from one end of a spectrum to another. I think people do want to do good in the world they just get overwhelmed, or think it's impossible, or discredit the small good things they do. Sometimes people think if you don't do a major good thing all the small things don't add up - honestly though it's often better to do smaller good long term things then a major non lasting one. Besides the world is getting greener, healthier and happier all the time if you look in the right places. You will always find what you ask for, so look for good and you will find it.

I don't mean the fact checking part - thats legitimately a good thing to pursue. What I mean is that the value of this (to you and your co-creators) has enormous value to you way beyond the social good it might provide. For example at some point you're going to have to deal with nuance. Things are rarely purely right or wrong. (The earth is not round, but its a good first approximation for geological beginners.) So, I'd encourage you not to measure success here with \"does it work\", or how many users, or if LLMs are a suitable approach, or any metrics like that. The goal here shouldn't be popularity or \"correctness\". The most value you will get is the experience of building something, ideally in team. Of facing road-blocks and challenges and overcoming them. Or, to put it another way, have fun. And things that are easy are not fun... Congrats on the project.

If you are going to do it anyway, I would suggest: - Using a RAG architecture on top of a database of factual information. Wikipedia is probably your best bet. It is not 100% factual or correct either, but maybe as good as it gets. Scaling RAG to wikipedia size is not trivial, but I think it can be done. - Prompting the LLM to cite its sources so people can fact-check the fact-checker - Prompting the LLM to say it is unsure when something does not have a clear answer. I don't expect this to be reliable, but maybe somewhat better reply CuriouslyC 14 hours agorootparentThere's a whole art to prompting a LLM to say it's unsure. I need to write a blog post about this, it's deep. reply visarga 14 hours agorootparentSample a bunch of LLMs with the same question, if they disagree much then they are unsure. You can even sample the same LLM with high enough temperature, text augmentations, different prompts or different demonstrations. When they are correct they say the same thing, but when they make mistakes, they make different ones. This only works for factual or reasoning tasks, but that's where it matters. reply codetrotter 13 hours agorootparentBut how do you know if the LLMs agree, when all of them word the response differently For example LLM 1: Yes, it is true that fireworks were invented in China LLM 2: Fireworks were indeed invented in China reply CuriouslyC 9 hours agorootparentPlot twist, you can ask LLMs to provide a bayesian prior on their belief in the truth value (from multiple perspectives, again) then plug that into a variety of algorithms. reply Bjartr 13 hours agorootparentprevAsk another model if the two statements are in agreement of course! ;) reply omneity 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is trivially achievable with function calling, assuming the model you use supports this (which most models do at this point).

The universe of facts is infinite. The larger a user base, the fewer facts they'll collectively agree on. If you take on a large user base and an infinite knowledge domain, you'll lose trust with users who disagree with your fact checking (rightly or wrongly.) Instead, give yourself a smaller scope where you can actually win. Train your tool to be a world-class fact checker in a specific domain. Then market to a userbase who explicitly already agree on the facts you check against. This smaller scope sets you up for technical success and builds experience, revenue, and user trust, all of which you can leverage to iterate into another domain more quickly. reply helloduck1234 10 hours agoparentYea ok, eliminating misinformation is what we want to eventually do.

I tried testing it with the sentence “Toledo is the largest city in Ohio” and it’s suggestions were to replace this with paragraphs of text about what constitutes a city in Ohio and history about Ohio, which did happen to include that Columbus is currently the largest city in Ohio. That doesn’t seem strictly helpful as a fact checker as at first glance it isn’t even addressing the truthiness of the original sentence and just bloviates on about other details, if I even accept it’s suggestion.

My Two cents would be to add a short demo. A 30 second gif or video with accompanying text that explains how to use this. Just some kind of demonstration on how your interface works and what to expect the output to look like. And secondly to possibly help with the over suggestion/under suggestion issue, the grammar and writing assistance should be a separate mode from the fact checker. Again, I would love to know more about how this works in the sense of how does it determine facts, and as you alluded to in other comments how it avoids political opinions.

First of all, we are using an OpenAI based back-end, we are in the process of developing our own LLM for the task of text fitting. Secondly, the LLM in our approach is currently only used for text translation. This meaning, we assume the LLM dosnt know anything, and thus before the users input even reaches the LLM it has to hit a couple other models which determine if the statement is a fact or not, then an intermediary text analyses model to extract understandable queries from the text which can then be used to search information about the topic from a DB (for example, Google FC API, or a custom dataset of documents known good). After that process, all the data is presented to an LLM which can then fit the known good data into the context of the users input. The LLM itself is never trusted with data. Of course for a system like this to work, we would need access to a DB and those intermediary models, which as you can guess, will take a while to build and develop. For now, we are pushing our beta without this system but a dumbed down non-optimized (and definitely flawed) version to test scalability and fix bugs, test security, and check scalability for our back-end platform. In case anyone was wondering anything about my credentials, I am one of the lead back-end developers working on the project.

Suggested revision: > The reduction in extreme poverty over the past two centuries is one of the most significant changes in human conditions. The decline from over 80% of the global population living in such conditions in 1800 to under 20% by 2015 represents a major shift, driven by a combination of factors including economic growth, technological advancements, improved health care and education, and international aid and development efforts. The World Bank's international poverty which which was set at $1.90 per day in 2011 prices, is a benchmark used to measure extreme poverty globally. Adjusted for inflation, this threshold would be equivalent to $2.57 per day in 2023 dollars. Living below this line means that individuals lack the resources to meet their basic needs for survival. Despite the progress, extreme poverty remains a critical issue, particularly in regions like South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria, for example, was have to have the highest number of people living in extreme poverty with 2018, with 86 million individuals below the international poverty line. Efforts to combat extreme poverty continue through various means, including economic development, and in education and health care, and targeted poverty alleviation programs. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, include a goal to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. Achieving this goal will require sustained and concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, the private sector, I think it's fair to say there's some edge cases left to smooth out. ;) reply helloduck1234 13 hours agoparentYea, thank you for the feedback, as its a beta deployment that's what we want, people finding bugs so we can fix everything for the full launch. reply netbioserror 8 hours agoprevThanks for helping the techno-dystopian power class build their toolkit. +10 social credit. reply thinkingtoilet 13 hours agoprevImpressive!

So basically, what we define as fact is something that has proof. For example, we stray away from political views as those are opinions, and stay with “facts”. As for disputed facts, we would also stay away from them unless they have a significantly larger backing than the other. The source currently is LLMs that are trained on huge amounts of data. We have a learn more feature, so whenever you get a suggestion, it gives you the link that the information was pulled from so you can check yourself to see the source. So in a nutshell, we focus more on known solid facts like historic and scientific information. And we are not capping about our age, here is my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-jiang1/ reply zero-sharp 18 hours agorootparentThe goal is admirable. But \"fact checking\" is complicated and intelligent people can disagree. And a lot of people understand that having a centralized source of \"truth\" isn't desirable. The mathematical disciplines have proofs. That is, \"facts\" that are attained by deduction. Science can be rigorous, but it isn't driven through proofs. Science is empirical. A lot of the time, scientific research is not accessible and requires expert consensus. In any case, my guess is that most people aren't going to be fact checking math and physics, but socially relevant claims. And those are usually politicized. The point is: I don't know how you're going to decide on \"facts\" or \"truth\" using AI without there being bias or domain expertise & understanding, especially considering that we know LLMs hallucinate. Again, keep in mind that educated people (experts) can disagree on social claims. Sorry if this is discouraging, but I'm just trying to be realistic. reply sqeaky 17 hours agorootparentA core part of the problem is a lack of trust in institutions. People feel the experts aren't experts, feel the experts lie, or feel the experts have different and sometimes malicious goals. Even if that weren't the case new institutions should be less trusted than those with a solid history. So this new institution is trying to convince people of things. Why would my flat-earther coworker believe factful.io when they don't believe NASA?

It's probably also common in the medical field to have big pharma doing the sponsoring. I don't disagree with you. Lack of trust is a problem in some ways. But I've also become used to the idea that determining truth includes scrutinizing the source. It really is a lot of work. reply sqeaky 15 hours agorootparentIt absolutely can be a lot of work, but sometimes the statement or stance is self-disproving. I once worked with a conspiracy theory believer who thought that the Earth was simultaneously a flat disk and a hollow sphere. This person wasn't obviously a fool in normal conversation. They had no trouble writing C++, they had a master's degree in math, they recently purchased a second house and we're doing the repairs themselves to flip it, and he was comfortable with writing SQL for the application we're working in. But he absolutely refused to believe that \"they\" weren't out to get him. In retrospect it was clear that this was likely standing from anti-Semitic conspiracy backgrounds but more than once I asked him to verify if he meant actual lizard people or if that was code for something, and with great conviction he told me he actually believes some of our leaders were lizards. This person fundamentally didn't trust our institutions. He thought at the Airlines and that the government were being headed by literal lizard people in human suits. He had access to all the evidence to the contrary, but he had been betrayed so many times by the government that he saw no reason to trust anything from them and refused any photographs I produced from NASA. No how hard I worked to produce and vet information citing sources, or even produce experiments that he can reproduce, he just wouldn't trust anything that appeared to line up with what he perceived to be the goals of the government. Worse, something so many people attached to reality deny is that people like him are common.

    "originBody": "The AWS S3 Denial of Wallet amplification attack If you publicly host large data files on AWS S3 and pay for AWS transfer costs, you may be vulnerable to a “Denial of Wallet” amplification attack. Even if you are not hosting data publicly, you may be exposed to a malicious third-party attack or even a programming error, that can cause major costs within a short time frame. Ben Liesfeld · Follow Published in Limbus News · 7 min read · Feb 22, 2024 -- 2 The way AWS meters data transfer costs may make your business vulnerable in a way you did not expect. Introduction Cloud computing enables companies to build fast-scaling applications. This allows for new ways of analyzing data, especially in medicine or bioinformatics. But with the ease of resource scaling up and down, the way of cost control changes significantly for the cloud customers. By design, resources are scaling in cloud environments, and this results in rising costs at the same time. Having control of the costs is a difficult job. Even though AWS offers its own pricing calculator, it is so difficult that many companies have products to assist in cost control or cost overview, see for example “AWS Costs: Surprise, Surprise? It Shouldn’t Be!” Because of the large variety of cloud services and their cost models, it is very important for customers that they can rely on certain assumptions. A simple assumption is that downloading of some S3 data (via the Internet) costs an amount of money that is proportional to the amount of data downloaded (see S3 pricing structure). With such an assumption people build software and have some rough idea about the costs a certain service may incur. Since cloud resources scale so easily, cloud users must take certain precautions to prevent malicious attacks that may incur unintended costs. For example, if you experience a DDoS attack on your specific application, the costs may rise significantly because your cloud resources can be configured to scale according to demand. You need to implement multiple mechanisms to prevent this. Cloud providers even create tools to reduce the attack surface (see here for AWS best practices on this topic). The Denial of Wallet amplification attack Here, we will provide a previously unknown example of a potential attack on cloud resources where the assumed costs differ significantly from the real costs. This is about how costs for AWS S3 egress (transfer into the Internet) are calculated. With a very small number of special requests, it is possible to generate costs that differ from the actually downloaded data by a factor of 50. We coined this scenario a “’Denial of Wallet’ Amplification Attack”. It is not an attack against your service but against your wallet. We publish this information in a blog post because we ourselves were caught unaware of this situation and we feel the need to raise awareness about this issue, as it could be exploited by malicious third parties. Data sets in health care may be large In the healthcare industry, many other large companies and organizations use AWS S3 and similar cloud platforms for data storage or processing. For example, there are many public bioinformatics data repositories, also from government agencies, that provide large files on S3 publicly (e. g. NCBI SRA or gnomAD). Even cloud-computing platforms of large sequencing instrument manufacturers are affected. Having cost control of data storage and data transfer is very important if your data volume is increasing that much. Attack amplifying S3 egress costs One day we experienced an anomaly of S3 egress costs. We analyzed this anomaly and found that the amount of data actually downloaded did not match the amount on our invoice. With our partners’ help, we reproduced this behavior and identified a minor bug in a bioinformatics library. It was an accident. Unfortunately, this accidental behavior could also have been ‘weaponized’ in an attack. After contacting the AWS Support we were directed to the following details of the S3 pricing page (highlighting by us): Data Transfer Out may be different from the data received by your application in case the connection is prematurely terminated by you, for example, if you make a request for a 10 GB object and terminate the connection after receiving the first 2 GB of data. Amazon S3 attempts to stop the streaming of data, but it does not happen instantaneously. In this example, the Data Transfer Out may be 3 GB (1 GB more than 2 GB you received). As a result, you will be billed for 3 GB of Data Transfer Out. Okay, this is half the explanation. AWS customers are not billed for the data actually transferred to the Internet but instead for some amount of data that is cached internally. The main problem is the potential difference between the amount of data received by an entity outside of AWS and the amount of data on your bill. In the example above from the AWS documentation, the difference is a factor of 1.5 (2GB sent, 3GB billed). In our real-world example, the difference was almost a factor of 50. This means 3TB sent and 130TB billed. That can make a difference between “we do not care” and “whaaat”? A single programming error on a single machine caused a very expensive weekend. It also slightly raised the pulse of our controller. The extent of the problem It may be even worse: we were able to reproduce the scenario where we downloaded 300MB of data in 30sec from AWS S3 and were billed for more than 6GB by AWS. If an attacker can induce costs for 6GB in 30sec how much costs can be generated in a day, or on the weekend when running many threads in parallel? Note that AWS S3 is highly available, and you may never reach any bandwidth limits in real-world scenarios. That should scare anyone who hosts large files on a public S3 bucket, because the egress costs can skyrocket in this scenario. The good news: we only observed this behavior for large files (>1GB), when software clients download them via HTTP(S) RANGE requests. With range requests, the client can request to retrieve a part of a file, but not the entire file. By quickly canceling such requests, a client can request parts of a file without downloading all the data. Due to the way AWS calculates egress costs the transfer of the entire byte range is billed, even though the requests are canceled before the data is sent. There may also be dependencies on access patterns and timing, but we were able to reproduce it across different buckets and files and over several weeks (so this is not a fluke). This means that everybody who hosts large files on S3 is at risk, especially if these files are publicly accessible. Potential remedies Can I prevent this attack? Do not host large files on S3 if they can be accessed by range requests in a way that you cannot control. If you are relying on hosting large S3 data sets publicly, then you cannot prevent this attack. AWS best practice guidelines recommend restricting data access to S3 buckets. What does AWS recommend? We do not exactly know what the recommendation of AWS is for companies relying on hosting data publicly, but we did not find any official documentation that has any recommendations in that regard for files in public S3 buckets. For example, the “Security best practices for Amazon S3” state: Unless you explicitly require anyone on the internet to be able to read or write to your S3 bucket, make sure that your S3 bucket is not public. But AWS does not say anything about those cases where you do need public access (at least we did not find any under the AWS best practices for storage). By the way: restricting access to your S3 buckets may not prevent you from incurring costs for unauthorized requests as @maciej.pocwierz found out: https://medium.com/@maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1. Are there workarounds to mitigate the attack? Yes. As the first and most important step you should create cost alerts. We suggest to activate AWS Cost Anomaly Detection. When activating this tool and configuring it correctly you will be informed about abnormal billing events. At least in our case, this helped us to identify such an adverse event after a short time frame limiting its financial impact. Sadly, preventing such an attack is no easy task because of the design of AWS S3. The service is designed to serve large amounts of data as fast as possible. You could monitor HTTP API requests to your S3 buckets which is possible with a delay of a few hours. If you see an unusually high amount of API requests, you could prohibit access to the resource. But this solution is a brutal last resort, potentially disrupting your service entirely. So, if I’m not hosting public S3 files I’m safe? Unfortunately, no, as we observed a similar behavior when serving S3 files via pre-signed URLs, for example.

At a past job (2020) we used S3 to store a large amount of genomic data, and a web application read range requests to visualize tiny segments of the genetic sequence in relevant genes - like 5kb out of 50GB. If AWS had billed the cost of an entire genome/exome every time we did that, we would have noticed. I monitored costs pretty closely, S3 was never a problem compared to EC2. It also seemed like the root cause was an interrupted range request (although I wasn't fully clear on that). Even so that seems like a recent regression. It took me ages to get that stupid app working, I interrupted a lot of range requests :) reply __roland__ 12 hours agorootparentYou are right, this is about canceling range requests and still getting billed, not about requesting ranges and getting billed for the complete file egress. Sorry; we'll make the post clearer. reply nextaccountic 9 hours agorootparentThis seems like something that customers can potentially sue for. AWS is overcharging them and not correcting the bug once they become aware of it. reply nielsole 12 hours agorootparentprevS3 egress costs are free if the traffic stays within AWS. Sounds like your clients were EC2 instances so this wouldn't apply to you, would it? reply mikepurvis 12 hours agorootparentIf it was a web application as stated in the GP, then it would indeed be egress as the request would be coming from a browser. reply nicklecompte 12 hours agorootparentYes, it was client-side JavaScript making the range requests, asking for a string of genomic data to render in the browser. It was only to give the scientists a pretty picture :) The EC2 costs were largely ElasticSearch for a different function, which never looked at the data in S3. reply belter 1 hour agorootparentprev> S3 egress costs are free if the traffic stays within AWS Not if it's cross-region. reply fabian2k 13 hours agoparentprevThat sounds egregious enough that I have trouble believing this can be correct. My understanding is that AWS bills for egress for every service, parts of the file that aren't transferred are not part of this so can't be billed. There could certainly be S3-specific charges that affect cases like this, no idea. But if AWS bills the full egress traffic costs for a range request I'd consider that essentially fraud. reply __roland__ 12 hours agorootparentSorry, I think that part of our write-up is misleading (I was involved in analyzing the issue described here). To our best understanding, what happens is the following: - A client sends range requests and cancels them quickly. - The full range request data will be billed (NOT the whole file), so I think this should read that the entire requested range gets billed, even if it never gets transferred (the explanation we received for this is that it's due to some internal buffering S3 is doing, and they do count this as egress). In any case, if you send and cancel such requests quickly (which is easy enough, this was not even an adversarial situation, just a bug in some client API code) the egress cost is many times higher than your theoretical bandwidth (and about 80x higher than in the AWS documentation, hence the blogpost). reply nijave 12 hours agorootparentThis is a problem with lots of services. Blocking large quantities of legitimate looking requests is a hard problem. Request cancellation is also tricky and not supported well in a lot of frameworks/programming languages. reply thayne 8 hours agorootparentBut the thing you are supposedly getting billed for is data transferred to the Internet. If the connection is closed there might be some data that goes out before the reset is received, but not that much. So either this is a bug, or the pricing documention is ... incorrect about what they actually charge you for. reply martin-lim 3 hours agorootparentSadly this is no bug. Customers are NOT billed for actual data transferred. Customers are billed for \"some kind of\" data requested. If you interrupt the data transfer before downloading all requested data then it's \"your fault\". AWS documents this detail somewhere hidden on the S3 pricing page (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/). Search for \"Data Transfer Out may be different from the data received\" in the \"Data transfer\" tab. reply thayne 2 hours agorootparentThat explanation still makes it sound like you are charged for what is transferred to the Internet, but your application might not get some of it because it already closed the connection. From the OP it sounds like the amount billed is too high to be explained by that. If what you are billed for isn't actually data transferred, then it is deceptive to say that you are billed for \"data transferred out\". reply thayne 8 hours agorootparentprevWait. What if the range is bigger than the file? Say if I made a request for a 5 TB range but the file is actually only 1kb. Would you get charged for 5 TB of egress? reply belter 13 hours agorootparentprevhttps://github.com/ZJONSSON/node-unzipper/issues/308 reply paulddraper 13 hours agorootparenttl;dr AWS user believes that testing on a 1Gbps connection for 45 min can't be more than $10 of egress. Gets a $500 bill instead. Note: This user specified a lower range but not an upper range on the request (and closed the connection prematurely). Essentially read() with an offset, for a ZIP tool. See also: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205213 reply fabian2k 13 hours agorootparentThere is probably a small area where it's difficult to measure, so I would not expect billing to be exact to the byte here. But billing for the requested range if not the entire range was actually transferred is just not correct and not acceptable. reply paulddraper 12 hours agorootparentCertainly if you are charging for internet egress. Like, charging for requests or internal data processing, sure okay. But this is a charge specifically for the data transferred from AWS to the internet. So if you're not transferring data to the internet.... reply fabian2k 12 hours agorootparentThe part where I think there is some flexibility is about the difference between \"bytes attempted to transfer\" and \"bytes actually transferred\". I think it is pretty fair to bill for the former, as long as you abort requests in a reasonable way. So I don't expect it to be billed exactly by the transferred byte, but I do expect it to not go above that higher than whatever the chunk size for transferring is. reply klabb3 11 hours agorootparentThat’s an orthogonal issue. There’s no interpretation of “egress” that means “stuff we do internally before leaving aws data centers”. If the tcp conn is reset only a few MB would leave aws frontend servers. Instead, it appears they’ve been basing the number off the range in the request and/or whatever internal caching/loading they’re doing within S3, which again has nothing to do with egress. I mean, we already know egress is short for egregious. It’s an incredibly bad look to be overestimating the “fuck you” part of the bill. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentprevSure. In this case specifically AWS is attempting to transfer 70Gbps through a 1Gbps pipe. Not a rounding error. reply yonixwm 13 hours agorootparentprevSo I guess the attack of the OP is a case AWS calculate price based on the unbounded request header and not on the actual egress reply scottlamb 13 hours agorootparentMore or less. The article quotes AWS as saying the following: > Amazon S3 attempts to stop the streaming of data, but it does not happen instantaneously. ...which doesn't really explain it. It shouldn't send more than a TCP window after the connection is closed, and TCP windows are at most 1 GiB [1], usually much less, so this completely fails to explain the article's observed 3 TB sent vs 130 TB billed. The article goes on to say: > Okay, this is half the explanation. AWS customers are not billed for the data actually transferred to the Internet but instead for some amount of data that is cached internally. In other words, how much they bill really isn't bounded by how much is sent at all. This is unacceptable. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_window_scale_option reply easton 13 hours agorootparent> this completely fails to explain the article's observed 3 TB sent vs 130 TB billed I interpreted that to be that their code was doing this over and over again, so in total they retrieved 3TB over a set of requests. Still horrifying, but mildly more explainable. reply scottlamb 8 hours agorootparentEven so, TCP windows generally don't start at the maximum size, so I'm really not buying that ratio of bytes ACKed to sent. One could disprove this explanation with a packet capture; just add the remaining window. reply slt2021 12 hours agorootparentprevthis can be explained that this may be not egress out of AWS, but egress out of S3 system itself. S3 is a block storage, so retrieving an object for such a high availability and high perf service means it tries to pull some X block of data and cache it before sending through the socket. That X block of data is out of internal S3 storage, just not sent through the bigger Internet egress subsystem. So technically aws may argue this is egress for s3, just not for aws reply jpambrun 9 hours agorootparentThe consequence of your interpretation is that surprise billing is not even bounded by the physical limitations. This is absolutely not reasonable. I am the user with in the zip case. I knew this testing would incur a cost, but I could imagine it could be 20x my network speed and I have absolutely no control over what AWS claims to meter. reply vermilingua 12 hours agorootparentprevThen subsequent requests that hit the cache shouldn’t be charged by that logic. reply slt2021 11 hours agorootparents3 is a complex system, you could be hitting a different node with subsequent requests where this cache entry does not exist yet. if you think egress is expensive, well storing data in RAM for cache purposes is 1000000x more expensive a lot of stuff could be happening. Main problem is AWS (i think) is charging for egress out of S3 system, but customers are looking at their ingress at client side and there is mismatch reply jpambrun 9 hours agorootparentBut you are not charged if it's not Internet egress, which makes your argument about compute/ram cost moot. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentprev> AWS customers are not billed for the data actually transferred to the Internet but instead for some amount of data that is cached internally. But egress fees only apply to S3 transfers outside AWS? So which is it? Data transferred to the Internet? Or data processed internally? reply scottlamb 8 hours agorootparentObviously they break the problem down into questions like \"what's the maximum that could be transferred between any two components? what's the most expensive components this transits?\" and pick the most expensive answers without any attempt at coherence. Right now some class action lawyer is drooling. reply voidwtf 13 hours agoprevThe way billing is calculated should be clearly labeled along with the pricing. Azure does this too, it's super unclear what metric they're using to determine what will be billed for requests. We're having to find out via trial and error. If we request 0-2GB on a 6GB file, but the client cancels after 400MB. Are we paying 2GB or 400MB or 6GB? Is there a billed difference between Range: 0-, no \"Range\" header, and Range: 0-1GB if the client downloads 400MB in each scenario? reply __roland__ 12 hours agoparentSorry for not having this made clearer (we'll fix this part of the post): the gotcha is not that AWS does not honor range requests, it's that canceling those will still add the full range of bytes to your egress bill (and this can add up quickly) although no bytes (or much fewer) have been transferred. reply alchemist1e9 12 hours agorootparentOn the other hand you did ask for them so what does it mean “canceling”? Just playing devil’s advocate that they did likely start getting the data for you and that takes resources. Otherwise they would be open to a DOS attack that initiates many requests and then cancels them. reply __roland__ 12 hours agorootparentSure, that's true. The thing is: this was the same requested (and cancelled) range on the same file(s), over and over (it was a bug). Looking at this from the outside, even some internal S3 caching should have had many cache hits and not have to re-download the requested ranges internally all the time (there were dozens of identical requests per second, immediately being cancelled). On top of this, S3 already bills (separately) for any request against a bucket (see the other current issue with the invalid PUT requests against a secured bucket, which still got billed to the bucket owner; https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40203126). So I'd say both the requests and the cancellations were already paid for; the surprise was the 'egress' cost on top, of data that was not actually leaving the AWS network. Still, you are right that this still consumes some additional AWS resources, and it is probably a non-trivial issue to fix in the 'billing system'. reply Havoc 13 hours agoprevIt's almost like the combination of public accessible + charged per use + big cloud refusing to allow hardcaps on spend is a terrible idea... reply jsheard 12 hours agoparentAzure is probably the most egregious example of this, AWS and GCP can at least claim they have architectural barriers to implementing a hard spending cap, but Azure already has one and arbitrarily only allows certain subscription types to use it. If you have a student account then you get a certain amount of credit each month and if you over-spend it then most services are automatically suspended until the next month, unless you explicitly opt-out of the spending limit and commit to paying the excess out of pocket. However if you have a standard account you're not allowed to set a spending limit for, uh... reasons. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-bill... reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentThat's insane as well. They already built the system, but you just can't use it because we want the option for you to screw up and pad our billing. There are many projects I've worked on where a service not being available until the 1st of the next month would not be anything more than a minor annoyance, and would much rather that happen than an unexpected bill. This is also something that I think would be a nice CYA tool when developing something in the cloud for the first time. It's easy to make a mistake when learning cloud services that could be expensive like TFA shows. reply anonymousDan 12 hours agorootparentprevAWS Educate has the same ability to impose a hard cap I believe... reply carbotaniuman 12 hours agorootparentprevI guess it's a matter of students don't have money to spend and bad optics, while a company might be cowed into paying the bill. reply Havoc 10 hours agorootparentprevNot just the student accounts - some of the corporate accounts have same.

Then it turns out that one param doesn't allow values below a certain number, even though the docs say otherwise. reply Twirrim 11 hours agoparentHistorically, they've been scared of versioning their APIs (not many services have done it, dynamodb has, for example). It leads to a \"bad customer experience\", having to update lots of code, and also increases maintenance costs while you keep two separate code paths functional.

    "originLink": "https://phys.org/news/2024-05-toxicity-fresh-scrutiny-salmon-die.html",
    "originBody": "May 1, 2024 Editors' notes This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication reputable news agency proofread Tire toxicity faces fresh scrutiny after salmon die-offs by Jim Robbins, KFF Health News Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain For decades, concerns about automobile pollution have focused on what comes out of the tailpipe. Now, researchers and regulators say, we need to pay more attention to toxic emissions from tires as vehicles roll down the road. At the top of the list of worries is a chemical called 6PPD, which is added to rubber tires to help them last longer. When tires wear on pavement, 6PPD is released. It reacts with ozone to become a different chemical, 6PPD-q, which can be extremely toxic—so much so that it has been linked to repeated fish kills in Washington state. The trouble with tires doesn't stop there. Tires are made primarily of natural rubber and synthetic rubber, but they contain hundreds of other ingredients, often including steel and heavy metals such as copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc. As car tires wear, the rubber disappears in particles, both bits that can be seen with the naked eye and microparticles. Testing by a British company, Emissions Analytics, found that a car's tires emit 1 trillion ultrafine particles per kilometer driven—from 5 to 9 pounds of rubber per internal combustion car per year. And what's in those particles is a mystery, because tire ingredients are proprietary. \"You've got a chemical cocktail in these tires that no one really understands and is kept highly confidential by the tire manufacturers,\" said Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics. \"We struggle to think of another consumer product that is so prevalent in the world and used by virtually everyone, where there is so little known of what is in them.\" Regulators have only begun to address the toxic tire problem, though there has been some action on 6PPD. The chemical was identified by a team of researchers, led by scientists at Washington State University and the University of Washington, who were trying to determine why coho salmon returning to Seattle-area creeks to spawn were dying in large numbers. Working for the Washington Stormwater Center, the scientists tested some 2,000 substances to determine which one was causing the die-offs, and in 2020 they announced they'd found the culprit: 6PPD. The Yurok Tribe in Northern California, along with two other West Coast Native American tribes, have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to prohibit the chemical. The EPA said it is considering new rules governing the chemical. \"We could not sit idle while 6PPD kills the fish that sustain us,\" said Joseph L. James, chairman of the Yurok Tribe, in a statement. \"This lethal toxin has no place in any salmon-bearing watershed.\" California has begun taking steps to regulate the chemical, last year classifying tires containing it as a \"priority product,\" which requires manufacturers to search for and test substitutes. \"6PPD plays a crucial role in the safety of tires on California's roads and, currently, there are no widely available safer alternatives,\" said Karl Palmer, a deputy director at the state's Department of Toxic Substances Control. \"For this reason, our framework is ideally suited for identifying alternatives to 6PPD that ensure the continued safety of tires on California's roads while protecting California's fish populations and the communities that rely on them.\" The U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association says it has mobilized a consortium of 16 tire manufacturers to carry out an analysis of alternatives. Anne Forristall Luke, USTMA president and CEO, said it \"will yield the most effective and exhaustive review possible of whether a safer alternative to 6PPD in tires currently exists.\" Molden, however, said there is a catch. \"If they don't investigate, they aren't allowed to sell in the state of California,\" he said. \"If they investigate and don't find an alternative, they can go on selling. They don't have to find a substitute. And today there is no alternative to 6PPD.\" California is also studying a request by the California Stormwater Quality Association to classify tires containing zinc, a heavy metal, as a priority product, requiring manufacturers to search for an alternative. Zinc is used in the vulcanization process to increase the strength of the rubber. When it comes to tire particles, though, there hasn't been any action, even as the problem worsens with the proliferation of electric cars. Because of their quicker acceleration and greater torque, electric vehicles wear out tires faster and emit an estimated 20% more tire particles than the average gas-powered car. A recent study in Southern California found tire and brake emissions in Anaheim accounted for 30% of PM2.5, a small-particulate air pollutant, while exhaust emissions accounted for 19%. Tests by Emissions Analytics have found that tires produce up to 2,000 times as much particle pollution by mass as tailpipes. These particles end up in water and air and are often ingested. Ultrafine particles, even smaller than PM2.5, are also emitted by tires and can be inhaled and travel directly to the brain. New research suggests tire microparticles should be classified as a pollutant of \"high concern.\" In a report issued last year, researchers at Imperial College London said the particles could affect the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs and cause cancer. People who live or work along roadways, often low-income, are exposed to more of the toxic substances. Tires are also a major source of microplastics. More than three-quarters of microplastics entering the ocean come from the synthetic rubber in tires, according to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts and the British company Systemiq. And there are still a great many unknowns in tire emissions, which can be especially complex to analyze because heat and pressure can transform tire ingredients into other compounds. One outstanding research question is whether 6PPD-q affects people, and what health problems, if any, it could cause. A study published in Environmental Science & Technology Letters found high levels of the chemical in urine samples from a region of South China, with levels highest in pregnant women. The discovery of 6PPD-q, Molden said, has sparked fresh interest in the health and environmental impacts of tires, and he expects an abundance of new research in the coming years. \"The jigsaw pieces are coming together,\" he said. \"But it's a thousand-piece jigsaw, not a 200-piece jigsaw.\" Journal information: Environmental Science & Technology Letters 2024 KFF Health News.

    "commentBody": "Tire toxicity faces fresh scrutiny after salmon die-offs (phys.org)169 points by NDAjam 20 hours agohidepastfavorite158 comments liminal 17 hours agoI'd like to see a weight tax on vehicles. Lighter vehicles have less tire wear, so less pollution. They also require less energy to move, so less emissions. Plus lighter vehicles would improve pedestrian safety. reply capitainenemo 17 hours agoparentInteresting idea. Apparently road damage goes up with the 4th power of the weight (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power_law) Really trucks are probably not paying their fair share in that regard. I wonder how it would be implemented in practice given how variable vehicle weights are depending on how they are being used. Weigh stations like they use for trucks? It might also be a solution for gas taxes being insufficient to maintain roads as vehicles transition to electric. And in concert with the much higher weight of electric vehicles due to batteries still sucking at power density (maybe it would increase interest in things like aluminium-air) reply chongli 15 hours agorootparentYes and so what makes the most sense is to make the tax increase with the 4th power of vehicle weight multiplied by the miles they travel. This way there are no perverse incentives. Everyone pays their fair share according to how much damage they cause. reply dragontamer 15 hours agorootparentI love pushing \"Tire Taxes\". We all know that tires will emit rubber particles down to the point where the tire tred is 2/32th of an inch (from ~8/32ths of a fresh tire). So just... tax the tires based on the ~6/32ths of an inch outer-diameter of the tire that turns into microplastic dust. Calculate the microplastic dust weight of the outer diameter + weight of tires and bam. You have a 1-to-1 correlation of tax to exactly the amount of particles emitted. No weight^4th power required. The tire wear directly correlates to the pollution we care about. So tax / measure the tires directly, don't do anything else that's more indirect. reply NewJazz 14 hours agorootparentDoesn't account for road wear or pedestrian risk, though. reply dragontamer 13 hours agorootparentI have to imagine that if Car X wore out 5kg of rubber, that it would have had half the impact of another Car Y that wore out 10kg of rubber. Right? Tire wear has to be directly correlated to road wear. They're in physical contact with each other after all, so it'd be as direct a measurement as any other possible methodology. reply positr0n 11 hours agorootparentBut rubber does not damage concrete, it's the weight of the vehicle that damages the concrete. As an extreme example, if I floor a 2000lb Miata when the light turns green that will deposit a ton of rubber on the road. But that does nothing compared to just driving through the intersection in a 6000lb suburban. reply chongli 8 hours agorootparentYeah. It's the vehicle weight combined with temperature fluctuations and water, ice, and salt. The worst case scenario is when the road develops tiny cracks that fill up with water and then the temperature drops, causing the water to freeze and expand inside those cracks. The cracks grow larger and then when the water thaws and evaporates it leaves behind those large cracks/voids which heavy vehicles collapse due to their weight, turning cracks into potholes. reply uoaei 12 hours agorootparentprevSo you want to tax tires separately to whole cars? You don't think your scheme will induce perverse incentives as regards tread patterns, grip in different weather scenarios, etc.? If I were a tire manufacturer I'd love this because I would: * make tires that have not very much tread to wear through * make the outer tread extremely hard so it wears (testably) much more slowly * blame consumers for driving the tires wrong rather than make safe tires because we can hide behind T&Cs and our army of lawyers when accident rates inevitably increase * put our fingers in all the tire installation and body shop pies to prpfit off of the new economic conditions that were created as a result of this tax reply dragontamer 11 hours agorootparentMy State isn't very big. If everyone started making tire taxes across the country, maybe that'd be a problem. But no one gives a care about just one small state making a tax like this. Michelin isn't going to redesign their tires just to save $50 in tire taxes. > * make tires that have not very much tread to wear through That's not how physics works. You need deep tread to safely expel water and/or deep treads to make snow-impressions (if its a snow tire). reply positr0n 10 hours agorootparent> That's not how physics works. You need deep tread to safely expel water and/or deep treads to make snow-impressions Key word here is safely. A large portion of people would care more about saving $100 in tax than about the physics that makes their car less safe. reply eldaisfish 15 hours agorootparentprevTying a tax to distance travelled requires accurate reporting of distance travelled. How is that not a perverse incentive? reply chongli 11 hours agorootparentWe shouldn't care if you want to buy a 10,000 lb electric truck if you leave it parked in your driveway all year round. If we're not taxing based on distance then the perverse incentive is to drive big trucks until they fall to pieces. reply dzhiurgis 3 hours agorootparentprevEasy in places where it requires annual safety checks reply digitalsushi 14 hours agorootparentpreva civie engineer told me an overloaded 18 wheeler is about the same as 8,000 passenger vehicles making the same trip on the tar. reply tommiegannert 17 hours agoparentprevMy canton in Switzerland uses this formula: tax = k * P*0.9 / m*0.05 P: power in kW m: weight in kg k: currently 7.125 Minimizing tax means a small engine and a heavy car. (Though the tax difference between 1000 kg and 3000 kg is only 6%.) They also don't do subsidies for EVs, with the rationale that EVs affect road maintenance as much as other cars. Given that, the formula is backwards in terms of weight. https://guide.autoscout24.ch/de/auto-unterhalt/verkehrsabgab... reply barrkel 16 hours agorootparentIt's penalizing high power to weight ratio, i.e. sports vehicles. reply dragontamer 16 hours agoparentprevMy local state is adding weight to our vehicle registration fees, but only slightly (ex: capping out at 5000lbs). There are vehicles as high as 8000+lbs commonly used, and I think those should have higher tax than the 5000lb class vehicles. reply faeriechangling 16 hours agorootparentHaving a cap makes absolutely no sense except politically. There’s not a diminishing impact here whatsoever. reply dragontamer 15 hours agorootparentThere used to be only one weight tax (erm, registration fee). Now we have two weight classes, 3500lbs and 5000lbs. Its an improvement, but why stop at two classes? Its nearly as bad as our previous law that was only at one weight class. Might as well follow the pattern at every 1500lbs up until no common vehicles are covered anymore. (6500lb and 8000lb are a natural extension of this new law). Oh well, we can fix it in next year's debate, I guess? reply UniverseHacker 16 hours agoparentprevThis would be a good idea, because weight is the major factor in vehicle safety... if everyone else has a 6,000lb vehicle, you need one as well to be safe when they hit you. If vehicles on average got lighter, this would solve this problem. Unfortunately, EVs and modern crash tech have made cars much heavier. A 1970 small economy car like a VW Rabbit was ~1800lbs, that same car now (VW Golf) is now ~3200lbs. reply jjtheblunt 15 hours agoparentprev> Lighter vehicles have less tire wear, so less pollution. there are different tire rubber/synthetic formulations, as another independent (of weight) variable reply mattpallissard 15 hours agoparentprevI'm tired of viewing taxes as a punishment. Taxes are for funding the government. If you're going to tax someone make sure the money goes to something specific, like keeping tire junk out of waterways. Some people like to drive, some people like big cars. Fix the tires, grand-daddy in all the existing cars, incentivize cleaner ones, and let everything age out. They're doing it with heat pumps, why not cars? reply txru 15 hours agorootparentA core economic concept is externalities, positive and negative. Positive externalities are undervalued by the market, negative ones are overvalued by the market, like cigarettes. There aren't many ways to resolve externalities. If you pay people to quit cigarettes, people start smoking to get paid for quitting. For negative externalities, sometimes you just really have to make the good more expensive, or we'll end up bearing the much larger societal costs down the road, like we did for lead in gasoline and widespread cigarette smoking. reply asdasdsddd 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about punishment, its about pricing in externalities reply earthling8118 14 hours agorootparentprevOn the level of the US federal government, taxes are absolutely not for funding. They could hardly be more removed from it. They're a restriction the money supply, but they don't determine what funding is. reply commandlinefan 15 hours agoparentprevEven more taxes on semi trucks that deliver the food that's already growing unaffordable that will be passed on to consumers then? reply TSiege 15 hours agorootparentIt could very easily just be on consumer vehicles, not commercial ones reply wiml 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's not hard to Fermi-estimate the impact on the price of a cabbage, say. What do you think it would be? reply dzhiurgis 2 hours agorootparentprevYes, buses too. reply lupusreal 15 hours agoparentprevThat would amount to a tax on (among other vehicles) electric vehicles, which weight a lot more than comparable ICE cars. reply swsieber 13 hours agorootparentAnd rightfully so, IMO. Increased pollution from increased weight is a real issue. reply lupusreal 13 hours agorootparentSure, but it doesn't seem politically viable to me. reply trgn 17 hours agoprevMy neighbor on one side maintains their virginal lawn with copious amounts of roundup, the neighbor on the other has a facsimile in astroturf. We will wallow, willingly, in trash, breathing fumes, particle dust, just because of an imitative, aesthetic fad. It's absolutely incredible to me. reply glorpsicle 15 hours agoparentIf you don't mind my asking, how do you maintain your property? It may be illustrative to see what some of the alternatives to the scenarios you described with your neighbors might be. reply everforward 13 hours agorootparentMine is slightly different from the other responder. I do mow my front yard (HOA requires it), but in the back I only weedwhack the areas that we actively use and a path to them. The gondola does have a square of cheap Home Depot astroturf under it, mostly so I don't have to weedwhack it every time we want to use it. My back yard is primarily ~knee high hedge parsley at the moment; the flowers are beautiful! I will have to weedwhack most of it here shortly though. Hedge parsley grows burrs after blooming, and it's a huge pain to pick them off all my clothing and furniture after my dogs roll in them and then come inside. My dogs love to run in it, and it brings in ton of wildlife. I'm on the edge of urban and suburban and get deer, rabbits, tons of birds, squirrels, raccoons, field mice, and more insects than you can shake a stick at. The mosquito population is surprisingly moderate as well; my suspicion is that the natural plants provide enough food for herbivorous insects that my house has a standing population of carnivorous insects flying around. I vastly prefer it from an aesthetic standpoint, though I grew up rural and prefer the organized chaos of nature over the unsettling uniformity of manicured outdoor spaces generally. It's also much less work than routine weed-eating and what not. Some people may have allergies and hate it. My only major concern is with attracting dangerous wildlife, primarily snakes given my geography. There's nowhere particularly warm for them to bask, but hiding spots are innumerable. Humans would likely be okay (the hiding spots are not close to where we hang out), but I do worry for my dogs. They really like sticking their snouts places where snakes would like to hang out. reply trgn 15 hours agorootparentprevI mow and weed wack. Looks tidy, but lawn is mix of weeds and grass. reply rrrix1 13 hours agorootparentWeeds are just unwanted grasses, flowers and hedges. Sounds like you like all of your lawn plants, so you don't actually have any \"weeds.\" That's how I do it too. It's the right thing for our planet. reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentI'd mostly agree, although it's worth mentioning that there are certain invasive species and harmful plants that are best to get rid of however you can. It might be worth taking a look at what's growing even for people who aren't interested in pulling weeds. reply goda90 14 hours agorootparentprev\"Weed\" is in the eye of the beholder. If it's not a harmful invasive plant then really the only reason to not want it is aesthetics or because it impacts what you want to do with a space. reply gregwebs 16 hours agoprevPutting EV subsidies instead into electrifying and enhancing train transit seems like a better approach to combat this. A lot of mass transit trains are still diesel powered and pollute heavily (although on a per person basis might be much better than driving cars). I am wondering if a bus is better or worse for tire pollution per capita? reply dzhiurgis 2 hours agoparentwell bus will pollute something like 10,000x more over EV. If you tax them accordingly you might as well take taxi. reply b800h 17 hours agoprevI'm similarly concerned about the horrible tiny rubber pellets used in latest-generation astroturf pitches. IIRC they used to be made from used tyres but now aren't - does that just mean they're processed? Where does the rubber come from and where does it go afterwards? reply cbsmith 17 hours agoprevI'm kind of stunned that we're just now getting a handle on problems with tire particulates. It's been roughly a century. reply lonelyasacloud 15 hours agoparentI'm not. Default assumption in the West is if it's not medicine and it doesn't kill immediately it's good to go. Some time later, usually quite a lot, a tiny group of independent scientists end up being interested enough to scientifically prove that bloody obvious scaling problem is a problem. But by that time usually much money and politics is tied up in it. To that mix, then add in legislatures that even when they are independent have processes and bandwidth largely optimised for the pace of change from the age of sail and we end up with an endless stream of doh moments. One glimmer of hope here is at least it looks like getting it sorted might take slightly less time than lead pipes. reply cbsmith 11 hours agorootparentThere's been a ton of analysis on the safety of automobiles in the US. Does it really make sense that we got to leaded gasoline being a problem decades before tire particles? reply r00fus 16 hours agoparentprevConvenient for the auto industry that it's been overlooked for so long... reply cbsmith 16 hours agorootparentVery. reply singularity2001 16 hours agoparentprevHow long did it take to become consensus that smoking is in fact not healthy? reply cbsmith 16 hours agorootparentIt'd didn't take nearly that long for us to start to identify that there was a problem there. Making the case that it required a regulatory response definitely took really long, which I expect will happen again this time. reply trvs 19 hours agoprevThis was also covered years ago in a children's podcast (and New York Times): https://tinkercast.com/podcasts/wow-in-the-world/the-mysteri...

I'm not convinced that street sweeping in most cities much but a low-level scam so the city can cash in on parking violations. In LA, I've seen street sweepers my whole life going around and mostly kicking around dry material and moving so fast that they barely pick up anything, often followed by a parking enforcer some kind of golf cart type vehicle. Street sweeping makes more sense when the debris is big and wet enough to be swept up, which may not be the case for most tire debris. If it's tire particulate, street sweeping might make things worse by making it more airborne. reply bamboozled 17 hours agoparentprevI’d almost guarantee the bristles on a street sweeper are also leaching insane amounts of toxic crap into the environment. I bet they’re plastic… reply carom 17 hours agorootparentThey are metal, you find them in the road sometimes. reply nosrepa 15 hours agorootparentYou can make an alright set of lock picks out of them. reply 13of40 17 hours agorootparentprevThey're actually steel, and if you keep an eye out you can find them all over the place. reply basil-rash 17 hours agorootparentprevThey’re metal. Plastic would not stand up to the task. reply bamboozled 10 hours agorootparentActually some good news then :) reply mistrial9 19 hours agoprevsome links from Google Scholar https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=jenn... \" a Ph.D. student, Haoqi Nina Zhao, suggested a new way to separate out chemicals that led to a prime suspect. But they couldn’t test it, because they didn’t know what it was. “It’s almost like you have a fingerprint,” Dr. Tian said. “But you really don’t know who this is, because in your database, this fingerprint doesn’t exist.” Dr. Tian’s “aha!” moment came one morning. Guessing that the mystery chemical had transformed from a substance originally added to the tire, he looked for a compound whose carbon and nitrogen molecules matched, ignoring the oxygen and hydrogen, since the latter are more likely to be altered when a chemical transforms. In an Environmental Protection Agency report on tire rubber, he found a match: an antioxidant called 6PPD. The researchers ordered the smallest amount they could, about a pound of purple pellets. When they oxidized the substance, the resulting chemical looked just like the one they had worked so hard to isolate from the tire water. It was time to test this version, 6PPD-quinone, on the salmon. “I find it incredibly sad to watch fish die,” Dr. Kolodziej said. “You’re just watching these fish struggle. And yet you’re happy you understand why.” The killer was the 6PPD-quinone from the tires in the roadway runoff. “The analysis that they did is really amazing,” said Nancy Denslow, a professor and director of aquatic toxicology at the University of Florida who was not affiliated with the study. She also praised the large number of authors. “It’s wonderful to see big groups of people coming together to solve problems,” she said. “Group science is fantastic.” -- How Scientists Tracked Down a Mass Killer (of Salmon) https://www.asf.ca/how-scientists-tracked-down-a-mass-killer... reply Chris2048 18 hours agoparentI don't understand how testing toxicity of chemicals, and their oxides, is not a standard part of allowing them in manufacture?.. reply zonkerdonker 17 hours agorootparentThere are hundreds of distinct chemical compounds in tires. This one in particular is very harmful to salmon. It's it harmful to bison? What about cicadas? It's a problem of scale, greed, perverse incentives, and capitalism. I'm sure there's some amount of testing involved, and I'm also sure that Dow Chemical has made many lobbyists very wealthy in order to keep that testing as cheap and as minimal as possible. reply commandlinefan 15 hours agoprev... and allowing as many people who can realistically work from home do so would go a long way toward alleviating this. But managers don't believe you're working unless they see your face in person, so keep on commuting... reply bdamm 18 hours agoprevTragedy of the commons? reply thefaux 16 hours agoparenthttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/indi... reply LarryDarrell 18 hours agoprev [–] Perhaps tires can be made less toxic, but over all, we need to prioritize driving less. WFH means I put barely 3000 miles per year on my car. It's absurd we are not aggressively promoting WFH or hybrid WFH at the national level. It's the easiest win for the environment and it's right there for the taking. reply thfuran 18 hours agoparentIs it actually a win for the environment? Sure, not commuting is, but what about more people deciding to live in less dense areas? reply epistasis 18 hours agorootparentOne of the biggest environmental impacts is driving, so the real key is to have mixed uses near by. If you have a family and still need to drive your kids to school everyday, because schools are too far away to walk and there's no bus (typical in California), if you need to drive to go to the grocery store, if you need to drive to do everything in your life, then working from home in a less dense area might still involve a very similar amount of driving. Once vehicle miles travelled is subtracted out, the biggest impact from living in less dense areas is deforestation, reduction of large fauna in ecosystems, etc. A classic example of that is the Santa Cruz Mountains, highly populated by low-density living, but getting in and out is so arduous that most people do not commute much, or even leave their houses for much. A good life for hermits, but it's not for everyone. reply SoftTalker 18 hours agorootparentI think it would still involve less driving. You don't get groceries every day if you drive to get them. You buy a few days or a week's worth of supplies at a time. School may be hard to avoid driving if there's no bus or good walking/biking routes, but maybe you can carpool with neighbors who have kids in the same school. But I think fundamentally a lot of people are just not accustomed to sitting at home. They feel cooped up, and bored. That's not me -- I'd rarely leave the house if I could get away with it. But I know a lot of people feel that way, if they didn't have to go to work they'd go drive somewhere just to be somewhere different for a while. reply epistasis 17 hours agorootparentI totally understand that, and we need to account for people with different desires and needs. I would go crazy in no time in an isolated setting, I really really crave having a lot of density and people around me. But despise driving to do anything unless it's purely recreational driving, which would be fun maybe once or twice a month. I would love nothing more than to live in a walkable neighborhood, with very few cars, that lets kids roam free without fear of them getting killed by drivers. But that's really hard to come by anywhere in the US. reply LarryDarrell 18 hours agorootparentprevAt some point one has to consider costs, scale and political expediency. WFH and H-WFH would be broadly popular among the electorate and could probably take off with just some changes to the tax code. Presuming everyone does want to live in a dense area (I do not), building housing and infrastructure is expensive and at the end of the day it has to be profitable to build. We don't really have the framework to zone municipalities at the Federal level. So now you are talking about leaving it to the individual states... and I think you can see where that goes. Given all that, yes, fewer miles driven in aggregate is a good and easy win for the environment. Less gasoline consumed, fewer tires and brake pads consumed, less work clothes bought, less meals purchased at lunch, etc. reply david-gpu 17 hours agorootparent> Presuming everyone does want to live in a dense area (I do not) I wish we stopped subsidizing wealthy folks choosing to live in low density areas. It is intrinsically regressive that poorer people living in sustainable denser areas are subsidizing the infrastructure of the low density suburbs where richer people live. Low density suburbs do not raise enough taxes to support their own infrastructure, from roads, to water management, to electricity, etc. Want to live in a single family home? Great! But don't expect people poorer than you to bear the cost. reply kiba 17 hours agorootparentI live in a SFH. It's very unpleasant outside of my home. It's inconvenient, sometime outright dangerous to walk to my local grocery store. There's also constant noise from the cars and the ever present possibility of a car driving off the road. I see a bicycle tribute or two to small children in my local area. I wouldn't even considering cycling given the speed of cars around there. The local road is used for through traffic despite being one lane in each direction. So it's very frustrating if I want to get somewhere during rush hour, and this is just cars! If you want to walk to the local gas station, you might have to deal with muddy ground because of the ground being the bottom of a hill in order to get there, although the owner of said muddy ground have filled it in with dirt lately. The sidewalks if they exist, are discontinuous. Yes, wealthier people live in SFH and the surburb, but it's a questionable in term of quality of life. I visited the city. In some way, they are more convenient such as access to rideshare scooters and bikes, but also dangerous and automotive centric if less so. reply LarryDarrell 17 hours agorootparentprevMy neighborhood and for miles around me is lower to middle-middle class. All people that wouldn't be able to afford to 1) move and leave their equity behind 2) afford the rents in the denser part of town. You are painting with too broad of strokes. reply Spivak 17 hours agorootparentprev> wealthy folks choosing to live in low density areas There's no way you're saying this with a straight face, right? People move out of the city because it's significantly cheaper. Rent in a nice two bedroom \"downtown\" is $3500. You move 15 minutes out of there and you can get 3 bedroom house for an $1800 mortgage that'll never go up. Source: I did that. I got tired of paying such a huge chunk of my income for living. reply jwagenet 16 hours agorootparentIt’s cheaper because not enough city housing is built and there are other costs associated with suburban living. IMO, property taxes should increase as density decreases because those less dense areas will cost a lot more to maintain roads, utilities, etc. down the road. reply weweweoo 15 hours agorootparentHigher property taxes for less dense areas might make sense for suburbs of big cities, but not beyond that. In the countryside road and other infrastructure is required for agriculture, if some people also choose to live there (and that way reduce prices in cities) it's a win-win. reply Spivak 15 hours agorootparentprevLook, where I live isn't SF or Vancouver that has the \"NIMBYs oppose all new building\" problem. If you wanted to build super dense high-rise apartments or skyscrapers both the city and state would throw money at you and give you tax breaks. It's still ludicrously expensive compared to even the closest suburb. We've gotten more traction building apartment complexes on the edges of the burbs than in the metro area in recent years. reply jwagenet 16 hours agorootparentprevNo way there should be incentives for living outside dense areas. Utility, road, and service maintenance costs increase per capita as density goes down, and currently that cost is not borne by people in those areas. reply kiba 17 hours agorootparentprevPresuming everyone does want to live in a dense area (I do not), building housing and infrastructure is expensive and at the end of the day it has to be profitable to build. We don't really have the framework to zone municipalities at the Federal level. So now you are talking about leaving it to the individual states... and I think you can see where that goes. It's impossible to build if there are restriction on permitting and construction. Also, I would expect land cost to be a significant factor in high density area due to high demand. reply thfuran 17 hours agorootparentprevI don't really see how any of this (aside from the brief mention of commuting again) has any bearing on the question of whether it's better for the environment. reply hinkley 16 hours agorootparentprevMy theory is that WFH will mostly contribute to creating secondary markets for more industries. Professionals will still want the services a city affords you but not want to pay SF or even Seattle prices. So they’ll end up somewhere under two hours from the nearest metropolis. But if you get enough people in one place, you’ll get entrepreneurship. reply BobaFloutist 16 hours agorootparentIf you get enough people in one place what you really get is a city. reply hinkley 15 hours agorootparentFrom a business standpoint that’s not sufficient though. You need a critical mass of people interested in your narrow little niche. reply faeriechangling 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes it follow if you don’t commute you’ll live rurally or in the suburbs? If you live urban you can just rid yourself of a vehicle altogether. reply thfuran 15 hours agorootparentAs in does working from home require someone to move to the suburbs? No. But many people do choose to move into larger housing in cheaper, less dense areas once they start spending more time at home and aren't tied down by a daily commute. reply kps 18 hours agorootparentprevA house can be approximately net zero from solar panels. Much denser housing can't be. reply epistasis 18 hours agorootparentDenser housing can easily be net zero from nearby solar panels. Additionally, denser housing is much more energy efficient, requiring less overall energy, but this is kind of a minor impact. Once we get to solar + batteries powering most of our energy needs, cutting space heating energy needs by 20%-50% doesn't matter much. reply blargey 18 hours agorootparentprevWhen the topic is \"tire wear on cars causes significant environmental damage, not just their combustion-engine emissions\", praising houses for just their electricity consumption seems a little silly. reply kps 17 hours agorootparentThe immediate context was an objection to WFH, not driving. reply kylebenzle 18 hours agorootparentprevThe denser the housing the more efficient in almost every way. Even if we had the money the world already doesn't have enough resources for everyone to get a single family home with solar panels, batteries, a tesla and a well, most will have to live in dense cities to survive. reply Neil44 18 hours agoparentprevAs long as aggressively promoting WFH doesn't penalise people for whom this is not an option. reply lm28469 17 hours agorootparentOK but then how many people are penalised by having to own a car? reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparentA lot of people simply can't work from home due to lack of space, noise and interruptions, etc. It's a lot easier to buy a cheap used car than uproot your entire living situation to a new home where you can WFH, which you also might not be able to afford. Not to mention you probably already own your car for other things like getting groceries. reply lm28469 29 minutes agorootparentBefore covid I went to the office everyday, by bike, or public transport, owning a car where I live is a more of an annoyance than anything. If we cared we could solve the bulk of problem somewhat easily, the 80/20 rule still applies but you could drastically reduce the number of cars on the road. Of course if all you care about is short term personal convenience and individualism then we're doomed, but if you care just a tiny bit about optimisation, pollution, long term sustainability, well being, the solutions are painfully obvious reply Spooky23 17 hours agorootparentprevThere are lots of ways to adapt to that. For example, you can have localized telework centers or subsidize co-working spaces. The current situation is far worse. People are literally trapped in a cycle of poverty or bad work experience because they cannot get to a suburban office park for want of a car. WFH has lots of limitations. Distribute work geographically and you can lower costs and improve outcomes. Why have accounts payable reps in New Jersey in a giant office when I could rent a small office in Maine or Kentucky for 80% less and pay the workers 30% less, without the complexities of offshoring. reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> subsidize co-working spaces These are called offices. Look, I WFH and I love it. But in the process I probably quintupled my emissions. I might be able to get that down to quadrupling with an EV and full solar array. But the realities of suburban/rural living are simply much harsher on the environment. reply lm28469 27 minutes agorootparent> But in the process I probably quintupled my emissions. What process ? WFH doesn't mean you have to move out of the city and build a huge house with all the modern bells and whistles reply Spooky23 9 hours agorootparentprevThe stated problem is some people can’t effectively work from home. My goal is to get the best candidates. My reasons are selfish - I can get great people cheap if they have circumstances problematic for other employers. So I got a 5 desks in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and about 15 people in that region utilize it. Everyone wins: i spend almost nothing. The employee has a great job, doesn’t have to drive 90 minutes, and doesn’t have to disrupt the family life. reply weweweoo 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's not the realities, but people's choices. One can live in rural area and limit driving to the absolute minimum necessary, and build a small house heated using renewables rather than a big house heated with fossil fuels. Similarly, lots of city people increase their carbon footprint through excess consumption and travel. I guess ecological rural living may not be easy if you enjoy lots of social activities. For an introvert like me it wouldn't be a problem. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> One can live in rural area and limit driving to the absolute minimum necessary, and build a small house heated using renewables rather than a big house heated with fossil fuels You’re still consuming massive resources in transporting materials to a low-density location. Unless you’re living completely off the land, de-densifying is far more impactful. (Consider how much land alone would be converted from nature to human use by spreading out the populations of New York and Los Angeles.) reply paulryanrogers 15 hours agorootparentprevCo-working spaces are distinct from traditional offices because they mix workers of so many different employers. Sometimes as granular as to the desk. This can significantly reduce or eliminate commutes. reply blueflow 17 hours agorootparentprevBlue collar jobs usually cannot be done from home... reply dleeftink 16 hours agorootparentprevHow about a place closer to home than a daily two hour commute? WFH and remotely logging hours doesn't mean working from your home in the strict sense, just a place that works for you with a shorter commute (whether that's your attic, local library or other type of workspace). I also wonder whether owning a car just 'for groceries' is that commonplace? reply r00fus 16 hours agorootparentprevI'd say the same for the reverse. Except that has been the history of office work for generations except we have the technology and economy where that isn't required. reply stonogo 17 hours agorootparentprevIt not only already does, it always will. reply tristor 18 hours agoparentprevSame here, been WFH since 2015, however I did do a lot of driving for other reasons previously. Since 2022 however I drive less than 7000 miles a year, and that includes a family road trip each year for the holidays that is ~2500 miles round-trip. One thing that bothers me is that insurance is getting extremely expensive where I live, even though I hardly drive and my car is garaged year-round due to the greatly increasing amounts of vehicle theft. I've considered a few times just not having a car and renting a car regularly, but services like ZipCar have pretty much died out and I don't live in a city center where they still sometimes exist. I drive on average just once per week, if I could that for a fully-laden cost of less than $500/mo it would be cheaper to rent than buy, but it doesn't seem like there's anyone that's captured this market. reply LeifCarrotson 16 hours agorootparentI can call my insurance agent and take a vehicle (seldom-used winter beater truck in the summer, or seldom-used summer car in the winter) on or off the road at a whim, prorating my premium appropriately. That sucks for usability, but I wonder if there exists a market for 'smart insurance' where I can log into a webpage or use an app to put it on or off a car. But the real answer, I think, is getting a quote for your actual mileage. You're driving 7000 miles a year and being lumped into a risk group with people who are driving two or three times as much: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm Unfortunately, I've found that mileage doesn't have a big impact on my premiums. reply njarboe 17 hours agorootparentprevDo you have full coverage on your car? You should consider dropping that. Vehicle theft should not be increasing liability costs that much. reply tristor 17 hours agorootparentI am required to carry full coverage because my car is financed. Even when I've paid a car off, I still carry full coverage, because liability-only policies tend to not help in my past experiences mostly due to the absolute epidemic of uninsured/unregistered cars on American roadways. reply pfdietz 16 hours agoparentprevIndeed, we need personal aircars! reply MisterTea 18 hours agoparentprev> It's absurd we are not aggressively promoting WFH or hybrid WFH at the national level. It's absurd that tech people seem to think that WFH is applicable to everyone. I'm in a shop right now and have to touch machinery on a daily basis. So do the rest of the workers. reply omginternets 17 hours agorootparentSurely the OP's point is that a significant proportion of the workforce can WFH, and that this would have a significant environmental impact... reply faeriechangling 15 hours agorootparentprevJealousy politics are indeed an obstacle but the societal insistence that everybody needs to pollute the environment because some people have to pollute the environment is nonsense. reply michael9423 16 hours agoparentprev\"we need to prioritize driving less.\" I doubt the majority of the world population wants to be included in your \"we\". reply faeriechangling 15 hours agorootparentI’m not so convinced that people are so foolish. Maybe they don’t want to be the first ones to stop driving but I think most people recognize the problems we face as a society. reply michael9423 14 hours agorootparentIndia, Africa and China are just waking up economically. Hundreds of millions of people waiting to buy cars to improve their quality of life by being more mobile. reply matsemann 18 hours agoparentprevYeah, the big focus on exhausts from cars has hidden lots of other problems they lead to. EVs don't solve most of these problems. The cars are heavier, hence their tires spread even more micro plastic. reply c0nfused 18 hours agorootparentWhile micro plastics are a problem climate change is the train coming down the tracks at civilization as a whole. I agree the EVs don't fix everything they are in theory buying us time to make the choices that get rid of cars in the long term. reply kiba 18 hours agorootparentThey should be buying EVs for those who needs them such as rural area. For the rest of us, our quality of life would improve if we get rid of cars and densify areas. reply matsemann 18 hours agorootparentprevI just wish the 4 billion we subsidize EVs with every year here in Norway were put to other use instead. Could habe built a new metro line every year for that amount of money. Which would have had a much larger long term effect. reply c0nfused 18 hours agorootparentThat's the dream here in the states too. Our issue is that we have built our cities as enormous suburbs with such a low density that rail/transit isn't viable from a cost/person perspective. We tend to think of public transit a a business rather than as a service and our tax payers don't want to spend billions on not driving especially as our cost per mile is insane[0]. So, for the states EVs are basically the only way for us to ease out of 4000+sqft home on 4 acres and a 40 mile car commute and back into an built environment that does not require a car for all trips [0] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-26/the-u-s-g... reply renewiltord 16 hours agoparentprevThat's 3000 miles too many. Consider cutting that down to zero. I suggest an e-bike, a normal bike, or just walking. Think about how many tire particles you put into the environment, especially if you didn't just stick to controlled city environments and went to the woods. Our plant and animal life will thank you. reply UniverseHacker 16 hours agorootparentConsider all of the shoe tread debris you create by walking or riding bicycles. Consider only walking barefoot, or just stay in one place and stop moving your body around. Judgemental strangers on the internet will thank you. reply kylebenzle 18 hours agoparentprevWe could replace all the synthetic rubber with home grown natural rubber right now. It would last longer and be of much higher quality but it would double prices or more, so instead we burn oil and dump pulverized plastics into our waterways, because its a little cheaper. reply SoftTalker 18 hours agorootparentThen the obvious answer is to price those externalities into the cost of the synthetic rubber tires. Of course then you'll have a lot of lower-income folks driving around on dangerously worn-out tires because they can't afford new ones. By the way I thought it was the synthetic rubber tires that lasted longer, but certainly possible that I'm mistaken. reply AJ007 17 hours agorootparentYes, synthetic should be more durable than natural rubber. Once the petrochemical supply is exhausted, or what is left is extremely expensive to extract, they won't be able to afford new tires either. (Tires, and personal passenger vehicles, could be some of the least important of the \"missing\" consumption from the loss of petrochemicals.) reply bennyhill 18 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, but wouldn't using only natural rubber result in a huge amount of land clearing and then a monoculture, similar to the environmental issues of palm oil? reply SoftTalker 17 hours agorootparentWe have a lot of already-cleared farmland that sits vacant or could be used more profitably. I don't know if it's suitable for growing rubber trees, but I doubt we'd have to do a lot of clearing. reply oivey 15 hours agorootparentIt’s not. We use synthetic rubber because natural rubber is expensive and can’t be cultivated easily in the US. reply Nasrudith 17 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately there are all sorts of other material properties to worry about beyond raw durability/'quality'. Natural rubber tires react quite poorly to hydrocarbons and greases, let alone traction issues. And that is putting aside the logistical issues with getting sufficient natural rubber. There may be some sort of \"compromise\" material that could be developed that would lack the toxicity or microplastics issues without compromising safety, but I'm going to defer to experts in that field. reply bilsbie 16 hours agoparentprevI say we let adults make their own decisions on how much they want to drive. reply p_j_w 16 hours agorootparentAs long as they're willing to pay the actual costs borne by the rest of us for their decisions, sure, why not? The problem is they're generally not, and when you suggest that they need to, they have a very not adult-like temper tantrum. reply polygamous_bat 16 hours agorootparentprevDoes your libertarian attitude extend to your neighbors burning tires in their backyards? Individual actions can incur communal costs. “Freedom” doesn’t mean “freedom from the consequence of your actions.” reply bch 16 hours agorootparentThis, (and/)or start charging for the true costs (externalities). reply pie420 16 hours agorootparentprevLet’s not control others. If people want to use lead paint, let them. Let’s not control others. If people want to use leaded gasoline, let them. Let’s not control others. If people want to build with asbestos, let them. Let’s not control others. If people want to cook with trans fats, let them. Let’s not control others. If people want to do fentanyl, let them. the entire basis of society and progress is controlling others for the prosperity of the human race. reply bilsbie 16 hours agorootparentThe world would be a sad place when we we need to apply for a permit to visit family. That’s where all this ends up. Good intentions and all that. reply 2024throwaway 16 hours agorootparentThat is one hell of a leap. That slope must be very slippery indeed. reply njarboe 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Driving is an amazing. It allows everyone huge amounts of freedom in what they do and who they spend time with. Having lots of shops and workplaces near your home is great and should be encouraged, but we should try and find ways to keep the freedom of personal transportation and reduce the impact it has. Lots and lots of tunnels, better tires, electric cars use brakes much less and could get to almost zero, etc. reply ramblenode 16 hours agorootparentThat's basically how driving was sold to the American public in the 1950s. The reality is that transportation is a network, and driving is only efficient for the individual driver at a relatively low level of density. The bigger the population and the more people who drive, the less efficient the network. If you try to keep the network efficient, then driving acts as a constraint on the rest of societal development and you end up with sprawl and long transit times. Driving doesn't scale beyond a certain point (as you know, by suggesting expensive tunnels). As for the freedom aspect, to get anywhere in an American suburb-styled society you are required to own and maintain a car, a major personal expense. When you travel somewhere, you have to find a place to safely park your car, and your person is tethered to where you park your car, usually needing to return there in a reasonable amount of time the same day, or else paying for long-term parking. You have to have a license from the government to use the only practical source of transportation, and if you don't have that license, you are effectively shut off from any autonomy. Cars certainly do increase the freedom to move and experience the world in some ways, but that is at the cost of other freedoms. reply lm28469 17 hours agorootparentprev> freedom It's also stupidly expensive for most people, and made us develop a car centric approach to a lot of things, a lot of problems it solves are problems we wouldn't have if we designed our cities in other ways Replacing the current 2b vehicles on earth by electric vehicles will buy us a few years at best but it won't solve the deeper issues reply mitchbob 17 hours agorootparentprev> freedom Including the freedom to spend the equivalent of weeks every year stuck in traffic: https://thecitypaperbogota.com/bogota/bogota-tops-tomtoms-gl... reply Spivak 17 hours agorootparentTravel time is travel time, you would have a similar tally on the train/bus/walking. This isn't really the best argument against cars because people buy cars because it's a massive improvement on \"waiting for the bus time.\" reply thefaux 16 hours agorootparentI don't really understand this statement. Do you genuinely think that there is no difference in QOL between a 30 minute drive on a packed freeway vs a 40 minute walk on pleasant streets? Personally, I'd leave 10 minutes earlier and choose the latter every time. Even better, walking time is remarkably consistent. On foot, I essentially never have to worry about my travel being disrupted by road conditions which means I know when I arrive based on when I leave which is not the case at all with driving which has a much higher variance. reply ben-schaaf 16 hours agorootparentprevTime on the bike or walking is time spent improving health and well being. Time on the train can be productive, relaxing or entertaining. There is an enormous difference between these and the stress of driving. reply soperj 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's really not. You can actually do stuff waiting for the bus, or riding the bus. You can't really do much while driving. Walking is incredibly good for you, unlike driving. reply marcosdumay 17 hours agorootparentprev> Driving is an amazing. As long as everyone isn't forced to do it at the same place at the same time. Driving less goes a long way into making it more amazing. reply trgn 17 hours agorootparentDriving is great for the one-offs and other people aren't doing it. It's awful anytime else. reply persnickety 16 hours agorootparentprev> keep the freedom of personal transportation and reduce the impact it has We've had the answer for longer than we've had cars. Put on the helmet and pedal away! reply NewJazz 17 hours agorootparentprevDriving is an amazing. Your car brain got so excited about driving that it forgot basic grammar. (It's okay, it happens to me too sometimes). reply latortuga 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, please may I have some more of the unmitigated freedom to pay a ballooning portion of household income toward a depreciating asset; the absolute pleasure of having to buy government-mandated insurance; the utter relief of participating in one of the most dangerous daily activities; the free choice of being able to salt the earth with CO2 emissions and tire particulate matter; and who can forget the ~socialized~ capitalist federal- and state-built roadways that cities are going bankrupt trying to keep up with funding. reply lonelyasacloud 16 hours agorootparentNot to mention the sheer joy of listening to the roar of traffic pretty much everywhere, the cost of sound insulation so that I can sleep at night, the increased medical costs (pollution/obesity/stress), drive through litter, being bullied off the road if you're not in a car, and having to either give way to metal box owners or cross roads at locations intended purely to enable them to move freely. All the while watching endless ads that'd make the Marlboro man blush - endless empty roads and vehicles that wouldn't harm a fluffy bunny. Yep, freedumb. reply alamortsubite 16 hours agorootparentprev> Driving is an amazing. It allows everyone huge amounts of freedom Your definition of \"everyone\" excludes children, many seniors, people who can't afford a personal vehicle, and those who can't drive due to disabilities or health conditions. You're also naively ignoring that just the infrastructure needed to support cars on its own often greatly impinges on these groups' freedom of movement. reply trgn 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is definitely and/and. Cars are best for the stuff they show on the commercials; driving to the weekend cabin, hauling a thing, impressing a date, going on the family trip. So yeah, keep the driving, but for the one-off things where they are great at. That's really the only time when a car represents freedom. They are not freedom when it's the only option to get a loaf of bread or get to your office. reply selimnairb 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] Cars are our worst invention, second only to agriculture. reply jjtheblunt 15 hours agorootparent [–] did you forget gunpowder and religion? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I've spent my recent career leading engineering teams of 10+ to ship world class products. Expertise in managing product timelines, overseeing architectural design/implementation, & keeping companies ahead of their competition. As an IC, I love to dig deep into technical problems, ship products with full autonomy/ownership, and make products look beautiful (see some old work at www.beaver.digital). I have been getting wonderful offers from great companies but am still on the job market because I suffer from an unfortunate health condition that makes my sleep rather erratic. My working efficiency is still exceptional, energy levels are great, and my output is the best it’s ever been, but I sometimes start work as late as 10:30am pst which is unacceptable for most companies. Anyways, if this won’t be a problem for your team I’m happy to hear from you. I’ll be happy to make accommodations for you if you’re willing to make this one for me.

So now my plan is to get a full time job to pay the bills and, in the free time, get up to date with the recent literature and in a few years be able to join an AI research team. reply vishalontheline 15 hours agoprevDesired Positions: Technical Project / Program / Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Full-Stack Engineer Location: San Diego, CA Remote or Hybrid: Yes Willing to relocate: No Technologies: Elixir (Phoenix), Ruby (on Rails), Python (FastAPI), JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Linux, Heroku, AWS, Jira, Trello, MS Project, Slack etc..

By starting from the bottom and working my way up to a Senior Director level position, I have been able to get a unique view of how a company functions while being part of the decisions and mistakes a company makes as it goes from being on the brink of bankruptcy to growth on a global scale. My initiatives to continuously automate as much work as possible, re-evaluate working processes, and improve redundant systems allowed the company to grow at an exponential rate while not increasing headcount. The extra capital this saved us allowed us to easily handle industry-wide downturns without having to cut any of the workforce or pull back on any projects or goals. I am fluent in Python 3+ and don't have much desire to write anything else at this point.

While you were spending your time being \"advertised to, encouraged, and expending time and resources adopting their project\" they did, you know, actual work to create and maintain said project. Let's not kid ourselves here. You chose to use their project. You are free to use any other one that fulfills your needs, fork an existing one, or, hell, create one yourself. Nobody is putting a gun up to your head and saying \"you must use this project or else\". Strictly as a consumer, you have absolutely zero pull on what a project or its maintainers do, and you shouldn't delude yourself in thinking otherwise just because you expended a modicum of effort to use a project. In short, get over yourself. Your time commitment is many magnitudes smaller than theirs. reply imiric 17 hours agorootparentAs someone involved in open source, both as a user and maintainer, this is a very user hostile position to take. For one, respect your users. If you made the decision to publish an OSS project, acknowledge that you can become a dependency in someone's workflow. While your users likely aren't supporting you financially, their usage of your projects, feedback, testing, indirect support and community building, all contribute to the success, and any status, fame, or potential employment that might come your way because of it. Saying that you don't owe your users anything and mistreating them like you suggest is just a dickish move, and earns you no good will in the open source community. These are relationships that you should cherish, not look down upon because you get to call the shots about your project. Everyone has difficult moments and perpetual unpaid work shouldn't be expected from anyone, but if you feel like abandoning a popular OSS project, the polite thing to do is to communicate this with your users, and find someone else willing to continue maintenance. reply mynameisvlad 15 hours agorootparentThere is a massive gap between what would be nice (what you describe) and what should be expected (the rest of the thread) from maintainers. While a smooth exit and transfer of ownership (and politeness in general) is nice to have, it should not be the norm out of a free product with no implicit or explicit support offered. And no, publishing a project is not an implicit offer of support, as much as some might want it to be. If someone chooses to offer something (whether that’s updates, support or anything else), awesome, but it should not be expected or demanded out of anyone you don’t pay money for. Heaping on responsibilities to people just because they created, maintained, or contributed to a project is just a recipe for burnout and eventual deterioration of a project. Sometimes, the user is wrong. If the user is demanding and expecting things out of a free project created and maintained by volunteers doing it in their own spare time, then they are a shitty user. You may choose to interact with them out of the kindness of your heart, but it should not be the norm or expectation from every maintainer out there. reply imiric 13 hours agorootparentI agree that expecting, or worse―demanding―, a specific behavior from a maintainer is out of place. But at the same time, categorically refusing to meet a user request or expectation just because they're not paying you implies that you prioritize paying users, which corrupts how the software is built. It means that you consider people who use your software for free (gratis) to not have any voice in how the software is developed, but paying users do. This is a very reductionist point of view of OSS to provide only the barebone essential freedoms of the license you chose, without taking into account the people using the software, and the community that can develop around it. If money is the main issue, there are ways to monetize OSS projects so that paying users effectively subsidize support and requests of non-paying users. But regardless if that system is in place or not, all users deserve a fair treatment, and maintainers should put in _some_ effort to do the right thing. In the context of Neofetch, a popular OSS project, the right thing would've been to not ghost the community, announce your eventual departure, and start the discussion of finding a new maintainer. These are not unreasonable expectations, and require minimal effort from the maintainer. This person decided to abandon software development altogether, and that's fine, but this way of handling things would ensure that users would think twice about using any of their software in the future. reply mynameisvlad 13 hours agorootparent> These are not unreasonable expectations Forcing someone to do work they don’t want to do just because they are a maintainer is extremely unreasonable. > and require minimal effort from the maintainer. I don’t think you understand the time and effort that finding a new maintainer takes. It is far from “minimal” and this mindset that it is somehow expected and/or required to leave a project is exactly my point. > I agree that expecting, or worse―demanding―, a specific behavior from a maintainer is out of place. > In the context of Neofetch, a popular OSS project, the right thing would've been to not ghost the community, announce your eventual departure, and start the discussion of finding a new maintainer. You literally just placed expectations and demands onto someone. Neofetch being a popular or well used project does not somehow make this ok. If someone doesn’t want to continue giving their time contributing or maintaining a project, then that is entirely their decision to make in whatever method they deem right. It’s not your or anyone else’s place to tell another person how they should leave a project they no longer want to be a part of. Nothing in being a user of said project gives you that right or privilege and making it sound like “the right thing to do” is just putting lipstick on an obvious demand. > and that's fine The rest of your comment makes it pretty clear that you do not actually think it is fine. reply imiric 12 hours agorootparent> I don’t think you understand the time and effort that finding a new maintainer takes. It is far from “minimal” and this mindset that it is somehow expected and/or required to leave a project is exactly my point. If a community of users exists, it takes no effort to communicate your desire to depart the project. If there are active contributors besides the lead maintainer (Neofetch had 206, most of them, granted, with minor contributions), starting a discussion to consider one or several people who could take over takes _minimal_ effort. Many projects do this all the time. It also takes minimal effort to mention the project in one of several maintainers-wanted lists/sites. The difficult thing, as pointed out by a comment in an adjacent thread, is to handover the trust in the project that existing users had to someone you presumably don't trust. As the xz situation showed, this can easily be exploited. Ultimately, if no suitable replacement can be found, then sure, shut the project down. My point is that it's not unreasonable to expect some effort before making this decision. > You literally just placed expectations and demands onto someone. I'm sleepy and sedated, so might not be fully congruent. :S I probably should've prefaced that first line with \"unreasonable expectations\". But to save us both some time, all I'm saying is that project maintenance involves more than just releasing code as open source. It's fine for a user, paying or not, to have some basic expectations of how the project is maintained, beyond the freedoms they have from the software license. I consider communication as one of those basic expectations, and in my opinion, the author of Neofetch failed to meet them. I am allowed to judge them for it, and you are allowed to disagree. reply bee_rider 19 hours agoparentprevIf you transfer your project, you have to find somebody that you trust enough to transfer over the personal trust that a huge group of people have put on you, to them. That is an unbelievably high barrier. The existing mechanism is for people to fork the project and move on. This is much better, because it doesn’t require the previous maintainer to endorse anything. Your suggestion puts probably the hardest social task this sort of project could have, on somebody who is in the process of giving up on it. A succession strategy could be designed while the project is going along well and healthy, but at the end, this is a recipe for disaster. reply rwmj 19 hours agoparentprevIs this sarcastic?

Sort of a way of “super liking” a repo while also making sure a copy of it exists that I can come back to later. Eventually I found that having a bunch of forked repos that I wasn’t touching and which became stale quickly only cluttered my GitHub profile, so I removed them from my profile. Instead what I do now when I find repos that I like is I run a command on my server that adds the repo to a queue for cloning and then the server clones the repo without me having to keep the terminal open and without having to keep a specific tmux session or anything either. It works great. The queue system I use is called task spooler https://viric.name/soft/ts/ It’s available in packages on most systems. For example: - https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/ts - https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/task-spooler On some systems it is installed as a binary named “ts” but on some other systems they install it as “tsp” to avoid conflicting with a different binary also called “ts”. So on my systems I use it as tsp when installed as such and if it’s installed as “ts” then I create an alias named “tsp” that I use, so that I always use it as “tsp” regardless of what it’s installed as on the system. reply DavidPiper 21 hours agorootparentprevI fork instead of Star when I want to make sure a thing can't suddenly disappear off GitHub when I want to come back to it at a later date. reply shiomiru 20 hours agorootparentprevIt is indeed often used as an amplified star.
