    "originBody": "Tech Industry Cyber Security South Korean telecom company attacks customers with malware — over 600,000 torrent users report missing files, strange folders, and disabled PCs News By Jowi Morales published 23 hours ago ISP sends malware to hundreds of thousands of customers to stop them from using a file-sharing service. Comments (18) (Image credit: JTBC) Korean news organization JTBC recently discovered through an in-depth investigation that KT Corporation, one of the largest telecom providers in South Korea, deliberately infected over 600,000 users with malware over their use of torrent services. The issue began in May 2020 when Webhard, a Korean cloud service provider, was inundated with user complaints of unexplained errors. The company discovered that its Grid Program, which relies on BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing, had been compromised. An anonymous representative of Webhard said, “There is a suspicion of a hacking attack on our grid service. It’s very malicious, interfering with it.” (Image credit: JTBC) Upon further investigation, the company noted that all affected users had KT as their internet service provider. The representative added, “Only KT users have problems. What the malware does on the user’s PC is to create strange folders or make file invisible. It completely disables the Webhard program itself. In some cases, the PC itself was also disabled because of it, so we reported it.” Police officials acted on the information and discovered it came from KT’s own data center south of Seoul. The authorities say that KT may have violated South Korean laws, including the Protection of Communications Secrets Act and the Information and Communications Network Act. They’ve since identified and charged 13 individuals, including KT employees and subcontractors directly connected to the malware attack last November, but the investigations continue today. According to the news report, KT said it directly planted the malware on its customers that use Webhard’s Grid Service, as it was a malicious program and that “it had no choice but to control it.” However, the main problem here wasn’t Webhard’s use of the BitTorrent protocol but the installation of malware on customer computers without consent. Webhard and KT have fought in the past over the latter’s use of its Grid Service. The former says that it’s saving tens of billions of Korean Won by allowing its users to use peer-to-peer services to store and transfer data instead of storing it on its servers. On the other hand, the massive number of Grid Service users is straining KT’s network, and the two companies went to court to resolve the issue. The judiciary actually ruled in favor of KT. It said that Webhard didn’t pay KT network usage fees for its peer-to-peer system and didn’t explain to its users how the Grid Service works in detail. Therefore, it wasn’t unreasonable for KT to block Webhard’s network traffic.

(Image credit: JTBC) But instead of blocking IP addresses, KT nuked Grid Service users with malware. Unfortunately, most of them were individuals, not businesses or corporations, and they had no idea what was going on. KT’s move to send and install malware on hundreds of thousands of Grid Service users seems like a financial move, as it likely just wanted to stop them from continually using Webhard’s BitTorrent file-sharing service. But whatever KT’s intentions were, this move led to missing files and damage to customer PCs. Its users were more than just inconvenienced; they likely had to deal with computer problems that stemmed from the company’s actions.

Reply Grobe Ok, I read the article and I'm left with some (maybe non-relevant) questions Does the ISP take this action for all kind of torrent or only those used by a specific service/software ?

ISPs try to charge companies insane fees because customers want to connect to their servers. Company decides to use peer-ro-peer instead so the ISP starts installing spyware on customer computers. Makes me wonder where this myth of \"good Korean internet\" even came from if everything ends up so bandwidth constrained. Is it because all the customers and services are in the same city so it appears low latency? I hope everyone involved in this catches criminal charges, all the way up the chain. Completely unacceptable behavior. reply yongjik 19 hours agoparentSouth Korea at least used to have blazingly fast internet infrastructure. Of course that didn't make up for shitty banking websites that you could only use by running Internet Explorer and allowing it to install \"security plugins\" that hook into Windows kernel, but at least the internet was fast, and it did give Korea an edge for its IT industry. That was, I think, about twenty years ago. I've been living in the US for 10+ years so I'm not very well informed, but basically the ISP industry ended up in an oligopoly where everybody's friends with the government, and they kept raising prices while neglecting infra upgrade. Until nobody can call Korea's internet \"fast\" any more. Now all we've got is shitty websites.

It got wildly popular in the west to a point where the server started lagging and was down frequently, so they set up a second one. Then the cheating got out of hand so they added some anti-cheat software, and shortly after they wanted people to verify their identity by sending a scan of their id/passport. This is when 99% of players left. reply sixothree 1 hour agorootparentHonestly I think the only way to get rid of cheating in online games is to use some form of identity vetting.

And the reality today is that it'll seem practically backwards to a Westerner - i.e. tons of paper forms and bureaucracy for things like banking and rental applications. reply sbarre 7 hours agorootparentI was in Japan in 2008 and the cellphones there were from the future! I remember being awed seeing people watching TV on the subway on their phones.. There was a bunch of infrastructure and services provided by the actual phone company NTT DoCoMo (as opposed to generally over the Internet) that let people watch shows, play games, shop, etc.. all on their mobile devices. Stuff that we do now every day, but this was almost 20 years ago. They also had phones built for this purpose, like ones that had rotating screens that went into landscape mode (imagine holding a \"T\"-shaped device) for watching TV.. So it certainly felt like they were ahead, but you're right, it was a very different approach with everything coming from the phone company itself, and one that wasn't set up to stay competitive or stay ahead.. reply Sakos 6 hours agorootparentOther examples of this are the Satellaview for the SNES and the 64DD for the Nintendo 64, both of which were only launched in Japan. The Satellaview let you download games and the 64DD let you browse the internet. Apparently they'd also planned to have multiplayer online gaming for the 64DD, but that was never released. reply krageon 2 hours agorootparentprevOn an infrastructure level Japan is literally not even in the same reality as the US. The infrastructure works, everything is clean and works, the toilets are usable and good. The mobile internet infrastructure is honestly fine and most likely better than what you'd be able to get in the US (especially as a foreigner). It will not seem backwards to a \"Westerner\" today. The only place where you'd really encounter forms as a human being is in government interactions (and possibly banking), which is not unusual or even particularly backwards. reply seoulmetro 14 hours agorootparentprevKorean internet is still extremely fast.

The ops must've set the machines up with a /dev/shm ramdisk or similar for uploads. There were no SSDs those days, so no way to even write at 125MB/sec, unless you had an unreasonably large Raid-0 array of WD Raptor HDDs, also possible. reply petre 13 hours agorootparentprevHow can prices decerease when every provider is a chaebol in bed with the government? reply AlchemistCamp 12 hours agorootparentThe government could make upgrading the infrastructure and lowering prices a priority. reply godelski 15 hours agoparentprevIt's also worth noting the SK has some pretty terrible laws around the internet in general. Distribution of porn is illegal there and they do their best to block it from outside. They are pretty big on cyber defamation and will go after people who make fun of government officials[0]. They have a comparatively low internet freedom score because they do things like fine middle schoolers for having anti-government websites and the president pursues legal action against YouTubers[1]. It's pretty interesting when coming from the west where all the problems are often spoken about in the open. I mean the great American past time is complaining about the government. But in SK there's a lot more trust of the government and similarly, a lot more control by them. And it is a fairly tight knit group and there's only a few companies that dominate the country.

Incorrect, it's yet another incorrect meme. Legal pornography is always possible in South Korea, and while the actual threshold varied over time (because you know, there is no objective metric for them anyway so it has to be a function of the approximate social consensus), legal pornography is not necessarily \"milder\" than illegal pornography distributed via blocked websites. (EDIT: incorrectly put \"stronger\" there...) The South Korean treatment of pornography was extremely distorted mainly because of the rampant copyright violation over pornographic materials produced elsewhere. That blocked virtually all attempts to sell legal pornography and profit from it, why would you pay when you already have tons of free porns out there. Technically speaking, a large portion of the current adult population should have been found guilty if foreign producers could sue them, and I can tell you that the name of a certain blocked but still popular pornographic website [1] has became a household name for many males in their 20s and 30s! And here is where the SK law's technical distinction between legal pornography and illegal obsence material turned out to be handy. Since those websites distributed pornography illegally, you can just consider them obscene and thus exempted from the copyright protection (!). I really hate this situation and like to see the radical change, but I can also see that it would become a massive and uncontrollable international affair otherwise. So that's why those websites had to be banned (to signal that it is indeed illegal), but the ban itself is so weak that it can be easily bypassed (more effective ban would be harder to justify). [1] I don't like to quote its exact name, but as a hint, it is often followed by \"꺼라 turn sth off\". reply skhr0680 9 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s a stretch to argue that porn is “de facto” illegal in South Korea reply jagrsw 8 hours agorootparentprevThank you for taking time to write this explanation, but otoh it's a lot of words to say that it's \"kinda illegal\" reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agorootparent\"Kinda\" may mean so many things that \"kinda illegal\" is as useful as no information, hence all these elaborations. They also matter for the eventual resolution. reply jagrsw 6 hours agorootparentI beg to differ. Using \"Incorrect\" to counter the statement that distribution is illegal implies it's largely untrue. While a distinction between \"illegal\" and \"de facto illegal\" exists, your own explanation doesn't support such a strong rebuttal. You acknowledge that legal pornography, while technically possible, faces significant hurdles due to rampant piracy and legal loopholes. This creates a situation where accessing legal pornography is difficult and impractical for most, making the initial statement, that distribution is effectively illegal, more accurate than your initial \"Incorrect\" suggests. reply AtlasBarfed 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's a lot easier to buy into a government when the most horrid example of one in modern history (arguable, I get it) is only 100 miles to the north with a huge amount of artillery pointed at you. reply somenameforme 12 hours agorootparentSouth Korea has a far crazier history [1] than I think most realize. This [2] is the first president of South Korea, installed by the US, and then eventually ferried off into exile in Hawaii by the US after a revolution, leading the 2nd Republic of Korea. That was followed by coups and all other sorts of great things, including 4 acting presidents that did not serve more than 50 days a piece, eventually leading to the 3rd Republic of Korea which was another dictatorship who then had his dictatorial powers codified in the 4th republic. Then he was assassinated and you get the the 5th republic where the dictator's friend was put in power. Then you get the 6th republic in 1987 (!!) and that's the South Korea we're somewhat more familiar with. Even in modern times, I think most don't realize how wacky Korean politics has been. For instance the president from 2013-2017 (Park Geun-hye, daughter of a former dictator) was involved in some sort of weird cult-like grooming controversy where she was being groomed and controlled by what some media called a 'Korean Rasputin.' She was eventually impeached and imprisoned for corruption/abuse of power, and is now serving decades in prison. And it seems the current president of South Korea has an approval rating in the 30s. So I have no idea how Koreans view their government, but it's really unlike anything I think that we can compare elsewhere. But I suspect \"trust\" and \"integrity\" are not the sort of words that'd be on top.

I do understand it, and I think it is dumb. If it is to the point that it is causing people to kill themselves, it is dumb. This doesn't justify the people harassing others, but rather that the cultural element about getting so involved that leads to such harassment is also dumb. Cultures are hard to change, but at the end of the day it literally is up to people collectively deciding change is needed. There is nothing physical in the way. Habits are hard to change, but not impossible. And we should not excuse harmful behavior by claiming it is simply culture. (There are many elements of Korean culture that are great. But they do not necessarily rely on such a strong notion of reputation.

Note that KT, while relatively recently privatized, is still a national corporation that is considered a critical national asset under the law (thus if the North attacks, KT towers are first priority to be protected by the South's military). So, it is not as if some rogue SME infected its users with malware; it's a national corporation infecting its users over and not even be sorry about it (as in the article). Plenty of other comments detail the strange Active X requirement: The national law had dependency on Internet Explorer/Active X. (I do not know of any developed nation having a national legal dependency on a specific corporation's consumer technology at this scale.) Also, many comments on South Korea's purportedly great infrastructure (albeit two decades ago). There is more to this. Interestingly, if you ask an average Korean, he would say Korea is literally the best nation in IT/internet technology, topping or at least on par with the US. The national propaganda effort that went into forming this collective conscious should not be understated. Even many of the top programmers in South Korea I met strongly believe in this superiority. I wonder if this strong sense of superiority is both (1) preventing SK from improving its actually-lagging tech and (2) act in Dostoevskian-Raskolnikov manners thinking that it is above the law and consensus (\"the best can break the rules and set new ones\"). Whatever the underlying reason may be, there is a serious techno-cultural issue going on in the country. One of the biggest banks in South Korea blacklisted Amazon as a financial scammer because it's Prime subscription renews monthly and customers complained after seeing the renewal charge on their credit cards. The ban was national -- no customer of this bank could buy a product from Amazon unless he calls the bank personally and ask the charge to be approved. Again, the issue wasn't technical. It was cultural. reply ken47 4 hours agoparent> many of the top programmers in South Korea Odd statement.

When you have a market with very high barriers to entry (government regulation + physical infrastructure costs), you can't just start your own internet service provider to undercut existing Korean telecommunications, because you won't make enough money to pay your investment back. reply stephen_g 13 hours agorootparentYes, this is called a ‘natural monopoly’. It’s the case with most infrastructure - basically there is little incentive for a private company to be more efficient than a public utility, since anybody building competing infrastructure is infeasible, but because they want to make profit there is incentive for them to charge more and to cut costs in other ways (like not investing in more than the bare minimum of maintenance). So it generally tends to work out worse for the customers. Unfortunately some people genuinely believe the private sector will always deliver services cheaper and more efficiently than the public sector, so all around the world this mistake keeps being made.

I’d be highly suspicious of the motivations of anyone arguing for this in 2024. reply pessimizer 18 hours agorootparentprevThere's no economic motivation to compete. The motivation is to raise prices slightly, wait for the other two companies to follow suit as a signal, then to raise prices again. If you raise and someone doesn't follow, backtrack to the previous level. This is assuming that they don't just have a meeting and set prices over drinks. reply creer 16 hours agorootparentRight. There are two possible very different strategies - even illegal collusion. There is no reason to compete aggressively until one of the \"several\" chooses to break ranks and do so. And if the one that breaks ranks is tiny, that might still not be enough reason for the others.

For context, the legal situation of network usage in South Korea is something akin to Ajit Pai's wet dream. Network operators are legally empowered to charge troll tolls on both ends of any connection they want. Infrastructure costs are to be borne by literally anyone BUT the network operators. To compound this, South Korea is economically an authoritarian hellscape. Large megacorporations[0] own everything and the government is just a clearinghouse and mediator for their interests. Corruption is so rampant that even administrations run by ardent anti-corruption activists wind up being toppled by rampant and widespread corruption.

I assumed you are talking about the general MITM because you mentioned SNI (because you can't put malwares with just SNI sniffing). The constitution only says about the \"privacy of correspondence\" in the Article 18, and several acts including the Protection of Communications Secrets Act (통신비밀보호법) [1] and the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection (정보통신망 이용촉진 및 정보보호 등에 관한 법률) [2] do have many exceptions that make them legal at least in principle. Indeed, most websites blocked by SK ISPs host either illegal obscene materials (distinct from the legal pornography in the SK legal system) or advocacy for North Korea (illegal due to the National Security Act 국가보안법).

    "originBody": "Home / News 25+ Years of Daily Show Clips Gone as Paramount Axes Comedy Central Site By Jed Rosenzweig June 26, 2024 2:37 PM ET 7 comments The Daily Show circa 2004 (Photo: Comedy Central/The Everett Collection) First on LateNighter: One of the richest repositories of late-night videos is no longer. ComedyCentral.com had been home to clips from every episode of The Daily Show since 1999, and the entire run of The Colbert Report, but as of Wednesday morning, the site is gone. Instead, visitors to the Comedy Central site are greeted with this message: “While episodes of most Comedy Central series are no longer available on this website, you can watch Comedy Central through your TV provider. You can also sign up for Paramount+ to watch many seasons of Comedy Central shows.” Unfortunately for those in search of older episodes of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, neither can be found on Paramount+. Other content lost in the purge were clips and full episodes of other short-lived late-night entries like The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the Chris Hardwick-hosted @midnight (predecessor to After Midnight), and Lights Out with David Spade. This morning’s closure of ComedyCentral.com comes days after two other Paramount-owned sites—MTV.com and CMT.com—also went dark. The move would appear to be part of continued belt-tightening measures at Paramount, which is more than $14 billion in debt, led by losses at Paramount+ and its aging cable networks. The company had been in merger talks with Skydance up until earlier this month when Shari Redstone, Paramount’s largest shareholder, is reported to have killed the deal at the eleventh hour. Those hoping to view clips from Comedy Central’s golden age of late-night programming will still find some clips on YouTube, but nothing near the complete collection that had been available on ComedyCentral.com. UPDATE: On Wednesday evening, a representative from Paramount offered the following statement: “As part of broader website changes across Paramount, we have introduced more streamlined versions of our sites, driving fans to Paramount+ to watch their favorite shows.” Get stories like this in your inbox: Sign up for LateNighter’s free daily newsletter.",

They could have easily auctioned off/sold very old content to someone else but that kind of thinking would be beyond their competency. It's no wonder they go in such huge losses despite of having loyal audience and monopoly over unparalleled content. To this day I cannot get over the fact that there are literally millions documentaries out there made with a lot of love and hard work but only available through DVD or mailing in a check to some dude. Similarly, lot of my favorite music albums are still on cassette tapes and never digitized online by their creators. Fortunately, audience did digitized them nicely and uploaded over to torrents and that's the only way to get them today. Same goes of out of print books and magazines. The producers of this content could have easily digitized it and uploaded over to some marketplace and made at least free coffee money for rest of their lives but surprisingly they just never get around doing it. IMO, it just expresses complete naivety and disregard to importance of their own content. They sure spent days and months of blood and sweat but can't get around to do a last mile of uploading files. There is a huge startup opportunity here for folks who are willing to chase these content and do the last mile on their behalf. reply onion2k 11 hours agoparentThey could have easily auctioned off/sold very old content to someone else.. That assumes they own the exclusive rights to the content. A lot of media has many rights holders (writers, music, etc), and you need to get them all to agree a sale or waive their right in order to sell. That could be expensive because it's involve lots and lots of lawyers.

The reasons people usually justify copyright protection usually centre on rewarding the creators, and I think the right to stop people seeing your work is a harder sell. There is of course a new question of how to set the price, but you could e.g. have an auction of some kind where the highest bid must be accepted.

There are ways of selling things that must be sold, I mentioned auctions, but also you can get independent assessments like in the case of compulsory purchase/eminent domain. I'm sure you could object to some particular solution I propose, but people much smarter than me have studied this kind of game theory extensively and there are a lot of options. The normalization can be the same as licensing is done now, \"per work\", negotiating specific usages needn't change, except that the seller has to allow that each covered work be subject to at least one must-sell auction per e.g. year. They can even win the auction themselves if all the bids are too low. reply eru 10 hours agorootparent> They can even win the auction themselves if all the bids are too low. Does the auction have any teeth at all in that case?

The details will depend on what sort of incentives you want to end up with, but I can't see yet that there isn't some reasonable solution. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentYou can probably come up with some messy compromise. But I'm not sure it's really much better than the existing system which already comes with fair-use constraints.

It's like all these people who basically were in content distribution didn't really wise up to the next, new thing in their business even as it happened in front of their eyes. It's pretty wild that Paramount+/Disney+/Peacock or whatever really struggle to get going, especially given that they provide access to top shows that people really want to watch. It's like having Breaking Bad-esque product but really screwing up when it comes to wanting people to watch it. Given the extent to which the tech behind streaming platforms -- storage, CDNs, tie-ups with telecoms -- have been standardized (and democratized, to some extent) by big players like YouTube and Netflix, you would think that a basic ad supported layer of any of these studio specific platforms would make many multiples of what they actually need to put in to setup a basic platform. The tech's cheap and they already have the content. Most of the older content would be relatively low traffic -- hell, most of these old topical Comedy Central late night shows barely broke a million views when they were new and I don't think jokes about Saddam Hussein and GW's folksy demeanor would click now. How much would it really cost for any big studio to let people view these archives?

The only thing I would add is that it will be interesting to see if professional, medium/high budget, polished, \"produced\" content will remain a stable and significant niche that is distinct from user-generated content. And does the high-production-value content directly compete with low-production value user-created content? And what percentage of a user's consumption it will represent in the future? And does the pool of available time for an individual consumer grow to accommodate both? To put it another way, on some level, all content competes for our time, so it's all in competition. On a different level, a Twitch livestream or TikTok feels like an entirely different category of media from a scripted, high-production-value TV series or movie, and I want both in the world. While traditional publishers may be losing % of daily media consumption - especially in younger age brackets - it's unclear to me where this trend asymptotes. My intuition is that most people will spend some time on \"reels\" or livestreams (or whatever), some time on blockbuster movies, some on Broadway plays, and some time on scripted produced \"TV style\" content. Some will expand their denominator of total time to accommodate additional media sources, others will pick one over the other. It seems there will be a degree of loss of market share as you allude to, but it's unclear how dramatic it will be and where it stabilizes. One thing is absolutely 100% for sure though in my opinion: media preservation should be deeply prioritized, and this news seems like a blow to that. reply soco 11 hours agorootparentYesterday was MTV News deleting their archive, right?

How much would you pay for Netflix a month before that got to be too irritating? $50? $150? The cable companies got to do it for so long because of the natural monopolies of shared physical infrastructure. To be fair, Netflix has been a major internet infrastructure company and there are arguments to be made about their colocation and peering agreements and the natural monopolies there that gave them an early streaming edge, even if the internet in its early days decided those sort of infrastructure agreements shouldn't create or promote monopolies. But beyond that first mover advantage and with the internet's spirit that peering and colocation are regulated fairly and not monopolistically, who would have gave Netflix the right to become the internet's TV monopoly? Would you have voted for a President who made it a campaign promise to make sure that FCC Regulators declared Netflix a legal monopoly in charge of TV streaming? Netflix only really ever had the first mover advantage, and it is probably a good thing in the eventual long term that Netflix didn't win everything. It goes that Netflix's early model while it felt \"perfectly viable\" from a consumer standpoint at the time was obviously not perfectly viable in the long term as a stable situation. The situation we are in now of too many streaming services and cutthroat competition between them maybe isn't sustainable in the long term and certainly doesn't feel \"viable\" to us as consumers. But it certainly seems more viable and preferable than the timeline where you need to send letters to your local Congress representatives in the hopes that they might legislate Netflix price increases and put FCC pressure on Netflix to serve the content they promised to serve. reply michaelt 9 hours agorootparentprev> Netflix paid for the rights to everything and gave access to everybody for a reasonable monthly fee.

I mean, after life + 70 years you already are entitled to other people's work. And a purpose of patents was to get people to release ideas so culture as a whole can grow from them, rather than just keeping them as trade secrets or whatever.

Though I think that’s definitely long enough to consider the option of public domain. reply piltdownman 7 hours agorootparentBrood War is still supported for 2 Reasons #1 - It was LAN first, offline, distributed as Shareware. The forgiving netcode and leniency of distribution ended up with it as a standard install on any Internet Cafe on the planet in the early 00s. It also hit Korean culture at exactly the right moment for it to go so popular as to become a cultural touchpoint. There's a Malcolm Gladwell book in there somewhere - it literally became South Korea's unofficial national sport [1] [1]https://www.wsj.com/video/starcraft-south-korea-unofficial-n... #2 - It was subject to a high-profile remaster as part of Blizzard's \"Classic Games division\", who also did rushed and careless remasters of Diablo 3 and Warcraft 3. The post-release monetization here is quite telling, as it was basically all aimed at the Korean market - popular South Korean StarCraft casters and Children's TV hosts providing the available announcer packs, with the main cosmetic being a chibicartoonised' version of the standard asset pack. reply cornholio 12 hours agorootparentprevThe question is if that stewardship would be ruined by making it free to play the offline, single player version. More generally, would Starcraft2 and similar titles still would have been made if Blizzard knew it only had 10 years to recoup the costs? The copyright lobby frames that question in a profoundly toxic way: are there any marginal profits that can still be milked for our IP portfolio? Of course there are, you can milk pennies even from \"Steamboat Willie\" and Chaplin movies, but that doesn't mean we should have perpetual copyright. What matters is the first few years where 90% of the profits are made, that's what motivates the creator; motivating the creator enough to create and \"promoting the useful arts\" are the purpose of copyright, there is no \"natural\" right to one's ideas and creation. It's a social and political compromise for the good of all. reply piltdownman 8 hours agorootparentWould Blizzard have made Starcraft 2 at all if they had predicted the paradigm-shift towards microtransactions and cosmetics, with the 'game' itself as a loss-leader? This basically forced their hand to make the game free-to-play 7 years into the initial release cycle. Indeed, Blizzard developer Jason Hall previously revealed that a single cosmetic skin for your horse in WoW made more money than the entirety of sales from Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty. The only reason that Starcraft2 is alive at all is the late-cycle introduction of a co-op mode, with microtransaction gated cosmetics, 'commanders', and commentator voicepacks. The online is all but dead, with almost no moderation and stewardship, and plagued by maphackers at all tiers. Even something as basic as the EU MMR brackets for tier ranking are completely broken for nearly a year. reply reaperman 11 hours agorootparentprevFWIW starcraft 2 is free to play, just not “offline”.

For single player games you can just still use and distribute the original, unpatched version. I agree that there is lock-in with online multiplayer games, but it's more on the game servers than the distributed content. So it's only marginally a copyright issue. reply reaperman 11 hours agorootparentI think the person above you meant “If the copyright clock for the original release keeps getting reset every time an update drops…” and you’re talking about “If each updated version gets its own copyright clock upon release”. Copyright (and patent) law generally follows the latter in western nations, but there’s nuance because third-party derivative works can easily contain elements which the original IP owners might feel are “derivatives” of newer innovations from subsequent updates, even if the third-party feels they only based their work on the original release. There’s often a lot of room for reasonable minds to disagree, and it can be difficult to create quality third-party derivatives which avoid any similarities to newer versions of the IP. Think of creating a modern representation of Mickey Mouse. If you create a new version of Mickey Mouse based on the 1928 version in Steamboat Willy, it is difficult to make something that looks relatively contemporary without creating something that looks arguably derivative of the 1953 work “The Simple Things” or the 1940 work “Fantasia”. You could play it safe by using something that looks like a carbon copy of Steamboat Willy, but if your personal artistic vision involves a more contemporary art style, it is understandably difficult to make it unambiguously not a derivative of more recent depictions that are still under copyright. For the Starcraft 2 example - in a thought experiment where the 14 year old “Wings of Liberty” version is now public domain but the 11-year old “Heart of the Swarm” expansion pack and current 9-year old “Legacy of the Void” version of StarCraft 2 are both still under copyright. You want to make a new single-player campaign which takes place after LotV and doesn’t retcon any canon events (many of which are still copyrighted). A careful creator would probably understand they couldn’t make any references to Amon being reborn and defeated by Artanis, because that plot is from the still-copyrighted Legacy of the Void. But would you be able to write a storyline that contains any acknowledgements that Zeratul died? (Zeratul died at the hand of his friend, Artanis, due to some of Amon’s mind-control machinations during that same LotV campaign) I think a creator would have to be careful precisely how their storyline acknowledges Zeratuls death. If its just a few characters generically lamenting the loss of a great/controversial man…probably fine? What if the loss of their friend Zeratul was specified to have occurred “in battle” with no other specifics about the battle? I have no clue. If your storyline includes a tiny quip about Artanis dealing with unspecified guilt/shame over Zeratul’s unspecified death … then that might be technically infringing until LotV falls out of copyright, because some people may feel that it’s specific enough to be definitely derived from the LotV campaign. Note that all three of these similar examples are where a creator does in fact intend to create a derivation of copyrighted materials to create a sequel campaign to the uncopyrighted work which is still “in-canon” with respect to still-copyrighted works. Its just exploring where is the line of “how much derivation can you morally and/or ethically and/or legally get away with before at least one reasonable person genuinely feels you have elements that are unambiguously derived from still-copyrighted content?” For “legally” getting away with something you have to consider the costs of successfully defending yourself against lawsuits from notoriously overly-litigious corporations like Disney/Nintendo/Blizzard. Are you so safe that you could get a summary dismissal or is there any reason it could qualify for awards of punitive damages under Anti-SLAPP laws? reply leni536 8 hours agorootparentYou make good arguments about derivative works on public domain works, where some other derivative works are still in copyright. That's probably difficult to maneuver legally. However if the goal is to just distribute the original public domain work legally, then that's easy and convenient. That alone would be hugely beneficial for games. reply modeless 12 hours agorootparentprevA better fix would be to make copyright last 5 years from the date of publication. I'm betting that for the vast majority of copyrighted content the vast majority of the money is made in the first five years. Copyright is a tax on society. It's not an inalienable right. We keep it for the noble purpose of encouraging authors to create. We don't want them to rest on their laurels. So why are we locking up all of our content for life plus 70? It sounds like a prison sentence. reply WorldMaker 17 minutes agorootparentThe US Founders' Copyright was 7 years if you filed paperwork with a chance to file paperwork for an additional 7 years. I realize that removing the paperwork saved the Government paying for a bunch of jobs and removed a source of accidental \"got ya\" style mistakes of subtly misfiled paperwork. But the paperwork was also meant to help archival purposes. There was even a time that everything filed needed to send a full copy to the Library of Congress, guaranteeing at least one archival copy. (But then publishing far outpaced the Library's physical space and ability to actually archive everything.) We have the technology to automate the jobs out of the paperwork and maybe at least the possibility to build an endowment for digital archives that don't need to worry as much about physical space, so maybe it's also time to think about bringing the paperwork back. reply throwaway48476 9 hours agorootparentprevThe model where copyright has a short automatic duration plus increasing costs to renew every n years is better. reply ryandrake 13 hours agorootparentprevThe copyright cartel would fight that with their lives.

And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.

Curiously, this also happens today. Grocery stores dump a lot of perfectly good food and other goods, and some of them figure that it can't be that someone dumpster-dives instead of buying, therefore they instruct employees to make the trash unusable. Example I've seen first-hand was when throwing away a perfectly good box of laundry detergent, they would open it and spill it into a container of perfectly good fruits and veggies, to make both unusable. I'm not a freegan, but I knew a few at some point, and the stories I heard even in my local area, makes the quote feel 100% believable. reply isomorphic 12 hours agorootparentprevThat particular passage, perhaps; however one can certainly believe growers destroying an abundance to control prices.

Farmers were going bankrupt because there was so much food that they couldn't sell.

It's a tall tale. reply ivanbakel 11 hours agorootparent>Farmers were going bankrupt because there was so much food that they couldn't sell. And the originally-quoted passage is about farmers destroying crops as part of price controls due to overproduction. Could you provide any kind of evidence that the supply of food was evenly shared?

Is that how you understand it?

What's the right threshold? What does it mean to intentionally distribute? Are we going to have protracted court battles over what tracking numbers are accurate or valid? Could those who want to abuse this (big business) simply work around it by making it infeasible to directly measure? And also, the copyleft complication too: If Bob writes a FOSS app with a GPL license, and it becomes popular, but then Bob retires and stops distributing it, does the copyright expire? I don't think the problem being discussed here is insurmountable to solve, I just think the proposed solution opens a whole new can of worms.

No, but if you gave your friend Bob a copy of the painting, he's allowed to copy that copy as much as he wants once you lose the copyright. The original copyright system-- you could only get the full term by extending 14 years in. That's maybe a little early.

Wouldn't this require Bob to outlive the artist by many, many years? My understanding was that copyright extends well past the death of the original creator. EDIT: I'm curious why this is downvoted. Am I incorrect about the length of copyright being decades past the death of the creator? A quick google shows that it extends to 70 years past the life of the creator, [1] which means that it would be quite unlikely that an adult who receives artwork from the creator would live to see the time when it's not under copyright. That is, even if the artist died the next day, it would be 70 years before the copyright expires. 1: https://www.copyright.gov/history/copyright-exhibit/lifecycl... reply mlyle 56 minutes agorootparentI can't downvote you, but I presume that you're being downvoted because your comment seemed to not understand the context of the thread.

I pointed out that's not how copyright works: it has nothing to do with control of physical artifacts. D. You then presumed that the copyright runs for a long time, which contradicts the premise we're talking about in \"A\", and is completely out of left field.

It was very shocking and complete antithesis of property rights in US that are so dearly held. When you think about this, in long run, it might sometimes make sense that future generation can use what previous generation has built. reply kube-system 15 minutes agorootparentNo, those laws are actually a recognition of property rights. Although it has become a popular social media trope to criticize things like adverse possession and \"squatters\" rights as some evil thing, the reason they exist is to protect people from being kicked out of their homes by others exploiting lack of or technicalities in paperwork. Let me give you some examples of why these laws are actually good: * Adverse possession: Imagine someone has been living and maintaining a property for 30 years. They have a single family home, and a driveway. They have a fence around all of their property, and they pay taxes on all of the area. The footprint of the property is exactly as they bought it 30 years ago. Their property is beside a piece of undeveloped, unoccupied, unmaintained land. Today, a land developer purchases the undeveloped land, and they come up with a 100 yr old document that shows that the part of the lot where their driveway is should be part of their lot. The developer then demands that the fence be torn down, and the driveway be given to them, despite the fact that the homeowner bought the property that way, has paid taxes on and maintained that property for 30 years, and nobody has brought this up as an issue in the past 100 years. * \"Squatters\" (really, tenants) rights: Imagine someone rented a home in 2020. They've been paying rent every month since then, on a month-to-month basis, without a written lease. In 2024, the home was sold to an investor who wants to renovate the home and flip it. The investor wants to flip the home as quickly as possible, so they tell the tenant to leave immediately with no notice. They call the police and tell them that someone is squatting in their home. The police tell the owner that they must file for eviction, because they are not capable of determining whether the person living in the home is a \"squatter\" or a tenant. Only a court can do this. Adverse possession is really just a recognition that mistakes made a long time ago shouldn't undo current realities. And \"squatters rights\" are really just a recognition that tenants don't have to defend their own property rights in front of a cop on their front porch at 2am on a Tuesday, they get to defend their rights to their leased property in court. reply fifticon 10 hours agorootparentprevmany countries have variants of this, for many years/since olden times. In my country, it is called 'hævd'. Instinctively, it makes incredibly much sense to me, even more so than property law.

(ie, i respect 'we have been using this for a long time' more than 'our ancestors whipped everyone in the village'). reply throwaway48476 9 hours agorootparentprevIn Europe it was common to have disputes between parties with competing several hundred year old claims. Adverse possession prevents this. reply arrosenberg 12 hours agorootparentprevNo, because thats theft. Its more like if someone took a picture of it and reproduced it for sale. In that case you would likely lose a copyright claim in practice, even if you may have a valid claim in theory. reply themoonisachees 12 hours agorootparentIIRC a part of copyright \"activating\" is publishing the content in the first place, so I don't think GP would have a good case to begin with, not that it matters. reply gnicholas 12 hours agorootparentCopyright does not require public publishing of the content — just \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression\". This would have been accomplished when the painting was created on paper. reply arrosenberg 2 hours agorootparentThis is essentially what I was referring to in the second sentence.

Do I lose the copyright then and someone is permitted to come to my home and take it away? If you paint something, show to a few people, then decide to put it in the drawer, nobody cares. However, if you displayed that painting in galleries for the past 20 years, became semi-famous for it, and then decide to destroy your work, I'd say the public has a stake and a right to say \"no\", to at least make and preserve some copies. On top it being an asshole move to destroy well-known work, even if you have the right to do it. > And copyright is not forever.

Back when Walt Disney started, copyright was 28 years. That was good enough for him to get started producing a media empire. The Berne Convention requires 50 years-why not just go back to that standard instead of the 95 years today? 95 years for works for hire; 70 years + life of the author if they make it themselves. There are very few pieces of work that their authors are still getting benefit from, but could be lost to history. Documentaries have to be censored to remove elements now that require licensing of materials. Walt Disney got his start remaking old works (public domain) into new ones. How many Walt Disney's are we preventing from letting them make better use of Mickey Mouse? We will find that out soon when the trademark Disney has been trying to impose gets challenged.

You take the movie and make a fan cut and sell that, you are added to the chain as a creator, you specify your cut and all the creators continue to get royalties. It doesn't stop piracy but it makes the royalty system transparent and it gives the creation an independent life. It distributes copyright or ownership I guess. Derivatives can also be worked on and sold easily. You could have any third party \"popcorn\" app that had this micro payment within it.

I can immediately see several attacks on this system, but I don't see an attack that blockchain would solve. For example, the fan cut could just not include the original creator's certificate. I don't see how a blockchain would help in uncovering this. Maybe if the blockchain contains the full video files? Then you could use regular plagiarism detection software or ContentID-type systems to find possible rights violations.

That’s not interesting because it’s a false dichotomy. If someone watches youtube and premium costs 5% of their monthly income, it will not be a shocker when they choose to block instead. Similarly, people who view it as a shakedown for payment with the alternative being visual and audio harassment are not going to bend the knee easily.

How a banned account removes access to subscription page so I literally could not unsubscribe to premium, and went through months of fruitless appeal process that was met with automated denial until I was forced to cancel my credit card after being charged 100+ because you're only allowed appeal every 90 days and I didn't want to lose a 10+ year old account. Or how I had paid Google One sub, which was suppose to offer me in person service, only for them to say they have no interaction with the Youtube team. Then I had to do a Take Out to back up all my data on the off chance that Google would ax all my other services for cancelling card.

    "title": "Google Sheets ported its calculation worker from JavaScript to WasmGC",
    "originLink": "https://web.dev/case-studies/google-sheets-wasmgc",
    "originBody": "Thanks for tuning in to Google I/O! Watch content on-demand. web.dev Why Google Sheets ported its calculation worker from JavaScript to WasmGC Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences. Michael Thomas Thomas Steiner Google Sheets is one of the first products at Google to use WasmGC on Chrome. The move was announced in 2022, and the Sheets and Chrome teams partnered on standardization, engineering, and tooling to provide real-time feedback on optimizations. This partnership set a precedent for how engineering teams at Google can effectively work with Chrome to have more Google apps running on WasmGC. The challenge: JavaScript The Google Sheets calculation engine was originally written in Java and launched in 2006. In the early days of the product, all calculation happened on the server. However, from 2013, the engine has run in the browser using JavaScript. This was originally accomplished through Google Web Toolkit (GWT), and later through Java to Closure JavaScript transpiler (J2CL). The JavaScript calculation engine runs in a Web Worker and communicates with the main thread using a MessageChannel. Migrating users from the server to the JavaScript version of the calculation engine (and later from GWT to J2CL) was a major undertaking that required careful validation. To ensure that the JavaScript calculation engine produced precisely the same results as the Java version, the Sheets team developed an internal validation mechanism. This mechanism can process a large corpus of sheets and validate that the results are identical between multiple versions of the calculation engine. The Sheets team uses this tool regularly to validate changes to Sheets. But the team didn't just compare the results of those calculations, they also compared the performance between JavaScript on the client and Java on the server. They found that the JavaScript version of the calculation engine was more than three times slower than the Java version. Why is JavaScript slower than Java? JavaScript is fast for a loosely-typed, dynamic language. Heavy investment in just-in-time (JIT) compilers (for example, Maglev, Sparkplug, and Turbofan) over the past 15 years has increased JavaScript's performance. However, JavaScript's loose types and dynamic behavior make it challenging for JIT compilers to generate optimal code. This means JavaScript still lags behind languages like Java and C++ for raw throughput. TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, but that type information is designed to make development easier, not to provide the sorts of guarantees needed by compilers to generate optimal code. For cases like Google Sheets, where large spreadsheets can take tens of seconds to calculate, JavaScript is fast, but not fast enough. The Solution: WasmGC WasmGC is an extension to the existing WebAssembly specification which adds the primitives needed to compile garbage collected languages (such as Java). For example, WasmGC adds instructions for defining types and allocating garbage collected data structures. WasmGC is poised to do for garbage collected languages what Wasm did for C++ (for example, Photoshop or Google Earth), which is to bring them to the web at near native speed. At Google, we believe that WasmGC has the potential to be even more impactful than Wasm because of the popularity of garbage collected languages. Google Workspace partners with Chrome The WasmGC MVP draft specification was published in 2019. In late 2020, Google Workspace and Chrome partnered to evaluate WasmGC using the Sheets calculation engine. Workspace's multiplatform team has significant expertise building and optimizing compilers and transpilers. Sheets, a part of Workspace, was identified as an ideal candidate for evaluating WasmGC: it is performance-sensitive and has robust performance and correctness validation mechanisms. Chrome has the V8 team to build and optimize the WasmGC runtime as well as contributors to Binaryen to build ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizations. Between Chrome and Workspace, there's all the expertise needed to build and optimize a WasmGC toolchain, with Google Sheets as an ideal testbed. The first prototype By mid 2021, the teams had a working Java to WasmGC compiler. Toward the end of the same year, they had a prototype version of Google Sheets running as WasmGC and doing calculations. Along the way, they hit many challenges. Tooling for profiling and taking heap dumps did not exist and had to be built. The existing implementation relied on many JavaScript libraries for which replacements had to be found or written for WasmGC. Validating the correctness of the Wasm calculation engine was a time-consuming effort due to the experimental nature of the specification, compiler, and new libraries. But Sheets' validation mechanisms were once again extremely helpful. The teams ultimately got it all working, and performance data started coming in early 2022. Additional optimizations The initial version of Sheets Wasm showed calculation performance roughly two times slower than JavaScript. However, this isn't a bad result for a new specification, new compiler, and several new libraries. From this point, the Sheets team began optimizing. Of the optimizations they found, a few categories emerged: Replicating core optimizations that already existed in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and in V8. Using highly optimized browser APIs. Removing JavaScript-specific coding patterns. Firstly, the Sheets team needed to replicate optimizations which already exist in other toolchains. The best example of this is optimizing virtual method dispatching, which has long been optimized by the JVM and V8, but nothing existed for WasmGC. Implementing speculative inlining and devirtualization—two very common optimizations—sped up calculation time by roughly 40% in Chrome. Second, there are cases where browser APIs are backed by optimized native implementations that are difficult to compete with using Wasm. Strings and regular expressions are two good examples. Specifically, with regular expressions, the team saw nearly a 100 times speedup of regular expression operations when switching from re2j (compiled to WasmGC) to the RegExp browser API in Chrome, which can compile each regular expression to its own machine code. Lastly, they found that years of optimizing had caused the codebase to be over-fitted to JavaScript. For example, they had a core data structure in Sheets which was blurring the lines between arrays and maps. This is efficient in JavaScript, which automatically models sparse arrays as maps, but slow on other platforms. So they had to rewrite the code in a more platform-agnostic way. This is another thing the team like about WebAssembly: it makes it easier for multiplatform applications to get good performance on the web. You don't have to bend your whole application to the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript. Conclusion WasmGC is a powerful technology that has the potential to advance the way developers build web applications. Over the coming years, at Google, we hope to see WasmGC advance to support shared memory multithreading and further improve single threaded performance. We encourage all web developers to consider using WasmGC for their next high-performance project. Join us and make the web a faster, smoother place together!

They had to reimplement some critical parts. reply ruds 3 hours agorootparentNote -- AIUI the js and wasmgc are both produced from the same Java codebase. The problem here is that the developers on the Java codebase had started making changes based on their performance when transpiled to javascript (which is only natural -- it seems that they had been targeting js output for a decade). reply cogman10 3 hours agorootparentI don't think that was the only issue. For example, they point out that they got 40% improvement by adding devirtualization to the compiler. Java by its nature likes to add a whole bunch of virtual method calls. Java devs primarily rely on the JIT to fix that up (and it works pretty well). Javascript relies similarly on that sort of optimization. WASM, on the other hand, was built first to compile C/C++/Rust code which frequently avoids (or compiles away when it can) virtual method calls. I imagine this isn't the only issue. For example, I'll guess that dealing with boxing/unboxing of things also introduces a headache that wouldn't be present in similar C/C++ code. In short, it just so happens that a lot of the optimizations which benefit JS also benefit Java. The one example where they did a Javascript optimization was prefering Maps and Lists over PoJos. reply michaelothomas 2 hours agorootparentIt was all of the above. We had a pretty awesome team of people working across the entire stack optimizing absolutely everything. The blog post only talks about the three optimizations that made the biggest difference. reply eknkc 3 hours agorootparentprevLikely because they are compiling Java with WasmGC extensions and stuff. If you try C, Rust, Zig etc they tend to run extremely fast in WASM. Go also has a WASM target which runs pretty slow compared to its native binaries. GC extensions might help but as far as I can remember, Go's memory model does not fit the WasmGC so it might never be implemented. reply tracker1 2 hours agorootparentI'm somewhat curious why they even chose Java over Rust or Zig, considering the spreadsheet data paths should be relatively straight forward even with a lot of clone() activity. reply michaelothomas 2 hours agorootparentThe calculation engine was written in Java before Rust or Zig were invented. reply tracker1 1 hour agorootparentGotcha, I made the mistaken assumption this was a rewrite. reply michaelothomas 2 hours agorootparentprevFor larger applications things like method dispatch performance start to dominate and you land closer to 2x overall performance uplift. reply giovannibonetti 4 hours agoparentprevMaybe the numbers didn't look very good and they thought it was better to leave them out reply ksec 4 hours agorootparentBut then what is the point telling us they are doing it with WASM now?

Edit: In a different blog post : https://workspace.google.com/blog/sheets/new-innovations-in-... \"Building on improvements like smooth scrolling and expanded cell limits in Sheets, today we’re announcing that we’ve doubled the speed of calculation in Sheets on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers,\"... I dont use Google Sheet but I wonder how far apart are their new implementation compared to Native Microsoft Excel. reply michaelothomas 3 hours agorootparentI don't know absolute values but Excel still has several advantages which make it faster: - Excel is written in C++ and compiled natively which will be a bit faster than Java running on the JVM. And Java running as WasmGC is about 2x slower than Java on the JVM. - Sheets is limited to 4GB of RAM by the browser, Excel isn't. - C++ can do shared memory multi-threading, WasmGC cannot. reply tomComb 1 hour agorootparentNot sure why you’re comparing the c++ Excel to the browser version of sheets. It would make more sense to compare the native version of Excel to the native versions of sheets, ie. android iOS and chromeOS, and the browser sheets to the browser excel. reply adrianmonk 1 hour agorootparentBecause they're replying to someone who wondered about the performance \"compared to Native Microsoft Excel\". I'll add that browser Google Sheets and native Microsoft Excel are the fastest versions available (of each product). reply ehsankia 18 minutes agorootparentprevI don't think there is a native desktop version of sheets? On ChromeOS, it's running the web version. But yes I'd be curious to see how the web version of Excel does it. reply azakai 3 hours agorootparentprevThe two posts make the most sense together, yeah. I was involved in this work (happy to answer any questions). Overall we started from a large slowdown compared to JS, worked hard, and ended up with a large speedup over JS of around 2x. So right now it is a big improvement over JS. That improvement required work across the codebase, the toolchain, and the VM. Most of it is not specific to Java and also helps other WasmGC projects too (like Dart and Kotlin). We are also working on further improvements right now that should make things even faster. reply lukan 29 minutes agorootparentOh, you were involved as well. Well then, no wonder things worked out! (I remember you from your work with asm and emscripten and the various ports you did, which I played around with) No specific question(right now), I just want to say, I admire your work. reply azakai 22 minutes agorootparentOh, thanks! Yeah, I was involved here on the toolchain side.

It seems to me that it has been ever slower over excel versions. reply PaulHoule 2 hours agorootparentOne trouble with Excel is that it does an awful lot of different things but doesn’t do them well. If you try do use it to do what Pandas does it is shocking how small of a data file will break it. The idea of incremental calculation of formulas that don’t need to be put in a particular order is still genius but the grid is so Apple ][. Maybe the world doesn’t know it because it spurned XBRL but accounting is fundamentally hyper dimensional (sales of items > $100 in the afternoon on the third week of February in stores in neighborhoods that have > 20% black people broken down but department…) not 2-d or 3-d. Having the wrong data structures is another form of “garbage in garbage out”.

(The example here was Java.) When WasmGC is widely adopted, we might hopefully see some languages adopting it as a target instead of JS. I'm thinking of Clojure and Dart specifically but there are plenty of other languages that might benefit here. This could also have an impact on \"edge computing\" (isolates etc.) down the line. reply davexunit 4 hours agoparentI work on a Scheme to Wasm GC compiler called Hoot. https://spritely.institute/hoot/ Languages like Kotlin, Scala, and OCaml also target Wasm GC now. reply avisser 4 hours agorootparentI'm waiting for the \"you should run the same code on the front-end and back-end\" argument to get thrown on it's head. golang on the back-end - golang in the browser. reply Tyr42 2 hours agorootparentThat's already happening with j2cl https://github.com/google/j2cl Java everywhere.

Another comment highlights that Go's memory management may not be a good fit for WasmGC, so we may not get near-native performance, which would be a bummer. reply jerf 1 hour agorootparentGo also has a runtime that does non-trivial things. If it can dump the GC out of it it'll shrink, but \"hello world\" would still be fairly large compared to many other languages. Having no tree shaking or similar optimizations also means that using a function from a library pulls the whole thing in. While I look forward to being able to use things other than Javascript or languages seriously confined to Javascript's basic semantics in the frontend, I expect Go to be a laggard because it's going to be hard to get it to not generate relatively large \"executables\". I expect other languages to be the \"winners\" in the not-JS-frontend race. reply dgb23 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is an extremely cool project, thank you for sharing! Edit: I'm not familiar with scheme/guile (only dabbled with Racket and later Clojure). Are these real bytes that behave like actual bytes when you manipulate their bits (unlike Java etc.) and are stored as actual bytes? https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Bytevect... reply davexunit 2 hours agorootparentYeah, bytevectors in Scheme are just some linear chunk of memory that you can get/set however you'd like. Funny that you mention this because this is actually another area where Wasm GC needs improvement. Hoot uses a (ref (array i8)) to store bytevector contents. However, Wasm GC doesn't provide any instructions for, say, interpreting 4 bytes within as a 32-bit integer. This is in contrast to instructions like i32.load that work with linear memory. The workaround for now is that you read 4 bytes, bit shift appropriately, and then OR them together. Wasm GC is fantastic overall but these little issues add up and implementers targeting GC feel like they're not on even footing with linear memory. reply mdhb 4 hours agoparentprevAs someone who jumps back and forth between Dart and Typescript fairly regularly I can’t tell you how quickly and enthusiastically I’m planning on moving more and more of my stuff to Dart.

Without WasmGC, you need to ship a compiled garbage collector to the user along with every WASM module written in a GC'd language.

And performance will always be a bit better with a native GC, plus you can share its scheduling with the rest of the browser process. reply mdhb 4 hours agorootparentprevI think it’s also that the V8 garbage collector already has a stupidly high bar when it comes to optimizations that shipping your own even without any consideration to WASM performance would be a step backwards for most languages running on the web. reply adzm 4 hours agoparentprevTo quote the summary of wasmgc feature from Chrome: > Managed languages do not fit the model of \"linear\" Wasm with memories residing in one ArrayBuffer.

Vanessa Freudenberg's SqueakJS Smalltalk VM written in JavaScript took a hybrid approach of using the JavaScript GC instead of the pure Smalltalk GC. WasmGC should make it easier to implement Smalltalk and other VMs in WebAssembly, without resorting to such tricky hybrid garbage collection schemes. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29019992 One thing that's amazing about SqueakJS (and one reason this VM inside another VM runs so fast) is the way Vanessa Freudenberg elegantly and efficiently created a hybrid Smalltalk garbage collector that works with the JavaScript garbage collector. SqueakJS: A Modern and Practical Smalltalk That Runs in Any Browser http://www.freudenbergs.de/bert/publications/Freudenberg-201... >The fact that SqueakJS represents Squeak objects as plain JavaScript objects and integrates with the JavaScript garbage collection (GC) allows existing JavaScript code to interact with Squeak objects. This has proven useful during development as we could re-use existing JavaScript tools to inspect and manipulate Squeak objects as they appear in the VM. This means that SqueakJS is not only a “Squeak in the browser”, but also that it provides practical support for using Smalltalk in a JavaScript environment. >[...] a hybrid garbage collection scheme to allow Squeak object enumeration without a dedicated object table, while delegating as much work as possible to the JavaScript GC, [...] >2.3 Cleaning up Garbage >Many core functions in Squeak depend on the ability to enumerate objects of a specific class using the firstInstance and nextInstance primitive methods. In Squeak, this is easily implemented since all objects are contiguous in memory, so one can simply scan from the beginning and return the next available instance. This is not possible in a hosted implementation where the host does not provide enumeration, as is the case for Java and JavaScript. Potato used a weak-key object table to keep track of objects to enumerate them. Other implementations, like the R/SqueakVM, use the host garbage collector to trigger a full GC and yield all objects of a certain type. These are then temporarily kept in a list for enumeration. In JavaScript, neither weak references, nor access to the GC is generally available, so neither option was possible for SqueakJS. Instead, we designed a hybrid GC scheme that provides enumeration while not requiring weak pointer support, and still retaining the benefit of the native host GC. >SqueakJS manages objects in an old and new space, akin to a semi-space GC. When an image is loaded, all objects are created in the old space. Because an image is just a snapshot of the object memory when it was saved, all objects are consecutive in the image. When we convert them into JavaScript objects, we create a linked list of all objects. This means, that as long as an object is in the SqueakJS old-space, it cannot be garbage collected by the JavaScript VM. New objects are created in a virtual new space. However, this space does not really exist for the SqueakJS VM, because it simply consists of Squeak objects that are not part of the old-space linked list. New objects that are dereferenced are simply collected by the JavaScript GC. >When full GC is triggered in SqueakJS (for example because the nextInstance primitive has been called on an object that does not have a next link) a two-phase collection is started. In the first pass, any new objects that are referenced from surviving objects are added to the end of the linked list, and thus become part of the old space. In a second pass, any objects that are already in the linked list, but were not referenced from surviving objects are removed from the list, and thus become eligible for ordinary JavaScript GC. Note also, that we append objects to the old list in the order of their creation, simply by ordering them by their object identifiers (IDs). In Squeak, these are the memory offsets of the object. To be able to save images that can again be opened with the standard Squeak VM, we generate object IDs that correspond to the offset the object would have in an image. This way, we can serialize our old object space and thus save binary compatible Squeak images from SqueakJS. >To implement Squeak’s weak references, a similar scheme can be employed: any weak container is simply added to a special list of root objects that do not let their references survive. If, during a full GC, a Squeak object is found to be only referenced from one of those weak roots, that reference is removed, and the Squeak object is again garbage collected by the JavaScript GC. reply jacobp100 4 hours agoparentprevPython has two garbage collectors - reference counting, and tracing Reference counting does not handle circular references, and tracing does Tracing collectors have to be able to read all the references of objects to work. The difficulty is that some of those objects or references to objects are in the stack - or in simpler terms, these are objects and references that only one function can read and understand. In C there are some non-standard extensions that let you do this to varying degree of success. In WASM, this is prohibited by design, because it’s a safety issue reply hankman86 1 hour agoprevIt is not entirely clear from the article, but apparently, they still use Java for their calculation engine. And then transpile it into JavaScript. Which makes me wonder whether instead of porting this code base to WasmGC, a partial rewrite would have helped the project’s maintain ability in the long run. Rust seems like a potentially good candidate due to its existing WebAssembly backend. WasmGC is useful for many other projects of course. But I wonder how painful it is to maintain a Java code base, which is not a great choice for client-side web apps to begin with. I remember using GWT back in the days - and that never felt like a good fit. GWT supported a whitelisted subset of the Java standard library. But the emitted Javascript code was nigh on impossible read. I don’t remember if Chrome’s developer tools already had source map support back in those days. But I doubt it. Other core Java concepts like class loaders are equally unsuited for JavaScript. Not to mention that primitive data types are different in Java and JavaScript. The same is true for collections, where many popular Java classes do not have direct counterparts in JavaScript. reply azakai 1 hour agoparentRewriting a large codebase with many years of work behind it to a totally new language is a pretty big task, and often ends up introducing new bugs. But I do agree Java has downsides. A more practical conversion would be to Kotlin. That's a much closer language to Java, and it can interop, which means you can rewrite it incrementally, like adopting TypeScript in a JavaScript project. Also, Kotlin uses WasmGC, which avoids the downsides of linear memory - it can use the browser's memory management instead of shipping its own, etc., which is an improvement over C++ and Rust. reply jsiepkes 1 hour agoparentprevThe code wasn't really ported to WasmGC.

I wonder what ever happened.......... reply yuri91 4 hours agorootparentIt's now possible to run Java Web Start applications fully in the browser without any plugins: https://cheerpj.com/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/ It's based on CheerpJ, a JVM that runs in the browser (using JS and Wasm). reply davidmurdoch 5 hours agoprevI still long for a world where we got ASM.js and SIMD directly in JavaScript. reply KeplerBoy 4 hours agoparentWhile we're at it, let's have CUDA.js and let me map CUDA objects to WebGL Texture and Vertex Buffers.

Am I right? reply CivBase 4 hours agoparent [–] Has Firefox announced any intentions to not support WASM? From what I can tell there is a bug with the current implementation, but I have a hard time believing that had anything to do with Google's decision. If that's what they wanted, it'd be a lot easier to just check the user agent. Most people aren't savy enough to fake their user agent. reply capitainenemo 3 hours agorootparent [–] Firefox supports WASM. The GC spec though is very much a work in progress. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1774825 Eyeballing that list it looks like they have a lot to do yet. reply azakai 2 hours agorootparentWasmGC has recently been completed in Firefox, the feature tracking page says since Firefox 120: https://webassembly.org/features/ (hover over the cell for Firefox and Garbage collection). The Firefox people have also been very active in WasmGC's development. reply davexunit 2 hours agorootparentprev [–] Wasm GC works great in Firefox. It's Safari/WebKit that need to catch up! It's been over 6 months since Chrome and Firefox enabled Wasm GC in stable releases and we're still waiting for Safari. reply capitainenemo 36 minutes agorootparent [–] Ah. My mistake.

      "Google Sheets has transitioned from JavaScript to WasmGC (WebAssembly Garbage Collection) to enhance performance, particularly for large spreadsheets.",
      "WasmGC supports garbage-collected languages like Java, offering near-native speed on the web, and Google Sheets is among the first to implement it.",
      "Initial performance of WasmGC was slower than JavaScript, but subsequent optimizations have significantly improved its speed, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize web application development."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "Google Sheets transitioned its calculation engine from JavaScript to WasmGC, initially experiencing slower performance but later optimizing it to be twice as fast as the JS version.",
      "The move involved significant reimplementation efforts, including devirtualization and leveraging browser APIs, aiming to improve performance and utilize the native V8 garbage collector.",
      "Despite improvements, some users still find Google Sheets slower compared to native applications like Excel, highlighting the ongoing evolution and optimization of web technologies."

I spent some time yesterday experimenting with Projects, and, like Artifacts, it looks really useful. I like the idea of being able to have multiple projects going simultaneously, each with its own reference materials. I don’t need to use it in a team, but I can see how that could be useful, too. The one problem I see is that the total context window for each project might start to seem too small pretty quickly. I assume, though, that Anthropic’s context windows will be getting larger as time goes on. I wonder what other features Anthropic has in the works for Claude. My personal wish is for a voice interface, something like what OpenAI announced in May but has now put off until later this year. [1] https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects reply viraptor 14 hours agoparentFrom my reading there's nothing here that's specific to Anthropic, right? Any app like Chatbox, Msty or other could implement their own version of Projects based on any of the available models. (Maybe even Notion...) The API for creating an assistant with a pre-baked context is also available. Or did I miss something unique there? reply amadeuspagel 13 hours agorootparentThese sort of basic features seem like the hardest thing for AI companies.

Anthropic’s Projects should make it easier for me to pursue multiple projects with different contexts at the same time.

I think it lets an expert programmer move more than twice as fast. There are limits - to produce high quality code, not copy-and-paste pablum, you have to be able to give detailed step-by-step directions and critically evaluate the results. This means you can't produce code better than you would have written by yourself, you can only do it much faster. As an experiment, I produced a set of bindings to Anthropic's API pair-programming with Claude. The project is of pretty good quality, and includes advanced features like streaming and type-safe definitions of tools. More than 95% of the code and docs was written by Claude, under close direction from me. The project is here: https://github.com/cortesi/misanthropy And I've shared part of the conversation that produced it in a video here: https://twitter.com/cortesi/status/1806135130446307340 reply appplication 3 hours agoparentThe biggest challenge I’ve felt is finding modern, idiomatic solutions for framework code. All LLMs seem to be victim to this issue where they will propose a mixture of old anti-patterns, roundabout approaches that technically work but make little sense, and mixing framework patterns with non-framework patterns in a way that leads to problematically incohesive code when taken together. For example, I’m an experienced backend programmer but have been using Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 asking questions about a frontend I’m building in TS using Svelte (which i am not very proficient in). The LLMs frequently confuse themselves with TS/JS, server/client side approaches, recommend old and deprecated approaches, and mixing patterns from other frameworks (e.g. react) when an idiomatic approach does exist. The biggest risk is when, in my ignorance, I do not detect when this is happening. It’s been functional enough to push a hacky prototype out (where it would take me probably months longer to learn and do this otherwise), but the code quality and organization of the project is certainly pretty low. reply zeroonetwothree 14 hours agoparentprevI find LLM coding much less useful when it’s interacting with a large existing codebase.

The second night it improves the code by adding threads (which I do know about but wouldn't have thought to use it there) and it worked better.

We just had a sudden storm that severely damaged some tomato plant stalks, and it suggested splinting them, or if it is still having trouble in a couple of days to cut off the top and plant in another pot, which is advice I've received from others too. The first picture I sent was some early blight on the leaves, it didn't get it on the first try (suggested the stem had edema, which I suppose is possible), but when I mentioned I thought it had a fungal issue it correctly noted the brown leaves and suggested a copper fungicide, among other correct remedies. It also correctly discriminated between two types of cucumber (well one was Armenian melon) held by my friend who had just picked them from her garden. Claude said that because there were hands present that it suggested that the vegetables were home-grown and/or freshly picked, and before that noted that they seemed to be good quality, which was correct. I went into this particular aspect of using Claude thinking it would be useless, but that's not what I have found with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. I'll note the fungal blight was with Claude 3 Opus, as well.

The message cap for a user in a ChatGPT Team workspace is approximately twice that of ChatGPT Plus. Please note that unused messages do not accumulate (i.e. if you wait 6 hours, you will not have 80 messages available to use for the next 3 hours on GPT-4). In certain cases for Plus users, we may dynamically adjust the message limit based on available capacity in order to prioritize making GPT-4 accessible to the widest number of people. reply eschluntz 13 hours agorootparentprevIt says 5x the free tier usage, but I agree we could be more explicit about what that is.

My experience with Claude is very positive when it comes to programming and planning out infrastructure. My only gripe so far has been some ethical constraints that didn't exist for ChatGPT, and those are a big one for me since I don't need Anthropic employees to act as my moral compass.

ASSISTANT As of my most recent update in October 2023, GPT-4 does not have an officially designated variant called \"gpt-4o\". However, OpenAI's GPT-4 model supports different maximum token limits depending on its variant. There are two primary context lengths for GPT-4 models: 1. *GPT-4 with 8K context length*: This variant supports up to 8,000 tokens. 2. *GPT-4 with 32K context length*: This variant supports up to 32,000 tokens. These limits encompass both input and output tokens in a given interaction. If you intended to refer to a specific or newly introduced variant, such as \"gpt-4o,\" it is essential to look up the most current resources or official announcements from OpenAI, as models and their capabilities can evolve. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 12 hours agorootparentI don't know what you're trying to point out here.

If you think you can save money by paying per token in the playground, you should know that you're not getting the same results. For example, if I ask Gemini the identical question, it gives a reasonable answer, even though Gemini was released before ChatGPT was released. It can look up the current OpenAI documentation and summarize it: USER What is the maximum number of tokens supported by gpt-4o? ASSISTANT GPT-4o has a context window of 128,000 tokens. This means it can process up to 128,000 tokens between your input and its output combined. However, the maximum number of output tokens (the AI's response) is limited to 4,096 tokens. reply cyral 15 hours agoparentprevI've been playing around with it this week and its coding ability is insane (for a LLM). I've given it some pretty sloppy descriptions about things I want to do and it's managed to figure out exactly how to do it on the first or second try, I'm talking things like building animations in React that cannot be described with text very well. Big pain point is copy and pasting things back and forth to have it edit them. If it was integrated and could see my local files, that would be killer. I know there are various companies working on that, but the jetbrains AI integration for example is garbage compared to the results I get by manually asking claude.

And at least for me that aspect of knowing the craft helps get my thinking in tune with problem solving in a very productive way. Coding can be similar to playing an instrument, if you have mastery, it can help you be more expressive with the ideas you already have and lead you to new ones. Whereas if we take away the craft of coding I think you end up with the type of code academic labs produce: something that purely starts on a “drawing board”, is given to the grad student/intern/LLM to make work, and while it will prove the concept it won’t scale into long term, as the intern doesn’t know when to spend an extra 30 minutes in a function so that it may be more flexible down the road. reply newswasboring 14 hours agorootparent> What worries me is you need that time in the dirt to get a feel for coding as a craft.

In TFA they name OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Anthropic. reply aappleby 15 hours agoprevI don't need an AI to write code for me, but it is _astoundingly_ helpful to have it summarize various design options and new technology stacks without me having to scavenge Google for the obscure corner-cases I care about. I have an idea for a project that involves streaming 3 giabits of data per second from a USB 3.0 device out over a 10 gig Ethernet connection, and it was able to compare/contrast various levels of support for high-bandwidth USB 3 and Ethernet in multiple frameworks and languages. And the whole conversation, with code examples, cost me 3 _cents_ of Anthropic credits. My new fear is when people start asking AIs \"Hey AI, here is my codebase, my org chart, and commit histories for all my employees - how can I reduce the number of humans I need to employ to get this project done?\" reply ttul 14 hours agoparentExamples like this make me think, “maybe the S&P 500 will be at 15,000 by 2030.” I mean, in my own job, Claude is making me substantially better in a wide range of areas, from sales negotiation to managing my team. Add that up across millions of people… reply squigz 14 hours agoparentprev> it was able to compare/contrast various levels of support for high-bandwidth USB 3 and Ethernet in multiple frameworks and languages. How do you know such information is correct though? reply aappleby 14 hours agorootparentSome of it I was able to verify immediately, some I confirmed by poking around in Github repos once I knew the magic words, some I haven't verified yet. For example, I wasn't sure if there was good support for USB devices in Rust. Just not something I'd ever bothered to investigate. Claude knew that there was a libusb wrapper and a \"rusb\" crate, and claimed that support for USB in Rust was stable. I verified the existence of the crates, and I'll take Claude at its word for stability unless I discover otherwise. reply panarky 14 hours agorootparentprevThe same way as when you learn something new from some random internet person. Does what they say conflict with anything you already know to be true? Is their argument internally inconsistent, does it contradict itself? Can you corroborate parts of their argument from other independent sources? reply squigz 8 hours agorootparentThe key difference is that I can reasonably trust (depending on the audience) that the other human is not simply hallucinating facts in order to provide a response. reply panarky 35 minutes agorootparentNot only do humans invent stuff that didn't happen (hallucination), we're also prewired with a very long list of cognitive biases. It depends a lot on the domain of course, but I'd bet that frontier LLMs already exhibit superhuman capabilities in providing accurate answers in the vast majority of domains. reply eastern 13 hours agoparentprevEven without writing code, on personal projects it's worth it for the three things I'm always lazy about: 1. Good, detailed commits 2. Tests 3. Docstrings reply gjsman-1000 15 hours agoparentprevNobody cared when it was the artists, the songwriters, the music studios, the film companies. But impacting jobs of the programmers - now, heaven forbid. reply thethirdone 14 hours agorootparentThe specific issue of using a LLM to make org decisions on how to downsize actually affects nearly all jobs equally. From what I can tell, most programmers are more ok with LLMs directly replacing them than artists are. I tend to agree that it is better to replace programmers, and protect artists. reply whywhywhywhy 8 hours agorootparentThe replacement is currently less obvious with developers, AI work needs to be copy pasted to the right places in execution and the hooks into the rest of the code need to be set up right. It doesn’t yet do prompt to 100% finished artifact. For concept artists and illustrators at least who have very generic or commercial styles Diffusion models can create a final artifact that passes as good enough to a lot of clients. Think developers would feel a bit different if they were in the same situation today. reply squigz 14 hours agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure people cared about the artists too. reply gjsman-1000 14 hours agorootparentDid the people building dall-e care? reply squigz 14 hours agorootparentAre those people here? Do you reckon GP is one of them? reply JCM9 13 hours agoprevThis is highlighting what has happened with all forms of ML. Give a baseline set of folks the same dataset and they will end up with a model that performs about the same. Companies are one-upping each other but it’s very back and forth and just a case of release date. These models will become a complete commodity. The thing that could be proprietary is the data used to train them, which could lead to a sustained better model performance. The barrier to entry here is super high given training costs, but the ML skills are still a commodity. reply brap 12 hours agoparentThis is why I strongly believe Google has the clear advantage. Infinite data, infinite resources , not to mention dozens of verticals (search, Android and Chrome are probably the killer ones) reply yunwal 3 hours agorootparentGoogle obviously has the advantage here, but it also seems like they’re willing to squander it. The Gemini rollout has basically been clippy 2.0 so far. The Gemini interface in gcloud seems to know nothing about how services work, the chat summaries consistently fail, the search summaries are comically bad. I’m usually not one of these people who wants to “block all the AI stuff” but with google products I do. reply bboygravity 13 hours agoparentprevThe dataset could become proprietary you say? In other words: information with copyright on it that was (illegally) used/stolen from billions of people and companies will get copyright on it that will be resold as a set? I don't know... reply realharo 9 hours agorootparentI think the comment was referring to things like internal company data, or licensed data that is not publicly available, etc. Those things could be a competitive advantage. reply silisili 14 hours agoprevWell, I went to try it, but it requires a phone number for some bizarre reason. Fine, gave it my primary number, a google voice number I've had for a decade, and it won't accept it. That's the end of my Claude journey, forever. If you want me to try your service, try using some flow with less friction than sandpaper, folks. reply seaal 14 hours agoparentGoogle Voice blacklist is pretty common. reply silisili 14 hours agorootparentI have about a dozen credit cards, 4 bank accounts, mortgage, car payment, utility accounts, github 2fa, aws 2fa, Fidelity retirement, etc. Not one has an issue with my number. I did have some service refuse it, I want to say Twitter? But I'd definitely not consider it common. This is probably only the second or third time I've seen it, tbh. reply simonw 13 hours agorootparentI'm going to guess the reason Anthropic do verified phone numbers is that, unlike email addresses, most people don't have an easy way to create multiple phone numbers. Since Anthropic accounts come with free rate-limited access to their models they're trying to avoid freeloaders who sign up for hundreds of accounts in order to work around those caps. Google Voice numbers are blocked because people can create multiple of those, which would allow them to circumvent those limits. reply mulmen 13 hours agorootparentWhat's the opportunity cost there? How much does a rate limited account cost and how much is a signup worth? reply mewpmewp2 12 hours agorootparentThese systems are likely under heavy sign up attacks and so must have a way to guard against that since their costs are quite high. reply mulmen 16 minutes agorootparentI’m really curious where that line is and how it is identified. How much business is lost to the onboarding friction? Is it more or less than the cost of the attacks? On one extreme usage of the service is totally open to everyone. On the other it is completely locked down and nobody can use it ever. Clearly neither of those are workable. So it’s a question of how far to go with validation. reply mewpmewp2 12 hours agorootparentprev2fa and those services are different. LLM api calls are relatively costly and in demand so they must have a decent barrier of entry so people couldn't just spam automated accounts with automated requests to use the app for free. There are systems that abuse that and even existing API integrations are being abused by proxying and using for other purposes if they are free and don't have good security. Any place that wants to defend against bots can't trust those phone numbers. reply mulmen 13 hours agorootparentprevFor a sales lead? Why? reply mulmen 14 hours agoparentprevThey don't want you to do anything. The friction they ware attempting to reduce is between phone numbers and wallets.

Being a side project, I asked it to put the code into a Docker container, which is did flawlessly. It also gave me a Makefile with sensible targets for building, rebuilding, starting, stopping, etc. Finally, I asked it use an .env file for the secrets I needed to store. Everything it did was one-shot on target.

Every side project I've thrown at Claude 3.5 Sonnet has been completed that same night. It's so different from how I used to treat my backlog projects which could take a week or so of research-code-iterate and now they're just an evening (or less; since Sonnet's upgrade on average it's taken me about 20-40 minutes to get the night's planned work done) and I get to sleep earlier.

Here's the breakdown: 4 × 100 = 400 400 × 100 = 40,000 Oops, it looks like there was an error in my previous calculation. So, 4 × 100 X 100 actually equals 40,000, not 400,000. To make it 400,000, you would need to use 4 × 10 x 10,000 or adjust the numbers similarly. claude-3.5: No, 400000 is not the same as 4 * 100 * 100. Let's break it down: 4 * 100 * 100 = 4 * 10000 = 40000 400000 is ten times larger than 40000. Everyone keeps saying gpt-4o beats benchmarks and stuff, but this is consistently my experience with it.

Its frustrating to work with the AI to implement something only to realise within a few interactions that it has forgotten or lost track of something I deemed to be a key requirement. Surely the future of software has to start to include declarative statement prompts as part of the source code. reply ilaksh 15 hours agoparentThe first thing I built with OpenAI a few years ago was a system that had a section for a program spec on one part of the screen and a live web page area on the other part. You could edit the spec and it would then regenerate the web page. It would probably work much better now. Eventually I might add something like that as a plugin in my current framework. reply simonw 15 hours agoparentprevHave you tried building that system with prompting? You could set a convention of having comments something like this: # Requirement: function always returns an array of strings And then have a system prompt which tells the model to always obey comments like that, and to add comments like that to record important requirements provided by the user. reply willsmith72 12 hours agoprevam i right in that it has no online capabilities? that's a pretty big issue for me reply renewiltord 14 hours agoprevClaude Sonnet is freaking amazing.

Vision capabilities are usually added later using a vision encoder that does not affect the LLM's knowledge of the visual world, but in this case the LLM clearly has quite a strong understanding of the visual world. reply levocardia 14 hours agoparentHave you read the \"sparks of AGI\" paper about GPT4? It suggested that even just text can give an LLM a rich world model, based on the tikz drawings of a unicorn that got progressively better as GPT4 precursors were trained on increasingly more data (and, interestingly, the drawings got worse when it was RLHF'd for safety). reply GaggiX 14 hours agorootparentYes of course, as always, it's very possible that just scaling solved the problem, but the fact that the model is so good makes me wonder if they actually did something different and pre-trained the model on image tokens as well. reply SubiculumCode 15 hours agoprevI'm fairly impressed with Sonnet's one shot scripting performance for my use cases. However, I was using it to help me diagnoses a gnome key ring and ssh issue I was having, and it suggested that I 'rm -rf' my keyring files to test it's solution out. A little drastic..maybe mv my password file first? Anyway, it sometimes seems even more cocky than last gen, and less careful by default reply nyellin 15 hours agoprevInteresting. We're finding that it's more verbose than GPT-4o (and often ignores instructions to give output in a specific format), but does better when faced with ambiguity and potentially confusing situations.

First, let's try to find the relevant Kubernetes resources related to the payment processor. Running `kubectl get -A --show-labels podgrep payment` Thank you for your question about the payment processor. initial search, I've found two pods related to payment processing. Let's investigate the one that seems to be having issues: 1. In the default namespace, there's a pod named \"payment-processing-worker-5bb5bd75cd-x4g99\" which is in a CrashLoopBackOff state. This indicates that the pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting. 2. In the sock-shop namespace, there's a pod named \"payment-ff86cd6f8-rs47b\" which appears to be running normally. Let's focus on the problematic pod in the default namespace. To get more information about what's wrong, we'll need to look at its logs and description. Running `kubectl describe pod payment-processing-worker-5bb5bd75cd-x4g99 -n default` AI: Based on the information gathered, it appears that there is an issue with the payment processor in the Kubernetes cluster. Let me explain what's wrong: 1 The payment processing worker pod is in a CrashLoopBackOff state: • Pod name: payment-processing-worker-5bb5bd75cd-x4g99 • Namespace: default • Status: CrashLoopBackOff 2 The pod is continuously restarting and failing: • Restart Count: 242 • The container is in a \"Waiting\" state with the reason \"CrashLoopBackOff\" 3 The root cause of the issue appears to be related to an environment variable: • The container is running a bash script that checks for the presence of the DEPLOY_ENV environment variable. • If DEPLOY_ENV is not set, the container exits immediately after printing an error message. • The command being run is: if [[ -z \"${DEPLOY_ENV}\" ]]; then echo Environment variable DEPLOY_ENV is undefined ; else while true; do echo hello; sleep 10;done; fi 4 The environment section in the pod description shows: Environment:This indicates that no environment variables are set for the container. 5 The container is exiting with a status of \"Completed\" and an exit code of 0, which suggests that it's running the script, finding that DEPLOY_E To fix this issue: 1 The DEPLOY_ENV environment variable needs to be set for the payment-processing-worker deployment. 2 You should update the deployment configuration to include this environment variable. 3 After setting the environment variable, the pod should stop crashing and enter a running state where it prints \"hello\" every 10 seconds. To resolve this, you'll need to update the deployment configuration for the payment-processing-worker. You can do this by editing the deployment and adding the DEPLOY_ENV environment variable with an appropriate value. Would you like me to show you how to update the deployment with the required environment variable? Note that it explicitly picks up on the ambiguity in the question and notes that there are 2 payment related workloads and one is healthy.

So it was necessary to add some sort of I/O-port expander to get more digital outputs. I did this by adding a 74HC574 octal D-type bus latch. This IC is wired as a 4-bit wide shift register with a depth of 2, so we get another 8 digital outputs. To clock the data into the shift register, I use the SCL line of the I2C bus. This is no problem at all for the I2C bus, because the devices on the bus will never see a valid I2C start condition when the SCL signal is used to clock the 74HC574. To avoid unwanted register writes to the LCD, the display has its on select-signal on My4TH's digital I/O port (OUT3). Two resistor-diode AND gates (R3/D6 and R4/D8) mask the chip selects on the LCD. The small capacitors C2 and C3 are required to filter out glitches caused by the 74HC574's toggling pins together with the parasitic capacitance of D6 and D8. The keyboard has 56 keys. The distance between the keys is 12 mm, so it is not possible to use larger, more confortable keys. I wanted to have the smallest possible device, and the display forced me to use a minimum width of 190 mm. With a spacing of 12 mm, 14 keys fit in one row, and with 4 rows we get a total of 56 keys. To read the keys, I use all the unused input pins on the My4TH's I/O-port connector, which are six in total. Together with 9 digital outputs, I can read a matrix of 6 x 9 = 54 keys. The remaining two keys are special: I added a shift key (which required another digital output) and a reset key. The reset key is protected by the shift key, i.e. to trigger a hardware reset you need to press the the reset key together with the shift key. A LiPo battery is used to power the system. The charger circuit is based on the TP5400 chip, which is widely used in cheap USB power banks. If you find it too difficult to solder the tiny SMD components onto the circuit board, you can use a pre-assembled TP5400 module and connect it to the keyboard PCB via fly wires. The Software support for the keyboard PCB is integrated in the My4TH ROM since version 1.0. So if you connect the keyboard extension board to your My4TH computer board, your My4TH will automatically detect the keyboard and LCD. The PCB is prepared so that it can be cut in half to separate the keyboard from the display. This allows you to a) mount the display at any angle to the keyboard and b) make your own (possibly more comfortable) keyboard. To initiate a hardware reset, hold down the shift key and press the |Reset| key.

It's not quite what I'd want, but all the schematics and software is there, so it wouldn't be too hard to change things to taste. :) reply tailrecursion 16 hours agoprevThe CPU for this computer is microcoded and is made out of a small number of discrete logic chips, plus an EEPROM. The data and address bus are 8 bits wide but the NOR unit operates on one bit only. The microcode has to loop in order to perform an 8 bit add. I was looking for a hardware shifter in the diagram, because I figured it'd be necessary to access bits D1-D7. But there is none. He uses a lookup table in EEPROM to do the shift. If you're interested in nice CPU designs, here's another one: the Novix NC4000 (also RTX2000), in which the bits in the instructions lead directly to control various muxes and units inside the chip. There's almost no decoding. reply Pet_Ant 1 hour agoprevWhat I'd love is a dialect of Factor written in Forth so that it could be run on these machines.

I see the custom keyboard community seem to be able to make any keyboard they like. The keyboard on the Model 100 consumed the majority of its space, but at the same time, it was usable. I don't know what a reasonable display would be. The notable thing about the 40x8 is that it was big enough to be usable, and it was readable. I've seen some decks with tiny 640x480 displays, and they're not readable, particularly to my aging eyes. The Psion 5 had a very usable keyboard, and better display than the M100. I don't know if that kind of keyboard can be made by a hobbyist like the other ones can. I don't know enough about keyboards. I don't know if one of those could be gutted and repurposed. (No doubt considered sacrilege to some.) We see these \"decks\" with these matrices of buttons, but I'd dare say they're not really keyboards. The PET 2001 kind of proved that (and I did a lot of coding on a PET back in the day). So, just curious what's stopping \"real\" ones, \"nice\" ones from showing up. I'd dare say money, but I see what folks spend money on for their hobbies, so it can't be that alone. Doesn't have to be a viable product for market. reply Gracana 16 hours agoparentFinding big low resolution displays is a pain. Pixel density has increased a lot, so larger displays are high resolution, which means you need a much faster device to drive them, and at that point it starts to feel a little silly because your display controller is way more powerful than the actual computer. That's the stumbling block I've run into, anyway. It's plenty doable, it just feels sillier than I intend. reply boffinAudio 9 hours agoparentprev>What's the modern day barrier to creating a \"hobby\" TRS-80 Model 100?

They ran on batteries for hours and had limited save space. You could hook them up to a larger computer to save your drafts. Where's the programming version of that? The recent HN post[2] about running a Mac 128k on a RPI2040[3] got me thinking about that. In theory, you could get real work done on a system like that, although it wouldn't be very good for entertainment. So, where's the AlphaSmart of low-power computing? 1. \"Real\" keyboard 2. Low-power display, ideally a larger e-ink one 3. Not connected to the internet To be clear, I don't mean a TI-83-like[4], TI-92[5], or even the recent NumWorks[6]. Those are meant to be calculators and have inconvenient calculator-like form-factors.

I know there's e-ink nerds out there and forums dedicated to it but I don't actually know the different types (here's an overview I think: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper). Maybe the good stuff is harder to find reply kragen 19 hours agorootparentthe amazon swindle is known for a month-long battery life, so a week is easily believable. but you're talking about how to solve a different problem if batteries are an option, e-ink is a super-low-power option because it uses 100 milliwatts or maybe 10 milliwatts at a cellphone size, while a conventional backlit color lcd uses 1000. but to run off solar panels, indoors, my power budget for the whole zorzpad is 1 milliwatt, and the screen can only have a fraction of that reply nine_k 19 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what's the point to run.batteryless? With such a small power budget, the device should accumulate energy when it can harvest more than it needs to consume, and use it when the lighting conditions deteriorate. It would only take a really small battery, but would seriously increase usefulness. reply kragen 18 hours agorootparenti've discussed the reliability problems of batteries further in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40805573, but, as an intuition pump, consider that when cellphone repair shops advertise particular repairs, the particular repairs they advertise most are battery replacement, charging port replacement, and broken screen replacement reply nine_k 17 hours agorootparentSo use a battery of a standard form factor and make it easy to replace. E.g. one AAA battery per device is easiest. Most coin-sized lithium batteries are also rechargeable, explicitly or implicitly. reply thetoon 9 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by implicitly? Last time I checked, most of button/coin-like batteries (CR2032 and the such) aren't know to be rechargeable, unless you specifically get rechargeable ones. reply kragen 17 hours agorootparentprevyou don't seem to have really understood my points, because you aren't engaging with them; as it happens, you're also mistaken about coin-sized lithium batteries (though any battery can be slightly recharged) reply nullc 12 hours agorootparentprevHave you given much though to the idea that parts which are inexpensive and shelf stable could just be bulked up? Long lifetime won't save you from parts that just get damages from wear and tear.

Where did you get 53 years from? I think, for longevity as a design criteria, including the documentation including design files is the best and most significant strategy. Mechanical: machine everything out of solid metal, over-spec the springs, seals and potential ingress point precision. Electronics: fat traces, replacement-optimized through hole components, socket-mounted chips, over-rated everything, passive cooling, conformal coating, arrays of smaller components in preference to single large components. Fasteners: easy grip broad head twistable screws only, potentially to double as stands, this ensures accessibility until fingers become obsolete. Software: ROM base system with physical restore function, dual ROM with mutual checksum if required, RAM for everything else. Digital storage/retrieval: Solid state only. Physical output: Optional low-longevity RS232 receipt printer for retro effect. Power: Solar + supercaps and/or a corded pull-out analog watch-style shake-to-charge assembly and/or a thermal charger utilizing thermals from combustion and/or a pneumatic charger utilizing common compressed air interfaces as a power source. reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentthanks! your ideas are mostly pretty good i agree that the machine should be fully self-describing, like darius bacon's 'book in itself'. of course, that won't help you if it won't turn on... rather than just conformal coating and seals, i'm thinking i'll not just conformally coat the boards, but also pot the whole assembly in something like silicone or toilet-ring wax, so that the potting material can be removed, but otherwise it's trivially ip68. except for the keyswitches, but the keyswitches can be a magnetic type that doesn't have any exposed electrical contacts or any springs solar-powered devices generally don't have to worry too much about cooling, though. or if they do it's from the heat they passively absorb from the sun, not from anything they dissipate internally. if your solar panels are 10% efficient (the best you can get out of amorphous silicon, which is the only kind that works under indoor lighting) and cover 30% of your device, they only harness 3% of the illuminance, which is later converted to heat in the circuitry. the other 97% is either reflected or converted into heat immediately. so the heat produced internally is only about 5% of the heat it has to deal with. now think about how much heat you feel on your skin from indoor illumination; we're talking about 5% of that socket-mounted chips tend to induce a lot of unreliability, so i don't favor them. desoldering surface-mount chips is a bit of a pain but still done routinely in cellphone repair shops around the world. but i want it to make it to its design lifetime without replacing components, and one reason for that is that i don't want to depend on the economy. (consider what components were commonplace in 01971 and how many of them are hard to obtain nowadays — and that was 53 years of relative peacetime. imagine trying to get parts today in moscow.) unlike batteries, chips do have a long shelf life, so you could conceivably stockpile chips today for future repairs. but if you're going to do that, probably the best place to stockpile them is on circuit boards inside the device, so you don't have to solder anything to fail over to them. that's not applicable for every device, but fortunately things like voltage regulators have very low failure rates, and you can still probably build in redundancy at a higher level. that's what we did when i worked on satellite systems: of n identical systems onboard, we only needed one to survive to run the satellite. there were even multiple power buses, so that even a failure that shorted a voltage rail to ground would only disable part of the satellite as i understand it (not having taken the measurements yet myself) over-rating is especially important for bypass capacitors in this context — not because they're prone to failure (unless you're using tantalums) but because capacitors have enormously higher leakage near their rated voltage if you want to build such a thing and have a mechanical charging option, i think a pullstring like 20th-century children's windup toys is the best option. it's compact, the spring constrains how much force you can apply to the generator and runs it at a predictable speed, and the pullstring grommet constrains the direction of force applied to the mechanism so that kofi annan can't break it by applying side-loading to your crank handle like he did with olpc. but i don't think electromechanical generators are likely to fit into the reliability budget for screws, i think protruding screws would catch on my pockets. but there are lots of ways to fasten things together in reopenable ways, especially if you don't need seals. if you did want to use conventional milled-head screws, well, i filed a flathead screwdriver out of a bolt a few months ago. i used a file, a vise, and a steel bolt. but exposed screws would tend to rust unless you made them out of titanium or something, which isn't an option for me a metal case has advantages and disadvantages. being able to take input power inductively (qi style) or communicate over rf could be useful, which you can't do with an all-metal case. metals are not very chemically stable, except for gold, silver, platinum, iridium, palladium, lead, nickel, aluminum, titanium, tin, and chromium. most of these have major disadvantages of their own, though titanium would be a pretty good option. many plastics are very chemically stable, including polypropylene, polyester terephthalate, silicones, and epoxy resins, and the epoxies in particular can be glass-fiber reinforced up to steel-like strengths and stiffnesses. so that was my plan why 53? i just like 53 reply contingencies 18 hours agorootparentPocketable wasn't in my mental spec, agree this is a good idea. You can also inset them. Marketing a portable as Kofi-proof is a neat marketing angle ;) Depending on your radio frequency perhaps you could put your RF behind your screen to get signal out, or use a slot as the antenna, or have a fold-out or telescopic antenna, or have a screw-on antenna port exposed when you open the thing, or some combination thereof. Aluminium's fine for cases, cheap, light, castable, extrudable, cheaply machined, and readily anodized. Steel won't rust for ages if it's of a decent chemistry and either treated and/or oil is used when the thread is mated. Even steel that appears heavily rusted after many decades of total abuse can be restored quite easily to a good state in many cases. I mean people had multi hundred year old wooden structures ... I don't think an embedded steel thread with an oil surface coating is going to disappear overnight. As a learning project I recently restored a 1980s drill press, that's basically 40 years old which is ~most of your target length, it had apparently been left with exposure to moisture for 20+ years, and was mostly intact. The net result of the learning was it's not worth restoring old drill presses, but I sure learned a lot! For maximum chip shelf life, you want to store them in nitrogen or some similar inert gas. With Wikipedia and survivalist content modules you could market this to the prepper crowd. Of course long distance radio would be an add-on. As would the radio direction finding hardware, encryption, etc. I still like the pneumatic idea. 100% of existing bicycle pump hardware becomes your viable charging interface. Speaking of which, a low profile wheel based generator would be a good add-on module. reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentthose are good ideas about antennas i hadn't actually considered machining it out of an aluminum billet. you might be right that it would be adequately stiff, even if it's much less stiff than glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy. it's much heavier than epoxy, but only slightly heavier than glass, and of course most of its grades are enormously less brittle reply pushfoo 20 hours agorootparentprevTL;DR: I love this idea and have two questions: 1. For early iterations / similar projects, could all-metal screw terminals[1] accept power internally? 2. Would supporting UXN/Varvara[2] be an option? More on these questions below after initial comments. ## Initial Comments > if you aren't worried about going batteryless, or about mass production, you could literally buy an alphasmart neo and wire its keyboard and display up to an esp32 or something I could, but it's a limited in availability. The keyboard is pretty important in my opinion. > memory-in-pixel lcd displays I vaguely remember hearing about this, but don't have the EE knowledge to judge the benefits of these. Data sheet for anyone interested: https://www.sharpsde.com/fileadmin/products/Displays/Specs/L... ## 1. The screw terminal: Disclaimer: I'm not an EE specialist. My understanding is that if the power loss isn't too great, an all-metal internal screw terminal[1] might improve device durability: * The power source could be replaceable. AA, AAA, LiPo, solar, etc * If you don't solder to the metal part, even sandpaper or a conveniently shaped rock could remove oxidation * For a case, internal screw terminals could turn a charging port into an easily replaceable component ## 2. UXN/Varvara: From your blog, I see an \"artemis apollo 3 board\"[3] is being used. From a Sparkfun page[4], it seems to have enough ram to host graphical Varvara. I was initially doubtful of UXN despite loving the idea, but: 1. The UXN community seems to have built a self-hosting ecosystem[5] of: * development and GUI ROM launching tools * text, font, and graphics editors * music sequencing tools 2. The UXN VM is light: 64k system ram, 4-bit 2-plane color, and misc state and debug 3. The core UXN VM is simple: a minimal implementation fits in under 150 lines[6] of C89 [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_terminal [2]: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html [3]: https://blog.za3k.com/zorchpad-update-cardboard-mockup-mk1/ [4]: https://www.sparkfun.com/artemis [5]: https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn [6]: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/uxnmin.c.txt reply kragen 19 hours agorootparenti'm glad to hear you find it appealing! i'll explain some of my thinking on these issues, some of which is specific to my own eccentric objectives (nobody designs computers to last decades) and some of which is more generally applicable screw terminals or post terminals are a good idea if you're going to have charging and want longevity. but charging implies batteries. and batteries themselves induce lots of failures; they typically have a design lifetime of two years, more than an order of magnitude too low for the zorzpad. by itself that's not a fatal flaw, because you could replace them, but it becomes fatal in combination with either of the two supplementary flaws: 1. battery shelf life is limited to about 10 years, except for lithium thionyl chloride and so-called 'thermal batteries' that use a molten-salt electrolyte (kept frozen during storage). consequently, if your computer needs batteries, after 10 years you're dependent on access to not just a market but a full-fledged industrial economy to keep your computer running. a friend of mine in rural romania has been trying to build a usable lead-acid battery from scratch to provide energy storage for his solar panels, and it's motherfucking difficult without that supply chain 2. batteries have a lot of failure modes that destroy the devices they power. overheating, swelling, leaking corrosive electrolytes, and too much voltage are four of them. if these failure modes were very rare (like once in 100 battery-years) that might be okay, but they aren't for me these are fatal flaws, but for others they may not be. if you can afford batteries, you can run for one hell of a long time on a single 18650 lipo on a milliwatt. a coin cell can deliver a milliwatt for a month as for uxn, uxn is the first attempt at frugal \"write once, run anywhere\" that's good enough to criticize. everyone should read devine's talk about its aspirations (https://100r.co/site/weathering_software_winter.html) however, uxn is not frugal with cpu, or fast, nor is it good for programmer productivity, and it’s not all that simple. It’s designed for interpretation, which inherently means you’re throwing away 90% or 95% of even a single-threaded cpu, and it’s not designed as a compilation target, which means that you’re stuck programming at the assembly-language level. This is pretty fucking fun, but that’s because it makes easy things hard, not hard things easy; the offgrid notes lionize oulipo (https://100r.co/site/working_offgrid_efficiently.html) as a result of the efficiency problems, the platforms with complete uxn implementations (see https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn#emulators) are the luxurious ones: microsoft windows, linux, amigaos, the essence operating system, anything that can run sdl or lua and love2d, gameboy advance, nintendo 64, nintendo ds, playdate, and the nook ereader: all 32-bit or 64-bit platforms with ram of 4 mebibytes or more, except that the gba only has 384 kibibytes, and there were amigas with as little as 512k (though i don’t know if they can run uxn). more limited machines like the gameboy, ms-dos, and the zx spectrum do not have complete uxn implementations (384k is the same amount of ram as the apollo3, so it's probably feasible, as you say) the uxn machine code is basically forth. forth is pretty aesthetically appealing to me, and i've gotten to the point where forth code is almost as easy for me to write as c code (though i have to look things up in the manual more often and have more bugs). however, it's much, much harder for me to read forth than it is to read c. it's harder for me to read forth code than to read assembly for any of 8086, arm, risc-v, i386, or amd64. possibly i just haven't written enough forth to have the enlightenment experience yet, but currently my hypothesis is that forth is just hard to read and that's it, and that the really great thing about forth is not actually the language but the interactive development experience the varvara display model is not a good fit for the memory-in-pixel displays, which only have one bit per pixel, while varvara requires two. also, evaluating things 60 times a second is not a good fit for low-power systems of any kind. and i'm not sure how well the existing varvara applications will work at 400×240 or tolerate a requirement to use fonts many pixels tall in order to be readable (a lot of the above notes are from xpasm.md in http://canonical.org/~kragen/sw/pavnotes2.git/ if you're interested in the context) as for tools for software development, program launching, editing text, editing fonts, editing other graphics, and sequencing music, i'm confident i can write those myself if i have to. i've written a compiler in a subset of scheme that compiles itself, a compiler in a forth-like language that compiles itself, various toy text editors, various virtual machines in under 150 lines of code, and various pieces of music synthesis software, and i've designed a few fonts of my own (though not using software i wrote) maybe i should set up a patreon for this or something, maybe people would be interested in supporting the project reply pushfoo 1 hour agorootparentTL;DR: Thank you for confirming some mismatch in display hardware and project goals > also, evaluating things 60 times a second is not a good fit for low-power systems of any kind. Agreed. As to a terminal-mode UXN, you pointed out: > as for uxn, uxn is the first attempt at frugal \"write once, run anywhere\" that's good enough to criticize. everyone should read devine's talk about its aspirations I think it's the primary use case like Java Applets and Flash preceded JS as iterations of sorta-portable and low efficiency tools which make up for it with sheer volume of high-familiarity material. > nor is it good for programmer productivity I'm curious about this. Could you please elaborate? When trying earlier uxntal versions, the worst part seemed to be the string syntax. If it wasn't because it seemed easier at the time, my guess is the pain point might be intentional nudges away from making things the designer doesn't like. > and it’s not all that simple. This is where I get confused: * Can you explain more about your views on this? * Do you favor a specific structure of hardware, OS code, and user scripts, or whatever ends up offering the best use of power and long-term device durability? > i'm not sure how well the existing varvara applications will work at 400×240 or tolerate a requirement to use fonts many pixels tall in order to be readable Counting mW and decades implies text > GUI. Despite 100r & fans favoring GUI, there's an UXN terminal mode and a few math and terminal libraries written for it. As to GUI, many of the ecosystem's GUI programs are FOSS with room to shrink the graphics. There's a decent 4x6 px ASCII font which is CC0 and could help, but as fair warning, it's awful at accents and umlauts. > possibly i just haven't written enough forth to have the enlightenment experience yet, but currently my hypothesis is that forth is just hard to read and that's it, and that the really great thing about forth is not actually the language but the interactive development experience This seems to be a universal opinion since REPL isn't rare anymore. Being portable and easy to bootstrap are probably the main draw now. In addition to 100r's work, I think remember hearing ${NAME}boot or another project used it to simplify porting. > the varvara display model is not a good fit for the memory-in-pixel displays, which only have one bit per pixel, while varvara requires two. Ah, this is what I suspected. I wasn't sure I understood the display you mentioned, so thank you for confirming the hardware mismatch. Although your blog showed you'd considered two identical side-by-side displays[1], I have a radical idea which might not be a good one: 1.

The Clockwork-PI[4] looks like it's mostly an emulation machine. For anyone who doesn't want to click through, it's a Game Boy form factor with a few extra buttons and a keyboard below the D-pad. To be fair to the device, I think it's different class of device. It also fills some very specific niches: 1. Prototyping for GB/GBC games on higher-power hardware and higher-level languages 2. A decent front-end attached sensors if you can use USB As example of #2: Mapping WiFi signal strength. Walking around a building holding a clunky laptop while someone else held the antenna wasn't fun.

Now scientists think they know where it goes June 26, 20245:00 AM ET Jon Hamilton The brain has a waste removal system and scientists are figuring out how it works Listen · 3:43 3:43 Toggle more options Download Embed EmbedTranscript New insights into the brain's waste-removal system could one day help researchers better understand and prevent many brain disorders. Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images About 170 billion cells are in the brain, and as they go about their regular tasks, they produce waste — a lot of it. To stay healthy, the brain needs to wash away all that debris. But how exactly it does this has remained a mystery. Now, two teams of scientists have published three papers that offer a detailed description of the brain's waste-removal system. Their insights could help researchers better understand, treat and perhaps prevent a broad range of brain disorders. The papers, all published in the journal Nature, suggest that during sleep, slow electrical waves push the fluid around cells from deep in the brain to its surface. There, a sophisticated interface allows the waste products in that fluid to be absorbed into the bloodstream, which takes them to the liver and kidneys to be removed from the body. One of the waste products carried away is amyloid, the substance that forms sticky plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Shots - Health News This new brain-mapping device could make neurosurgery safer There's growing evidence that in Alzheimer's disease, the brain's waste-removal system is impaired, says Jeffrey Iliff, who studies neurodegenerative diseases at the University of Washington but was not a part of the new studies. The new findings should help researchers understand precisely where the problem is and perhaps fix it, Iliff says. \"If we restore drainage, can we prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease?\" he asks. A brief history of brainwashing The new studies come more than a decade after Iliff and Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, a Danish scientist, first proposed that the clear fluids in and around the brain are part of a system to wash away waste products. The scientists named it the glymphatic system, a nod to the body's lymphatic system, which helps fight infection, maintain fluid levels and filter out waste products and abnormal cells. Both systems work like plumbing in a house, says Jonathan Kipnis of Washington University in St. Louis, an author of two of the new papers. \"You have the water pipes and the sewage pipes,\" Kipnis says. \"So the water comes in clean, and then you wash your hands, and the dirty water goes out.\" Shots - Health News These identical twins both grew up with autism, but took very different paths But the lymphatic system uses a network of thin tubes that transports waste to the bloodstream. The brain lacks these tubes. So scientists have spent decades trying to answer a fundamental question, Kipnis says: \"How does a waste molecule from the middle of the brain make it all the way out to the borders of the brain\" and ultimately out of the body? Part of the answer came in 2012 and 2013, when Iliff and Nedergaard began proposing the glymphatic system. They showed that in sleeping animals, cerebrospinal fluid begins to flow quickly through the brain, flushing out waste. But what was pushing the fluid? And how was it transporting waste across the barrier that usually separates brain tissue from the bloodstream? Waves that wash Kipnis and his team began looking at what the brain was doing as it slept. As part of that effort, they measured the power of a slow electrical wave that appears during deep sleep in animals. And they realized something: \"By measuring the wave, we are also measuring the flow of interstitial fluid,\" the liquid found in the spaces around cells, Kipnis says. It turned out that the waves were acting as a signal, synchronizing the activity of neurons and transforming them into tiny pumps that push fluid toward the brain's surface, the team reported in February in the journal Nature. In a second paper published in the same issue of Nature, a team led by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provided more evidence that slow electrical waves help clear out waste. The team used mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's. They exposed these mice to bursts of sound and light that occurred 40 times a second. Shots - Health News Domestic violence may leave telltale damage in the brain. Scientists want to find it The stimulation induced brain waves in the animals that occurred at the same, slow frequency. Tests showed that the waves increased the flow of clean cerebrospinal fluid into the brain and the flow of dirty fluid out of the brain. They also showed that the fluid was carrying amyloid, the substance that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. In a paper published a few weeks earlier, Kipnis had shown how waste, including amyloid, appeared to be crossing the protective membrane that usually isolates the brain. Kipnis and his team focused on a vein that passes through this membrane. \"Around the vein, you have a sleeve, which is never fully sealed,\" he says. \"That's where the [cerebrospinal fluid] is coming out\" and transferring waste to the body's lymphatic system. From mice to humans Together, the new studies suggest that keeping the brain's waste-clearance system functioning requires two distinct steps: one to push waste into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain, and another to move it into the lymphatic system and eventually out of the body. \"We've described them separately,\" Iliff says, \"but from a biological perspective, they almost certainly are coupled.\" Iliff says many of the new findings in mice still need to be confirmed in people. \"The anatomical differences between a rodent and a human,\" he says, \"they're pretty substantial.\" But he says the results are consistent with research on what leads to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's. Researchers know that the brain's waste-clearance system can be impaired by age, injuries and diseases that clog blood vessels in the brain. \"All of these are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease,\" Iliff says. Impaired waste removal may also be a factor in Parkinson's disease, headache and even depression, Iliff says. So finding ways to help the brain clean itself — perhaps by inducing those slow electrical waves — might prevent a wide array of disorders. Correction June 26, 2024 A previous version of this story incorrectly described the bursts of sound and light used in an experiment as occurring at 40 times a minute. They occurred at 40 times a second. Alzheimer's brain health human brain neuroscience neurology Facebook Flipboard Email",

And don't forget the incomprehensible horror. reply thatcat 10 hours agorootparentDidn't this already happen repeatedly in US history? Legislation was passed preventing human testing in the early 90s reply skeledrew 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is voluntary though. Sure the odds of more volunteering increases with the total number of bodies, but I don't think it'd be actually significant. reply tumult 13 hours agorootparent“in exchange for time served” reply skeledrew 13 hours agorootparentSure. There isn't an inherent financial incentive here for the prison system (though an illegal one could easily develop, as it does with all else). It really boils down to the type of study and how much time gets exchanged: I'd assume the more dangerous something is, the more \"time served\" it's worth, for example. And of course there are all the usual caveats of determining a fair rate, ensuring informed consent, etc. reply snapcaster 4 hours agorootparentprevTruly monstrous idea. It alarms me that you can't immediately identify several massive problems with this idea reply skeledrew 14 hours agoprev> So finding ways to help the brain clean itself — perhaps by inducing those slow electrical waves — might prevent a wide array of disorders. Even before getting to the end this had me thinking of binaural beats. Back in college there was a beat that I would use whenever I was super tired and had a lot to do, and it'd help me refresh via a quick 20m nap (sometimes the nap itself wasn't even needed; just to let my mind be taken by the beat for the duration). If it's the case that a part of the effect is to trigger a \"deep clean\" (I've wondered on and off what's really happening), then this just may become a way to reduce said disorders... reply mrtksn 12 hours agoparentIIRC they ware selling tracks that were supposed to make you smart or calm etc. I torrented the most expensive one which the legend said it costs 1000$ and makes you smart, didn't change a thing but maybe because I didn't pay for it :) reply skeledrew 4 hours agorootparentBinaural beats is a phenomenon though, not a company, so no need to pay for anything ;). Of course there will be those creating tracks or generators with their \"special sauce\" and charging for it. Kinda like selling shell necklaces so you don't have to gather the shells and make one yourself. reply hhjinks 11 hours agorootparentprevI remember those vividly. We were on a school trip, and some of the girls heard about it and wanted to try the Speed track (as in the drug). It certainly altered their consciousness, one of them even fainted. We tried to keep it a secret from the teacher, but it eventually got out, and I think all of us on that trip got confronted by the teacher during parent–teacher conferences. We were all like 14, so we had no idea what Speed actually was like. Seemed almost real for a minute there, but of course it's more akin to hypnosis than actual brain alteration. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 10 hours agorootparentI remember trying a bunch of these in middle school as well. They really just gave me a headache. reply soco 11 hours agorootparentprevYou saved 1k$ and that looks quite smart to me. So... success? reply RamblingCTO 3 hours agoparentprevHow would audial waves affect the brain as electrical waves? I don't think that's possible. I'm figuring they'd need to directly take effect in the brain tissue itself to clean it. reply phasel0ck 2 hours agorootparentPotentially via the ear in the same way that a microphone translates sound waves (vibrations in the air) into electrical signals. Just a guess. Seems like there must be signal-flow from from the ear to the brain that involves electricity and the recreation of the signal to be processed by the brain. reply jimmaswell 14 hours agoparentprevcould you find the exact one? reply skeledrew 13 hours agorootparentThe beat frequency? Not really; I used an app called Gnaural (on Android, hasn't been updated in years), and just selected the \"Power nap\" profile. It'll be theta or delta though, maybe a combination. reply zczc 9 hours agorootparentLooking at the beatfreq values in the XML source of the preset [1], it's indeed combination of 4 to 11 Hz beats (mostly theta) and 2 Hz (delta). [1] https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnaural/files/Presets/Minds... reply skeledrew 4 hours agorootparentOh nice, thanks. I didn't think to check the source. Been thinking to update the app myself though as it's not installing on my current device, and I'd like to explore BBs more. I've also found \"Energize\", \"Problem resolver\", \"Wakeup\", \"Rain shower\" and \"Babbling brook\" to be useful. The rest by comparison are pretty meh, or maybe I just didn't find a task match. reply elcritch 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are lots of them on YouTube now. I listen to one most nights. Just search for “sleep” and “binaural beats. reply carlbarrdahl 12 hours agorootparentI'm sure there are differences in their effectiveness. Based on my limited knowledge the sound frequencies attempt to put the brain into theta or delta frequencies and does this by creating a ghost signal (left ear 100hz - right 106hz gives a 6hz theta wave). Dreamachines work similarly (but mono) by creating a flickering light at set frequencies. I'm sure tactile vibrations or pulses could have some effect also. reply numtel 5 hours agorootparentI made this a few years ago after getting into Hemi Sync tapes to test out what different tones feel like. https://numtel.github.io/binaural-playground/ reply therobots927 18 hours agoprevIt’s pretty incredible that by showing the mice a light and music show, they were able to induce drainage of brain waste. That’s really exciting and I would love it if they could invent a hat to wear at night that accelerated the process while sleeping, effectively multiplying your time spent sleeping by some factor. It could be really effective for people with tough work schedules like doctors, truck drivers and pilots. reply Lammy 18 hours agoparent> It could be really effective for people with tough work schedules If such a thing were invented it would effectively become mandatory, because anybody not willing to use it would be out-competed for work by people who were. reply GenerocUsername 17 hours agorootparentYes, but early adopters would either move up in socioeconomic status, or develop new horrors beyond comprehension reply dullcrisp 16 hours agorootparentEither way, sign me up! reply therobots927 15 hours agorootparentYep, I’ll take more effective sleep any day reply DaoVeles 16 hours agorootparentprevSo modern society and many of its ills. reply titanomachy 14 hours agorootparentprevI don't know if that's true.

I found my sleep to decrease in length but I wake more rested. reply justinclift 18 hours agorootparentMake sure to check if it's legal in your jurisdiction before attempting to go and buy it. Saying that from personal experience after I returned to Australia from the UK, and popped into a local pharmacist to grab some to try it out. The lady behind the counter and the customer next to her acted like I'd literally asked to buy heroin. (!) It turns out Melatonin wasn't legal to buy at that time (a few years ago now), though the law has apparently been changed since. reply MrDrMcCoy 13 hours agorootparentIt's so weird to think that a naturally occurring hormone which is safely available in one first world country would be so restricted in another. reply Eavolution 11 hours agorootparentIt's not so weird to me, I don't know much about melatonin but testosterone (probably the most popular steroid) is also just a natural hormone reply supple-mints 2 hours agorootparentI think testosterone should be legalized. There are hundreds of black market websites that sell it to US customers and its usage is actually very common. Better to take the cryptocurrency, scams, counterfeits off the market. reply christophilus 7 hours agorootparentprevThyroid hormone is prescription only, and for good reason. Hormone overdose can be dangerous. reply Jedd 17 hours agorootparentprevI assume it's national not state based policy - I asked my pharmacist (in NSW) about this a few months back, evidently it's available to people over the age of 55 only. reply stephen_g 14 hours agorootparentYou can get a prescription from a doctor if you have trouble sleeping. My sleep doctor prescribed me a sublingual suspension instead of the tablets (you measure it with an oral syringe and squirt it under your tongue), and to take it earlier than what is recommended. I do just 1mg, 2 hours before sleep and since starting my sleep has been far, far better than it ever has been in my life. The sustained release tablets (like ‘Circadan’ or similar branding) I found were not good - I’d wake up groggy and generally didn’t get good sleep. They were just prescribed by a regular GP, and the sleep specialist I saw later on thinks it’s counter productive because they keep releasing longer than you want it to. reply Jedd 13 hours agorootparentYup, though for a cheaper option you can just buy it online (iherb stocks 3mg and 10mg tablets, f.e.). I have the 'Natrol' brand. The liquid form sounds like an interesting option. I haven't experimented much with timing - instructions suggest 20-30 minutes prior to bed, which I've been following for my very occasional usage. reply sundvor 13 hours agorootparentMy teenage son's paediatrician has no issues with my buying melatonin from iHerb vs the liquid on prescription, as the latter is obscenely expensive and wasn't covered by the PBS last time I checked. Their 3mg tablets work great for the both of us. reply jdironman 18 hours agorootparentprevI feel this will be very subjective of course. The biggest thing I have found I can do for a full rest (not length but quality) is no screens at all after 8pm and no lights except candle light after 930pm, coupled with reading by candle light. Melatonin does help me occasionally but it's hit or miss. Reading instead of watching or listening seems to be the biggest help. I guess different parts of my brain fires during that activity than normal. reply xattt 18 hours agorootparent> …no lights except candle light after 930pm… I am imagining a household transforming into Amish roleplay by 9:30 PM. I’ve achieved a similar-but-less-impactful effect by putting Zwave dimmer switches where I could, and setting the turn-on brightness to be lower during a “wind-down” house mode. reply Lammy 17 hours agorootparentprev> no screens at all after 8pm and no lights except candle light after 930pm I swear by blue-blocking glasses for this reason, especially when driving at night since the advent of obnoxiously bright LED (but I repeat myself) head and tail lights on every car.

I'll have to try these some time and see how they compare. reply salamo 17 hours agorootparentprevSwitching my smart lights to red works pretty well for me, although from the street it definitely looks like something unholy is happening in the apartment. reply therobots927 15 hours agorootparentYes I intend on getting smart lights. They’re expensive but I’m sure they’re worth it. reply lazide 17 hours agorootparentprevOr you’re running a brothel! reply p1esk 17 hours agorootparentprevFYI, candle light probably makes your air worse. reply vundercind 15 hours agorootparentI did the same thing for a while, and found it weirdly hard to replace with electricity. Most options are too bright, almost none are incandescent. If I try it again I’ll have to build my own battery powered lanterns with ultra-low-wattage incandescent bulbs (don’t want the spiky spectrum of LED for this purpose) to get them dim enough and in a useful form factor. I could read and get around just fine by two beeswax candles (and after getting used to that, full room lighting seemed insane, it’s so bright) but most things you can buy are at least 5x that bright. Even most plug in night lights are brighter than two beeswax tapers. reply sgarland 6 hours agorootparentI have Kasa Smartbulbs (KL110) for bedside and couch-side lamps. They claim 2700K, and while I don’t have a way to measure that, they feel pretty similar to incandescents. They’re also extremely dimmable, which was my main reason for getting them. At the lowest setting, they claim 10 lumens, which is roughly equivalent to a candle. Two of them in the living room at a low-moderate brightness are plenty for evening relaxation. reply therobots927 14 hours agorootparentprevI’m looking at getting Philips Hue bulbs. They’re expensive but look promising. I cannot stand the eco friendly bright white lightbulbs these days.

Recommendations?

I believe it helps reduce muscle cramping, improving my sleep. TIL There are many compounds avail OTC. The most common Mg-citrate upsets my tummy. After trying a few variataions, I settled on Mg-glycinate, which is also reasonably priced (vs say Mg-orotate). YMMV. Please consult your doc. Adverse effects, drug interactions, etc. Best, of course, is a nice hot bath with epsom salt. But that's not always practical. reply RamblingCTO 3 hours agorootparentprevOr, you know, fix the issues that prevent you from sleeping instead of messing with hormones. If you really need to sleep, take some GABA. Otherwise, work on it and maybe take magnesium. reply therobots927 15 hours agorootparentprevI need to get back into taking that. Good idea! reply j1mmie 19 hours agoprev> during sleep, slow electrical waves push the fluid around cells from deep in the brain to its surface. Is that what dreams are? Electrical waves and fluid knocking on our brain cells? reply cen4 15 hours agoparentRead this book few years back, that dreams are a way of different regions of the brain to defend territory. So the neurons in the visual processing region stop receiving input signal when one sleeps. Those neurons can then be used by neighboring regions for whatever. To prevent that takeover pseudo signals are created to keep them busy. Can't remember the name of the book, but it was a pretty cool theory. EDIT: found the book - Livewired by David Eagleman reply gradientsrneat 3 hours agoparentprevDreams occur during REM sleep. reply supple-mints 18 hours agoparentprevNo. reply aamoyg 16 hours agoprevI was going to say onto the Internet as a joke. reply nakedneuron 10 hours agoparentGlad you didn't! reply xnx 20 hours agoprevIt may sound a little woo woo, but I definitely feels this. After duration of difficult mental work (often difficult reading) I can feel my ability to focus slipping and eyes getting heavy. If I can successfully take a short deep nap (sometimes less than 15 minutes) all that is flushed away and I can focus again. Weird analogy, but a the relief is similar to emptying a full bladder. Related, not napping in these circumstances seems like it would be very unhealthy and damaging. reply therobots927 18 hours agoparentI wish I could take naps like that. I’m lucky that I don’t have trouble falling asleep at night but once the sun is up it’s like my brain just refuses to shut off. Once every week or two I’m able to pull off a nap in the late mornings. reply srcreigh 1 hour agorootparentIt’s not necessary to actually fall asleep. Just set a timer and relax. For me it’s only a semi-conscious pre sleep state, but it helps significantly. Do this if you get tired while driving too. It’s a life saving practice! (And no, driving tired isn’t always due to bad nights sleep. Glucose spikes can be dangerous even if you sleep well at night.) reply therobots927 1 hour agorootparentI’ll try that! Driving tired scares me. It’s tough when you’re driving through Nebraska for example and places to stop are so spaced out. All of a sudden the sleepiness just hits you and you’re cooked unless you pull over on the side of the highway, which is what you’re supposed to do. How do glucose spikes play into that? reply srcreigh 21 minutes agorootparentIt’s very scary. I hope your Nebraska highways have some exits/side roads you can pull into. I’ll do that sometimes, or find a town and park a gas station somewhere. Glucose spike is referring to the thanksgiving dinner effect where you get tired and need a nap after eating. Feeling tired after lunch. Etc. It can happen after almost any meal, even while well rested, etc. There’s ways to reduce the spikes but afaik once you get the spike, nap is the best solution. Coffee can help for some type of tiredness, but sometimes it’s not enough. I’ll do 15-20 min nap increments. Sometimes one nap isn’t enough, I need to rest longer. Thankfully, I can always tell when the one nap is insufficient before getting on the highway again. reply quartesixte 17 hours agoparentprevYou’re not far off the mark. Many jobs/skills that require intense mental concentration report practitioners needing a rest period or having an upper limit to performance. A notable example I remember are the United Nations’ live interpreters. They can only interpret a live conversation for only about 45 minutes before they have to switch off with a new interpreter because the error rate just exponentially goes up due to mental fatigue. reply mozman 19 hours agoparentprevI love to nap after a brain draining moment.

He liked to work long stretches, 10-12 hours, and then unwind for a few hours and sleep for 12 hours. Unfortunately just didn't work well with the real world. reply JKCalhoun 17 hours agorootparentEarth, anyway. reply crocowhile 19 hours agoparentprevyes, we've known for two centuries that a couple of hours of extra sleep can help us undo the effects of days and days of sleep deprivation. This is one of the strongest argument against this brain clearance non-sense. If we can get this done in 15 minutes, why sleep 8 hours a day? reply xarope 18 hours agorootparentsolo sailors (amongst others) do this; 30-90mins of sleep each time, but they cat nap all the time, not just once a day. However, research shows that long term learning etc, as well as critical decision making, are impaired. My anecdata of 1; I prefer 6-7 hours of sleep, but during some expeditions, I'd be lucky to get 2-3 hours before a summit attempt of 12-18 hours (leave at 1-2am, return to high camp by 3-4pm, pack up and head down to a lower level for safety). For safety, I make sure to practice all the skills required (rope, carabiner and knot handling) so these are \"routine\", and not require more cognitive effort to \"figure out\". A funny story during an expedition: a friend couldn't lift his foot whilst we were all preparing for some ice traverse - it was stuck for some reason, we all stood around wondering why, and we finally realised I was standing on one of his crampon straps. I swear it took us 10mins to figure this out, a result of sleep deprivation, high elevation, being swathed in layers of clothing, and general fatigue. reply janalsncm 19 hours agorootparentprevIt would be an amazing gift to be able to sleep even only half the time every day. That said, I have had the unsettling thought that the brain is never really “off” during your lifetime. With computers you can restart them, but your brain keeps going, even when you’re sleeping. So I think we should be nice to our brains. reply crocowhile 10 hours agorootparentIt would be an amazing gift to you, but it would not make sense from the evolutionary point of view. Take an animal of your choice (e.g. a cat or a dog or a mouse) and give them through magic the ability to sleep only 1 hour a day or nothing for the rest of their life. Do you think they would have an evolutionary advantage? Quite the opposite. they would end up burning more energy for nothing, having to look for more food and eventually endanger themselves to predation wondering, rather than cozy up in their nest sleeping. reply IncreasePosts 18 hours agorootparentprevRead more about Intel ME ;) reply Qem 6 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps decrease of waste with sleep is exponential, not linear. After days of sleep deprivation, waste concentration is very high, so initial clearance rate is very high as well. As is clears, concentration decrease, so concentration rate also decreases. reply crazygringo 19 hours agorootparentprevWhere are you getting 15 minutes from? That might be enough to recharge you to a normal level after something particularly taxing. It's not enough to restore you completely, and certainly not after an entire day's worth of activity. And there's so much more to sleep that you're missing, like consolidating memories, muscular coordination habits and patterns, etc. reply xnx 18 hours agorootparentI do regular full night's sleep. But when my brain is particularly spent, a short nap is nearly unavoidable. Afterward, I wake up on my own (no alarm) and can resume work immediately. No grogginess. reply JKCalhoun 17 hours agorootparentprevIf it were possible, not harmful, I imagine we would already be doing it.

LLMs with native audio input and output capabilities will likely make it easier to build fast-responding voice bots soon. But for the moment, I think this is the fastest possible approach/tech stack. firefoxd 11 hours agoWell that was fast. Kudos, really neat. Speed trumps everything else. I only noticed the robotic voice after I read the comments. I worked on an Ai for customer service. Our agent took the average response time of 24/48 hours to merely seconds. One of the messages that went to a customer was \"Hello Bitch, your package will be picked up by USPS today, here is the tracking number...\" The customer responded \"thank you so much\" and gave us a perfect score in CSAT rating. Speed trumps everything, even when you make such a horrible mistake. reply firefoxd 1 hour agoparentFun fact, we fixed this issue by adding a #profanity tag and dropping the message to the next human agent. Now our most prolific sales engineer could no longer run demos to potential clients. He had many embarrassing calls where the Ai would just not respond. His last name was Dick. reply lukan 10 hours agoparentprev\"The customer responded \"thank you so much\" and gave us a perfect score in CSAT rating.

And i general I also would not trust a LLM so much, that cannot divide between formal talk and ghetto slang. It will likely get other things wrong as well, humans will, too - so the error bar needs to be lower for me as a customer to be happier.

This is an ONNX port of Silero's VAD network. By cross-platform, I mean it works in Firefox too. It doesn't need a WebRTC session to work, just microphone access, so it's simpler. I'm curious about the browser providing this as a native option too. There are browser text-to-speech engines too, starting to get faster and higher quality. It would be great if browsers shipped with great TTS. GPT-4o has Automatic Speech Recognition, `understanding`, and speech response generation in a single model for low latency, which seems quite a good idea to me. As they've not shipped it yet, I assume they have scaling or quality issues of some kind. I assume people are working on similar open integrated multimodal large language models that have audio input and output (visual input too)! I do wonder how needed or optimal a single combined model is for latency and cost optimisation. The breakdown provided is interesting. I think having a lot more on the model on-device is a good idea if possible, like speech generation, and possibly speech transcription or speech understanding, at least right at the start. Who wants to wait for STUN? reply phkahler 2 hours agoparent>> I'm curious about the browser providing this as a native option too. IMHO the desktop environment should provide voice to text as a service with a standard interface to applications - like stdin or similar but distinct for voice. Apps would ignore it by default since they aren't listening, but the transcriber could be swapped out and would be available to all apps. reply regularfry 1 hour agoparentprevIf you do stt and tts on the device but everything else remains the same, according to these numbers that saves you 120ms. The remaining 639ms is hardware and network latency, and shuffling data into and out of the LLM. That's still slower than you want. Logically where you need to be is thinking in phonemes: you want the output of the LLM to have caught up with the last phoneme quickly enough that it can respond \"instantly\" when the endpoint is detected, and that means the whole chain needs to have 200ms latency end-to-end, or thereabouts. I suspect the only way to get anywhere close to that is with a different architecture, which would work somewhat more like human speech processing, in that it's front-running the audio stream by basing its output on phonemes predicted before they arrive, and only using the actual received audio as a lightweight confirmation signal to decide whether to flush the current output buffer or to reprocess. You can get part-way there with speculative decoding, but I don't think you can do it with a mixed audio/text pipeline. Much better never to have to convert from audio to text and back again. reply charlesyu108 2 hours agoparentprevLol this announcement blows what ive been working on out of the water but i have a simple assistant implementation with rick0123/VAD + Websockets. https://github.com/charlesyu108/voiceai-js-starter reply vessenes 7 hours agoprevThis is so, so good. I like that it seems to be a teaser app for cerebrium, if I understand it. It has good killer app potential. My tests from iPad ranged from 1400ms to 400ms reported latency; in the low end, it felt very fluid. One thing this speed makes me think is that for some chat workflows you’ll need/get to have kind of a multi-step approach — essentially, quick response, during which time a longer data / info / RAQ query can be farmed out, then the informative result picks up. Humans work like this; we use lots of filler words as we sort of get going responding to things. Right now, most workflows seem to be just one shot prompting, or in the background, parse -> query -> generate. The better workflow once you have low latency response is probably something like: [3s of LLama 8b in your ears] -> query -> [55s of Llama 70b/GPT4/whatever you want, informed by query]. Very cool, thank you for sharing this. reply za_mike157 5 hours agoparentHi Vessenes From Cerebrium here. Really appreciate the feedback - glad you had a good experience! This application is easy to extend/implement meaning you can edit it to however you like: - Swap in different LLM's, STT and TTS models - Change prompts as well as implement RAG etc In partnership with Daily, we really wanted to focus on the engineer here. So make it extremely flexible for them to edit the application to suit their use case/preference while at the same time take away the mundane infrastructure setup. You can read more about how to extend it here: https://docs.cerebrium.ai/v4/examples/realtime-voice-agents reply c0brac0bra 4 hours agoparentprevI've wondered about this as well. Is there a way to have a small, efficient LLM model that can estimate general task complexity without actually running the full task workload? Scoring complexity on a gradient would let you know you need to send a \"Sure, one second let me look that up for you.\" instead of waiting for a long round trip. reply vessenes 3 hours agorootparentFor sure: in fact MoE models train such a router directly, and the routers are not super large. But it would also be easy to run phi-3 against a request. I almost think you could do like a check my work style response: ‘I’m pretty sure xx, .. wait, actually y.’ Or if you were right, ‘yep that’s correct. I just checked.’ There’s time in there to do the check and to get the large model to bridge the first sentence with the final response. reply _def 8 hours agoprevThis was fun to try out. Earlier this week I tried june-va and the long response time kind of killed the usefulness. It's a great feature to get fast responses, this feels much more like a conversation. Funny enough, I asked it to tell me a story and then it only answered with one sentence at a time, requiring me to say \"yes\", \"aha\", \"please continue\" to get the next line. Then we had the following funny conversation: \"Oh I think I figured out your secret!\" \"Please tell me\" \"You achieve the short response times by keeping a short context\" \"You're absolutely right\" reply danielbln 6 hours agoparentThat works for me, to be honest. not the short context, but definitely the short replies. Contrast that with the current implementation of ChatGPT's voice mode, where you ask something and then get a minute worth of GPT bla bla. reply realyashnag 3 hours agoprevThis was scary fast.

Silero runs via onnx-runtime (with wasm). Whilst it sort-of-kinda works in Firefox, the VAD seems to misfire more than it should, causing the latency numbers to be somewhat absurd. I really want to get it working though! I'm still trying.

It creates a 100% reliable paper trail of what the model heard and said in the conversation. This can be extremely important in some applications where you need to review and validate what was said. reply isaacfung 8 hours agorootparentThere are way more text training data than voice data.

I've wondererd why you could not introduce a small sound that overplays the waiting time? Like an \"hmm\" to skip a few 100ms of the response time? Could be pregenerated (like 500 different versions) and play after 200ms of the last users input. reply andrewmcwatters 27 minutes agoprevI love it when engineers worth their salt actually do the back-of-the-envelope calculations for latency, etc. Tangentially related, I remember years ago when Stadia and other cloud gaming products were being released doing such calculations and showing a buddy of mine that even in the best case scenario, you'd always have high enough input latency to make even casual multiplayer FPS games over cloud gaming services not feasible, or rather, comfortable, to play. Other slower-paced games might work, but nothing requiring serious twitch gameplay reaction times. The same math holds up today because of a combination of fundamental limits and state of the art limits. reply c0brac0bra 7 hours agoprevI've been developing with Deepgram for a while, and this is one of the coolest demos I've seen with it! I am curious about total cost to run this thing, though. I assume that on top of whatever you're paying Cerebrium for GPU hosting you're also having to pay for Deepgram Enterprise in order to self-host it. To get the latency reduction of several hundred milliseconds how much more would it be for \"average\" usage? reply za_mike157 5 hours agoparentHey! From the Cerebrium team here! So our costs are based on the infra you use to run your application and we charge per millisecond of compute. Some things to note that we might do differently to other providers: 1. You can specify your EXACT requirements and we charge you only for that. Eg: if you want 2 vCPU, 12GB Memory and 1 A10 GPU we charge you for that which is 35% less if you rented a whole A10 2. We have over 10 variety of GPU chips so you can choose the price/performance trade-off 3. While you can extend this on the Cerebrium platform, it cannot be used commercially. We are speaking to Deepgram to see how we can offer it to customers. Hopefully I can provide more updates on this soon reply c0brac0bra 4 hours agorootparentExcellent; thanks for the info. reply mmcclure 10 hours agoprevWow, Kwin, you’ve outdone yourself!

Thank you. I went back and looked at actual benchmark numbers from a couple of years ago and the numbers I got were ~26ms one-way. I rounded up to 30 to be conservative, but then double-counted in the table above. Will fix in the technical write-up.

I know making a real-time voice bot is not easy with this low latency. which LLM did you use? how large LLM to make the conversation efficient? reply yjftsjthsd-h 14 hours agoprevDumb question - I see 2 opus encodes and decodes for a total around 120ms; is opus the fastest option? reply kwindla 14 hours agoparentYes, Opus is the fastest and best option for real-time audio. It was designed to be flexible and to encode/decode at fairly low latencies. It sounds good for narrow-band (speech) at low bitrates but also works well at higher bitrates for music. And forward error correction is part of the codec standard. It's possible to tweak the Opus settings to reduce that encode/decode latency substantially. Which might actually be worth doing for this use case. But there isn't quite a free lunch, here. The default Opus frame size is 20ms. Smaller frames lower the encoding/decoding latency, but increase the bitrate. The implementation in libwebrtc is very well tested and optimized for the default 20ms frame sizes and maybe not so much at other frame sizes. Experience has made me leery of taking the less-trodden-paths without a lot of manual testing. reply jaybrendansmith 15 hours agoprevThis thing is incredible.

Sorry for the sarcasm. maybe im just slow, but when I'm trying to formulate a question on the spot, I pause a lot. having the chatbot jump in and interrupt is frustrating.

The speed is impressive, but the key to a useful voice chatbot (which I've never seen) is one that adapts to your speaking style, identifies and employs turn-taking signals. I acknowledge there are multiple viable patterns of social interaction, some talk over each other, and find that fun and engaging, while others think that's just the worst, and wait for a clear signal for their turn to speak and expect the same.

Deposition can be very precise (they say micron-level resolution here), but it's typically slow for a naive approach. That's not necessarily a problem if you need that precision. They say their approach is fast, probably by using some kind of array of nozzles (think an inkjet printer head). 2. You can also selectively run the process in reverse, so an electrochemical printer is actually a combo additive and subtractive manufacturing machine. 3. Because it's electrochemistry, I believe such a 3D printer is mostly restricted to depositing pure elemental metals and only a few alloys. This severely restricts your material selections.

On the assumption that I couldn’t afford such a machine myself for DIY, it would be really cool to have a send-cut-send like service. It seems like the relatively gentle process and I assume predictable results with minimal post processing would lend itself to an high degree of automation. Perhaps a scale out manufacturing set up where the speed of an individual machine is less important than the throughput of having many machines. There are a lot of little random things that I would design if I knew there was a capability to have it made at non-aerospace prices. Initially heatsinks, manifolds, heat exchangers, but possibly many random things depending on the pricing. reply Tossrock 13 hours agorootparentYou can get on-demand metal printing from Shapeways. Somewhat expensive compared to sendcutsend, but still far below aerospace. reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentSure, there is a huge gamut of prices from aerospace to just above material costs. On the expensive side I would use it judiciously, on the economical side I would use it for just about everything and so would many others. I do a bit of DIY and a large amount of the design work is to work around limitations of cheaper materials and cheaper processes. Most of what I make is onesie-twosie where the design costs dominate so I can afford to spend more on a more expensive materials and processes to cut back on the design. But it would be extra amazing if there was an economical high quality process that is suitable for prototyping and would also be amenable to cost competitive mass manufacturing. That would be absolutely world changing. If I could just list designs somewhere and customers have them printed on demand, either via Amazon or some drop-ship, I could recoup a lot of the design costs so I could spend more time designing things - maybe even make a career out of it. Instead of needing a whole factory to support the low cost manufacturing of a single part it could just be a design document sitting on a server somewhere. I understand that it is not in Fabric8s interest to do this though, expensive machines are high margin and exclusivity is required to maintain a bit of a monopoly for their customers so that their customers can justify purchasing the expensive machines in the first place. If Fabric8 were to start out with expensive machines and then subsequently release cheaper machines they would burn their previous customers. That would make this one of the many cool things that I can't use until the patents expire which would be a damn shame and would also make the technology completely uninteresting to me as I would have to focus on alternatives in the interim. It took a long time to go from Rep-Rap to Bambu Labs for FDM but with increased interest in the space that process is speeding up. Hopefully Micronics will manage a consumer Nylon SLS printer. A ton of small scale manufacturing technology is being made cheaply enough for home use and services like PCBWay and Send-Cut-Send have really democratized high quality manufacturing. I can make many things production quality with near zero overheads and I can buy things from others who have done the same at similarly low costs. Something like send-cut-send for ECAM seems inevitable and it would be up to Fabric8 to decide if they want to cannibalize themselves instead of having someone else undercut them. I don't know how defendable their patents are, there does seem to be a fair amount of prior art. There is probably a bunch of trade secrets though. For them one of the downsides of having such a promising solution is that there is an even greater incentive for competitors to enter the market. I would posit that long term there is more money to be made with a scale-out low margin mass market solution where they could better leverage trade secrets gleaned from process experience than than selling individual high margin machines. If they kept overheads low enough it would never be in anyone else's interest to enter the market and they could leverage their trade secrets for above average returns ad infinitum. reply Tossrock 1 hour agorootparent> If I could just list designs somewhere and customers have them printed on demand, either via Amazon or some drop-ship, I could recoup a lot of the design costs so I could spend more time designing things - maybe even make a career out of it.

The feedstock is effectively water based so none of the flammability risks of metal powder. No special gases required, no high powered lasers or thermal processing sytems. That being said it still is an industrial process and requires responsible handling of the feedstock and equipment to ensure safety to personnel and the environment. reply tastyfreeze 3 hours agorootparentprevMetallic ionic solutions are usually strong acids.

Every metal 3D printer requires high temperatures, inert and reducing gasses to prevent oxidation, and most of them require powdered metal, whether for something like DMLS or powder bed technologies. The accuracy is also impressive. One of the ancillary ideas that I and a few others came up with in exploring binder jetting was 3D organ printing because the feature size is quite small. I wonder if there's a world where you could use an analogous process on a solution of individual cells. reply dpain 15 hours agoparentYes! One of the major benefits from not using a powdered metal feedstock is that minimum feature size is no longer limited by powder size, and instead is determined by our electrode \"pixel\" size which is 33 microns today and will get even smaller over time. The room temperature deposition process also means we can print directly onto substrates like PCBs, ceramics or Silicon wafers to enable some very unique functionality. reply AbrahamParangi 9 hours agorootparentvery cool that you don’t need to worry about thermal effects, nice work! reply ben_w 22 hours agoprevGood to see!

Can you speak to the minimum resolution and wear rate/lifetime with single electrode approaches? reply petermcneeley 16 hours agorootparentI would imagine resolution mostly comes down size of electrode and how close you can get that to the substrate and grow the deposit in a controlled fashion. Mine were 25um. As for wearing out the electrode; madden's paper probably has some information. I would expect the wear to be similar to the oxygen side of electrolysis (water). https://darkcephas.github.io/MELED_paper/MELED_paper.pdf reply ben_w 12 hours agorootparentThanks, interesting read. reply kragen 16 hours agorootparentprevi'd forgotten all about madden's work! thanks for this! how did your project go? reply petermcneeley 16 hours agorootparentI actually got to meet Madden multiple times and he even gave me access to his lab. My physics profs were very impressed by my project but I was disappointed. This electro deposition effect is a bit like lightning and didnt work well with my theories about trying to use a multielectrode head with different voltages to produce a shaped potential. reply kragen 16 hours agorootparentyeah, i've been thinking about that too. how did you model the field? reply petermcneeley 16 hours agorootparentI dont think there was any rigor in modeling of the field. I did this entire project as one semester as one of my last undergrad courses. I wish I had more time and resources for the project but by then I knew I was headed outside the university into software development. https://darkcephas.github.io/MELED_paper/MELED_paper.pdf From what I heard the state of the art was to move away from electrodes and to use lasers. So how that works is that you have the normal electrolytic solution but you apply a passive voltage below the activation voltage. Then you use the laser to break down the double layer at the substrate surface. This leads to laser controlled deposition. reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentneat! i was wondering if that would work last week i feel like it's probably easier to have 1000 electrodes than 1000 lasers tho reply Haemm0r 15 hours agorootparentOptics may help to reduce the amount of lasers. reply dpain 15 hours agoparentprevYes the microelectrode array is the key to driving parallelism of the process, making it area based (layer-at-once) rather than point deposition. DLP/LCD vs laser SLA or FDM is a good analogy! reply kbenson 22 hours agoprevMy understanding is that most current metal 3d printing yields items with significantly worse properties with respect to shear forces, because of how the molecules align compared to when it's melted together as a whole and cooled (or something like that, I can't find the research paper someone linked to me in the past here regarding that).

Specifically, there's quite a lot of energy that goes into making the metal powders that is avoided as the input to the ECAM system is a precursor material several steps upstream of a typical refined metal. reply kragen 16 hours agoparentprevin general electrolytic processes are very energy-intensive, and i'm sure fabric8labs's process is no exception reply FrostKiwi 16 hours agorootparentInteresting! Can you reference some numbers? Other processes such as SLM and DED require a powerful laser, starting from 3000W. When talking about copper specifically and especially when wanting higher processes speed, you need higher wavelength blue laser reaching 10000W of power. But on the flipside, the process can be quite quick. Non-laser alternatives like Metal Paste Deposition need a furnace, though I'm unsure of the power requirements there. Any idea or references on how ECAM would compare to that? reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentevery metal atom requires two electrons (or three for some metals), and you typically need 1–3 volts, and sometimes there are side reactions that waste most of your electrons; probably 'faradaic efficiency' or 'coulombic efficiency' is the term to google slm and ded and metal paste deposition just have to rearrange some crystal structures; in electrolysis (including ecm machining) and electrodeposition you have to actually rip molecules apart, atom by atom and electron by electron basically you're charging a battery, so you can get a rough idea by thinking about how much energy a battery could store if it was the same size as your desired workpiece reply heisenbit 11 hours agorootparentprevBased on the graph the process is producing way less CO2 than other additive processes. Being low temperature this intuitively seems a credible claim. Maybe you are concerned about high currents which is true but since voltage is low that does not multiply to much. reply naasking 5 hours agorootparentIt's because that chart is measuring end-to-end energy use.

    "originBody": "A New Package for Making Charts in Emacs: eplot One of the items on my todo list was: And that’s because I’ve been looking for an easy way to do simple plots for yonks. When I did a post about movie ratings, I tried chart.el: It’s a built-in thing in Emacs that has its origins as a testing tool for eieio, and as such, it is pretty limited. But it basically did what I needed? Except for… man, look at that Y axis. This cannot stand! Bad axes marking is a personal bugaboo — I hate them sooo much! But it’s easy to understand how they end up that way, because it’s a genuinely tricky problem. For instance, for decades Google Finance had charts looking like this, with totally nonsensical axes. They basically just use the largest number as the highest Y marking, and then add a couple lines equidistant towards origo, and then go off and collect their paychecks. These useless charts were there until, I think, 2021? I used to check them irregularly for years to see whether they’d gotten sufficiently embarrassed by this shameful thing, but nope. But then they reimplemented the entire site, and they finally got proper axes. I was particularly interested because I worked for a stock broker, and one of the first things I did (back in 1997-ish) was implementing a chart library: And the problem isn’t exactly “hard” in a “solve for Eulers dilemma” maths way, but it just requires some thought about what “pleasing numbers” are (basically 1, 2 and 5 in various scales), and thoughtful handling of the many border cases you get when plotting stock charts (a range can be between $0.00001 and $0.00002, or between 1e9 and 1e10 etc etc), and how do to time periods (years, sure, but then half years and then quarters and months and weeks? and then possibly divide months into weeks? so many details). So why didn’t I just use this PHP thing for my charts? Well, while it’s really convenient to generate stuff on a web server — that’s not really very convenient when you’re futzing around in Emacs with some numbers. There’s a reason Excel and Jiputer Notebooks are so popular, after all — interactively massaging the data until it shows what you want it to show is where it’s at. I mean, giving others an optimal experience of the data. Now, of course Org has functions for doing plots, but… it uses Gnuplot as the backend, and I’ve never enjoyed how Gnuplot does anything: Again, look at that Y axis and roll your eyes. I mean, it’s chosen nice numbers for the axis, but the formatting? I mean, Gnuplot is perfectly OK, but… But mainly, I had a stomach bug thing, so I didn’t really have anything to do, so I decided to type up this thing anyway. So: Look! The Y axis! It has numbers that make sense! And… I wasn’t really going to implement everything from chart.php, but when I got started, it was just irresistible to do everything. But also more, like “dark mode”. One fun thing in the PHP library are the gradients, which were painstakingly written by hand (including a GIF colour map resource thing, if I remember correctly). So they were painted pixel by pixel, I think? But in the Emacs Lisp version, I just use SVG, and SVG has support for gradients. So I just make a polygon and gradient that (as shown above). And here’s the PHP original. Looks pretty similar? Just about the only thing I didn’t implement was this other, weird gradient, because… er… well, it would be hard! I’d have to re-implement the pixel by pixel thing… or at least line by line thing, and that would involve math and stuff. But it’s not like anybody would use that… But it does look nice in the backgrounds? *sigh* Nah, not gonna implement it. So what does the Emacs user interface for this look like? You go to a buffer with a lot of numbers in, and you type M-x eplot. (Yes, I had to call the thing eplot, since chart was taken.) It’ll then pop up a buffer and show the plot. But how do you then adjust the plot? After all, the point of all this is that it should be easy to tweak plots until you get what you want, so… To digress a bit — sometimes I happen upon what seems to be nice libraries (or frameworks, as they often call themselves), and the selling point is often “we do all the boring stuff for you! Things just work!” And then they present a minimal example, like I’ve done here, and then they sort of leave it hanging how you do the rest. So when you google that, you discover that if you want to change any of the defaults, you have to write a depth-first traversal algorithm (in Haskell), and then override all of the stuff everywhere, and then you end up with 4x as much code as if you’d just written the darn thing yourself the way you wanted it. That is: Many frameworks seem to actually have the motto “we make the simple things trivial, and then the slightly more difficult things almost impossible”. So — I hope I haven’t landed there myself? OK, the first “extra” thing I did was introduce the concept of “headers”, like this: I’m using a compact format with a small chart, just as a demonstration here — don’t need all that scrolling on the blog here. And that’s basically it — most of the different variations you see in the very first image on this blog post are by these simple headers thingies. All the useful things can be controlled by these headers, so iterating through this stuff is fast — just add some headers and C-c C-c and then you immediately see the results. (Yes, there’s an eplot mode to make this easier.) Yada yada. I’ve even written a README.md file that documents all the various possibilities. This is still very much a work in progress, but I’ve put it on Microsoft Github. I think it should basically be somewhat useful now, but I’ve been hacking away at this for a week now, and I keep redoing everything, so perhaps not? In any case, the code is a complete mess now as I’ve been programming it test case by test case, in the least efficient way possible, and I need to consolidate a lot of code paths, and make the code more readable. But I feel like taking a break now, so I just pushed it. So there. Caveat end userage. Like this: Like Loading...

One thought, using Emacs' feature of file- and directory-local variables for the chart config might make for a more flexible UX. (For example, I might be generating the data files and not want to have to manually modify before charting, or I might have a large directory of data files that I'd like to plot at will without having to apply a header by hand to each.) reply breck 8 hours agoprevNeat! Really clever simplicity on how you added gradients. This is one of my favorite spaces, so I'll add some generic advice which may or may not be helpful. I once had the privilege of working for Max Roser and Hannah Ritchie at Our World in Data, as one of the engineers on their Grapher library (https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher), and learned a ton from them (and others on the team) about making great charts. My one piece of advice from looking at your examples would be: don't neglect title, subtitle, and caption! They would be so easy to do well because you've already created your \"simple headers thingies\". A few words go along way. Check out \"Storytelling with Data\" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic for a great read on the subject. Owid's Grapher does those the best, IMO (followed closely by DataWrapper.de -- but that's not open source). At some point, if you keep up with this, you'll also want to add a dataflow library and DSL. Hadley Wickham's dplyr in R was the GOAT, and I copied that in my Ohayo tool and in OWID Grapher's CoreTable library (https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher/tree/master/packages/%4...). Jeffrey Heer's newish Arquero (https://idl.uw.edu/arquero/) library is also along those lines. Lately I've delving into Mike Bostock's new thing Plot (https://observablehq.com/plot/). So far, excited by it, but only spent a day or two with it at this point. I don't use emacs anymore, but hopefully something helpful in the comments above. reply zelphirkalt 10 hours agoprevOne could also use Python and matplotlib for plotting in org mode. Gnuplot is not the only thing one can use. reply codetrotter 9 hours agoparentMatplotlib already has a pretty uncomfortable API. I can’t imagine that wrapping that in a layer of elisp would result in anything nice to use at all. It would probably be a case of the thing OP mentioned, where the amount of code needed would exceed just doing it yourself. reply setopt 9 hours agorootparentGnuplot is the best plotting interface I’ve ever used. Once you’ve learned “the Gnuplot language”, it’s very fast and efficient to visualize anything and iterate on it interactively, and I personally find it more usable than GGPlot, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, and Matlab. I think Gnuplot is undervalued because by default the results look horrible. Like many power tools, it requires some config in ~/.gnuplotrc to modernize the looks; http://gnuplotting.org/ is a great source to get started. Unfortunately, I’m mostly using Matplotlib these days because the data generation is in Python. But despite using it on and off for over a decade, I’m nowhere near my efficiency in Gnuplot, and often have to ask Google or Copilot for help if I’m doing something more complex. reply arnsholt 8 hours agorootparentGnuplot is fantastic. And with the epslatex terminal, it sets the graphics in EPS and the text elements in TeXsobtgat you can get everything typeset juuuuuust right. reply billfruit 2 hours agorootparentprevI find Gnuplot syntax to be terse and unintuitive, and having poor discoverability without constantly refer to the docs. reply setopt 11 minutes agorootparentIn Gnuplot you can indeed write each command in a very terse way; some simple examples: plot cos(x) ls 2, sin(x) ls 3 plot 'file.dat' u 1:2 w lp ls 1 lw 3 ps 2 But you can also write the same code in a descriptive way: plot cos(x) linestyle 2, sin(x) linestyle 3 plot 'file.dat' using 1:2 with linespoints linestyle 1 linewidth 3 pointsize 2 I think most people prefer the terse version once they learn it. But I’d definitely recommend learning the descriptive commands first, as the abbreviations follow very naturally from there. reply dima55 4 hours agorootparentprevTo address your python woes: https://github.com/dkogan/gnuplotlib/ Gnuplot is excellent, and I use it every day. reply lordgrenville 5 hours agorootparentprevYou're not wrapping it in elisp. You can just write matplotlib in a code block, evaluate it, and pop out an image to your buffer. reply zelphirkalt 9 hours agorootparentprevMatplotlib has 2 APIs, a procedural one and an object oriented one. Which one are we talking about? Or both? reply Cacti 6 hours agorootparentprevSeaborn, plotly, datashader, etc. all exist to wrap matplotlib and they are wildly successful. Is there some reason an equally good interface couldn’t be written in elisp? reply Pinus 8 hours agoparentprevOne thing that always bothers me with both matplotlib and gnuplot, is that they literally seem to have a command (or function call) for everything. To set the tick size for the third-level ticks on the Y axis, you call set_third_level_y_ticks() or something like that. This is not necessarily bad (and maybe it has to be this way — I haven’t even tried to analyse the problem) but it feels very un-orthogonal, like everything is special-cased. reply natrys 8 hours agoparentprevThere is also ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics) which, among other things, supercharges org-mode with R/Julia, which means the likes of ggplot2 or makie.

Codeberg does seem to be gaining some momentum with FOSS projects now though, at long last. reply rty32 6 hours agorootparentWhy do FOSS projects use github? Because it's a good product, simple. It has lots of features that people use every day that you don't necessarily find on other source code platforms. For example, their new code search is top class. You won't realize what's missing until you try to do the same thing elsewhere. GitHub also gets a lot of details right e.g. in pull requests and issue management. Added to that, it has the largest community of developers, and those who would potentially participate in FOSS projects likely already have an account. It's where people already are and what they are familiar with. (I have contributed to a few FOSS projects on github.) reply LightFog 6 hours agorootparentThis ‘everyone is using it so I need to also’ logic is funny to me, given the idea of the F in FOSS is to use network effects to spread the idea of software freedom. Using and thus endorsing a proprietary platform with ever increasing integration into the software lifecycle seems to do the exact opposite of that. reply toolslive 3 hours agorootparent\"eat $h*t: a billion flies can't be wrong\".

While placing the code in Codeberg only to get warm feelings. reply tetris11 6 hours agorootparentYou have it backwards. The beloved projects were already successful without those paychecks, hence why those companies took an interest in them in the first place and didn't (at least publicly) try to create their own alternatives knowing that they wouldnt be able to compete. Since the companies have been in the extend phase of their EEE logic, their contributions to open source have been helpful, granted. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentI have been around long enough, hence why I can offer some reality checks. > 1998: Many major companies such as IBM, Compaq and Oracle announce their support for Linux. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux The C language it was written on, has come into existence thanks to AT&T paychecks, landing on Ken Thompson and Brian Kernighan bank accounts. reply tetris11 3 hours agorootparentYou omitted: > 1996: Version 2.0 of the Linux kernel is released. The kernel can now serve several processors at the same time using symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and thereby becomes a serious alternative for many companies. Linux had been around for half a decade at that point, and companies took note and reacted accordingly in 1998. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentUntil 1998 was a toy kernel, that barely worked except in very special cases, as someone that tried to use 1.0.9 with IDE CD-ROMs in 1994, or fighting with X modeline for the graphics card to display a barely working 800x600 in 1996, will recall.

    "originLink": "https://www.joanwestenberg.com/6-months-ago,-i-left-the-bullshit-industrial-complex",
    "originBody": "I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars, and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether there was an ounce of truth in it. I was running a profitable tech PR agency. It looked impressive enough on LinkedIn. It paid for fancy dinners and weekend getaways. I had the clients, the connections, and a couple of shiny awards gathering dust on my bookshelf. My phone buzzed constantly. But something was starting to unravel. Like a loose thread on a comfortable sweater. You know you shouldn't pull on it, but you can't help yourself. A nagging doubt. An odd moment of \"Jesus, what the hell am I doing?\" I would lie awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It had been years since I'd displayed a shred of journalistic integrity. The thread kept unraveling. One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release touting yet another \"game-changing\" startup that had raised - yet another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn't remember the last time I'd written something I believed in. The words that used to flow felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty tube. That was the day I cracked. It wasn't about the individual startups or the overhyped products. It was the whole damn ecosystem—if we can call it that. The inflated valuations, cult-like frat house “culture,” and the relentless, mindless pursuit of growth that comfortably glossed over the human cost of \"disruption.\" Somewhere along the way, I'd allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex. I'd convinced myself that I was part of something bigger, something world-changing. But deep down, in the quiet moments between pitch meetings and product launches, I knew better. It was a slow-building wave, gathering momentum with every story I was hired to spin, every tone-deaf founder I media-trained to sidestep hard questions, every time I was asked to massage the numbers and make a struggling startup look like a unicorn in waiting. Going back to my roots as a writer felt like coming up for air after a long, deep dive in a river of shit. The first few months were disorienting as hell. It's tough adjusting to life outside the echo chamber. I've had to relearn how to write without an agenda, how to ask questions without anticipating the \"right\" answers, how to look at the tech industry with clear eyes. There are days when I question my decision—when I gather up the courage to look at my dwindling bank account, for example. Tech has a way of tempting you back, whispering sweet nothings about stock options and catered lunches. Well-meaning friends in the industry have texted, called, emailed. They've told me that I'm burning bridges, that a critical stance will make me unemployable in tech circles. They've advised me to soften my tone, to find a middle ground that won't alienate potential future employers or clients. I get it. I do. In an industry built on network effects, taking a stand can feel like career suicide. The pressure to conform, to go along with the prevailing narrative, is immense. Trust me, I know. But then I sit down to write, and I remember why the fuck I'm doing this. I write about the human cost of gig economy apps that treat workers as disposable resources. I write about the venture capital industry that repeatedly and stubbornly fails to invest in anyone who doesn't look like Mark Zuckerberg's clone. I can't go back to writing comforting VC pandering fictions. I won't do it, no matter how many zeroes are dangled in front of me. This isn't to say that I've become an anti-tech fanatic, railing against all notions of progress. Technology has potential when it's guided by ethical considerations and a genuine desire to improve the human condition. I've spent the last 6 months interviewing founders who are building companies without following the VC playbook, without setting fire to the world around them. But I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a blind pursuit of \"disruption\" will lead us to a better world. I've seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders' vision. I've watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started their companies in the first place. I'm reminded of a quote attributed to Upton Sinclair: \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\" For years, my salary—and my sense of self-worth—depended on not understanding the deeper implications of my work. I can't keep faking blameless ignorance. I don't know where this will lead me. The tech industry has a long memory. So it goes. At least I have my integrity. The machine may grind on, but I'm glad to have stepped off the treadmill. Howard Zinn said: \"You can't be neutral on a moving train.\" Tech is an out-of-control locomotive with no fucking brakes, and I've chosen where I stand. It may not be a comfortable or lucrative position, but it's one I can live with. And for the first time in years, when I look in the mirror, I can recognize the person looking back. That's worth all the stock options in the world. Subscribe to @Westenberg and never miss a post.

I feel there is so much disillusionment among folks that came of age during the 90s because there was so much techno optimism then, and it didn't quite turn out like we envisioned. Two things made me think about this recently: 1. I saw a Reddit post that was titled something like \"The 90s were peak humanity. Enough tech to make life comfortable, but not so much that it had totally taken over the focus.\" It was a video of a packed mall around the holidays filled with generally happy people socializing in public. 2. That viral quote that was making the rounds, \"I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.\" I just feel there has been a growing chasm over the past 25 years where tech is no longer solving pressing human problems (generally, obviously not true in all areas e.g. decarbonization tech) but is more concerned with just rent-seeking value extraction. reply ryandrake 13 hours agoparentI used to love computers and software. When the next great thing came out, I’d be an enthusiastic early adopter, and enjoyed the new powers the technology gave me. Now, whenever something new comes out, my first thought is: “how is this thing going to suck up my personal data and monetize me?” And my second thought is “how is this going to wreck some part of life and/or humanity and turn it into profits for the rich?” You can’t be a techno-optimist anymore. Everyone is working on a similar, but slightly different wealth-siphoning Torment Nexus these days. reply m463 12 hours agorootparentThat is how I felt. Computers made everyone's life better! My opinion is that \"the big sellout\" happened when apple introduced the iphone and the apple app store. and it basically came down to a couple nuances in their policies... #1 apps have unfettered network access #2 apple would never approve security apps like a firewall (because #1) and when a big player sets an example, it normalizes the situation for everyone else. I think it was seen (or sold) as \"advertising will fund everything\" just like television, radio and print advertising did in the past. Except the old advertising was one-way. Advertising today means ubiquitous surveillance and dossier building on every person on the planet. It's been ~ 17 years of this iphone BS, and now behavior is creeping into every app, device and platform. Look at microsoft breaking new ground in appalling behavior with each software update. Thank goodness for linux, open software, open hardware and people coming up with great hacks all the time. reply prox 11 hours agorootparentThis seems like historical revisionism. Not saying Apple wasn’t part of a certain trend, but it’s an odd bone to pick since Apple technically is one of the few companies that relies on hardware sales, not ad revenue. Google is far more likely to fit your profile. It’s where ads (adwords and adsense) started to transform the web. First just a few cute banners at the top. And these days some sites just plaster the whole page with them. Even still it’s hard to pick any singular company that started to make tech suck, they all followed or initiated trends that made things worse from a consumer standpoint. reply FrancisMoodie 10 hours agorootparentIt's hard to pick any singular company that started to make tech suck because it's a result of the economical structure in which these companies are trying to exist. The neverending search for more profit, more growth every quarter has made it impossible for companies to adopt a strategy that is not focussed on consumer exploitation, at least in the long run. reply prox 6 hours agorootparentAgreed, they also calculate in “future profit” in the valuation and so you need to always hit your targets. reply ryandvm 5 hours agorootparentprevAgree. Ad-based businesses are eating the world. They hoover up data, invade your privacy, and then set up moats around their little fiefdoms (when they aren't selling your data to the other fiefdoms). And every ad-based business has the same underlying strategy: steal from the finite amount of attention you have and use it to extract your wealth. reply Terr_ 11 hours agorootparentprevIn think it boils down to the difference between technology as capital that individuals could acquire and control for their own priorities, versus technology controlled by a large company to deliver--or deny--a limited service to individuals. While the past 30 years have absolutely put the \"personal\" into \"personal computer\", I'd rather have a personal assistant than a personal overseer. reply ryandrake 5 hours agorootparentI agree with this most out of all the replies. The PC of the 90s was a personally empowering device. You bought it from the manufacturer (or individual parts), took it home, turned it on, and it was yours, and only yours, to explore and use. You could make it do whatever you wanted, up to the limits of the hardware and your programming ability. You decided when to turn it on and off, what to run on it and when. These devices existed for the benefit of the users, and to make your life easier and better. Modern technology lost this. Everything now comes with a hidden, or not so hidden, tether to various companies. Unlike the PC of the 90s, ModernDevices today are limited. And the limits are artificial and set by the device and OS manufacturers, not set by physics or your own personal skill with the device. Now you constantly have these manufacturers looking over what you're doing, to ensure it's OK with them, and to ensure it's still making them money. And as soon as what you want to do with your ModernDevice conflicts with what all these various companies want you to do with them, they get to ultimately decide, not you. The companies are more and more deciding when the device can be turned on and off, what can and cannot run on it and when. These devices exist for the benefit of their manufacturers. Companies' paternalistic attitude of \"What should we allow users to do?\" is what soured new technology for me. reply bboygravity 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's interesting to read this from a market research perspective. I have a very similar opinion and also consider(ed) myself an early adopter. This may just mean that early adopters are now signaliing that they are getting bored with software/tech and the rest of the market may soon follow that opinion. reply copperx 12 hours agorootparentMaybe it means they're not bored with what tech gives them right now. In the past we adopted new startups such as JustinTV, YouTube, and Instagram because they gave us something we didn't have front and center. Live streaming, video, and stylized photos. Now every social network offers all kinds of media and in different engagement foemats, and the algorithms keep us entertained enough. There's not a whole lot of reasons to adopt something new, unless it's even more addictive. Maybe the reign of the incumbent social networks will last much, much longer than we initially expected. reply genewitch 11 hours agorootparentHosting video is expensive; a Twitch streamer (Thor) mentioned that an 8-hour stream at 1080p with 8,000 viewers costs Twitch nearly $5,000, while 720p still costs around $1,300. Personally, I prefer 720p. It's easy to play on any device, the file sizes are much smaller, and the quality is fine. I don't need 4K for most content and save it for exceptional visuals like Godfrey Reggio's Trilogy or Yojimbo — one of the most visually stunning movies I've ever seen in high resolution. My preference also reduces hosting costs for platforms, at least from my account. Social media constantly pushes high-res, addictive content, but alternatives like Fediverse exist. After adjusting to these communities, I deleted my X account and rarely use Facebook. On Fediverse, server operators encourage efficient file sizes (and types,) unlike Instagram or TikTok. The network effect drives people to the few social networks, but I'm not convinced people actually want what they're being given. Repeating for emphasis: I'm not convinced this is what people want! reply dmurray 11 hours agorootparent> Hosting video is expensive; a Twitch streamer (Thor) mentioned that an 8-hour stream at 1080p with 8,000 viewers costs Twitch nearly $5,000, while 720p still costs around $1,300. This sounds way too much - prohibitive, in fact, when cheap all-you-can-eat dubiously-legal IPTV services exist. On the one hand, AWS quote something similar as an estimate ($12,000 for 10 hours for 10,000 viewers at 1080p) [0]. All but a rounding error of this is paid to AWS CloudFront for per-GB distribution costs and this assumes 99% of bits can be served by the CDN. On the other hand, Amazon note that this is typically an overestimate because it's unlikely all your viewers will get the 1080p, and they can degrade service to some (QVBR) and pass you on the savings. Additionally, Twitch video content (disproportionately, video games) seems like it should be more compressible than most video. And most importantly, Twitch don't pay the retail price. Still, it's going to come in an order of magnitude above what I thought Youtube/Twitch etc needed to pay their bills.

I no longer have access to a twitch account (as an aside i blame starlink and not using gmail) so i can't verify if streamers on the platform have access to those tools. And the pricing seemed about right. You can't tell but i am napkin-ing this right now: twitch recommends 4500kbps for 1080p30 on the uplink side, which fans out to 40gbit. per second. So maybe you can get that for $5000/month; or you can get 10gbit links in four places. Receive bits, transcode, stream. how hard wait transcode? A certain very large media company was paying a third party $250,000 per month for transcoding, on three 24x7 streams. I'm not saying that spend was necessary, because it isn't, just that it is a pain point. anyhow that video shows $0.132 per half-viewer-hour (or something) at 1080p - probably 60fps. Come to think of it that's suspiciously close to what i'd guess AWS would charge for transit (which you alluded to, i think) - so this is showing streamers what they would be paying if they self hosted? reply dmurray 7 hours agorootparent> Come to think of it that's suspiciously close to what i'd guess AWS would charge for transit (which you alluded to, i think) - so this is showing streamers what they would be paying if they self hosted?

That's what Peertube is for. The original video comes from a specific web site. If the viewer count goes up, the people watching it also stream it out. So a hugely popular video won't overload the source server. This is not like Bittorrent. It's not distributed file storage, just distributed streaming. It's only a load on the viewer's system when they are watching the video. Now that there are large numbers of users with symmetrical network connections, this is a practical way to distribute video. I put technical videos on Peertube because there are no commercial interruptions.[1] I recommend it for content which doesn't need \"discovery\" service - that is, users arrive from some other source than the hosting site.

Whether that diffuses into the middle class is mostly a political problem. However the stronger a middle class is, (through access to capital) the faster technology production and adoption will become. Or so is a school of thought of contemporary political economy (read Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu. et. al. ) Example: the cotton gin did not make for a healthier middle class, since the political apparatus barred access to capital (and human rights and civic participation) for so much of the population. reply throwaway7ahgb 6 hours agorootparentThis is nihilist thinking.

So really most people are in the same boat when it comes to these things. It just manifests differently. reply randomdata 3 hours agorootparentYou are right that those who start off being well paid in the working-class tend to buy capital with the differential in pay, and thus move into the middle-class upon doing so. But, as such, still realize the gains on the capital side, so the decline on the wage side is not the whole picture for them. reply wnc3141 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't think necessarily, it just describes of the national productivity, how much of that produce is allocated toward labor rather than capital. (wealth generated through assets vs. wages) The middle class owning more assets than working class sure is better off. But both derive most of their income through wages rather than assets. reply fiachamp 12 hours agorootparentprevThat share of income from wages started its downward trajectory in 1971, when the US removed the gold standard and money-printing replaced hard money. The result was a man-manipulated interest rate fueled economy. Low interest rates benefit existing asset holders the most since they most definitively increase asset prices.

There was also a significant population increase in the latter half of the century, there - but forget looking at milk prices or gasoline prices - look at a ford mustang, or a motorhome - or even housing. Once a certain segment of the population realized that real estate was \"undervalued\" relative to the potential for collecting rent on the undervalued property - yeah. rent goes up, wages don't at the same rate, more credit card debt.

Since the founders / owners / shareholders extracted all excess profits, the companies became brittle in crises, causing them to buy each other until there is just about 1 per continent, possibly 1 in the whole world. The only way to jack up prices until then, barred burying the whole planet under a pile of planned obsolescence electronics garbage, is to invent new ways to introduce scarcity.

I was a teenager during the 90's, and I do have fond memories of things from that decade, but it would do well to keep your nostalgia in check. Even when we restrict ourselves to the realm of tech, a lot of things back then sucked horribly. Large tech companies already showed their rent-seeking tendencies, there was crazy hype for shit ideas (the dotcom bubble popped for a reason). In fact, I think that the current mindset of people being increasingly jaded, skeptical, and mistrusting of tech is healthy. It shows that at least some people are learning their lessons, even if this mindset is somewhat restricted to bubbles like this. reply hn_throwaway_99 4 hours agorootparentYes, it's good to be cautious against nostalgia, but it's also bad to just pretend that everything just basically repeats. To be clear, since I feel a bunch of comments are taking that \"90s was peak humanity\" quote overly literal (another commenter pointed out there were still horrible wars during the 90s), I'd point out that it was about the expectations of how tech would improve human lives. Most specifically, there was a very broad belief that things like the Internet would bring people closer together. But by lots of objective metrics (measures of loneliness, polarization, pessimism for the future, youth mental illness, etc.), not only did tech not \"bring us closer together\", it actively helped rip us apart.

Notice how the overwhelmingly-vast majority (if not entirety) of the rich happily did away with those candle-lighting servants in favor of electric lighting; why pay a bunch of servants, after all, when that money could be invested elsewhere? Likewise with the cheap cloth and cheap cotton and rayon fabric and boots and motorcars and so on; the ultra-rich have adopted these in droves because the alternatives require money better spent elsewhere. Yeah, candles and silk garments and horse-drawn carriages do still exist, but for the rich they are nothing more than novelties for occasional enjoyment; for their day-to-day lives it's all lightbulbs, cotton, and cars. Not only that, but the rich tend to be the early adopters of these very innovations - that is, capitalism begot these innovations specifically to cater to those able to afford them, and only later (after the requisite infrastructure and economies of scale took hold) did they serve as any sort of boon to the common man.

Setup, juxtaposed by punchline. reply roenxi 13 hours agorootparentSomething can be a joke and still be worth taking seriously. In this case, the joke is misleading on an important topic - the existence of AI changes economic realities but has no bearing on how humans spend their leisure time, or how much of that leisure time they have. In fact, it probably will increase the amount of leisure time available on net since it is freeing us up as a species from needing to do a bunch of artistic and creative chores. reply disqard 12 hours agorootparent> \"freeing us up as a species from needing to do a bunch of artistic and creative chores.\" Would you please clarify something? You're saying that we need to be freed from \"artistic and creative chores\" -- so that we can be free to do what? For me personally, the highest-quality leisure I can think of is to follow creative pursuits and hone my artistic abilities (e.g. playing a musical instrument, making something with my hands, etc.) reply roenxi 12 hours agorootparentFree to do whatever you like. If you want to sit around playing musical instruments in your spare time nothing is stopping you. We've had superhuman chess AI for decades and that hasn't stopped anyone playing chess. But if I want to review a game showcasing the highest level of chess play I wouldn't turn to human games. Similarly, sooner or later, if I want a specific picture of something I'm not going to be wasting the time of an artist to get it. reply mdhb 6 hours agorootparentThis is such a genuinely weird worldview to me.

Though it makes no sense to me to call it \"clickbait\". Bait for what? The original commenter was just expressing an opinion, not selling ads or something. I don't think it's a statement about \"classic\" at all - it's a statement that people generally enjoy writing and making art, and people generally don't enjoy doing their dishes or laundry. Tech used to be about making the \"hard drudgery easier\". reply XorNot 13 hours agorootparentRight but..for whom? Again: AI existing doesn't stop people doing writing or making art. What it does stop is getting paid for those activities where they are paid for: but then, that's not \"unbridled creativity\" anymore - that's \"corporate says we need a stylized picture of a man standing in a field by tomorrow\". Or it's the exact thing the author in the linked blog here is talking about: what was their actual job? > One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release touting yet another \"game-changing\" startup that had raised - yet another - $25 million.

You don’t need „AI“ for that - by the way it’s actually machine learning - AI is another bullshit term.

I get the dangers of this technology but I really don’t see why it would prevent anyone from pursuing their hobbies. Edit:// oh an capitalism doesn’t ruin art, quite the opposite.

The obvious thing is that technology (and various things we’ve called AI over time) actually has given laundry robots and dish washing robots. Her follow up tweet said of course she knows and that she's joking, but the joke/criticism relies on those things not existing. I kinda think she just forgot, as we all do, as we take technology for granted. 2. Second takeaway was the same as you, with all the free time we have now—and the free time we hypothetically would get with laundry AI—hard to believe we’re really going to start our great American novel. 3. Her follow up was something like “I don’t actually mean laundry and dishes, I mean it metaphorically”. This just read to me as \"I just want things that I want. And don’t want things I don’t want. Don't ask me what those things are.\" We all do, but it muddles any potential wisdom in the quip if we can just swap laundry, dishes, writing, and art for whatever. So basically a nothing burger about what AI is today or should be, but loud expression of that nothing anyway. I thought it was more like a spitball take (albeit a tad clickbaity and trolling) and had it gotten lost in the wind it would have been fine, but it going viral said something about current opinion. reply meheleventyone 10 hours agorootparentThe way to read it is “I want AI to automate the drudgery of life, not remove the joy from it”.

As someone that grew up on the East Coast, I often notice how the communication style on the West Coast is much less confrontational and more “everything is awesome”, which I think leads to the sort of fake enthusiasm the author grew tired of projecting. Of course, there’s no lack of hype and BS in NYC/DC/Boston, but there seems to be a much more developed culture of criticism and analysis than in California. And so the default attitude on the East Coast is a bit more cynically pragmatic, which is both good for the above reasons, but also less imaginative and more restricted - which is why SV has more “dreamers” that do crazy things.

For all the \"disruption\" caused by \"unicorns\", has it really had a net positive effect on our lives? Big Tech companies keep building technology that is designed to extract as much value from their users by any means necessary. Most of the startup world revolves around growing companies based on this premise, in the hopes of one day making it big as well. There are still companies that ignore this rat race and try to do the right thing, but they are hard to come by. Those are the real unicorns, IMO. I realize the irony of this opinion on a VC forum.

The optimism and buy-in that excited people about tech from the debut of the iPhone until fairly recently was a function of PR and technology marketers-- like the author-- doing their jobs very well. For any industry, generating interest and excitement is more than a purely descriptive process. The magical venture doesn't just appear and then the marketers have the simple job of describing it. Marketers/strategists/PR people play a very important role surveying the project and then articulating a compelling vision. That vision then becomes sort of a self-fulfilling prophesy since stakeholders (both creators and users) have bought into the promise of worth. If strategists aren't able to see a path forward, to survey the field and identify the things that make the project worthwhile, exciting, sustainable, tactical, etc... then they're just not great at their job. Admitting that you haven't really believed in anything you've worked on as a marketer is a bit like an actor admitting that someone else is reading their lines. A good marketer, like a good actor, lives in their promises like they are already real. The realer and more convinced you are, the more you can speak your vision into reality. reply sirspacey 10 hours agoparentThis is a popular misconception. Tech has always been built in the face of massive distrust, mischaracterization, and dismissiveness - especially by media outlets. PR was not how tech overcame that. It was charismatic founders (who often broke the rules of PR at the time) and massive break-throughs in adoption by winning customers over directly. It’s honestly amusing that so many believe that marketers were the reason users decided to love tech. By and large, market-speak was the anti-thesis of what would win over the early adopters of tech. Like most sea change movements, tech was very punk at the start. To be tech was to stand against the corporate types who milked people for money without offering real value. Doesn’t feel like it today, but most of the people I know in tech are still coming from a place of wanting to build things of genuine value, usefulness, and helpfulness. Those intentions may not be enough, but there’s not much to be gained in discounting them either. reply leocgcd 10 hours agorootparentCharismatic founders are PR lol.

People are obsessed with iPhones because they're a superior product, not because they were sucked into a PR campaign filled with Justin Long ads. reply leocgcd 8 hours agorootparentThinking that TV spots are the limits of brand strategy is just kind of naive. You think iPhones are a superior product... Why? Other phones have more RAM, better screens, more capable OS. An iPhone is designed in response to market demands-- it is the vision of Apple to anticipate what users will want, and to show users what phones can be. So many Apple billboards around New York show kids or families, the \"memories\" function of the iOS Photos app is designed to pull from forgotten pictures and tug on your heartstrings. Part of this is Apple marketing responding to a demographic of tech-consuming people becoming parents or grandparents... But it is also Apple showing us what tech is good for. It's a vision of compassionate technology that will hopefully sell more iPhones while also structuring the narrative of what an iPhone is. An iPhone is a superior product not because it has the best tech specs or the best combination of components. An iPhone is the superior product because the future of technology can be compassionate, and Apple wants to position themselves there. This is a marketing strategy, and it is likely why you associate iPhones with quality and superiority. We cannot immediately see all possible uses and promises of technology, no matter how tech-literate we think we are. It takes institutional vision (in many cases a function of market/brand strategy) to figure out what makes a good product and how we can show people that our product fulfills that idea. reply keiferski 8 hours agorootparentThe TV commercial reference was a joke. Sheesh. iPhones are extremely popular around the world and in 99% of those places, the people have little or no interaction with Apple billboards or marketing. Not everyone is a family in New York City, or even speaks English. You’d have more of a point if you said Apple aims to portray a premium brand and therefore they have this reputation globally because of marketing, but even then, that doesn’t last for long if the products themselves don’t have a good reputation. reply leocgcd 7 hours agorootparentJoke or not, you're still demonstrating that you're naive about the scope of brand strategy. The majority of brand management work is not material that is shown to the public, it is strategic decision making about how to position a brand and control it's reputation across markets. This includes yuppies in NYC and teenagers in Southeast Asia. The cultural positioning of Apple is a function of western hegemony and global memetics. An Eastern European housewife that wants an iPhone doesn't want it because she's done the tech research to understand that it is the most reliable and technically sound product, she wants it because Apple has taken great care to maintain their image through brand strategy. She probably sees iPhones on social media, in the hands of celebrities, the nicest store in her city is the new Apple outpost, they're teaching classes on apps and she wants to have the experience that she sees other iPhone users having. Your misunderstanding is a larger trend in the tech space of people overvaluing \"utility\" instead of recognizing that the driving forces of any industry-- not just tech-- cannot be reduced to a spec sheet. reply keiferski 7 hours agorootparentI actually live in Eastern Europe, and no, that woman doesn’t care about the iPhones in the hands of celebrities and there is no Apple Store here, and the top shop that specializes in Apple products is mediocre and has bad reviews. In fact, there are no Apple Stores in a lot of countries. [0] There is also minimal advertising done by Apple - although there is a ton by Huawei (how well do you think that works?) iPhones are popular because they’re perceived as a high quality product from a dependable Western company. Not because they have billboards and celebrity sponsorships. You really don’t seem to understand how widespread Apple is, and instead are intent on portraying yourself as some kind of expert that puts down others. Their popularity isn’t merely due to some brand strategy plan, as their products are practically a baseline of modern life at this point. I didn’t say anything about “utility” I said their products were higher quality, which they are. Especially on the design/UI front. People buy them because the competition simply isn’t as good, among other social reasons. A mastermind branding plan is not really that relevant when you’re already as widespread as they are. Nothing I wrote has anything to do with customers doing tech research. So just to reiterate and wrap up this conversation: no, Apple is not widely used because their branding team crafted a smart campaign for every corner of the globe. They are widespread because they’ve been making solid products for a long time, people use them, and then form an impression that they’re quality products. All the advertising and celebrity sponsorships and everything else are dressing at best. This is a unique situation and if you were talking about anyone other than Apple, I’d agree with you that the market positioning / PR is key, but in this instance it’s simply not the case. 0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store#Countries_and_regi... reply lucianbr 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat I can see by just loooking outside is that people are obsessed with iPhones.

Theranos is an example of a failed project through and through, but even something unarguably successful like the iPhone was built through market strategizing-- not just technical engineering. Identifying what consumers wanted, conveying that vision, shaping a compelling brand, these are all things that can easily be written off as \"fake\" by people who cannot buy into the vision, but when done well they are just as important as the technical innovations. reply imiric 7 hours agorootparent [–] > Marketers necessarily sell something that doesn't exist because part of their job is creating that thing. Funny. I thought a marketer's job is helping companies sell their product, not selling a nonexistent product based on a vision. The individuals and companies doing the latter are known as grifters, snake oil salesmen and scammers. The iPhone succeeded because it was a fantastic product released at the right moment in history. Apple saw a major gap in the market, and they filled it brilliantly. No amount of marketing would've made the iPhone a success if it wasn't an outstanding product on its own right. Apple embellished its capabilities with its usual marketing tactics, but the product was real, and people wanted it regardless. What you're advocating for is exactly what Theranos did. Market the product first even if it doesn't exist yet, and the product will miraculously materialize from that vision. This is known as fraud, and is what rightfully landed its CEO in prison. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Veterans Affairs Department that whistleblowers may receive compensatory damages if a firing hurt their future earnings. Nanzeeba Ibnat / Getty Images Sponsor Message Sponsor Message Get the latest pay and benefits news delivered to your inbox. email View Privacy Policy Stay Connected Sponsor Message Sponsor Message Featured eBooks Pay & Benefits Federal whistleblowers are entitled to damages for missed future pay, court rules Employees can receive compensatory payments if their firings caused harm that prevented future earnings. Eric KatzJune 25, 2024 Whistleblowers MSPB Eric Katz Senior Correspondent Federal employees who face retaliation after blowing the whistle at their agencies are entitled not just to back pay, a federal court has ruled, but also financial compensation for the loss of potential future wages. The new precedent, set by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Perlick v. Veterans Affairs Department, establishes that federal whistleblowers can receive compensatory damages if their firings caused harm to their earning capacities in the future. Those workers do not have to prove they had guaranteed jobs lined up, but rather can merely show the reprisal they faced caused defamation that hurt their chances at some future employment. Deborah Perlick brought her case after VA fired her in 2017, shortly after she alerted officials in the department that $78,000 was missing from a study on which she was working related to traumatic brain injury. Perlick worked on one-year contracts that had been renewed since 2010, and the Merit Systems Protection Board ruled she was entitled to back pay dated to March 2020 when the project on which she was working ended. She pressed for additional compensation—including $500,000 in compensatory damages—saying whistleblower protection laws entitled her to the recovery of future lost earnings. MSPB ruled in 2022 that Perlick was not entitled to that money because she had no guarantee of future employment with VA, given the term-limited nature of her research. The Federal Circuit noted it must first clarify whether federal whistleblowers can receive compensatory damages for future lost earnings, and found that they can. When Congress updated whistleblower protection laws in 2012, it added that federal employees were eligible to receive “reasonable and foreseeable consequential damage” and “compensatory damages.” The latter category has long been interpreted to include future lost earnings, the court said, including when reputational harm can hurt employees’ earning potential. In Perlick’s case, her lawyers argued her firing interrupted her research, prevented her from publishing on it and damaged her reputation in a way that could have impacted her future employment. Patrick Walsh, one of Perlick's attorneys, said the case could have far reaching impact. \"The Federal Circuit’s decision in Perlick is an important victory for federal whistleblowers who have been fired in retaliation for coming forward,\" Walsh said. \"In addition to losing their jobs, these whistleblowers can suffer reputational harm, career disruption and other impediments to future employment.\" The court noted Congress’ intent in updating whistleblower protection law was to ensure employees are provided “make-whole relief,” which it said included future lost earnings. That interpretation is supported by other laws, the court said, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act that allows for damages for future lost earnings in cases of discrimination. The court also said MSPB erred when it ruled Perlick was not entitled to compensatory damages because she was not guaranteed a job after her research concluded. Instead, the judges ruled, Perlick needed only to show that a preponderance of the evidence that she was likely to have future employment. That standard does not require certainty, the court ruled, and therefore Perlick—or any future federal employee litigants arguing the reprisal they faced in some way damaged their future earnings—did not need to have a guaranteed job lined up. VA argued Perlick was entitled only to back pay, but the court said that form of payment was “separate and apart from” compensation. “The back pay award is irrelevant to the inquiry of whether Perlick could establish lost future earnings by a preponderance of the evidence,” it said. The court remanded Perlick's case back to MSPB for a final decision. Walsh said that going forward, the court has confirmed that \"lost future earnings are recoverable to make a whistleblower whole, and that a whistleblower does not have to 'guarantee' future employment to prove these damages.\" Share This: NEXT STORY: Biden’s 2% raise more likely upon advancement of Senate defense policy bill Management Reinventing government: Reflections 30 years later Workforce Retiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor Management 'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA Workforce State of the Unions: A New Normal Oversight What I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years sponsor content Balancing Act: The Dual Sides of Generative AI Workforce State of the Unions: A New Normal Oversight What I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years sponsor content Balancing Act: The Dual Sides of Generative AI Management Reinventing government: Reflections 30 years later Workforce Retiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor Management 'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA Workforce State of the Unions: A New Normal Oversight What I Learned Covering Government for 34 Years sponsor content Balancing Act: The Dual Sides of Generative AI Management Reinventing government: Reflections 30 years later Workforce Retiring NTEU President Reflects on 3 Decades in Organized Labor Management 'Long, Long Overdue': An Oral History of the GPRA",

On the one hand it says \"The latter category has long been interpreted to include future lost earnings, the court said, including when reputational harm can hurt employees’ earning potential.\" Which makes it sound like the decision is no big deal and in standing with long set precedent. But then it also says, \"Patrick Walsh, one of Perlick's attorneys, said the case could have far reaching impact.\" But it isn't clear what the far reaching impact is, since future earnings have always been a factor? It sounds like the actual far reaching impact is this? \"The court also said MSPB erred when it ruled Perlick was not entitled to compensatory damages because she was not guaranteed a job after her research concluded. Instead, the judges ruled, Perlick needed only to show that a preponderance of the evidence that she was likely to have future employment.

I'm just trying to parse what is actually novel & news here and the article isn't helping. reply gnicholas 11 hours agoparentMy reading (IAAL) is that in 2012 the whistleblower laws were changed, and key language was added in. That language has been interpreted, in other contexts, to include future earnings. But the new law had not yet been tested, so this case is a \"case of first impression\" in that regard. The reason it will have far reaching impact is that potential whistleblowers will no longer worry about losing future earnings, which could have deterred (especially younger) potential whistleblowers. reply mannykannot 6 hours agoparentprevFew (if any) laws set out an exact decision procedure thorough enough to determine precisely whether it applies in every possible case, and if so, the corresponding response to be mandated. In this particular case, the issue was what counted as consequential damage from the illegal actions. The VA argued that as the whistle-blower was working on renewable one-year contracts, the lost earnings were fully compensated for by back-pay up to the end of the contract in effect at the time. Her lawyers argued her firing interrupted her research, prevented her from publishing on it and damaged her reputation in a way that could have impacted her future employment. While this issue could be framed as being one about how much evidence is required here, I feel that, more importantly, it is a rejection of the VA's premise, which amounted to the claim that the end-date of the plaintiff's contract set a horizon beyond which no harm could be attributed to the VA's illegal actions. While this ostensibly only applies to workers on fixed contracts, I imagine the same principle could be applied in other cases where the employer attempts to limit the scope of damages to the specific position held by the employee at the time of the infringement. reply sharpshadow 12 hours agoprevThat's would be a great incentive especially for better payed workers with possibly more access to critical information. reply robertlagrant 10 hours agoprevInstinctively I worry about unintended consequences for this sort of thing, but in this case it seems...pretty good?

It’s still no walk in the park: you have to prove liability first, meaning you have to prove your whistleblower activity was the motive for your firing. (The government will cook up an alternate explanation, of course.) You have to prove your damages to a reasonable certainty. But if you do jump through those hoops, then you won’t hit a special wall previously erected to block an aspect of federal employees’ claims. reply laborcontract 9 hours agoparentprevSEC whistleblower rewards have been an unequivocal good.

So he wouldn’t get any benefit from this. Government whistleblowers also have to strongly consider attempting to run things up the pole internally first in a Snowden-type situation. You may be allowed to skip internal procedures for whistleblowing if you have a good reason for believing internal reporting channels are compromised or ineffective. You’d still have to report it to some government entity that could hold the NSA accountable (like sending the info to members of Congress or your agency’s Office of Inspector General) rather than run straight to the news media. Running straight to the media first like Snowden did generally strips you of whistleblower protections. Especially if its not even something illegal in the first place (like spying on Angela Merkel). Biggest Snowden disclosures which would have been supposed to receive whistleblower protections (unsanctioned / illegal NSA activity): - Domestic phone record metadata collection (actually was approved by FISA/FISC courts under section 215 but federal courts determined the program exceeded the authority granted by 215) - PRISM program (was authorized under section 702 and received annual certifications from FISC, ostensibly focused only on foreign spying but scope of collection ability included all domestic content as well) - XKeyscore (authorized under Executive Order 13333 and FISA, similar concerns as PRISM) Neither XKeyscore or PRISM were ever determined to “systemically” exceed their legal authority, but disclosure of these programs did lead many politicians to work towards better oversight of NSA activities given their “shocking” (at the time) scope of collection. Biggest Snowden disclosures which were clearly not eligible for whistleblower protection because there was no doubt it was legal: - Spying on Angela Merkel and other foreign leaders (of course we spy on other nations, duh. That’s what spying is.) - Lots of operational details and techniques used for legitimate spying. Tailored Access Operations, Quantum Insert, ANT catalog, BULLRUN, MYSTIC, SOMALGET, Dishfire and Prefer, DEWSWEEPER, SECONDGET, etc. - Economic Espionage: Spying on Petrobras, Belgacom, Trade Negotiation surveillance, IMF, World Bank, German economic targets (variety of industries), French Ministry of Economy, Mexican energy sector, EU trade negotiations Nobody thought any of these exceeded the NSA’s authority. Spying on other nations is generally considered fair game. The most iffy disclosure (hard to tell if program was entirely legal) never got much followup. These were details on the MUSCULAR program, which siphoned data going between Google and Yahoo datacenters outside of the USA (but obviously still would have ended up “spying” on many Americans). reply cesarb 6 hours agorootparentA bit tangential to your argument, but > Especially if its not even something illegal in the first place (like spying on Angela Merkel). There's a good chance that this was illegal according to German law, and depending on the exact details on how it was done, there's also a good chance that it could be considered as being under German jurisdiction. Think about it in the opposite direction: if a German citizen had wiretapped the USA president's mobile phone, the USA would probably consider that act as being under USA jurisdiction, and illegal according to USA laws, even if said German citizen had never set foot outside Germany. That's the reason \"some might find [this] distasteful\". They're breaking other country's laws, in a way which would also break USA law if the situation was reversed (so they can't even say that the other country's laws are bad and wrong), and hiding behind \"[it] is very much legal\" (in the USA), even though that argument would not be accepted by the USA if the situation was reversed. reply lesuorac 6 hours agorootparentIf that german citizen stepped foot in the USA, they might get arrest for espionage. But I highly doubt a German court/judge is going to approve an arrest warrant for a presumably sanctioned activity. Now, if a private german citizen wiretapped the USA's president's phone for the lulz then yeah they might get arrested and extradited. Whether or not something is illegal is in the eye of the beholder and IIUC, Title 50 Section 36 explicitly makes espionage legal [1] (when done by the US against other people).

Germany has also admitted to spying on the White House specifically, along with surveilling “telephone and fax numbers as well as email accounts belonging to American companies like Lockheed Martin, the space agency NASA, the organization Human Rights Watch, universities in several U.S. states and military facilities like the U.S. Air Force, the Marine Corps and the Defense Intelligence Agency,” and phone lines “at the U.S. Treasury Department and the State Department” > There's a good chance that this was illegal according to German law, and depending on the exact details on how it was done, there's also a good chance that it could be considered as being under German jurisdiction. This is an absolutely absurd argument against spying. Should no one ever spy on Russia or North Korea just because they make a law against it? Only spy if you’ve declared war on them? How do you see this working in the real world?

It violated FISA. Secondly, Stating spying Merkel and tapping her phone was legal is simplfying the issue greatly. It may be allowed by US law yet as was stated at the time, observing German Law on German soil may still mean it was an illegal act. As it was found in the investigation into the spying scandal that there were US spys working on German soil, it was therefore illegal. Therefore some think it exceeded the NSA's authority, which is nil in Germany. This also refers to spying on other nations being fair game, not following a countries law on their soil does not make it fair game, it makes it an illegal act. In regards to the many operational details leaked, the focus of that was to determine if or not their methods of spying are legitimate. These tools and procedures can on the surface have legal methods yet still be used in illegal methods, so it isn't as simple as saying they didn't think they exceeded the NSA's authority. reply reaperman 5 hours agorootparent> Therefore some think it exceeded the NSA's authority, which is nil in Germany. This is very false though. NSA absolutely has at least SOME authority to spy on Germany. Not just by American law but also Germany has provided the NSA with office space for up to 1,800 NSA employees to work in the town of Bad Aibling.

This makes no sense.

Every form of spying by any country is suddenly illegal? reply ktallett 4 hours agorootparentIt has never been proven they legally have authority to spy on German citizens. That goes against Germany's constitution and is another case of a government acting illegally by turning a blind eye to the acts of the NSA and ignoring the rights of their citizens. Spying in some settings is absolutely illegal, no matter the country you are spying on, whether it be North Korea, Russia, or Fiji. It goes against their Sovereignity.

The way it's justified is all centred on this principle: > Spying on other nations is generally considered fair game Perhaps the most damning thing Snowden revealed is how this excuse is used for domestic spying. Britain's GCHQ, for example, is also not supposed to spy domestically. How did they 'sidestep' that issue? They told NSA exactly what they wanted, NSA listened to those communications for GCHQ, and handed the records over [1]. That way it's not \"violating the law\", it's just \"intelligence sharing\". And of course GCHQ returned the favor to NSA by doing the same in reverse.

[1] https://www.channel4.com/news/intercept-text-messages-spy-ns... reply reaperman 7 hours agorootparent> Saying Snowden compromised foreign spying efforts is disingenious I’d argue this heavily depends on scope and context of discussion. For what you’re talking about, it’s a reasonable take. But for things like spying on foreign leaders and ANT Catalog and Tailored Access Operations — there’s not really much domestic angle there, so those elements wouldn’t be disingenuous to represent as “compromising foreign spying efforts”. There’s certainly a concern that TAO techniques could be turned inwards, but what we know about it suggests that its been consistently outward-focused for the past 25 years. > What he revealed is that intelligence agencies are acting in bad faith and they completely trample on the civil liberties and freedoms they are supposed to protect. I agree with this. I just also think his disclosures went beyond this and that discussions about Snowden are incomplete if we limit ourselves to acknowledging only acknowledge the disclosures which include a domestic angle. > Perhaps the most damning thing Snowden revealed is how this excuse is used for domestic spying…(etc) I agree that this type of “i spy on your citizens, you spy on mine” information-sharing became much more widely known due to Snowden but I knew about Five Eyes/ECHELON back when I was in middle school before 9/11 or the PATRIOT act.

Along with Russian media of course. He died of pneumonia after being arrested in Kharkiv for publishing pro-Russian invasion literature (maybe you don't like that law, but it was the law). He was freed on bail after his arrest but tried to run a checkpoint and exit Ukraine, violating his bail conditions. What you call \"exposing uncomfortable truths\" was just him saying Ukraine is Russia, calling the military Nazis, and calling for Ukrainian surrender. reply longitudinal93 4 hours agoprev [–] I expect Julian Arrange to get a substantial award. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 3 hours agoparent [–] Why would you expect that? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that federal whistleblowers can receive compensatory damages for future lost earnings if their firing harmed their earning potential.",
      "Deborah Perlick, fired after reporting missing funds, successfully argued for additional compensation beyond back pay, impacting future job prospects.",
      "This ruling sets a precedent for federal whistleblowers, allowing claims for future lost earnings without needing guaranteed future employment, and the case was remanded to the Merit Systems Protection Board for a final decision."

    "commentSummary": [
      "A court has ruled that federal whistleblowers are entitled to damages for missed future pay, even without a guaranteed future job, provided there is sufficient evidence of likely future employment.",
      "This decision may encourage more whistleblowers by alleviating concerns about losing future earnings and aligns federal employees' rights with those of private-sector employees.",
      "The case, involving a VA (Veterans Affairs) employee, emphasized that reputational harm affecting future earnings is compensable."

For a technical talk it seems long. For an entertaining keynote it seems short. Movies are 90+ minutes. reply xanderlewis 5 hours agorootparentAt both the universities I’ve attended, lectures lasted 50 minutes. The odd few we had that were 100 had a short break in the middle supposedly inspired by research on how attention levels decay and recover over time. Conference talks seem to usually hover around the 60 minute mark. I find movies have become too long — especially in recent years. reply meristohm 3 hours agorootparentSame here, regarding movies- we preferentially watch films under two hours, ideally 90-100 minutes, because that both fits between our child's bedtime and ours, and it's a better economy of time for a story in that format, rather than an indulgent marathon. I doubt I will ever watch Heat again, unless over a couple days, and unless my child wants to I won't watch the Lord of the Rings again (and especially not The Hobbit movies; that was largely a waste of time, though I will gladly read The Hobbit at least once more before I die). Mad Max: Fury Road (Black & Chrome version) I watched for the third time recently, but over two days. Engaging conversation, though? I recently had the luxury of time and privilege of talking for three hours straight with a well-read college student. Not being a high school teacher anymore I'm out of touch with young-adult perspectives, and I have so many follow-up questions now. reply tialaramex 5 hours agorootparentprevHumans don't do well concentrating on something for more than about an hour. So fifty minutes seems like a reasonable rule of thumb. You can improve this if you make it more varied, adding interactions, changing media, multiple speakers taking turns, that sort of thing, but having a rule of thumb helps. And it fits calendars nicely, fifty minutes per talk, ten minutes break between, one talk per hour. reply gniv 4 hours agorootparent> fifty minutes per talk, ten minutes break between Yes, I suspect that's the real reason. reply dylan604 3 hours agorootparentBut that break was typically how long it took to get to the next class. So it might have been a break from active brain activity (as evidenced by the brain dead decisions of navigating hallways/lockers), it's not a break per se. Maybe one was determined by the other, but I remember having to hustle to get from one end of campus to the other in those 10 minutes in a very un-break like use of energy reply Frummy 6 hours agoprevThat’s pretty good. Feynman keeping problems in his mind constantly, like a monk, is easy said but difficult to do. Attention and the harmony required to maintain it, in this day and age, is a few new theorems the reward for that? I guess you have to enjoy the process of working on problems like that as well, to dedicate your attention to it all day long even passively. reply almostgotcaught 5 hours agoparent> problems in his mind constantly, like a monk, is easy said but difficult to do. You're misunderstanding what's being described - there's nothing monk like about it. Using myself as an example, you have a couple techniques you're good at (linear programming) and a couple of problems you've tried to solve before but failed (fixed parameter tractable problems). Every time someone tells you about a problem (or you run into one) you try apply the thing you're good at (\"will an LP work here\"). Every time someone tells you about an approach they took with their problem you try it out on your thing. It all happens completely automatically/naturally/fluently if you're good at the technique and have actually tried to solve said pet problem. Like I don't need to write code or calculate anything because I know by now exactly where/what my blockers. Conversely I know very quickly when an LP is appropriate because I know the assumptions/requirements very well. reply maxbond 4 minutes agorootparentThis is actually why I come to HN. I absorb people's experiences, the problems they've encountered and the techniques they've applied. And when I encounter a problem, I'm usually and to draw on that experience to come up with a solution. It might not be a good solution, but it's a starting point. reply lupire 3 hours agorootparentprevOn a lay level, people think I'm a genius because I can finish their unfinished crossword puzzles. But they never see me when I fail to do a crossword puzzle from scratch myself. reply Suppafly 2 hours agorootparentI used to be amazed that my dad could finish crosswords when I was a kid until one time as an adult I was sitting across from him at the table and realized that I knew several of the answers that he hadn't figured out yet.

Solicitor Martin Smith and his barrister colleague Simon Clarke met the judge at Birmingham Crown Court in 2013 on the eve of a trial of a sub-postmaster accused of theft. Around the same time, the interim report by forensic accountants Second Sight had revealed potential problems with the Horizon system which had been the basis for previous prosecutions. The prosecuting lawyers applied for public interest immunity on the report, successfully persuading the judge that the defence solicitors should not be made aware of it. Giving evidence to the inquiry, Smith accepted he was the instructing solicitor on the case but stressed he was only present at the meeting to take notes and he could not remember any details of what was said to the judge. The inquiry heard of several issues with disclosure as the Post Office and its representatives approached the mediation scheme and potential reviews of past convictions. In the case of north Wales sub-postmaster Noel Thomas, who had been jailed in 2006 for false accounting, Smith suggested that an investigation report from the time should not be disclosed to him when it was reviewed in 2014. If it was to be disclosed, the inquiry heard, it should be heavily redacted – and Smith himself had written that Thomas should not be shown a Post Office note from 2005 which noted that operator Fujitsu was testing the reliability of Horizon. ‘Such a [note] may well invite a request for disclosure of the test results,’ Smith had emailed a colleague. ‘There may also be a risk that [Thomas] will suggest the investigation was inadequate or incomplete.’ On another occasion, Smith and Bond Dickinson’s Andy Parsons discussed whether disclosure might give a ‘ticket to the Court of Appeal’ to Seema Misra, who had been wrongly convicted in 2010 while she was pregnant with her second child. Smith admitted that he had not complied with his duties as a prosecuting solicitor to ensure that the Post Office expert witness was aware of his obligations. He accepted he did not have the ‘requisite skill and expertise’ for the role he was in and did not know why Cartwright King had been given the task of handling Post Office prosecutions. ‘Quite why Cartwright King thought it was appropriate to take on this prosecution with hindsight I have no idea, because we certainly didn’t have the training for it,’ he said. ‘I was simply not aware of the duties on a prosecutor to make sure an expert witness was fully aware of their duties.’ He added that the approach to expert witnesses was ‘undoubtedly not compliant.’ The inquiry continues.

Either incompetence cannot be a defence, or convictions must not be permitted to be made where incompetence might lead to an injustice. Or another way of looking at this: \"the prosecution's case would fail if anybody involved on the prosecution's side turns out to be incompetent\" should be an absolute defence in any trial and if that situation arises then it must always fail to result in a conviction. reply cj 6 hours agoparentI was at traffic court yesterday and before they got to my ticket they were processing actual criminal cases with defendants walking in the courtroom in hands and feet cuffs. I was watching the public defender interact and process each case that walked in. I was extremely unimpressed with the public defender who didn’t appear to know basic details on any of the cases she was representing. It was a sad reminder that the justice system is still very much imperfect, and the outcome of many cases depends heavily on whether you have money to pay attorneys. The simplest “proof” of the preferential treatment you get with a paid attorney is you’re almost always the first case on the docket if you have paid representation. Then after the cases with paid representation they move on to the public defender cases. I would be terrified to face the US justice system without heavy weight defense attorneys - even if I’m completely innocent - because the system isn’t fair by default. reply Twirrim 4 hours agorootparentWashington State defined its limits for public defenders as: Felonies: 150 cases per year Misdemeanors: 300 cases per year Juvenile cases: 250 cases per year So a total of 700 cases per public defender, per year. Assuming no vacations or sick leave, total working hours is about 2000 per year, so they could average not even 3 hours per case, and of course felonies are likely to eat up the lions share of whatever hours they could spend on them. You're not going to get effective representation from any public defender, even with the most competent lawyers in the world. They simply don't have enough possible hours to spend on any given case to provide competent defense. reply briffle 4 hours agorootparentprevI know a public defender (in family law, so adoption, foster care, child endagerment, etc). The state pays her $75/h. Most people locally look at that dollar number and feel she is out of touch to complain, but she also has to: 1. have an office that is not her home that can recieve certified mail (and be signed for, no po boxes) 2. pay any staff out of that. 3. Maintain her own computers, and software and access to services needed 4. Hire her own PI's (if needed) out of her own pocket 5. Any other expert consultants out of her own pocket She also doesn't get any health insurance, or other benefits. And the best part, is the state has a formula they don't disclose, that determines how many hours work they think each case is appropriate for, and don't care how many she actually works. Every time she is paid, it includes a paper only invoice that she then gets to reconcile manually to see which cases are paid off, which are only partially, and which they forgot to pay that month. reply patrickmay 4 hours agorootparentThe simple, straightforward, and therefore politically impossible solution is to require parity in funding for the district attorneys' offices and the public defenders' offices. reply tracker1 3 hours agorootparentI think it should go beyond that, in that public defense and prosecution should come from the same pool of lawyers and they are graded by success on both sides by type/class of case. reply p_j_w 3 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that this isn't the case after 200 some odd years exposes us. We don't care about the right to a fair trial for people who don't have money, it's a lie we tell ourselves. reply FireBeyond 3 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who absolutely agrees with this in principle, I disagree with \"simple and straightforward\" - you need to look at case categories (felonies and classes thereof, gross misdemeanors and misdemeanors) for a view on expected effort, and then you need to look at \"what proportion of those cases have private representation\". And then this will always be a trailing metric. I mean, personally I think the simple answer is just blanket equal resources, but there's no motivation to make that happen, but certainly won't be without things like the above. Elected prosecuting officials is a bad thing, IMHO. The incentives are all wrong. They get elected and re-elected on \"being tough on crime\", which means convictions, which leads to the simple fact that the US abuses the concept of the plea deal enormously. Thousands of people who would otherwise be found not guilty (if not are factually innocent) accept plea deals just to be done with a process that can take years to resolve (not to mention money, or freedom, or both, in the interim). In other countries the use of the plea deal is generally fairly rare, and comes with stringent judicial oversight. Here it is often the first option. \"Well, what would your client plead to?\" reply VancouverMan 4 hours agorootparentprevThe situation that you just described would be a pleasant improvement for many of the private sector sole proprietors and small business owners that I know. Her situation sounds actually far more stable and easier than theirs in a variety of ways. Her client is likely quite well-established, and the risk of it \"going out of business\" or running into insurmountable funding issues is small. Her client will likely be feeding her a steady supply of work, without interruption, effectively forever. It doesn't sound like she has any marketing, advertising, or customer-acquisition overhead. She doesn't have the overhead of negotiating a contract and fees with each client. Her working conditions are likely quite safe and comfortable (as compared to those in the trades, for example). I don't think she has much to complain about when compared to what those in the private sector have to deal with. reply ssklash 2 hours agorootparentAre any of these unfortunate private sector proprietors the sole bulwark against their clients ending up in jail or prison, and always up against better-funded opponents? You're comparing apples and something far, far different than oranges. reply krustyburger 4 hours agorootparentprevWow. I had heard that public defenders certainly weren’t in it for the money but that’s worse than I expected. It seems like the biggest sink would be paying someone to staff the office. I think some coworking spaces are set up to be able to accept certified mail. Has she looked into that? reply techjamie 3 hours agorootparentprevWhere I live the public defenders just try to convince all their clients to plead guilty and take the lower charge. Was sitting near a public defender with his client in the courtroom once and his lawyer just told him plead guilty and he'll get a light sentence. The client protested that he was innocent, lawyer told him to plead anyway because the bargain charge wasn't serious. reply openasocket 4 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like what you were watching was a first appearance, though I could be wrong. Depending on the circumstances, the public defender may not have even been appointed to the case until the hearing. The public defender may not even have had an opportunity to talk to the defendant prior to that, and is going mostly on whatever the prosecutor filed. But that doesn't really matter that much for first appearances. The only real point of first appearances is to advise the defendant of their rights, the charges, take an initial plea (this is almost always a not guilty plea - negotiations for plea agreements generally don't start until after the first appearance), and officially assign a public defender to the case (assuming they are not hiring their own attorney). Depending on the jurisdiction and context a bond may also be set, or that may be in a separate hearing. In some jurisdictions a public defender isn't even present for first appearances, because there's so little for them to actually do. The stereotype is that the public defenders are all incompetent. But if you actually talk to judges or criminal attorneys you will get a different picture. Judges in particular tend to have a lot of respect for the public defender's office. Honestly, in all the hearings I've seen involving an incompetent defense attorney, they are more likely to be private counsel than from the public defender's office. reply tracker1 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is why I truly believe that both Prosecutors and Public Defenders should be from the same pool of lawyers and that they are \"graded\" on both types of cases for promotion, pay, bonus, etc. reply rayiner 5 hours agorootparentprev> It was a sad reminder that the justice system is still very much imperfect, and the outcome of many cases depends heavily on whether you have money to pay attorneys I’m not sure that’s true. Prosecutors also throw far more resources into cases with expensive private attorneys. I saw the end results of the process from the appellate side (where the facts are fully developed), and I know lots of public defenders. I think what you’re overlooking is that 99% of those people are facially guilty. The police and prosecutors are lazy, they don’t want to prosecute marginal cases that don’t have rock solid evidence. My wife defended a murder case where they had almost continuous CCTV video of the defendant shooting the victim and driving home to his house. Just one camera angle after the other. And that was a sufficiently exciting case to warrant her big firm getting involved pro bono. I also see all these ACLU and Innocence Project mailings. Rarely do you see someone who isn’t guilty. Usually the case is about some legal technicality, or some principle such as whether teenagers should be prosecuted as adults or whether gang members involved in a fatal robbery should all be tried for murder when only one pulled the trigger. So what you’re seeing is the system doing the best it can with this huge volume of obviously guilty people. The public defenders I know are all on the lookout for the rare defendant who might be innocent. reply ryandrake 5 hours agorootparentEven \"obviously\" guilty people are entitled to competent, robust, and vigorous defenses (and whether or not this 99% are truly \"obviously\" guilty is an entirely separate HN thread). This is where the imperfection lies: These public defenders have such a huge case load that they cannot properly and competently defend their clients. If I could wave a magic wand, and we'd magically have 100X the number of public defense attorneys, each now having the ability to properly prepare for and litigate for their clients, even if those clients were \"obviously guilty,\" why wouldn't I? reply rayiner 4 hours agorootparentSure, but what does a competent defense look like when someone is caught on CCTV breaking into a cell phone store and stealing phones, and then the police find text messages of him fencing the stolen phones? The thing about \"poor people crimes\" is that they're either easy to prove because what's illegal is doing something you're not allowed to do. (Or they go unsolved, because they can't find who did the thing.) The reason \"rich people\" crimes are so expensive to defend is because those crimes often involve conduct that could be a crime or not depending on what various people were thinking at the time they did it, or whether it amounts to a pattern, etc. I agree with the principle that anyone accused of a crime that warrants a complex defense should get one, whether or not they can afford it.

But that’s just an invitation to put aside reason and think with emotions. That doesn’t mean it would be fair to society to do that. And why should we allow a small class of anti-social people to revictimize society in that way? I was a card-carrying ACLU member for a long time. But working in the court system really opened my eyes to the reality is that there’s a fraction of the population that’s anti-social and repeatedly victimizes society and the communities in which they live. They have rap sheets a mile long, and are prosecuted based on piles of evidence. Society needs some way to deal with these people that’s just to them but also just and fair to society. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentThe principle of innocence until proven guilty, the standard of reasonable doubt, and the inefficient trial by jury of one's peers is the best we have figured out so far.

Look at how much more peaceful and orderly places like Japan and Singapore are, where you have effective, efficient justice.

Ensuring an overly zealous prosecutor doesn't overcharge the case? I was the defendant in a case (charges dropped completely very quickly) where the prosecutor had flagged me as a \"flight risk\" and wanted me held with a stupid amount of bail and a surrendered passport because I was \"here on a temporary work visa only\" (actually, lived here 17 years as a permanent resident) and had \"no ties to the community\" (other than owning a house in the area for several years, working in the area, including as a volunteer firefighter/paramedic, oh, and having a partner and child).

I understand providing a way to determine guilt and innocence without bias, but if everyone knows someone is guilty, isn't trying them and/or defending them just a waste of resources, with the best outcome being \"same as plea bargain\" and worst possible outcome being \"goes free without punishment, despite having committed crime\"? reply cjbgkagh 4 hours agorootparentIt’s a token effort to catch the false positives. If you put in no effort you’d start to become overconfident in the guilty assessment and an increasingly larger percent of defendants will be considered guilty even though more of them will in fact be innocent. Plus there is more to it than guilty/not guilty and the state should not be permitted to take shortcuts. reply program_whiz 3 hours agorootparentprevOk I get what people are saying, but you are describing the common case, where guilt is in question. I'm talking about the parent comment which is saying \"even if someone is known to be guilty they still deserve defense.\" You're talking about the common case -- where there is doubt to guilt and/or someone maintains innocence. Do you also believe someone who admits guilt should still be defended (e.g. hide this fact from the jury and proceed as though they didn't admit to the crime)? The only reason for defending someone is because they may be innocent, there is no advantage to excusing a guilty person. Or do you believe there is an advantage to excusing the guilty? I also understand why we have our current system, and that there may be false positives, I'm merely commenting on the fact that we should not defend those that are 100% known to be guilty (and I'm not claiming that its easy to ascertain, but that in cases where people plead/confess, maybe its for the best). reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentLet's enter fantasy land for a moment and assume that we even can ascertain whether someone is \"100% known to be guilty\" without a trial. Say we have a crystal ball that we can just ask. That person still is entitled to representation to ensure that all the proper procedure was followed (was the law somehow broken when the crystal ball was consulted? was the crystal ball accurately calibrated and configured? is it a real crystal ball and not a knock-off that always says \"guilty\"?). Even if there was no crystal ball! The defendant admitted and signed a confession. He still needs a defense. Was the confession forced or obtained under duress? Did the defendant know what he was confessing to? And even if there was no crystal ball, the defendant confessed voluntarily and understood fully what he confessed to, cooperatively admitted everything to the point where there is zero chance of reasonable doubt. He still needs a defense. Who is going to ensure that a fair punishment is imposed? Without a defense attorney and proper procedure, what stops the judge from simply imposing the maximum sentence for everyone? reply program_whiz 2 hours agorootparentThanks this changed my mind and I agree with your assessment. reply ryandrake 4 hours agorootparentprev> If you knew 100% someone was guilty, why would you defend them? Ask defense attorneys, I think you'll be surprised at the number of \"yes\" responses. How do you establish that \"everyone knows\" someone is guilty?

Sit through a docket or two and you come to a few conclusions. 1. They're all guilty. This is a corollary of: prosecutors like shooting fish in a barrel, not prosecuting cases where they might have to actually work. 2. The role of the defense lawyer in 99% of these cases is to keep them from disrupting the proceedings. 3. Probation / alternative sentences don't work.

There's another attorney in this thread who seems genuinely unsure why we should be devoting time, effort or energy into people who are \"obviously probably guilty\".

We have a conviction system. When prosecutors run for office (haha!), they don't brag about all the times they thoroughly investigated an alleged crime and determined that the defendants were innocent and should have charges dropped, they brag about how many they've put behind bars. And, in some cases, it's turned out that those they bragged about were in fact innocent. Additionally, when appeals seem destined to exonerate someone already convicted, something like half of prosecutors will go to heroic lengths to protect those convictions even when forensic science makes innocence clear. > I would be terrified to face the US justice system without heavy weight defense attorneys Often, it's enough to have one at all. Public defenders will browbeat you to plead out, and if you insist otherwise, they'll just wink at you and you know they'll sleep through your trial. They exist to give the appearance of defense.

Like at the end of the day, in reality, a judge with a law degree and very limited life experience doesn’t really know what should happen.

I would point out that if criminal proceedings are a possibility, the presumption of innocence will have the consequences listed in krisoft's post, and while these consequences are convenient for the people and institutions directly and tangentially responsible, it does not follow that this convenience is the inquiry's only purpose. Is there a serious possibility of criminal prosecutions arising from this inquiry? if not, then conducting them as if that possibility existed might itself be seen as a delaying tactic. reply petesergeant 6 hours agorootparentSure, and we can’t know the minds of others, so the hypothesis is unprovable either way. I would say that public enquiry followed by a trial (if warranted) seems a generally worse outcome for potential defendants, than the other way around, given that it gives the prosecution a lot more time to get their case solid, and given that there’s no risk of hitting double jeopardy restrictions.

No issue there. The judge however, erred. He should've never allowed the disclosure to not be disclosed. You can redact information that is harmful to the state, or is not relevant to the case, but in this case, the fact that the system that was being used as the basis of detection of fraud, was in itself being audited, should've meant that it was to be included and disclosed to defense. In my non-lawyer opinion, the judge is the one that erred, and it is compounded that this matter came up in a private meeting without defense, thereby supporting the idea that private meetings should never be had, when there are always exceptions for them.

This sort of case of massive abuse and criminality by very powerful figures should be rare, but when it does happen there are still fallbacks. There is still a free press that can dig into it and report on it and apply pressure doggedly for years. There are separations of powers that make it more challenging for any one entity to suppress everything. In the UK they did a full TV miniseries around this, lots of articles in major papers, there is an ongoing podcast, vs sending the first journalist to ask questions to prison. There are still regular changes of government at the vote of the population, and in turn incentive for different groups of politicians and new generations of them to gain power by digging into malfeasance of existing ones. There can still be public inquiries long after the fact. The entire point of all the various checks and balances and defense is precisely to try to, eventually, steer things back onto the right track when, not if, they start to veer off. Humans are humans the world over. The slower, louder, argumentative processes of democracy and law are our so far best effort to try to corral that reality.

They’re fighting the good fight right now, so if you happen to be in the Kansas area, please support Aj’s NY Pizzeria (it’s NY-style pizza based in Manhattan and Topeka, Kansas, and while I’m biased, it’s good). If capitalism is driven by a search for profit, the food delivery business confuses the hell out of me. Every platform loses money. Restaurants feel like they're getting screwed. Delivery drivers are poster children for gig economy problems. Customers get annoyed about delivery fees. Isn't business supposed to solve problems? Last week's Uber-Grubhub news set off some antitrust alarms for me and got me thinking about the business of food delivery as a whole. But let me start this newsletter with a story about Pizza Arbitrage. image via Reddit Market Inefficiencies In March 2019 a good friend who owns a few pizza restaurants messaged me (this friend has made appearances in prior Margins' pieces). For over a decade, he resisted adding delivery as an option for his restaurants. He felt it would detract from focusing on the dine-in experience and result in trying to compete with Domino's. But he had suddenly started getting customers calling in with complaints about their deliveries. Customers called in saying their pizza was delivered cold. Or the wrong pizza was delivered and they wanted a new pizza. Again, none of his restaurants delivered. He realized that a delivery option had mysteriously appeared on their company's Google Listing. The delivery option was created by Doordash. To confirm, he had never spoken with anyone from Doordash and after years of resisting the siren song of delivery revenue, certainly did not want to be listed. But the words \"Order Delivery\" were right there, prominently on the Google snippet. He messaged me asking me if I knew anything about Doordash, and oh boy, did I get Softbank-triggered. I had just read about their $400 million Series F and it was among the WeWorkian class of companies that, for me, represented everything wrong about startup evolution through the 2010s. Raise a ton of money, lose a ton of money, and just obliterate the basic economics of an industry. Doordash was causing him real problems. The most common was, Doordash delivery drivers didn't have the proper bags for pizza so it inevitably would arrive cold. It led to his employees wasting time responding to complaints and even some bad Yelp reviews. But he brought up another problem - the prices were off. He was frustrated that customers were seeing incorrectly low prices. A pizza that he charged $24 for was listed as $16 by Doordash. My first thought: I wondered if Doordash is artificially lowering prices for customer acquisition purposes. My second thought: I knew Doordash scraped restaurant websites. After we discussed it more, it was clear that the way his menu was set up on his website, Doordash had mistakenly taken the price for a plain cheese pizza and applied it to a 'specialty' pizza with a bunch of toppings. My third thought: Cue the Wall Street trader in me…..ARBITRAGE!!!! If someone could pay Doordash $16 a pizza, and Doordash would pay his restaurant $24 a pizza, then he should clearly just order pizzas himself via Doordash, all day long. You'd net a clean $8 profit per pizza [insert nerdy economics joke about there is such a thing as a free lunch]. He thought this was a stupid idea. \"A business as successful a Doordash and worth billions of dollars would clearly not just give away money like this.\" But I pushed back that, given their recent obscene fundraise, they would weirdly enough be happy to lose that money. Some regional director would be able to show top-line revenue growth while some accounting line-item, somewhere, would not match up, but the company was already losing hundreds of millions of dollars. I imagined their systems might even be built to discourage catching these mistakes because it would detract, or at a minimum distract, from top-line revenue. So we put in the first order for 10 pizzas. The Numbers He called in and placed an order for 10 pizzas to a friend's house and charged $160 to his personal credit card. A Doordash call center then called into his restaurant and put in the order for those 10 pizzas. A Doordash driver showed up with a credit card and paid $240 for the pizzas. It worked. Trade 1 We went over the actual costs. Each pizza cost him approximately $7 ($6.50 in ingredients, $0.50 for the box). So if he paid $160 out of pocket plus $70 in expenses to net $240 from Doordash, he just made $10 in pure arbitrage profit. For all that trouble, it wasn't really worth it, but that first experiment did work. My mind, as a combination trader and startup person, instantly had the though - just run this arbitrage over and over. You could massively even grow your top-line revenue while netting riskless profit, and maybe even get acquired at an inflated valuation :) He told me to chill out. Maybe this is why he runs an \"actual business\" while I trade options while doing brand consulting and writing newsletters. But we did realize, if you removed the food costs this could get more interesting. Trade 2 The order was put in for another 10 pizzas. But this time, he just put in the dough with no toppings (he indicated at the time dough was essentially costless at that scale, though pandemic baking may have changed things). Now suddenly each trade would net $75 in riskless profit ⇒ $240 from Doordash minus ($160 in costs + $5 in boxes). This got a bit more interesting. If you did this a few times a night, you could start to see thousands in top-line growth with hundreds in pure profit, and maybe you could do this for days on end. So over a few weeks, almost to humor me, we did a few of these \"trades\". I was genuinely curious if Doordash would catch on but they didn't. I had visions of building a network of restauranteurs all executing this strategy in tandem, all drinking from the Softbank teat before the money ran dry, but went back to work doing content strategy stuff. Was this a bit shady? Maybe, but fuck Doordash. Note: I did confirm with my friend that he was okay with me writing this, and we both agreed, fuck Doordash. Google Hijacking and Fake Phone Numbers Tricking businesses onto your platform and creating additional headaches for small business owners in the pursuit of Softbankian growth is a bad as it gets. Many restauranteurs were complaining about their Google listings being \"hijacked\" by Doordash, sometimes even usurping their own preferred delivery. These underhanded tricks aren't unique to Doordash though. In recent weeks there has been some great work coming out around a Yelp - Grubhub phone scam. This one is just priceless (seriously, read this Buzzfeed piece). Grubhub for their own sites generates a phone number for each restaurant that goes to a centralized, Grubhub owned call center. If someone calls in and orders via this number, the restaurant gets charged a fee. Apparently, some enterprising BD folks came up with the idea that Yelp could put the Grubhub phone numbers in place of the real restaurant phone number on the Yelp listing. Customers who think they’re “helping” their local restaurants by calling in the order are still creating a fee for Grubhub. Food Delivery Platform Existentialism Which brings us to the question - what is the point of all this? These platforms are all losing money. Just think of all the meetings and lines of code and phone calls to make all of these nefarious things happen which just continue to bleed money. Why go through all this trouble? Grubhub just lost $33 million on $360 million of revenue in Q1. Doordash reportedly lost an insane $450 million off $900 million in revenue in 2019 (which does make me wonder if my dream of a decentralized network of pizza arbitrageurs does exist). Uber Eats is Uber's \"most profitable division” 😂😂. Uber Eats lost $461 million in Q4 2019 off of revenue of $734 million. Sometimes I need to write this out to remind myself. Uber Eats spent $1.2 billion to make $734 million. In one quarter. Amazon just bailed on restaurant delivery in the U.S. What is it about the food delivery platform business? Restaurants are hurt. The primary labor is treated poorly. And the businesses themselves are terrible. This Business Insider piece did a good job covering the problematic dynamics of the industry: As this conflict comes to a boil, one thing is becoming clear: there are no winners in this fight. Restaurant owners are losing money. Diners are seeing their costs raised, either by delivery companies that need to pay delivery drivers or by the restaurant owners who raise prices to offset delivery fees. And delivery drivers still make low, unpredictable wages frequently with no benefits. How did we get to a place where billions of dollars are exchanged in millions of business transactions but there are no winners? My co-host Can and my restaurant friend both defaulted to the notion “delivery is a shitty margin business” when discussing this post. But I don’t think that’s sufficient here. Delivery can work. Just look at a Domino’s stock chart. But, delivery has been carefully built as part of a holistic business model and infrastructure. Maybe that’s the viable model. After the start of this pandemic, my friend actually launched in-house delivery at one of his restaurants. He said he’s starting to get a sense of the economics and explained he’s starting to get a sense of the volume required per location to make the economics reasonably work. That’s what is so odd to me about third-party delivery platforms. The business of food delivery clearly is not intrinsically a loser. Domino’s figured it out. Every Chinese restaurant in New York City seemed to have it figured out long before any platform came along. My friend is figuring it out. That’s the thing about how industries have evolved over the past decade. I know I ascribe ZIRP as the cause of all ills in the world, but this sometimes feels like the greatest ZIRP story ever told. You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model. It's used to subsidize an untenable customer expectation. You leverage a broken workforce to minimize your genuine labor expenses. The companies unload their capital cannons on customer acquisition, while this week’s Uber-Grubhub news reminds us, the only viable endgame is a promise of monopoly concentration and increased prices. But is that even viable? Third-party delivery platforms, as they’ve been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they’ve been subsidized into market dominance. Maybe the right model is a wholly-owned supply chain like Domino’s. Maybe it’s some ghost kitchen / delivery platform hybrid. Maybe it’s just small networks of restaurants with out-of-the-box software. Whatever it is, we’ve been delayed in finding out thanks to this bizarrely bankrolled competition that sometimes feels like financial engineering worthy of my own pizza trading efforts. The more I learn about food delivery platforms, as they exist today, I wonder if we’ve managed to watch an entire industry evolve artificially and incorrectly. Arbitrage is about taking advantage of market inefficiencies and for all the newly minted day-traders out there, perhaps it’s time to start looking into frontier markets like pizza. Note 1: We found out afterward that was all the result of a “demand test” by Doordash. They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant’s website and don’t charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed onto the platform. If we had to pay a customer fee on the order, it would’ve further cut into our arbitrage profits (though maybe we could’ve incorporated DashPass as part of the calculation). Note 2: A few months ago, in the pre-pandemic times, I was at an East Village pizza place and watched as the owner was arguing with a Doordash driver. The owner insisted the driver take the pizza in a heated bag so the customer didn’t get cold pizza, but leave an ID so the driver would be compelled to return the bag. The driver argued the amount of time it would take to come back to return the bag would mean he couldn’t make enough deliveries to “pay my rent”. #Innovation.

The only flaw with this is that people have to work economically inefficient jobs delivering food, instead of the wealth transfer occurring through taxes on the rich and funding something like basic sciences. reply dralley 1 hour agorootparentIt's equivalent to \"broken window\" spending. Yes, breaking a window allows you to generate economic activity by paying the manufacturer to create a new one and paying an installer to install it, but it's not socially useful economic activity. You could have spent the same money building excess renewable energy resources, or on basic science research, or a million other things that might be equally \"inefficient\" from an investment standpoint but at least have a chance of providing benefit to society. It's a serious flaw and not one that can be waved off as easily as you do. reply ianferrel 57 minutes agorootparentI disagree with that. In the case of food delivery, there's socially and economically useful work of getting food from where it can be efficiently created (restaurants) to where it can be efficiently consumed (hungry people's location). In the absence of that work, the hungry people would be making their own food (less efficient, generally, than restaurant cooking which can do larger batches) or going to get their own food (less efficient, at least plausibly, because a delivery worker can make multiple deliveries on one drive rather than a strict out and back trip that people would take). The thing that makes fixing a broken window \"fake\" economic growth is that it is arguing that destruction is economically useful because of the work to fix it, but nothing's being broken in this case. People are naturally hungry on a pretty regular basis, and the production and transportation of food is economically and socially useful work, which in this case was being subsidized by capital.

Chris2048 16 minutes agorootparentprevI've heard of the \"broken window fallacy\", and this seems an incorrect representation. The fallacy is that breaking windows must have an inherent value (and the fallacy is that its a good thing to have vandalism). Part of the justification that it might be otherwise is the benefit of having window repairmen, and how they couldn't exist if they didn't have a steady income - and it's here that lies the fault, however the fault is one of quantification, in fact a broken window can be socially useful, just with decreasing usefulness as quantity increases, plus there are better ways to do it (e.g. insurance payment); It's still true that (in an unmanaged market) if (somehow) there aren't enough broken windows, when one breaks there might not be anyone who can repair it (economically) - I think it's the same category of problem as, donating clothes to Africa destroys its own textile biz. reply madaxe_again 2 hours agorootparentprevNo, because it’s a circular economy - at no point does that wealth reach workers, it just ends up in the hands of other plutocrats. reply RandallBrown 2 hours agorootparentHow exactly does the money that a company like DoorDash loses end up with other plutocrats?

If the employees spend their income on low-margin goods or services (food and clothing are quite competitive low-margin sectors with high labor costs), the money has flowed from investors mostly to laborers. reply lambertsimnel 27 minutes agorootparentMy thinking is that spending gets split between richer and poorer people. The former buy assets with it, but the latter spend it on living costs. Each time it circulates, typically some goes to richer people and stops circulating.

They're becoming DoorDash focused and the dining room experience suffers. Even picking up your own food is becoming destroyed. Orders get made with no regard to the estimated pickup times you used to be able to rely on. Your order might get made immediately and just tossed onto a pickup shelf where it sits getting cold for half an hour. This is all because DoorDash guarantees absolute shit quality and accuracy. Cold food, wrong orders, and they've trained people to not complain by threatening to ban you from the service. So instead of the son of the owner of the pizza place rushing right out to make your order right with an apology, you just accept that an 80% correct order is OK. A whole generation of young adults has come of age with this thanks to COVID, so we're just stuck with it now. reply beloch 1 hour agorootparentprevThe delivery service in my area has no competition. You order from their version of restaurant menus on which the prices have been jacked up. Then you pay a delivery fee. Then you pay a service fee. Then you have to deal with drivers making minimum wage who can be surly if not tipped enough. It more than doubles the price of a meal, so few people use it. Is this DoorDash's plan once they've driven their competitors out of the market? The market will shrink and it will take quite some time to recoup their expenses. Maybe that's okay in their books. Own the whole pie even if you shrink it. reply mikejulietbravo 53 minutes agorootparentprevThis is the biggest point. You can simply not use them.

The problem here is that there's a $45B company (doordash) in the middle of the person cooking the food and the person delivering the food instead of a high school kid in a funny hat. Exchanging the overhead of a dining room for the overhead of unskilled labor taking food to a place is an easy win for a restaurant. Doordash and the like are taking jobs that you could train a child to do in an hour (take an order, deliver it to a place) and spending billions on the technology to do instead while still requiring unskilled labor to do the job. This is the kind of software that needs to be a small scale distributed open source affair instead of a $45B company with several competitors at the same scale.

As in, they sell an online-ordering-platform-as-a-service to restaurants (sometimes bundled with a POS system), rather than gunning for market dominance on the consumer side of things. I think that's probably a viable model for the future, assuming they don't have VCs that will push them to squeeze restaurants like the big apps, at some point. reply josefresco 1 hour agorootparentprev> Food delivery has been a thing for a very very long time. > The problem here is that there's a $45B company (doordash) in the middle of the person cooking the food and the person delivering the food instead of a high school kid in a funny hat > This is the kind of software that needs to be a small scale distributed Related: a few years back before DoorDash and the like exploded in popularity there was a local company near me who tried to start a food delivery business.

No, you've got that backward. Customer behavior is driven by the tides of capital. Advertising is a pretty clear example but it's not the limit. I mean, how many people were ordering DoorDash before DoorDash existed? I'm not being entirely facetious - it's impossible for customers to behave in a way that's not allowed by the market. That you are resistant to these tides is not evidence against, it's just accounted for. You're not the target audience. Nor am I. But neither of us has ever made a decision in a vacuum; we choose our purchases from what's available, according to the information we're exposed to. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparent> Customer behavior is driven by the tides of capital Source? The best argument against this is how elastic demand was when ZIRP ended. Customers responded to an underpriced product. When the price was raised to a profit-clearing level, it no longer cleared most of the market. reply digging 1 hour agorootparentI don't understand your argument. It sounds like customers were reacting to their environment more than driving change. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agorootparent> sounds like customers were reacting to their environment more than driving change It sounds like customers had agency. Tides of capital gave them more or fewer options, and they chose them at their discretion when the terms were advantageous. When they weren't, ever or any longer, they didn't. reply digging 1 hour agorootparent...In other words, because DoorDash is convenient and advantageous for customers, they choose to get food delivered instead of go to the restaurant. And admonishing people for choosing the advantageous option is useless, at best. Does that not follow? reply JumpCrisscross 58 minutes agorootparentYou argued \"customer behavior is driven by the tides of capital.\" That's attributing cause and effect. The tides of capital didn't cause the customer behaviour, it enabled existing behaviour to scale. Capital driving behaviour describes diamonds, not DoorDash. reply insane_dreamer 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is no doubt that advertising has a huge impact on customer behavior. But that doesn't mean that consumers are incapable of making choices that go against the grain of the market. It does take a conscious effort, and it's true that most consumers just don't care or can't be bothered with it, or are crushed by too many other things in our modern society to have the bandwidth to even consider their choices. reply digging 58 minutes agorootparentEverything you're saying is exactly in accord with what I posted. Individuals always have choice, but when we're looking at an entire population and seeing that large amounts of people are making a choice that we think is \"bad\", saying, \"Well people just need to stop making bad choices. People are stupid. I make good choices.\" is ludicrous. Let's assume that the answer really is to ensure individual choices are changed. Who's going to go house to house and educate everyone about why the choice to use DoorDash is problematic? Does this person have the time to customize their solutions to every family's needs? It's insanity. It's an argument that leads nowhere at all; it's an abdication of responsibility (which is totally unnecessary, because the commenter never had a responsibility to change the situation).

After all, a steady surplus of naive and enthusiastic drivers is essential to their business model. 2. You might have some schmuck doing that for the for free, by trying to brag about themselves as personally successful on social media (either for ego reasons or just trying to get clicks). 3. I think a lot of the drivers are \"misinformed, bad at math.\" I've read it's pretty common for casual drivers to be totally ignorant of some of the major costs they're paying indirectly (e.g. not factoring in the wear and tear on their car or (more egregiously) fuel costs). 4.

For example, a reddit post I read a little while ago (can't find it again) the person said they do ride sharing so got to take a lot of deductions on their taxes so they said \"on paper\" it \"looks like\" they make \"much less\" than they \"actually\" do. The comments rightly pointed out the poster's \"on paper\" income is their actual income, because they are deducting expenses they paid and it wasn't an accounting trick. reply phantom784 4 hours agorootparentThere could be some truth to this based on the vehicle you drive. The IRS gives a flat per-mile deduction, which is an estimate of fuel, repair, maintenance, and depreciation costs. If your actual vehicle expenses are lower, then you are making more money than your taxable income. reply astura 4 hours agorootparentSure, you might be ahead a bit more than \"on paper\" but you still have significant expenses that were actually accrued. The context of this post was the person thought their \"actual\" salary didn't include their (significant) expenses and being eligible for deductions was just a bonus. They argued in the comments their salary was \"really\" their pre-deduction salary, I guess because that's what went into their bank account. They were also asking if they should just stop taking these deductions for a few years for some reason (I think to qualify for a mortgage), so they weren't exactly understanding finance.

Specifically, data is only worth as much as the buyer is able to exploit it to make money.

Few other players can leverage personal data to this financial extent. More importantly, the players that can leverage personal data for immense profit also collect their own data, and so externally-sourced data is only of marginal utility. And you see this in the discourse around this issue. We theorize for example that some grocery chain would \"pay a lot\" for personal data. But to what end? So they can offer just-in-time enticements to go to the store? A lot of these supposed \"applications\" of personal data seem pretty flimsy, and even where they are genuinely useful, their monetary worth is marginal.

How personalized are the ads you see on the web, really? What's the ratio of times you clicked on an ad accidentally or got tricked into clicking an ad (ever had the layout change on Anandtech just before you tried to click on a link?) I used to work for a company that helped other companies decide where to place stores. Circa 2007 we were thinking about it from the viewpoint of trips and I'd developed a touchscreen kiosk that would get visitors to a Dairy Queen to tell us where they came from and where they were going. We believed that people didn't just go to a fast food restaurant that was convenient to their home but that they were driving from point A to point B and happen to stop at a restaurant along the way so a \"good location\" had a kind of centrality where it was on many such paths. (The project was ill fated. The kiosk we selected was rather expensive, particularly for a project we'd sold to one franchisee.

On one level it's a good idea, but what is the data really worth? Chains that work hard at picking good locations find their competitors follow them and set up shop across the street. The value of the data is based on the amount of lift you can get using it relative to the alternatives.

If that scenario still exists, they could still do this, but most of the time the store has some kind of deal with DoorDash so they would be responsible for pricing. As for why fill the boxes, technically DoorDash would be the store's customer, so if you didn't give them what was ordered they could press the issue.

    "title": "Corcel – Use WordPress backend with Laravel or any PHP application",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/corcel/corcel",
    "originBody": "A collection of Model classes that allows you to get data directly from a WordPress database. Corcel is a collection of PHP classes built on top of Eloquent ORM (from Laravel framework), that provides a fluent interface to connect and get data directly from a WordPress database. You can use WordPress as the backend (administration panel) or CMS, for inserting posts, custom types, etc, and any other PHP app in the other side querying those data (as a Model layer). It's easier to use Corcel with Laravel, but you're free to use it with any PHP project that uses Composer. Buy me a CoffeeFollow Corcel on Twitter Table of Contents Installing Corcel Version Compatibility Installing Corcel Database Setup Usage Posts Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Integration Custom Post Type Single Table Inheritance Taxonomies Post Format Pages Categories & Taxonomies Attachments & Revision Thumbnails Options Menu Users Authentication Running Tests Contributing License Version Compatibility Laravel Corcel 5.1.x ~2.1.0 5.2.x ~2.2.0 5.3.x ~2.3.0 5.4.x ~2.4.0 5.5.x ~2.5.0 5.6.x ~2.6.0 5.7.x ~2.7.0 5.8.x ~2.8.0 6.0.x ^3.0.0 7.0.x ^4.0.0 8.0.x ^5.0.0 9.0.x ^6.0.0 10.0.x ^7.0.0 11.0.x ^8.0.0 Installing Corcel You need to use Composer to install Corcel into your project: composer require jgrossi/corcel Configuring (Laravel) Laravel 5.5 and newer Corcel wil register itself using Laravel's Auto Discovery. Laravel 5.4 and older You'll have to include CorcelServiceProvider in your config/app.php: 'providers' => [ /* * Package Service Providers... */ Corcel\\Laravel\\CorcelServiceProvider::class, ] Publishing the configuration file Now configure our config file to make sure your database is set correctly and to allow you to register custom post types and shortcodes in a very easy way: Run the following Artisan command in your terminal: php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Corcel\\Laravel\\CorcelServiceProvider\" Now you have a config/corcel.php config file, where you can set the database connection with WordPress tables and much more. Database Setup Laravel Setup Just set the database connection you want to be used by Corcel in config/corcel.php. Let' suppose you have those following database connections in your config/database.php file: // File: /config/database.php 'connections' => [ 'mysql' => [ // for Laravel database 'driver' => 'mysql', 'host' => 'localhost', 'database' => 'mydatabase', 'username' => 'admin' 'password' => 'secret', 'charset' => 'utf8', 'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci', 'prefix' => '', 'strict' => false, 'engine' => null, ], 'wordpress' => [ // for WordPress database (used by Corcel) 'driver' => 'mysql', 'host' => 'localhost', 'database' => 'mydatabase', 'username' => 'admin', 'password' => 'secret', 'charset' => 'utf8', 'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci', 'prefix' => 'wp_', 'strict' => false, 'engine' => null, ], ], In this case you should want to use the wordpress connection for Corcel, so just set it into the Corcel config file config/corcel.php: 'connection' => 'wordpress', Other PHP Framework (not Laravel) Setup Here you have to configure the database to fit the Corcel requirements. First, you should include the Composer autoload file if not already loaded: require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; Now you must set your WordPress database params: $params = [ 'database' => 'database_name', 'username' => 'username', 'password' => 'pa$$word', 'prefix' => 'wp_' // default prefix is 'wp_', you can change to your own prefix ]; Corcel\\Database::connect($params); You can specify all Eloquent params, but some are default (but you can override them). 'driver' => 'mysql', 'host' => 'localhost', 'charset' => 'utf8', 'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci', 'prefix' => 'wp_', // Specify the prefix for WordPress tables, default prefix is 'wp_' Usage Posts Every time you see Post::method(), if you're using your own Post class (where you set the connection name), like App\\Post you should use App\\Post::method() and not Post::method(). All the examples are assuming you already know this difference. In the examples, every time you see Post::method() assume Corcel\\Model\\Post::method(). // All published posts $posts = Post::published()->get(); $posts = Post::status('publish')->get(); // A specific post $post = Post::find(31); echo $post->post_title; Creating your own model classes Optionally you can create your own Post model (or Page, or whatever) which extends Corcel\\Post. Then set the connection name (if you want to override the Corcel's default one) you're using, in this case foo-bar: Extending Corcel\\Model\\Post class can add flexibility to your project, once you can add custom methods and logic, according what you need to use from your WordPress database. meta->link; // OR echo $post->fields->link; echo $post->link; // OR To create or update meta data form a User just use the saveMeta() or saveField() methods. They return bool like the Eloquent save() method. $post = Post::find(1); $post->saveMeta('username', 'jgrossi'); You can save many meta data at the same time too: $post = Post::find(1); $post->saveMeta([ 'username' => 'jgrossi', 'url' => 'http://jgrossi.com', ]); You also have the createMeta() and createField() methods, that work like the saveX() methods, but they are used only for creation and return the PostMeta created instance, instead of bool. $post = Post::find(1); $postMeta = $post->createMeta('foo', 'bar'); // instance of PostMeta class $trueOrFalse = $post->saveMeta('foo', 'baz'); // boolean Querying Posts by Custom Fields (Meta) There are multiples possibilities to query posts by their custom fields (meta) by using scopes on a Post (or another other model which uses the HasMetaFields trait) class: To check if a meta key exists, use the hasMeta() scope: // Finds a published post with a meta flag. $post = Post::published()->hasMeta('featured_article')->first(); If you want to precisely match a meta-field, you can use the hasMeta() scope with a value. // Find a published post which matches both meta_key and meta_value. $post = Post::published()->hasMeta('username', 'jgrossi')->first(); If you need to match multiple meta-fields, you can also use the hasMeta() scope passing an array as parameter: $post = Post::hasMeta(['username' => 'jgrossi'])->first(); $post = Post::hasMeta(['username' => 'jgrossi', 'url' => 'jgrossi.com'])->first(); // Or just passing the keys $post = Post::hasMeta(['username', 'url'])->first(); If you need to match a case-insensitive string, or match with wildcards, you can use the hasMetaLike() scope with a value. This uses an SQL LIKE operator, so use '%' as a wildcard operator. // Will match: 'J Grossi', 'J GROSSI', and 'j grossi'. $post = Post::published()->hasMetaLike('author', 'J GROSSI')->first(); // Using % as a wildcard will match: 'J Grossi', 'J GROSSI', 'j grossi', 'Junior Grossi' etc. $post = Post::published()->hasMetaLike('author', 'J%GROSSI')->first(); Fields Aliases The Post class has support to \"aliases\", so if you check the Post class you should note some aliases defined in the static $aliases array, like title for post_title and content for post_content. $post = Post::find(1); $post->title === $post->post_title; // true If you're extending the Post class to create your own class you can use $aliases too. Just add new aliases to that static property inside your own class and it will automatically inherit all aliases from parent Post class: class A extends \\Corcel\\Post { protected static $aliases = [ 'foo' => 'post_foo', ]; } $a = A::find(1); echo $a->foo; echo $a->title; // from Post class Custom Scopes To order posts you can use newest() and oldest() scopes, for both Post and User classes: $newest = Post::newest()->first(); $oldest = Post::oldest()->first(); Pagination To order posts just use Eloquent paginate() method: $posts = Post::published()->paginate(5); foreach ($posts as $post) { // ... } To display the pagination links just call the links() method: {{ $posts->links() }} Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) If you want to retrieve a custom field created by the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin, you have to install the corcel/acf plugin - click here for more information - and call the custom field like this: $post = Post::find(123); echo $post->acf->some_radio_field; $repeaterFields = $post->acf->my_repeater_name; To avoid unnecessary SQL queries just set the field type you're requesting. Usually two SQL queries are necessary to get the field type, so if you want to specify it you're skipping those extra queries: $post = Post::find(123); echo $post->acf->text('text_field_name'); echo $post->acf->boolean('boolean_field_name'); Custom Post Type You can work with custom post types too. You can use the type(string) method or create your own class. // using type() method $videos = Post::type('video')->status('publish')->get(); // using your own class class Video extends Corcel\\Post { protected $postType = 'video'; } $videos = Video::status('publish')->get(); Using type() method will make Corcel to return all objects as Corcel\\Post. Using your custom class you have the advantage to customize classes, including custom methods and properties, return all objects as Video, for example. Custom post types and meta data: // Get 3 posts with custom post type (store) and show its address $stores = Post::type('store')->status('publish')->take(3)->get(); foreach ($stores as $store) { $storeAddress = $store->address; // option 1 $storeAddress = $store->meta->address; // option 2 $storeAddress = $store->fields->address; // option 3 } Configuring the returning Instance Every time you call something like Post::type('video)->first() or Video::first() you receive a Corcel\\Model\\Post instance. If you choose to create a new class for your custom post type, you can have this class be returned for all instances of that post type. Registering Post Types (the easy way) Instead of call Post::registerPostType() method for all custom post type you want to register, just use the Corcel's config file and map all custom posts and it's classes. They will be registered automatically for you: 'post_types' => [ 'video' => App\\Video::class, 'foo' => App\\Foo::class, ] So every time you query a custom post type the mapped instance will be returned. This is particular useful when you are intending to get a Collection of Posts of different types (e.g. when fetching the posts defined in a menu). Registering Post Types (the hard way) //all objects in the $videos Collection will be instances of Post $videos = Post::type('video')->status('publish')->get(); // register the video custom post type and its particular class Post::registerPostType('video', '\\App\\Video') //now all objects in the $videos Collection will be instances of Video $videos = Post::type('video')->status('publish')->get(); You can also do this for inbuilt classes, such as Page or Post. Simply register the Page or Post class with the associated post type string, and that object will be returned instead of the default one. Shortcodes From config (Laravel) You can map all shortcodes you want inside the config/corcel.php file, under the 'shortcodes' key. In this case you should create your own class that implements the Corcel\\Shortcode interface, that requires a render() method: 'shortcodes' => [ 'foo' => App\\Shortcodes\\FooShortcode::class, 'bar' => App\\Shortcodes\\BarShortcode::class, ], This is a sample shortcode class: class FakeShortcode implements \\Corcel\\Shortcode { /** * @param ShortcodeInterface $shortcode * @return string */ public function render(ShortcodeInterface $shortcode) { return sprintf( 'html-for-shortcode-%s-%s', $shortcode->getName(), $shortcode->getParameter('one') ); } } In runtime You can add shortcodes by calling the addShortcode method on the Post model : // [gallery id=\"1\"] Post::addShortcode('gallery', function ($shortcode) { return $shortcode->getName() . '.' . $shortcode->getParameter('id'); }); $post = Post::find(1); echo $post->content; Laravel 5.5 uses Package Auto-Discovery, so doesn't require you to manually add the ServiceProvider If you are using Laravel, we suggest adding your shortcodes handlers in App\\Providers\\AppServiceProvider, in the boot method. Shortcode Parsing Shortcodes are parsed with the thunderer/shortcode library. Several different parsers are provided. RegularParser is the most technically correct and is provided by default. This is suitable for most cases. However if you encounter some irregularities in your shortcode parsing, you may need to configure Corcel to use the WordpressParser, which more faithfully matches WordPress' shortcode regex. To do this, if you are using Laravel, edit the config/corcel.php file, and uncomment your preferred parser. Alternatively, you can replace this with a parser of your own. 'shortcode_parser' => Thunder\\Shortcode\\Parser\\RegularParser::class, // 'shortcode_parser' => Thunder\\Shortcode\\Parser\\WordpressParser::class, If you are not using Laravel, you can to do this in runtime, calling the setShortcodeParser() method from any class which uses the Shortcodes trait, such as Post, for example. $post->setShortcodeParser(new WordpressParser()); echo $post->content; // content parsed with \"WordpressParser\" class For more information about the shortcode package, click here. Taxonomies You can get taxonomies for a specific post like: $post = Post::find(1); $taxonomy = $post->taxonomies()->first(); echo $taxonomy->taxonomy; Or you can search for posts using its taxonomies: $post = Post::taxonomy('category', 'php')->first(); Post Format You can also get the post format, like the WordPress function get_post_format(): echo $post->getFormat(); // should return something like 'video', etc Pages Pages are like custom post types. You can use Post::type('page') or the Corcel\\Model\\Page class. use Corcel\\Model\\Page; // Find a page by slug $page = Page::slug('about')->first(); // OR $page = Post::type('page')->slug('about')->first(); echo $page->post_title; Categories and Taxonomies Get a category or taxonomy or load posts from a certain category. There are multiple ways to achieve it. // all categories $cat = Taxonomy::category()->slug('uncategorized')->posts->first(); echo \"\"; print_r($cat->name); echo \"\"; // only all categories and posts connected with it $cat = Taxonomy::where('taxonomy', 'category')->with('posts')->get(); $cat->each(function($category) { echo $category->name; }); // clean and simple all posts from a category $cat = Category::slug('uncategorized')->posts->first(); $cat->posts->each(function($post) { echo $post->post_title; }); Attachment and Revision Getting the attachment and/or revision from a Post or Page. $page = Page::slug('about')->with('attachment')->first(); // get feature image from page or post print_r($page->attachment); $post = Post::slug('test')->with('revision')->first(); // get all revisions from a post or page print_r($post->revision); Thumbnails Getting the thumbnail for a Post or Page. $post = Post::find(1); // Retrieve an instance of Corcel\\Model\\Meta\\ThumbnailMeta. print_r($post->thumbnail); // For convenience you may also echo the thumbnail instance to get the URL of the original image. echo $post->thumbnail; To retrieve a particular thumbnail size you may call the ->size() method on the thumbnail object and pass in a thumbnail size string parameter (e.g. thumbnail or medium). If the thumbnail has been generated, this method returns an array of image metadata, otherwise the original image URL will be returned as a fallback. if ($post->thumbnail !== null) { /** * [ * 'file' => 'filename-300x300.jpg', * 'width' => 300, * 'height' => 300, * 'mime-type' => 'image/jpeg', * 'url' => 'http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/filename-300x300.jpg', * ] */ print_r($post->thumbnail->size(Corcel\\Model\\Meta\\ThumbnailMeta::SIZE_THUMBNAIL)); // http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/filename.jpg print_r($post->thumbnail->size('invalid_size')); } Options In previous versions of Corcel this classe was called Options instead of Option (singular). So take care of using always this class in the singular form starting from v2.0.0. The Option::getAll() method was removed in Corcel 2+, in favor of Option::asArray($keys []). You can use the Option class to get data from wp_options table: $siteUrl = Option::get('siteurl'); You can also add new options: Option::add('foo', 'bar'); // stored as string Option::add('baz', ['one' => 'two']); // this will be serialized and saved You can get all options in a simple array: $options = Option::asArray(); echo $options['siteurl']; Or you can specify only the keys you want to get: $options = Option::asArray(['siteurl', 'home', 'blogname']); echo $options['home']; Menu To get a menu by its slug, use the syntax below. The menu items will be loaded in the items variable (it's a collection of Corcel\\Model\\MenuItem objects). The currently supported menu items are: Pages, Posts, Custom Links and Categories. Once you'll have instances of MenuItem class, if you want to use the original instance (like the original Page or Term, for example), just call the MenuItem::instance() method. The MenuItem object is just a post with post_type equals nav_menu_item: $menu = Menu::slug('primary')->first(); foreach ($menu->items as $item) { echo $item->instance()->title; // if it's a Post echo $item->instance()->name; // if it's a Term echo $item->instance()->link_text; // if it's a custom link } The instance() method will return the matching object: Post instance for post menu item; Page instance for page menu item; CustomLink instance for custom menu item; Term instance for category menu item. Multi-levels Menus To handle multi-levels menus, loop through all the menu items to put them on the right levels, for example. You can use the MenuItem::parent() method to retrieve the parent instance of that menu item: $items = Menu::slug('foo')->first()->items; $parent = $items->first()->parent(); // Post, Page, CustomLink or Term (category) To group menu items according their parents, you can use the ->groupBy() method in the $menu->items collection, grouping menu items by their $item->parent()->ID. To read more about the groupBy() method take a look on the Laravel documentation. Users You can manipulate users in the same manner you work with posts: // All users $users = User::get(); // A specific user $user = User::find(1); echo $user->user_login; Authentication Using Laravel If you're using Laravel 5.4 or older, make sure you have the CorcelServiceProvider provider registered. And then, define the user provider in config/auth.php to allow Laravel to login with WordPress users: 'providers' => [ 'users' => [ 'driver' => 'corcel', 'model' => Corcel\\Model\\User::class, ], ], Now you can use the Auth facade to authenticate users: Auth::validate([ 'email' => 'admin@example.com', // or using 'username' too 'password' => 'secret', ]); To make Laravel's Password Reset work with Corcel, we have to override how passwords are stored in the database. To do this, you must change Auth/PasswordController.php from: use App\\Http\\Controllers\\Controller; use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\ResetsPasswords; class PasswordController extends Controller { use ResetsPasswords; to use App\\Http\\Controllers\\Controller; use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\ResetsPasswords; use Corcel\\Laravel\\Auth\\ResetsPasswords as CorcelResetsPasswords; class PasswordController extends Controller { use ResetsPasswords, CorcelResetsPasswords { CorcelResetsPasswords::resetPassword insteadof ResetsPasswords; } Not using Laravel You can use the AuthUserProvider class to manually authenticate a user : $userProvider = new Corcel\\Laravel\\Auth\\AuthUserProvider; $user = $userProvider->retrieveByCredentials(['username' => 'admin']); if(!is_null($user) && $userProvider->validateCredentials($user, ['password' => 'admin'])) { // successfully login } Remember you can use both username and email as credentials for a User. Running Tests To run the phpunit tests, execute the following command : ./vendor/bin/phpunit If you have the global phpunit command installed you can just type: phpunit All tests were written using Sqlite with :memory database, so it runs in your memory. All tests use factories and migrations. Take a look on tests/database/factories and tests/database/migrations directories for more information. Contributing All contributions are welcome to help improve Corcel. Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines: Fork https://github.com/corcel/corcel in Github; Clone your forked repository (not Corcel's) locally and create your own branch based on the version you want to fix (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5): git checkout -b my-fix-branch 2.5; Make all code changes. Remember here to write at least one test case for any feature you add or any bugfix (if it's not tested yet). Our goal is to have 100% of the code covered by tests, so help us to write a better code ;-) If you don' have experience with tests it's a good opportunity to learn. Just take a look into our tests cases and you'll see how simple they are. Run the unit tests locally to make sure your changes did not break any other piece of code; Push your new branch to your forked repository, usually git push origin HEAD should work; In GitHub again, create a Pull Request (PR) from your custom my-fix-branch branch (from your forked repository) to the related branch (corcel:2.5, for example, not corcel:master, please; Wait for the approval :-) Licence MIT License © Junior Grossi",

Our family's e-commerce business previously had a slow and bloated WooCommerce site, largely due to my skill issues. However, we were able to rescue the site by using Corcel, Laravel, Filament, and LunarPHP. My wife still uses the WordPress admin interface as the main admin tool, while the public-facing website is rendered by Laravel, with data provided seamlessly through Corcel. reply n3storm 12 hours agoparentin wordpress ecosystem do not blame yourself if you end up with a bloated site :) reply chiefalchemist 8 hours agorootparentSandly, Automattic / WooComm is responsible for such thing. For example, the product gallery is such all images - thumbs and main slides - load on page load. If you don't click any thumbs - and had 10 total images - 9 would have loaded for naught. But there are BE + FE ways to fix that :) Also, WooComm recently introduced HPOS that moved order meta into its own table. Smart! But there is still order data captured for every order (e.g., customer order IP, etc).that's in the meta table. Why those we're moved to the new table IDK. reply n3storm 5 hours agorootparentThe real issue is that customers without knowledge are asking explicitly for wordpress instead letting us techs give the best advice. reply conradolandia 4 hours agorootparentMost techs give terrible advice. reply chiefalchemist 2 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand, most techs are bias. That is, the tool they know is always the best solution, whether that's true to not. Yeah, perhaps there are times when WP isn't the ideal choice from a pure technology POV, but there's more to it than that. For example, most (solo) devs complete dismiss the \"getting hit by a bus\" test. Sorry, but no one should accept advice from anyone who dismisses that test. reply todotask 9 hours agoparentprevAfter taking a quick look at your e-commerce site, you could simplify it further without compromising performance over personalization/technology stack if you have alternative options especially minimal codebase and CDN friendly. reply dizaime 5 hours agorootparentYou are right, I should completely move out of Woocommerce and exclusively use Laravel + Filament + LunarPHP or even use hosted Shopify and decouple myself from the tech stack.

I took the WordPress-based / WooCommerce system and split it into 1) the Shopify system for admin stuff and also the whole payment system and 2) the \"frontend\" i.e. the consumer facing part BEFORE the payment (I used Symfony, similar to Laravel, but more modular and I was more familiar with it). Theoretically you could fetch all the product data via the Shopify API and then sync it automagically. But in the first iteration, we just copied some of the basic product data into a simple Symfony Admin backend and made a simple javascript-based checkout slide-out, and only when they were ready to pay, they would be forwarded to Shopify. This way we would have full control of the user experience up to the point of purchase, and then Shopify would take over. I thought this was the best way I can deliver a performant website, while also being able to sleep well, because all the money stuff and all the customer data is handled by Shopify. I was able to increase search engine traffic by 30% this way, reduce page size and increase page speeds and revenue increased significantly. After 3 years, he decided he wanted to make it more \"professional\", so he fired me, I got none of the credit (\"the search engine traffic must be because of better branding - and the page isn't up to my standards of aesthetics... yes, the designers who were supposed to deliver the designs kept stalling and delivered NOTHING and you had to just create something on the fly before the main selling season, and yes we had huge sales gains on the website and more traffic, but this was not because of the website\"... they didn't change any of the marketing or any of their strategies, by the way.) So they hired an agency team with a project manager, designer, developer, marketing person; who then asked me to give them the source code from git so they can upload the code to their FTP server (!). And they pretty much didn't change anything for a few years, everything looked the same. After like 4-5 years, they adjusted the design a bit, but still looked VERY similar. reply cess11 9 hours agorootparentprevFirst request to finished render without any client side caching takes 5 s on my end, so I expect it to take maybe the double on an elderly device with a wobbly connection. There might be better ways to increase profits. reply hu3 19 hours agoprevIf I understood correctly, this is basically a collection of Eloquent (Laravel's ORM) models that represent Wordpress database tables. Nifty tool for PHP projects that need to interface with Wordpress data. With how large the Wordpress market is, this is probably desired by more teams than one could think of at a quick glance. reply 3D30497420 11 hours agoparentAgreed. I've been doing freelance design/dev for small businesses for 15+ years and at first I would always choose the best current CMS available. Wordpress was always an option, but it was clunky and had a mixed reputation. Well, all those CMSs are gone and I had to migrate several sites. Wordpress offers one of the most important things to these small businesses: (relative) consistency and dependability. I can very much see the benefit of decoupling the front and back ends for these cases, especially since in most cases nowadays the public facing pages are pre-rendered/cached anyway. Also, I love Laravel. reply samuell 10 hours agorootparentJust wanting to chime in that ProcessWire [1] has provided this dependency for me over the last 10 years, even in a better way than WordPress can provide, since it is such a small core that rarely needs updating, and that most if not all functionality can be developed through a few lines it's amazing PHP API rather than tons of 3rd party plugins that need constant updating. 10+ year site still running without me touching it. One customer even was able to find a (non-expert) developer to develop it further, since it is all pure PHP anyways. As a former Drupal webdev, ProcessWire is heaven. https://processwire.com/ reply chiefalchemist 8 hours agorootparentprev> Wordpress offers one of the most important things to these small businesses: (relative) consistency and dependability. Kudos. Maintainability. It matters. I wish more devs realized that their DIY solutions are a disservice to the client once they leave the project. WP has it (many) faults. But in general a good new dev can - with some effort - pick up where the ex-dev left off. Clients should not loose sleep tracking down support for some esoteric megalomaniac-developer solution. reply benatkin 17 hours agoparentprevIt circumvents the GPL unless you have a very unusual interpretation or have it putting GPL code into your database, with better performance and less complexity that the REST and GraphQL wrappers that are common ways to do headless WordPress. reply cess11 9 hours agoparentprevLooks to me to be a bit more than that in the repo. Not sure if this is a thing in Laravel yet but usually it's easy to generate ORM classes from an existing database. Symfony has it in their CLI tool, or had back in 2019 when I last used it. reply saltybytes 3 hours agoprevHow's Corcel different to using WP's own API? What are the pros / cons? reply kayodelycaon 2 hours agoparentA direct database connection means almost all of your queries will work without any error handling. Using an API requires you to handle lost connection every time you make a request. Direct database connections almost always are orders of magnitude faster, especially when joins are involved. reply philipwhiuk 3 hours agoprevThis is a good mid-migration step but I'm not sure the WP database design is of particular merit otherwise. (This is speaking as someone who just migrated a site TO WordPress because it was still better than the previous system...) reply crooked-v 12 hours agoprevI can see why people would do this with existing WordPress setups, but would there be any reason to consider it for a new build over a dedicated headless CMS (like Strapi or a bunch for PHP I don't know well enough to name) or headless CMS SAAS (like Prismic)? reply ianhawes 6 hours agoparentWe migrated from WordPress to Prismic several years ago, then migrated to Strapi a year ago, and it has been miserable. We originally used Corcel with our Laravel installation, but somehow still found malware, so we immediately decommissioned the entire WordPress install and switched to Prismic. Prismic worked great and I regret switching to Strapi, but I felt the extensibility would be better (and latency reduced) if we self-hosted our headless CMS. Managing Strapi is a full-time job, and their support for things like localization and their API are terrible. Don’t believe their marketing hype. reply dotancohen 10 hours agoparentprevYes. Every content manager and content writer knows and loves Wordpress. It's only developers that hate Wordpress. Corcel lets those content people use the tools they like, and lets developers build secure, performant, maintainable websites. reply woody311 17 hours agoprevI haven't used Corcel as I haven't needed to reach for Eloquent but https://github.com/roots/acorn and the ecosystem surrounding it is fantastic. reply tcfunk 3 hours agoprevAnyone know of something similar but for interfacing with a Drupal database? reply ssnepenthe 17 hours agoprevThere is also wordpress-interop on the doctrine side: https://github.com/williarin/wordpress-interop reply aantix 15 hours agoprevInteresting..

WP has a very good REST API reply jackconsidine 18 hours agoprevThis is very cool! It always felt like PHP was behind in tooling - git-driven CI was challenging for WordPress (because the framework's plugins edit the project files and it is married to subversion), and serverless PHP was basically impossible until Laravel Vapor came along. Projects like this give me hope and excitement. I wish Corcel was around years ago when I had to write gross SQL string interpolation for various WordPress projects. reply djxfade 10 hours agoparentPHP hasn't been behind in tooling, WordPress has (and still is). Frameworks like Laravel are very much up to par when it comes to tooling. reply rgbrenner 18 hours agoparentprevAgreed on PHP tooling. I'm surprised more hasn't been borrowed from other frameworks. Working in this space too on serverless wordpress+mariadb[0]. We have a lot of open source tooling on our roadmap to make this as complete as serverless for other languages. 0. https://www.agiler.io reply askonomm 7 hours agorootparentPHP tooling is amazing. WordPress tooling is not, since it uses archaic development practices. reply emj 5 hours agorootparentI am not a PHP developer, and our php code is all third party apps. Do you have any write ups on PHP tooling? My feeling is that php tooling has a hard time handling stateless images, you often need to install plugins to php applications with a GUI with no good way to do it in a build process. Config of php applications is always an mix of php.ini and database config, often making monitoring a case of writing custom http requests and html parsing. I am not that happy with Java but there are many things it get right especially in tooling. reply ceejayoz 18 hours agoparentprevI think Bref predates Vapor.

Is it derived from \"coerce\", because it can be pronounced like \"core cell\"? Or something else?

WP has a REST API. It has a GraphQL plugin.

Or is it built separately? reply gexla 18 hours agoparentFrom skimming the docs, this is more about WP database than WP itself. In other words, you could install WP to setup the DB and then kill the WP install if you liked. 1. It looks like it only works with that which would be provided by WP by default. For example, the link below is an extension for working with Woocommerce. Given that WP doesn't even need to exist (you only need the WP DB) then you could use whatever setup is compatible with Laravel. You could also have separate environments with WP and Laravel sharing a remote DB. 2. Both WP and Laravel would work as if the other didn't exist. They only share the DB. https://github.com/corcel/woocommerce reply TheCapeGreek 13 hours agoparentprev [–] Would Acorn not also fall under the same utility?
