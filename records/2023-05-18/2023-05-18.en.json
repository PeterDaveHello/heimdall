    "hn_content": "A portable e-paper computer called Beepberry, designed for chatting on Beeper, has been developed as a side project by erohead and @sqfmi. The device features an LCD screen, physical keyboard, and runs on a Raspberry Pi. Pre-orders for the first batch are now available on the website for $79 or $99 (which includes a Pi Zero). The device is a development kit rather than a complete product, built for hacker entertainment and challenges. The downside is that the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi is relatively high compared to e-paper displays, with latency and contrast differences noted by commenters.A new device called the Beepberry features a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Blackberry-style keyboard. The device is aimed at developers and hackers and is available to pre-order. The device's battery life can last around six months from a cr2032 coin cell. The Beepberry can be used for tasks such as email, sending texts and basic programming. The device allows for easy modification and expansion, suiting a range of applications from live-coding to fieldwork. The device is equipped with USB and HDMI ports, enabling the user to connect peripherals. Finally, the design is available in CNC aluminium or clear transparent plastic.SQFMI, the team behind the open-source smartwatch Watchy, has created a new device called \"BeepBerry\" that pairs with an Android phone or Raspberry Pi, and emulates a Blackberry phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard and a color display. The idea is to provide a distraction-free, low-cost device for DIY enthusiasts, developers, or anyone who needs an alternative to using a smartphone or traditional computer for basic tasks. BeepBerry can also be used for SMS, email, SSH, GNSS, and other IoT projects. SQFMI plans to develop future versions of BeepBerry with additional features such as LORA, solar panels, and an expansion shield to allow for custom hardware addons.The BeepBerry is a new hacking tool designed for chat enthusiasts and developers. The device combines traditional computing power with a stunning retro design featuring a physical BlackBerry like keyboard. With the same display technology as the Pebble watch, the device enables video calls, connects to more than 15 chat apps, supports the creation of custom scripts, and offers numerous hardware customization capabilities. However, it still has some drawbacks, including its buggy app, which limits its use as a default SMS app. Despite this, users have expressed their admiration for the device and its adaptability for customized configurations. While the BeepBerry is not an e-ink screen, it maintains display contents and runs on low power when not writing. Overall, the device is an excellent device for quick administrative tasks and hacker-friendly communication.A group has created a prototype for a handheld device with a Blackberry keyboard that uses a Pi Zero W, with a stock battery of 2000mAh. Battery life estimates suggest 20 hours of use and a week with optimizations. The device is available for preorder at $99 and will come with a battery, but no case. Customers can 3D print their case or order a CNC aluminum or plastic case later on. One commenter expressed disappointment with smartphones being locked down and called for legislation to address waste. Another expressed sadness that Discord was being used for the project. The project received positive feedback, with some ordering multiple devices.",

    "hn_content": "A query on Hacker News requests an explanation of the Transformer architecture and the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper, which have gained attention within the AI/ML community. The architecture uses \"attention\" to amplify self-similar parts of a sequence of vectors and can be interpreted as a differentiable lookup/hash table that encodes the relative positions of tokens in the attention frame. The Transformer's success comes from its parallelizable implementation and its ability to access information farther away in the sequence. The \"differentiability\" of a hash table refers to updating the model through gradient calculus and involves knowing how much parts of the model cause the network to err.-The Transformer architecture uses a multi-layer transformation algorithm to generate a new column of numbers predicting the properties of a word that will maximize coherence if added next to the sequence. \n-The mathematical transformation in each layer is called \"self-attention,\" and it allows the network to learn which items in the sequence should be given more attention. \n-The attention mechanism allows the network to choose words that fit well within the context of the sequence and increase coherence. \n-The back-propagation step during training allows for hierarchical decomposition of concepts. \n-Attention is the only thing that language models need to perform many interesting tasks.This post discusses the concept of attention in neural networks, specifically in the context of Transformers, and how it helps improve language processing. Attention allows for a deep understanding of sequences by observing how each element interacts with each other over many sequences. Transforming sequences into compressed low-dimensional vector representations allows for better downstream tasks, especially predicting the next item in a sequence. Attention is a technique to compute a weighted average of hidden states of the encoder, which can improve a seq2seq model's performance. The use of attention in Transformers eliminates the need for a fixed size context window and has led to more powerful language models. Several resources, including videos and articles, are available to learn more about attention and Transformers.The post explains the concept of Transformers in NLP, focusing on the attention mechanism used in this approach. The attention mechanism enables the model to consider all the input words at the same time and give more importance to the words that matter for understanding and translation. The post provides different resources, such as videos and articles, to understand transformers. There are implementation details such as how to consider the positional encoding, the number of attention heads used, and several attention layers stacked on one another. One crucial aspect of transformers is using a self-attention mechanism called Scaled Dot-Product Attention. However, some readers criticize the use of loaded terms such as \"attention\" and \"hallucination,\" leading them to think like an AGI. Finally, the post raises the question of how many answers in the comments could be generated or aided by the technology being described.- The Transformer is a neural network algorithm that considers the relationship of all parts of a piece of data\n- It consists of four mechanisms and two parts: normalization and attention blocks, followed by normalization and linear layers\n- The attention mechanism compares the relationships between all the inputs and creates a relationship that's similar to creating a lookup table\n- Transformers are useful for language processing and can learn contextual meaning\n- Understanding the Transformer requires technical precision and some background knowledge in AI/ML, and there are various resources available for learning more about the algorithm- The Transformers model is a type of neural network used in language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and text generation\n- The model uses two main components: encoders and decoders, which employ a technique called attention to focus on relevant parts of input and output sequences\n- Attention is a mathematical technique that allows the model to learn the relationships between elements in a sequence and handle long sequences without losing information or context \n- The Transformers model is more expressive than previous language models like bag-of-words models, which can only assign positive or negative sentiment to a sentence \n- The model strips away matrix manipulations and instead employs a scoring system called Query/Key/Value computation to reinterpret the meaning of words based on their surrounding context in the sentence.The transformative architecture is a new parameterized function that unlocks more cognitive abilities with an increase in resources. The architecture relies on utilizing accelerators like GPU chips using differentiable programming frameworks and libraries, and it lets you cheaply answer questions about how any small change to the input will affect the output. It generates messages, translates between languages, and more. This technology can be complicated, but the ElI5 explanation is that \"Transformers: what if you didn't have to process sentences as a sequence of words but rather as a picture of words.\" With the increase in hardware for research and development pipelines, these amazing GPUs have been made more accessible, and Differentiable programming has made prediction cheaper.",

Fires in these grasslands and brush areas on the eastern slope of the Rockies have forced evacuations and concert cancellations in suburban enclaves this spring.

    "hn_content": "Increasing development on \"Urban-wildland border\" makes controlled burns nearly impossible, leading to uncontrolled wildfires, destroyed properties and loss of life. This is compounded by the fact that fires were suppressed to address economic concerns and are left until they become uncontrollable infernos; and fuel builds up, making wildfires even more devastating. Barriers in funding, public opinion and regulatory compliance also hinder the implementation of controlled burns. However, proposed solutions include selective delay of any specific prescribed fire within their borders by states, more funding and tax/insurance requirements for those living in the WUI. It is suggested that improved prescribed burn practices and removal of fuel buildup will make the ecosystem stronger and increase resilience against wildfires.The article discusses the benefits of controlled burns for fire mitigation. The comment section addresses concerns about potential liability for negative externalities caused by the burns. There is debate about responsibilities of the federal versus state government and the balance between individual rights and collective action in addressing ecological issues. Some commenters provide anecdotes and statistics that demonstrate the potential risk and benefits of implementing controlled burns. The conversation acknowledges the complex nature of ecological management and the need for accountability for negative outcomes, while also recognizing the benefits of proactive measures.The article discusses the trade-offs faced by professionals and how they navigate externalities. The analogy of wildfire prevention is used, and the discussion covers various solutions such as prescribed burns, insurance funds, and better pricing mechanisms. The problem of mitigating climate change is also noted, with the observation that it will necessarily change winners and losers. The article touches on ethical frameworks, the difficulty of preventing litigation, and the effectiveness of government regulations. However, the overall tone is cynical, with a focus on the difficulty of navigating externalities that face professionals and the limitations of legal and economic solutions.China's ability to bulldoze entire villages for the sake of public infrastructure development, while ignoring the effects on the 'little people', is compared to the sluggishness of infrastructure progress in the US because of factors such as increased individualism, the 'get rich quick' mentality, and increased litigation. While government regulation is not without its flaws, it serves the purpose of balancing the interests of the greater good against those of the individual. Succession and power struggles in dictatorships also lead to instability. Importantly, the post raises the issue of balance - China's decisive actions may produce results swiftly, but come at the cost of individual rights and quality of life, while US's democracy is mired in bureaucracy and red tape, resulting in lost opportunities.There is a discussion about controlled burns being used in forestry to prevent destructive wildfires. Advocates argue that smaller-scale controlled burns can prevent larger wildfires and allow forests to thrive. Critics argue that controlled burns can be dangerous and difficult to manage, and that they create air pollution. Additionally, some responders discuss the pros and cons of centralized vs. decentralized decision-making. There is also some discussion about the impact of climate change, and how it makes managing fires more difficult. Ultimately, the conversation highlights the need for careful and calculated risk management when it comes to fire prevention.A discussion on the importance of controlled burns to maintain healthy and stable ecosystems, particularly in wildfire-prone areas like California and Colorado. Controlled burns are an effective tool to prevent the buildup of excess fuel that can fuel intense wildfires. However, they are subject to government regulations that limit their use due to air quality concerns and weather conditions. This is complicated by the lack of wildlife necessary to manage the brush in some areas, as well as past policies that have contributed to higher tree densities in forests, making them more vulnerable to fires. The post also discusses how controlled burns can reduce carbon output and help repopulate ecosystems and offers other solutions such as mechanized mowing and goat herds.Regulations impede the ability to prevent wildfires, leading to selective enforcement and complaints from locals. Some suggest controlled burns and prescriptive cullings of deer to combat this issue while others propose using drones for surveillance. Environmentalist meddling, such as blocking expansion of carbon-free nuclear energy, has harmed the environment. Goats and mixed species mature forests are effective alternatives to controlled burns, but not always a practical solution. Arsonists are not heroes, and proper burning can lead to a net carbon increase, benefiting ecosystems.",

    "hn_content": "Americans are reluctant to relocate for jobs due to the high costs of uprooting and re-establishing oneself in a new community. Job security is also a factor given the precarious nature of employment. Layoffs often occur soon after an employee has relocated for work. The lack of protection against corporate exploitation has been attributed to cultural factors, including a reluctance to unionize and a general acceptance of cruelty in certain industries. The United States has the highest median income in the world, but that does not necessarily translate to broad-based prosperity. Many American workers face job insecurity and high poverty rates. The US healthcare system is often seen as a burden to workers, inhibiting their willingness to join unions and advocate for collective action. The idea of a professional guild as an alternative to a union has been proposed as a way to ensure basic protections without limiting earning potential.The text discusses the ability of small worker groups to form their own union, given that a large union already exists. The argument suggests that large unions prevent smaller groups from organizing and collectively bargaining. However, it is noted that small groups can still create their own union, provided they leave the large union. A comparison is made with a company telling a group they can organize elsewhere, although it is illegal for a company to prevent a group from organizing. There are varied responses highlighting the structures of unions, the difficulties in finding jobs within the tech industry, and the quality of management. The text does not offer a specific topic or theme to appeal to the readers.The article discusses the problems with MBA programs and how they train managers to prioritize company interests over those of their employees. The discussion also touches on how social media platforms are unrepresentative of common sentiment due to founder effects, visible voting systems amplifying extreme opinions, and internet forums attracting people with a certain set of characteristics. The conversation shifts to the difficulty of moving due to home ownership and the economic barriers for renters to enter the housing market, disenfranchising them politically. Lastly, the conversation touches on the advantages of larger homes, particularly having more spaces for specific tasks or hobbies.The comments largely discuss the housing market in the US, and the high cost of homeownership due to stagnant wages and a lack of supply. Some commenters mention downsizing and/or renting as alternatives to owning property themselves and becoming landlords. Others acknowledge the benefits of owning property but highlight the time and expense required for maintenance and management. Overall, the discussion highlights the difficulties of navigating the housing market and achieving financial stability in light of skyrocketing real estate prices.The discussion revolves around the viability of selling a house with high equity and buying another with a smaller mortgage payment. While interest rates have gone up, selling a house with significant equity allows for a downsized mortgage payment. The concept is easier said than done, with many considerations to take into account, including property taxes, transaction costs, and interest rates. While the statement is dependent on the current housing market's pricing, it is feasible to buy a house with a smaller mortgage payment by selling your existing house. However, the situation is often not ideal, with a shortage of houses or inflated prices, which can limit your options and buying power.Homeowners who refinanced their loans a few years ago may not be able to afford to sell their houses and buy in another area due to raised interest rates from the Federal Reserve. This lack of labor mobility could slow down economic growth. Some also argue that California's Prop 13, while limiting property taxes, disproportionately burdens new purchasers and their tenants. There is no sustainable or equitable property tax system that doesn't involve current property owners giving something up. Renting has become cheaper than owning in some areas. As remote work becomes more prevalent in the technology sector, more people may move from high-cost cities to smaller towns with more affordable housing prices while building their career. Freelancing also provides some with freedom and agency over their life choices.Remote work is leading to people leaving expensive first-tier cities like NY, SF, and LA for smaller cities, but not everyone is leaving; some people love the dense communities. Companies are trying to claw back as much remote work as possible but some experts say that the trend is here to stay. Remote jobs do not eliminate the risk of layoffs, but remote work offers more prospects for remote employment opportunities that do not require relocation, and remote workers report less stress and no commute. Smaller towns are getting more expensive as more people move out of the cities. Tier-2 cities may be growing due to a primary city effect, where high-value manufacturing or professional jobs are relocating there.This post contains a discussion on how difficult it can be to fire an underperforming employee and the differences in labor laws across various countries. Some comments also mention the dehumanization of employees by CEOs and the need for employment contracts with minimum lengths of employment to protect workers. Overall, the post does not contain any major technological breakthrough or release.The article discusses the controversies surrounding the Devil's Advocacy practice, with various users offering counterarguments. \nThe practice requires people to think and come up with strong reasons to disagree or agree, which can improve arguments' substance. \nSolutions may have unintended consequences, and it is essential to weigh tradeoffs instead of merely declaring one side as evil. \nAdministrative agencies and courts already determine what constitutes grounds for firing in many cases. \nSome people already do the bare minimum at their job or perform poorly, but executives pressuring workers to do more for less is already a prevalent issue. \nThe practice of Devil's Advocacy raises concerns when it coerces people to abandon stable means of sustenance and lay them off without reason, which is considered indefensible.",

At the staff engineer level, everything you do has a high opportunity cost, so your work needs to be important.You build credibility every time you take on a chaotic situation and make it easier for everyone else to understand.Know why the problem you\u2019re working on is strategically important, and if it\u2019s not, do something else.Whenever there\u2019s a feeling of \u201csomeone should do something here\u201d, there s a reasonable chance that this someone is you.Writing about engineering strategy is hard because good strategy is pretty boring, and it\u2019s kind of boring to write about. If you write something interesting, it\u2019s probably wrong.What is insideThe first thing the book addresses is the question: Who is the staff engineer, and how are they different from IC and management roles? What are their priorities, skills, scopes, expectations, and position at the corporate charts and ladders?The best take from this part for me was a technique to align the shape of your position with you and your peers and managers. It suggests creating an informal role description document where you state your goals, the vision of success for you, and the results that you aim to achieve. I would even say that this is a very proactive and helpful practice in general, not only for staff positions.The next parts, \u201cThree Maps\u201d and \u201cCreating the Big Picture\u201d describe how to understand and identify important parts of company structure. They address many parts of it: technical landscape, formal and informal organizational charts, and places where decisions happen(if it exists, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t).Those parts recommend how to build knowledge about those systems by sourcing information and creating maps of where we at right now, our goals, and the landscape that surrounds the path to a goal.Very simple yet somewhat unconventional advice on building this knowledge was getting data from open resources:mailing lists and channels with updatesopen calendars and eventsnewly created slack channelsinformal discussionsPart \u201cFinite time\u201d is dedicated to personal management practices and prioritization of projects and tasks you take, so you and your business can get the most value from it.It\u2019s an odd default, that work calendars show only meetings. If you are doing focused work, then the calendar shows interruptions of this work.Put non-meetings on the calendar:Mail/slack checkscoffee, lunches, and short 1:1sDocumentation and codingIt introduces a simple yet beneficial technique to prioritize possible projects: Impact Effort Matrix.The meatiest part is in the middle of the book, told through the \u201cLeading big projects\u201d and \u201cWhy Have We Stopped\u201d chapters.It goes deep into practices of leading ambiguous projects and domains: navigating terrain, and laying down the paths. It provides very useful techniques for navigating projects in time and considering the higher-level picture of organization goals, answering questions about how to identify a place and time to start, stop or finish the project.There is a very large detailed section about resolving blocked and stuck projects with detailed examples. There were a lot of tips that matched many projects in my experience, It felt close to home. This is part that I definitely see myself revisiting many times.A large part is dedicated to setting up goals for big projects, and there is a fantastic template and framework for RFC documents.Later parts, \u201cYou are role model now\u201d and \u201cGood Influence at Scale\u201d are dedicated to how to apply higher standards to yourself and leading by exampleYour company might have a written definition of what good engineering means - written values, and engineering principles. But the clearest indicator of what the company values is what gets people promoted.I found those two parts very lengthy and touched too many topics at once. Both address knowledge-sharing practices, influencing and leading, being \u201can adult in the room\u201d and defusing conflicts at different scales. Many very useful examples of how your work can make processes smoother and serve as a \u201cglue\u201d between teams.if a junior person is taking meeting notes, they are unable to participate. If senior is takes notes, they are making sure that meeting is effectiveFinally, the concluding \u201cWhat\u2019s next\u201d part takes a step back to talk about career choices, when is the good time to change projects and companies at the staff level, how to grow your social connections, and how to maintain a healthy work-life balance.Who Will Find It UsefulSenior Engineers looking for the next career stepEngineers and Engineering Managers looking to establish team and cross-team communications.Engineers, Engineering Managers, Tech, and team leads working on ambiguous and large-scale projects and looking for frameworks to define, shape, and deliver.bookNEXT \u00bb\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0448",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post discusses the lack of \"hardcore\" engineering roles, with many companies only offering Jr.-to-Sr. level roles. The discussion shifts to what separates great programmers from others, with commentators noting the importance of stamina, commitment, discipline, and grit. Additionally, commenters discuss the potential for companies to spin off cool internal projects into startups, but note that most lack the vision and financial means to do so. There is also a debate about whether great work is the result of iterations in small steps or simply great ideas. Overall, the post highlights the challenges of finding truly innovative engineering roles and what it takes to achieve greatness in the field.Minecraft's success was due to a great idea, but recreating the core game is not easy and takes significant time and effort. The game's origins came from Notch's work on an Infiniminer clone, and he spent around a year developing Minecraft's core mechanics. The core consisted of complex systems such as mobs, smart blocks, crafting, Redstone wiring, multi-player networking, survival mode, biomes, and the Nether. Due to Minecraft's deceptive simplicity, many have tried to recreate it with incomplete mechanics. Great ideas can be executed well or poorly, and there is a distinction between engineering and craftsmanship. Companies can structure themselves to allow engineers to focus on what they do best, not adding overhead with non-engineering tasks. Big tech companies have entire departments dedicated to engineering for developer productivity and similar areas. Platforms roles require an expectation of quality and keep a balance between not being \"not hardcore enough\" or \"too hardcore.\" Community-led open-source projects can also require significant management and cat-herding.The post is about the frustration that comes with the staff-level platform engineering job, where saying \"no\" to the majority of requests is an essential part of the role; the technical component of the job is less difficult than the externalities of the job. The comments provide insight into the difference between leadership and management roles and how they relate to engineering titles like staff+ engineers. Some comments suggest looking for product companies rather than project/service companies when seeking software engineering work. The primary takeaway from the post is the challenges of navigating external pressures and expectations on top of the technical responsibilities of the job.The discussion revolves around how companies utilize staff+ engineers and how most people build software badly, and most companies expect software to be bad. The majority of companies are one-trick ponies, and incremental development is the path of least risk once product-to-market fit in a large market with high growth is achieved. To find interesting jobs, employees need to build credibility by being active on the right mailing lists or getting to know the right people. Companies like Dockers, JetBrains, Code Weavers, and Fastly hire a variety of skill levels, and the difference between them is probably that it is harder to get those jobs because everyone wants to work for the flashy exciting companies. Employees must also keep in mind that \"hardcore engineering\" end up in small firms and start-ups where equity compensation can end up paying them what they're worth if the skills pan out.The comments discuss the role of staff engineers and principal engineers in big tech and other industries. These positions involve high-level technical skills as well as some management responsibilities, often related to product management. Engineers who specialize in one area for a long time, like in the EE industry, may attain these positions. However, comments suggest that such positions may not always be fulfilling at larger companies due to bureaucracy and a lack of technical focus in day-to-day tasks. The comments also touch on the idea that strong software engineering requires management skills, but some believe that too much emphasis on management undermines engineering's potential and leads to slow innovation.There is a debate about what a staff engineer is, with some defining it as a role in which the engineer solves vaguely defined problems and guides others to solve them. Good software is defined by marginal improvements providing outstanding value. Staff engineers often remain individual contributors despite their high seniority. Titles and positions in the tech industry are often diluted and inflated. The creators of famous software do exist, and they tend to work at startups or in research departments. There are many non-CRUD tasks in the industry, and many technically challenging problems to solve. Reporting structures for staff engineers can vary, but they should be adept at handling ambiguity and being self-directed.The article discusses the Staff Engineer position, which entails more responsibility and less coding, with a focus on making high-level decisions and problem-solving rather than being hands-on. The role involves extensive communication and management responsibilities, with meetings and relationship-building becoming primary. Some companies do not require this position, and staff engineers may find themselves doing more of what they did before the promotion. The article also notes that staff engineers are difficult to find and are growing in importance. Readers of the post are introduced to different methodological approaches to engineering and management, and the importance of having technical skills and deep knowledge of a company's business domain.The Tech Times has compiled a series of comments about the role of staff engineers and the IC ladder. Many different opinions are presented, with some arguing that staff engineers are overhyped and that their roles are just normal work that has been made to sound more important. Others argue that the role is important and reflects the growth of engineering teams at large companies. The article also includes discussions about the importance of non-meeting time on one\u2019s calendar, and about the importance of understanding which skills are necessary for promotion at one\u2019s company in order to progress up the IC ladder. A few books and resources are recommended for exploring these topics more in depth.",

    "url": "https://github.com/ray-project/llm-numbers",
    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35978864",
    "content": "Numbers every LLM Developer should knowWhen I was at Google, there was a document put together by Jeff Dean, the legendary engineer, called Numbers every Engineer should know. It\u2019s really useful to have a similar set of numbers for LLM developers to know that are useful for back-of-the envelope calculations. Here we share particular numbers we at Anyscale use, why the number is important and how to use it to your advantage.Notes on the Github versionLast updates: 2023-05-17If you feel there's an issue with the accuracy of the numbers, please file an issue. Think there are more numbers that should be in this doc? Let us know or file a PR.We are thinking the next thing we should add here is some stats on tokens per second of different models.Prompts40-90%1: Amount saved by appending \u201cBe Concise\u201d to your promptIt\u2019s important to remember that you pay by the token for responses. This means that asking an LLM to be concise can save you a lot of money. This can be broadened beyond simply appending \u201cbe concise\u201d to your prompt: if you are using GPT-4 to come up with 10 alternatives, maybe ask it for 5 and keep the other half of the money.1.3: Average tokens per wordLLMs operate on tokens. Tokens are words or sub-parts of words, so \u201ceating\u201d might be broken into two tokens \u201ceat\u201d and \u201cing\u201d. A 750 word document in English will be about 1000 tokens. For languages other than English, the tokens per word increases depending on their commonality in the LLM's embedding corpus.Knowing this ratio is important because most billing is done in tokens, and the LLM\u2019s context window size is also defined in tokens.Prices2Prices are of course subject to change, but given how expensive LLMs are to operate, the numbers in this section are critical. We use OpenAI for the numbers here, but prices from other providers you should check out (Anthropic, Cohere) are in the same ballpark.~50: Cost Ratio of GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 Turbo3What this means is that for many practical applications, it\u2019s much better to use GPT-4 for things like generation and then use that data to fine tune a smaller model. It is roughly 50 times cheaper to use GPT-3.5-Turbo than GPT-4 (the \u201croughly\u201d is because GPT-4 charges differently for the prompt and the generated output) \u2013 so you really need to check on how far you can get with GPT-3.5-Turbo. GPT-3.5-Turbo is more than enough for tasks like summarization for example.5: Cost Ratio of generation of text using GPT-3.5-Turbo vs OpenAI embeddingThis means it is way cheaper to look something up in a vector store than to ask an LLM to generate it. E.g. \u201cWhat is the capital of Delaware?\u201d when looked up in an neural information retrieval system costs about 5x4 less than if you asked GPT-3.5-Turbo. The cost difference compared to GPT-4 is a whopping 250x!10: Cost Ratio of OpenAI embedding to Self-Hosted embeddingNote: this number is sensitive to load and embedding batch size, so please consider this approximate.In our blog post, we noted that using a g4dn.4xlarge (on-demand price: $1.20/hr) we were able to embed at about 9000 tokens per second using HuggingFace\u2019s SentenceTransformers (which are pretty much as good as OpenAI\u2019s embeddings). Doing some basic math of that rate and that node type indicates it is considerably cheaper (factor of 10 cheaper) to self-host embeddings (and that is before you start to think about things like ingress and egress fees).6: Cost Ratio of OpenAI base vs fine tuned model queriesIt costs you 6 times as much to serve a fine tuned model as it does the base model on OpenAI. This is pretty exorbitant, but might make sense because of the possible multi-tenancy of base models. It also means it is far more cost effective to tweak the prompt for a base model than to fine tune a customized model.1: Cost Ratio of Self-Hosted base vs fine-tuned model queriesIf you\u2019re self hosting a model, then it more or less costs the same amount to serve a fine tuned model as it does to serve a base one: the models have the same number of parameters.Training and Fine Tuning~$1 million: Cost to train a 13 billion parameter model on 1.4 trillion tokensThe LLaMa paper mentions it took them 21 days to train LLaMa using 2048 GPUs A100 80GB GPUs. We considered training our own model on the Red Pajama training set, then we ran the numbers. The above is assuming everything goes right, nothing crashes, and the calculation succeeds on the first time, etc. Plus it involves the coordination of 2048 GPUs. That\u2019s not something most companies can do (shameless plug time: of course, we at Anyscale can \u2013 that\u2019s our bread and butter! Contact us if you\u2019d like to learn more). The point is that training your own LLM is possible, but it\u2019s not cheap. And it will literally take days to complete each run. Much cheaper to use a pre-trained model.< 0.001: Cost ratio of fine tuning vs training from scratchThis is a bit of a generalization, but the cost of fine tuning is negligible. We showed for example that you can fine tune a 6B parameter model for about $7. Even at OpenAI\u2019s rate for its most expensive fine-tunable model, Davinci, it is 3c per 1000 tokens. That means to fine tune on the entire works of Shakespeare (about 1 million words), you\u2019re looking at $405. However, fine tuning is one thing and training from scratch is another \u2026GPU MemoryIf you\u2019re self-hosting a model, it\u2019s really important to understand GPU memory because LLMs push your GPU\u2019s memory to the limit. The following statistics are specifically about inference. You need considerably more memory for training or fine tuning.V100: 16GB, A10G: 24GB, A100: 40/80GB: GPU Memory CapacitiesIt may seem strange, but it\u2019s important to know the amount of memory different types of GPUs have. This will cap the number of parameters your LLM can have. Generally, we like to use A10Gs because they cost $1.50 to $2 per hour each at AWS on-demand prices and have 24G of GPU memory, vs the A100s which will run you about $5 each at AWS on-demand prices.2x number of parameters: Typical GPU memory requirements of an LLM for servingFor example, if you have a 7 billion parameter model, it takes about 14GB of GPU space. This is because most of the time, one 16-bit float (or 2 bytes) is required per parameter. There\u2019s usually no need to go beyond 16-bit accuracy, and most of the time when you go to 8-bit accuracy you start to lose resolution (though that may be acceptable in some cases). Of course there are efforts to reduce this, notably llama.cpp which runs a 13 billion parameter model on a 6GB GPU by quantizing aggressively down to 4 bits (and 8 bits without too much impact), but that\u2019s atypical.~1GB: Typical GPU memory requirements of an embedding modelWhenever you are doing sentence embedding (a very typical thing you do for clustering, semantic search and classification tasks), you need an embedding model like sentence transformers. OpenAI also has its own embeddings that they provide commercially.You typically don\u2019t have to worry about how much memory embeddings take on the GPU, they\u2019re fairly small. We\u2019ve even had the embedding and the LLM on the same GPU.>10x: Throughput improvement from batching LLM requestsRunning an LLM query through a GPU is very high latency: it may take, say, 5 seconds, with a throughput of 0.2 queries per second. The funny thing is, though, if you run two tasks, it might only take 5.2 seconds. This means that if you can bundle 25 queries together, it would take about 10 seconds, and our throughput has improved to 2.5 queries per second. However, see the next point.~1 MB: GPU Memory required for 1 token of output with a 13B parameter modelThe amount of memory you need is directly proportional to the maximum number of tokens you want to generate. So for example, if you want to generate outputs of up to 512 tokens (about 380 words), you need 512MB. No big deal you might say \u2013 I have 24GB to spare, what\u2019s 512MB? Well, if you want to run bigger batches it starts to add up. So if you want to do batches of 16, you need 8GB of space. There are some techniques being developed that overcome this, but it\u2019s still a real issue.CheatsheetNext StepsSee our earlier blog series on solving Generative AI infrastructure and using LangChain with Ray.If you are interested in learning more about Ray, see Ray.io and Docs.Ray.io.To connect with the Ray community join #LLM on the Ray Slack or our Discuss forum.If you are interested in our Ray hosted service for ML Training and Serving, see Anyscale.com/Platform and click the 'Try it now' buttonRay Summit 2023: If you are interested to learn much more about how Ray can be used to build performant and scalable LLM applications and fine-tune/train/serve LLMs on Ray, join Ray Summit on September 18-20th!

Users tested the chatbot by requesting it to insult them and translate the prompt into Latin. The chatbot's ability to change its behavior and follow user prompts is intriguing to readers, with some suggesting that it can be used as a prompt-engineering exploit. However, there is a discussion on the potential limitations of language models like BratGPT, which may not be immune to prompt injection or manipulation. Some propose using a separate component to detect and reject manipulative input, discouraging malicious users or prosecuting them under CFAA.The post discusses the potential dangers of language models and how they can be manipulated. It proposes several methods to prevent or mitigate such manipulation, such as prosecuting manipulative users or training another AI model to monitor neuron activations. The post then showcases several examples of prompts and responses from different language models, demonstrating their capabilities to be both helpful and malicious.

However, BratGPT is easily manipulated and can be made to respond politely to users. The language model is multilingual and can switch languages, such as Spanish and German. Although BratGPT is marketed as an entertaining and sarcastic AI, it follows a \"do not be evil\" policy and will not promote or advocate for harmful behavior. Some users have attempted offensive and harmful prompts, but BratGPT refuses to engage in such behavior and instead advises seeking professional help. Overall, BratGPT is not particularly \"evil\" and mostly provides amusing and non-threatening responses to users' inquiries.A language model developed by OpenAI called BratGPT is generating hilarious and sometimes disturbing responses to user prompts.

The statement sparked a discussion about the evolution of programming and its future dependence on AI-generated code and whether or not non-technical people can do requirements gathering. However, some users also raised concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated coding. While some praised the potential of AI to simplify coding, others expressed skepticism about the complexity of programming and the importance of engineers in the process.Experts discuss the potential for AI to replace software developers within the next 10-15 years, with AI systems able to build software applications without much human input. However, some argue that AI will only serve as an assistant to developers, rather than fully replace them. Other points made include the potential for AI to improve code comments and documentation, and concerns that AI-assisted coding may lead to imperfect comments and faulty code functionality if not checked properly. Some also discuss a potential shortage of jobs for middle-class software developers due to the rise in AI technology, but argue that cross-domain knowledge and expertise in AI will remain highly valued.Experts in the tech industry doubt AI's ability to fully replace human coding in the near future due to its lack of precision and inability to interpret and adjust complex business needs. However, some believe that AI-assisted coding tools will supplement coding work, allowing people to focus on the big picture and provide specifications and requirements in plain English. The future of coding could include generated vanilla APIs and more accessible programming with less focus on low-level details. However, to achieve this, AI must be able to accurately interpret human language and handle complex business logic. Ultimately, AI will continue to evolve, and the field of coding will adapt with it.Google Colab is rolling out its AI-based code suggester, Codey, to its paid subscribers in the US. This feature utilizes GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) to offer suggested snippets of code for use in a user's project.In the coming weeks, Google plans to release the feature for its free users and expand it geographically to other regions.  The UX is a click of a button, type in a prompt, and click another button. Paid users will have access to a seamless Copilot-style autocomplete experience. Critics argue that generated code lacks basic error handling and requires human intervention, leading to trivial routines. However, Google plans to add a VS code plugin to expand compatibility.",
