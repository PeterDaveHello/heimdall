        "url": "https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key/",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35285390",
        "content": "GitHub has updated its RSA SSH host key used to secure Git operations, following exposure of its private key in a public repository. The key has been replaced as a precaution, with no evidence that it had been abused in the interim. GitHub\u2019s implementation of secure shell uses ephemeral keys, meaning that even possessing the key does not enable access to data. As such, GitHub said that web traffic to the platform and HTTPS Git operations remain unaffected. Customers using ECDSA or Ed25519 keys will also not need to take any action, but those using RSA will need to update their ~/.ssh/known_hosts file to include the new public key, or remove the old one via ssh-keygen.GitHub has yet to introduce a mechanism for revoking SSH keys, which could be a potential issue if compromised. Keybase could enable the use of X.509 style certificates, allowing clients to blacklist SSH keys that have been compromised. Revocation of key material is essential for security, as demonstrated by the recent GitHub key leak, and holding private keys anywhere other than a secure hardware module is problematic. Certification standards such as ISAE, SOC and ISO 27001 do not mandate specific technical implementations for key management, but just compliance with controls for protecting cryptographic media. To ensure security, using commit signatures and taking pragmatic steps should be sufficient for most threat models.Having a factual real-world risk/threat model is crucial for building reasonable security controls, rather than relying on hypothetical \"the-world-is-burning\" scenarios. Git authors should sign their commits with their own private key for code integrity, rather than trusting hosting providers which could lead to tampering with a repository. Requiring all commits to be signed by trusted keys mitigates the risk of tampering by hackers who gain access to a repository. However, signed commits do not protect against code leaks. Github came under fire after it accidentally published its key, which undermines the principle of trust. Consequently, all communications with Github since the company's inception must be considered compromised. The key should have been put in a hardware security module to mitigate the security threat.Github has regenerated a significant number of SSH keys for its users after the accidental inclusion of a key in a public repository left it compromised. According to the company, the key was exposed for three months and could have been used to impersonate a legitimate account, thus potentially accessing the repositories of other users. Github said it had found no evidence that the compromised key was used, although it has taken account security measures to minimise the chance of future incidents. The incident has led to renewed calls for Github to use hardware security modules, which can store cryptographic keys securely and reduce the risk of compromise, more comprehensively in future.GitHub had to rotate its SSH key after it was briefly exposed in a public GitHub repository. While GitHub claims that there is no evidence that the key had been compromised between its publication and discovery, some argue that there is now a risk of heightened phishing attacks, with an opportunity for malicious network operators to make the most of a time when millions of users will be changing their keys at the same time. GitHub has stated that it has not seen anything that suggests the key was accessed while available on GitHub.com, but the incident does emphasise the security risk of public repositories.GitHub has pushed for improvements to certificates used for logging into code repositories in light of recent issues with private keys leaking. Currently, few people are validating certificate fingerprints when ephemeral servers are being utilised (baked images become compromised leaving critical, impossible-to-revoke-or-rotate keys vulnerable). Existing SSL certificate options may work when dealing with a small number of servers but beyond that, they\u2019re of little benefit. GitHub is now encouraging a move away from the current certificates, suggesting alternatives such as a new protocol that could eliminate the requirement for warnings, and a universal URL enabling the safe collection of SSH keys.\nGitHub and GitLab both support two-factor authentication (2FA) via their command line interfaces (CLI), which can help reduce security risks associated with shared private keys. Alternately, certificate authorities (CA) can provide private keys at different levels, allowing the root private key to be stored in a physical vault and used infrequently to issue other private keys. But relying on CAs also carries risk, as they can be compromised. In the specific GitHub context, the risk of a key shared by numerous SSH load balancer machines being compromised or perceived to be at risk is higher than the risk of a CA being compromised. MITM attacks are a potential risk, as users may blindly accept a new key without verifying it. GitHub recommended users update their known host files to mitigate the risk.GitHub reported that it accidentally leaked its SSH key to the public, which could have allowed a cybercriminal to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack on code repositories. The company quickly rotated the key and released an explanation of what had happened and how users could check that their SSH configuration was still secure. Although GitHub reassured users that such a breach would not allow a perpetrator to upload malicious code onto its site, it is recommended that individuals using the site check their SSH through the \"known hosts\" files, either manually checking it themselves, or by simply running \"ssh -T git@github.com\" command which will show whether the SSH configuration is still secure. If a breach was detected, individuals were advised to contact their system administrator or GitHub support.The recent theft of the private key from Github's RSA host key pair highlights potential security flaws in many fintech companies, many of whom rely on blind trust in Github host keys. A recent hacker attack on Myetherwallet successfully took over a key with a BGP (border gateway protocol) attack. A wildcard TLS cert or an SSH host key in plaintext can be leveraged as a loaded weapon against a high-value target. While startups may be forgiven for a lack of senior security engineers, whereby Github swiftly rotated the key after the breach, established firms have no excuse not to employ consultants or afford senior security personnel. However, many still trust DNS, BGP, TLS certs, and SSH host keys, like the medical industry before they learned hand washing was a thing.GitHub has revealed that it briefly exposed a private key due to an accident. The SSH key was deployed to GitHub\u2019s production instead of the application used specifically for safe-storage. A compromised key can be used a remote attacker to gain access to an organisation\u2019s servers. Although the firm claims there's no evidence that the key has been abused, after discovering the mistake the firm took the proactive steps of revoking the key and associated certificates and redeploying new ones. It has also conducted a full audit of its software development processes and begun implementing enhanced controls. Experts said this demonstrates that even organisations that take security seriously can still make mistakes, and that processes need to be in place to minimise the impact of such human error.",

Photograph: Paul Archuleta/FilmMagicOhioPolice sue rapper Afroman for using footage of home raid in his music videosOhio officers, who conducted a botched raid of rapper\u2019s home, are suing for invasion of privacy and emotional distressMaya YangThu 23 Mar 2023 19.07 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Mar 2023 11.14 EDTPolice officers who conducted a botched armed raid of rapper Afroman\u2019s home last year have filed a lawsuit against him for invasion of privacy and emotional distress after he used footage of it in his music videos.Earlier this month, police officers Shawn D Cooley, Justin Cooley, Michael D Estep, Shawn D Grooms, Brian Newland, Lisa Phillips and Randolph L Walters, Jr, filed the lawsuit in Adams county, Ohio, against Afroman, alleging that the rapper and others including his record label used the officers\u2019 likenesses for commercial purposes.According to court documents, police officers conducted a search of Afroman\u2019s residence last August, \u201cpursuant to a lawfully issued search warrant\u201d. According to the warrant, the search was carried out as part of an investigation into drug possession and trafficking, as well as kidnapping.Following the raid, Adams county prosecutor\u2019s office said officers found no probative criminal evidence, and Afroman faced no charges.At the time of the raid, Afroman, whose real name is Joseph Edgar Foreman, was not home but his wife was.In addition to Afroman\u2019s wife recording parts of the raid on her phone, security video cameras installed at their home also caught portions of the search, including the faces and bodies of many of the officers involved.The rapper went on to use the footage recorded by his wife and house cameras as part of several music videos which were released online. Afroman also posted content from the raid on to his social media accounts including Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram, the lawsuit said.\u201cThese music videos clearly portray the images, likenesses, and distinctive appearances (\u2018personas\u2019), of many of the officers involved in the search, including those of all Plaintiffs,\u201d according to the lawsuit.One of the images posted to Instagram is of Afroman wearing a T-shirt with a picture of police officer Shawn D Cooley next to a picture of Family Guy character Peter Griffin, the lawsuit said.Another Instagram post featured a picture of Judge Roy Gabbert who signed the search warrant. According to the lawsuit, the caption read: \u201cThis is the judge that signed the warrant that said kidnapping. His name is Roy Droopy Gabbert. Vote him out before he signs a fictitious warrant then send some over reacting paranoid KKKops to your House jeopardizing the lives of you and your family, Stealing your money and disconnecting your home video security surveillance system \u2026\u201dThe police officers allege that Afroman\u2019s actions were \u201cwillful, wanton, malicious, and done with conscious or reckless disregard\u201d and claim that they have been subject to ridicule by the public.They also claimed that they have been subject to death threats and have been unable to perform their duties properly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "url": "https://www.grocerygazette.co.uk/2023/03/22/food-inflation-highest-rate/",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35290460",
        "content": "Food inflation in the UK rose to 18.2% in February, the highest rate since 1977, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase, which followed a figure of 16.8% a month earlier, was primarily as a result of higher vegetable costs due to shortages caused by bad weather in southern Europe and northern Africa. The rising price of grains, certain proteins, eggs and oil also contributed. Fresh food prices are increasingly under pressure, putting further strain on household budgets. A sharp rise in prices for bread, pork, margarine and eggs in February contributed to the increase. Ready-meals, confectionary and hot beverages also experienced the highest rates since at least 2008.The discussion on a forum ranges from population density to consumer protections and taxes. One user points out that there are around 1,000 people per square mile in a certain area, similar to population densities in Israel and Belgium. Another user argues that people often block moves towards empty areas because they claim it is a desert or uninhabitable. The discussion then turns to taxation, with some advocating for taxing the wealthy to pay off the national debt or invest in small businesses, while others claim that this will not work and could cause asset values to plummet. The talk then moves on to the relationship between supply, demand, and price gouging, and eventually to inflation and its causes, including Brexit.The comments section of a thread on Hacker News covers a range of topics, from the use of the word \"chemicals\" to the desirability of making one's own flour-based products to the importance of considering prices while shopping. Many users express concern over the rising cost of everyday items, such as groceries, and cite their own experiences growing up in low- or middle-income households. Others debate the merits of prioritizing experiences over material possessions and discuss the psychology of frugality. Some share anecdotes about frugal habits of successful entrepreneurs, such as Jeff Bezos. Overall, the comments suggest that people's attitudes towards spending and consumption are complex and intertwined with their backgrounds and values.Commenters on Hacker News discuss rising food prices, with some contextualizing the issue within a global perspective - pointing to instances of food inflation in East Africa where prices have seen a 200-400% increase over the past three years due to issues of fertilizer availability, wheat shortages, and poor growing seasons. Some UK-based contributors share their experiences of prices noticeably increasing, with examples given of toothpaste prices rising by 20%, and a single bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos costing over $5. Others suggest cooking from scratch as a way to cut costs, with one user recommending meal planning and preparation as a necessary life skill for better managing food budgets. The thread ends with a conversation about class issues and food, unpacking the links between skill, cost, and access.The agricultural sector is in crisis due to the need to reduce nitrogen emissions, which is being forced on farmers by people who do not understand the challenges of running a farm. The situation is similar in the Netherlands, where cutting emissions is causing significant problems for the agricultural sector. The UK has average food inflation compared to other European countries, but there is a general sense of negativity in the media about the state of the country since Brexit. The negativity is also prevalent among British people online, who lean heavily to the left and are often pro-remain, despite being critical of the current government. Despite the challenges, there is a need to think long-term and sacrifice individual benefit for the common good to keep the planet habitable.UK supermarkets are struggling to cope with food scarcity, high energy costs and global supply chain issues, leading to empty shelves and price hikes. Inflation is currently at 10.4% in the UK, with food prices rising at an even higher rate of 18.2%, compared to the EU average of 9.9%. Some commentators attribute this to the UK's reliance on imported produce and disruption caused by Brexit. Others believe that the UK is unfairly singled out by the media, and that similar trends are happening elsewhere. In France, inflation is at around 10%, while Netherlands and Germany have also seen prices rise. However, there are reports of rationing and empty shelves in the UK that haven't been seen elsewhere.Inflation in food prices is causing concern for vulnerable groups, with some people struggling to buy enough food. Prices of flour, cheese, and tomato sauce are becoming more expensive, which is causing consumers to buy less nutritious food or eat less overall. While some suggest that choosing cheaper calories is an option, this is not always possible for low-income families with little spare time to cook. The situation is made worse by the fact that\u00a0processed foods often contain addictive sugars and additives that make them an attractive but unhealthy dietary option. As prices continue to rise, people will have to make even tougher choices about what they eat, further impacting the demand for food overall.\nFood prices have risen in many countries, with consumers in America, Europe, and Asia all feeling the pinch. Rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions are among the factors cited as pressing inflationary pressures. Beef in particular has become significantly pricier, though the cause is unclear. While some commenters on social media suggest animal welfare concerns may have led to a rise in costs, others posit that COVID-19 restrictions could be causing delays to supply chain operations. This comes against a backdrop of rising food inflation, with the UK seeing the highest rates in 10 years, and Nigeria experiencing its worst rate of food inflation in 15 years. The impacts are potentially far-reaching, with an estimated 30% of US consumers reporting they have had to cut back on food purchases.The root cause of inflation is elevated energy prices, as energy underpins the price of everything else in an economy, including production and transportation, which affects the price of groceries. The problem is further compounded by unpredictable world events and an illusory competition that results from big business domination in the UK. Smaller shops are increasingly priced out of the market, and consumers are left with fewer choices. Supermarkets engage in price fixing, whereby retailers cannot pass on the whole price hike to the end customer, which results in operational costs for retailers and screws over people working there. The solution may be for individuals to save, invest in inflation-indexed bonds and be cautious about job movements. Technology may also offer some hope, provided it can produce new industries and job opportunities.",

Not only does the Framework Laptop 16 carry forward all of the same design philosophy around upgrade, repair, and customization from the Framework Laptop 13 at a substantially higher performance point, but it also brings in two new module ecosystems: a fully reconfigurable input deck and modular, upgradeable graphics. This enables an incredible range of use cases and deep personalization for gamers, creators, engineers, and more. We\u2019ll be sharing full specifications, pricing, and availability when we open pre-orders on the Framework Laptop 16 this spring, ahead of shipments in late 2023. For more updates on our Framework Laptop 16 development journey, you can sign up for our newsletter. What we\u2019re releasing today is a preview to let developers get started with our open source design documentation.\n\nInput Module system\n\nWhen starting the design of a larger screen laptop, one of the key questions was: Numpad, or no numpad? After performing some market research, we found out there is almost exactly a 50/50 split between people who love and need numpads and people who hate them. We used this as an opportunity to not only let you pick your preference there, but also completely customize the input experience.\n\nWith the Framework Laptop 16, options for the input system are nearly unlimited. Input Modules are hot-swappable, making it easy for you to reconfigure at any time. Input modules come in three sizes \u2013 Small, Medium (Numpad Modules), and Large (Keyboard Modules). Many of the Small module options enable color customization, but it\u2019s also possible to build functional modules like an LED Matrix or haptic slider.\u00a0For Medium modules, in addition to numpads, secondary displays and macro pads are workable.\u00a0For Large modules, we\u2019re developing both regular backlit keyboards in a range of languages and an RGB backlit version.\nWe\u2019ve also released open source firmware based on QMK keyboard software that runs on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller that many of our Input Modules utilize.\nWith an open source design, we can\u2019t wait to see the incredible modules that the community creates: jog wheels, sliders, touchscreen displays, e-ink notepads, smartcard readers, and more. Really, almost anything can be created into an Input Module. The only limit is your imagination, and the 3.7mm height constraints.\n\n\nExpansion Bay system\u00a0\n\nWith the Framework Laptop 16, we\u2019re delivering on a dream that many have given up on: upgradeable, modular graphics in a high-performance notebook. With the Expansion Bay system, it\u2019s possible to upgrade Graphics Modules independently of the rest of the laptop. Since Expansion Bay modules can extend the laptop in both thickness and depth, we have immense design flexibility to handle generation over generation changes in mechanical, thermal, and electrical requirements for GPUs.\n\nOn top of that, the PCIe x8 interface enables a range of other non-graphics use cases that need both high power and high speed. As an example, we\u2019ve developed a dual M.2 SSD card that can drop into an Expansion Bay Shell, allowing for an additional 16TB of storage. Since the documentation for this interface is open source, developers have freedom to create amazing modules on it, like card readers, video capture devices, AI accelerators, SDR radios, and more.\n\nExpansion Card system\n\nThe Framework Laptop 16 also brings in the Expansion Card system from the Framework Laptop 13, letting you choose which ports you\u2019d like on each side along with adding other functionality like high speed storage.\u00a0We\u2019ve enabled three Expansion Cards on each side.\u00a0We\u2019ve also replaced the fixed 3.5mm headphone jack with a new Audio Expansion Card, letting you choose analog audio if you\u2019d like or swap it for a port if you\u2019re using a USB or wireless headset.\u00a0\n\nDeveloper documentation\u00a0\n\nDeveloper documentation is available on GitHub today for all three systems: Input Modules, Expansion Bay Modules, and Expansion Cards. By open-sourcing our designs early, we\u2019re enabling the creation of a robust and vibrant ecosystem of modules to accompany the launch of the Framework Laptop 16. In the future, we\u2019ll also be opening the Framework Marketplace to third party module makers, enabling both individuals and companies to participate directly in the ecosystem.\n\nThe Framework Laptop 16 is meant to be a platform of possibilities.\u00a0Whether you\u2019re a gamer, developer, heavy Linux user, creator, or have other performance-demanding work, the Framework Laptop 16 is built to be customized to your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentez cet article de blog dans la communaut\u00e9 Framework\n\n\nRejoignez la discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuel Framework Laptop vous convient le mieux ?\n\n\n\nComparez tous les Framework Laptops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntreprise\n\n\u00c0 propos de nous\n\n\nNotre blog\n\n\n\nNous recrutons\n4\n\n\n\nNous contacter\n\n\n\n\n\nR\u00e9seaux sociaux\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscord\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCommunaut\u00e9\n\nForum communautaire\n\n\nAssistance\n\n\nGuides de r\u00e9paration\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace\n\nVoir tout\n\n\nOrdinateur portable Framework\n\n\nCartes d'extension\n\n\nCartes m\u00e8res\n\n\nM\u00e9moire et stockage\n\n\nClaviers\n\n\nPi\u00e8ces\n\n\nPersonnalisation\n\n\nOutils\n\n\nLogiciel\n\n\nMerch\n\n\n\n\n\nS'abonner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay up to date with Framework newsletters & product updates (1\u20132 times per month)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for subscribing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2023 Framework Computer Inc\n\n\n\nConditions d'utilisation\n\n\nPolitique de confidentialit\u00e9\n\n\nGarantie\n\n\nConditions de vente\n\n\nPolitique en mati\u00e8re de cookies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEUR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo12March 22 (Reuters) - The integration of OpenAI's technology into Microsoft-owned Bing has driven people to the little-used search engine and helped it compete better with market leader Google in page visits growth, according to data from analytics firm Similarweb.Page visits on Bing have risen 15.8% since Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) unveiled its artificial intelligence-powered version on Feb. 7, compared with a near 1% decline for the Alphabet Inc-owned search engine, data till March 20 showed.Reuters GraphicsThe figures are an early sign of the lead the Windows maker has taken in its fast-moving race with Google for generative AI dominance, thanks to the technology behind ChatGPT, the viral chatbot that many experts have called AI's \"iPhone moment\".They also underscore a rare opportunity for Microsoft to make inroads in the over $120 billion search market, where Google has been the dominant player for decades with a share of more than 80%.Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co, said that he expects Bing to gain market share in search over the next coming months, especially if Google continues to delay the integration of generative AI into its product.While Bing AI has been available to most users around the world since February, Google began the public release of its chatbot Bard only on Tuesday.\"Bing has less than a tenth of Google's market share, so even if it converts 1% or 2% of users it will be materially beneficial to Bing and Microsoft,\" Luria said.App downloads for Bing have also jumped eight times globally after AI integration, according to app research firm Data.ai. Downloads for the Google search app fell 2% in the same period, the data showed.Reuters GraphicsStill, some analysts said that Google, which in the early 2000s unseated then leader Yahoo to become the dominant search player, could overcome the early setbacks to maintain its lead.\"Google's ranking algorithm can have a competitive edge over that of competitors\", Yongjei Jeong, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities in South Korea said, referring to how Google's algorithm helped it beat Yahoo Search.Reuters GraphicsReporting by Akash Sriram and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Shounak DasguptaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Akash SriramThomson ReutersAkash reports on technology companies in the United States, electric vehicle companies, and the space industry.

        "content": "Databricks has introduced Dolly, a large language model (LLM) that can be used to generate human-like text and follow instructions much like ChatGPT, using only 6 billion parameters, compared to ChatGPT's 175 billion. Dolly can be re-created on Databricks using open-source code and using high-quality training data on a single machine. Dolly has the potential to democratize LLMs and make them more accessible to companies that could not afford them in the past. Using Dolly, organizations can own and customize their models and improve their products. Companies may prefer building their models instead of sending sensitive information to a third-party LLM service behind an API. Databricks has open-sourced a simple notebook to build Dolly on Databricks.Databricks has announced plans to help organisations harness the power of large language models (LLMs) with a series of forthcoming releases. The company has identified the power of artificial intelligence to transform productivity and is keen to encourage customers to join in this journey. The move builds on the work of many organisations, including EleutherAI, which open-sourced and trained GPT-J, Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models, and the team behind Alpaca. However, the company is careful to highlight that AI is still emerging, and research is in its early stages. Generative AI can exhibit inaccuracies, bias, offense, toxicity and hallucination just like human language, so users are urged to exercise caution. More information is expected to follow.OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2 model is capable of creating high-quality images from text prompts, according to a report by Databricks. The company ran several tests using DALL-E 2 and fine-tuned it for chatbot-style interfaces, resulting in a high level of accuracy. DALL-E 2 follows on from the DALL-E model announced earlier this year, which produces images from text prompts but at a much lower quality. It is not yet clear what will happen to the DALL-E model, which is still in a beta phase. Meanwhile, some commenters on Hacker News speculated on the motivations behind OpenAI\u2019s move into AI safety, suggesting that it could represent an attempt to get people to look past the company's involvement in forming monopolies.OpenAI's business model may be at risk if smaller and cheaper models can achieve similar outcomes. OpenAI's original goal was to explore fundamental questions of artificial intelligence in a non-commercial, ethical way. However, with commercialization, OpenAI now claims to offer open source tools, shared research, and relies on fundraising to keep up with the latest advancements of AI. While OpenAI's ChatGPT models are popular, the organization is primed to face competition with other AI models hitting the market. Despite this, OpenAI has established a diverse portfolio of expensive and inexpensive models, making it well-positioned to stay ahead of its competitors, despite pricing competition. OpenAI's success largely depends on keeping up with, if not staying ahead of, its competitors.Discussions on HN suggest that while Alpaca is deemed questionable in terms of legality, Dolly, a new AI model from GitHub user \"EleutherAI,\" is generating interest from developers. Dolly utilizes the same LLAMa data set as Alpaca, but researchers at Eleuther have fine-tuned the model to run more efficiently with only 6 billion parameters, while still producing impressive outputs. Dolly is reported to be more than \"vaguely good\" though not on par with larger GPT models such as GPT-3 or -4 from OpenAI. It is noted that the democratization of access to large language models through smaller models generating increasingly more flexible language is a promising development in the field of NLP.Alpaca, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, is being used to teach a smaller, specialized AI model to converse in English with the use of external knowledge and tools. The process involves starting with a mega-model and prompting it with a set of standardized tests designed for humans. The AI model is then provided access to the same APIs as humans to help it find answers to questions, and the teacher \"rewards\" the model for using external knowledge and tools. The result is a smaller, more efficient model that can be used for specific tasks in combination with other specialist AI models. The development marks a step toward democratizing data and LLMs.",

Of the around 150 guests, 37 went \u201cphone-free\u201d leaving their devices with Clearspace. The startup gave these attendees claim tickets, \u201creplacement\u201d notepads and pens, and phone-free badges. The purpose of the event was to encourage people to experience an unplugged night and to gather data on why people choose not to do so. Among the reasons for retaining their phones were expecting an investor call, needing to 2FA a Stripe login, and not trusting Clearspace. Attendees who went without their phones for the night said they spoke to more people, felt liberated, and found it easier than anticipated. \u00a0The issue of tipping in the US has sparked debate, with some arguing that workers are underpaid and heavily depend on tips to make ends meet, while others argue that tipping is an outdated practice that should be abolished. Some customers prefer to pay and tip by card, but this raises concerns about potential theft or manipulation of tips by employers. This has led to calls for a change in the system to ensure that workers receive a fair wage and employers cannot manipulate the tip system. Some have suggested that tip-sharing could be a fair solution, but only if tips are distributed fairly and transparently. Ultimately, the issue of tipping highlights broader issues around workers' rights and fair compensation.A 40-year old was caught robbing 10 houses in a neighbourhood. The writer's iPhone was also stolen, but the password was complex and there was no iCloud backup. The writer did not turn on \"Find my phone\" due to privacy concerns but learned from a comment that \"Find my iPhone\" is for approving options towards locking down or wiping the phone, and doesn't increase tracking. Some wonder whether there is value in stealing modern phones due to factory locks. Although Apple has paired hardware on newer phones, parts of the devices can still be sold individually. Even though newer iPhone vulnerabilities are less common due to being more secure, past interactions lead some to believe that attackers are waiting for the next zero-day to come, and the value of the phone lies in its data.People are discussing the practice of being required to turn over your phone before entering certain secure locations or events. Some suggest using a Faraday cage or lockable pouch to prevent compulsive checking or unauthorized access, while others argue that simply turning off the phone and keeping it in your pocket would suffice. The discussion also touches on the possibility of forgetting the phone or needing it for work, as well as the potential security concerns of leaving it with strangers for hours. Some suggest using phone notifications sparingly or silencing non-essential notifications altogether to prevent distraction. Overall, the discussion centers around striking a balance between convenience, security, and personal preferences when it comes to phone usage.An online discussion took place about the benefits of having no cell reception or Wi-Fi at a gathering. One participant noted how it felt \"magical\" as it was like the parties they had in the era before smartphones. With no reception, participants talked, joked and debated without being glued to their phones. While another participant agreed that it sounds nice, they lamented it should not take such measures for people to interact in social settings. They argued that it was \"incredibly rude to dick with your phone\" at a gathering of friends, especially considering those who are in social isolation due to COVID-19. The discussion ended with some suggesting the use of Faraday cages to block phone signals and voluntary countermeasures such as locking phones away during social gatherings.summarize this thread about the problems and solutions of phone-free events. The conversation revolves around a comedy show that required attendees to lock their phones in special pouches during the show. The system was criticized for being chaotic and slow, and for hindering communication between friends and family members. Some users suggested using RFID tags or sound alarms to improve the efficiency of the pouch system. Others argued that the whole concept of a phone-free event is unnecessary and that it hinders the overall experience. Trust and security concerns were also raised regarding giving someone else control over access to personal devices. One user quoted Snowden, saying that giving away personal information is like giving away the right to privacy, even if the exposed information seems trivial.A discussion on Hacker News about physical access to mobile phones at Y Combinator's Demo Day has sparked a wider debate about people's dependency on their mobiles. A group of 37 executives and founders gave physical access to their phones, albeit turned off, for the duration of the event. Commenting on the discussion, one poster complained that no mention had been made of parents, children, or babysitters, which led to another thread on whether people could live without their devices. Suggestions included using a pager, which limited incoming messages to calls and texts, and a wristband or clothing item that would indicate the wearer was not carrying a phone.\nThe author of a court filing was surprised to find that the official public form required them to provide their phone number and email address. They question why everything seems to \"require\" personal information, and prefer to be free and not always reachable. Some commenters suggest alternative apps that allow for similar control over phone usage without requiring personal information, while others share stories of successfully disconnecting from their phones and enjoying nature or social events without constant digital distractions. Still, others express concern about leaving their phones unattended and suggest security measures such as sealing them in envelopes or flipping them face down to protect against potential attackers taking pictures of sensitive information.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35295807",
        "content": "Docker has reversed its decision to end its Free Team plan, after consulting with its community and receiving feedback. Customers who previously upgraded to a paid subscription between the sunsetting announcement on 14 March and the reversal announcement will receive a full refund. Customers who migrated to a Personal or Pro plan will also return to their former Free Team plan, though can alternatively request a new Personal or Pro account via the Docker website. The company has received over 10 days significant interest in its Docker-Sponsored Open Source program following its decision to reverse its fee structure. Docker recently reversed its decision to end free support for the Docker Desktop app on macOS and Windows, and open-sourced some code.\u00a0The recent change to Docker's terms of service, which limited free use to 1 container or 1 swarm, has led to concerns about the use of \"free\" services as anti-competitive tactics. Some have suggested that companies offering free services should be legally required to make clear whether and when their service may become paid, to avoid allegations of dumping. Others, however, argue that such scrutiny would be detrimental to business models which rely on subsidizing initial purchases with more expensive ongoing services, and likening such scrutiny to outlawing free software. Some have also criticized the change in Docker's terms of service as having been executed poorly. Some developers have moved to GitHub Container Registry or Quay.io as an alternative.Backwards compatibility can vary within Microsoft products, with examples of old Word documents not opening in newer versions of Word, but being compatible with Open Office. However, Microsoft's support for backwards compatibility does buy enterprise licenses, and they have a reputation for being careful not to screw over customers that rely on certain behavior. While their documentation may contain broken links, they generally do not kill off projects and products left, right, and center like other companies. It's noted that Docker did not break backwards compatibility, but rather started charging for its services. Github is free for normal users as Microsoft extracts value out of the code hosted there.Docker announced it was sunsetting its free tier offering, which led to a backlash, and has now reversed its decision. Some experts\u00a0have said the about-turn will not restore Docker's trust with the open-source community. Earlier,\u00a0the company, which has raised a reported $252m to date, said users who did not sign up to its $5-per-month plan by 1 November\u00a0would get higher usage rates and lose access to the Docker Hub. Many open-source projects rely on DockerHub for hosting container images, but users distrusted the company's new model. Resentment may remain because Docker still requires an opt-out of its new policy after the deadline.\u00a0\nDocker has backtracked on its decision to limit the usage of its free account for container image storage to a maximum of 200 pull requests per six-hour period. In an announcement, the company said the move came as a result of feedback from the community. The backtrack comes after Docker user groups voiced strong disapproval of the original decision, warning that it would cause damage to the company's reputation and drive users away. The user groups also pointed out that smaller firms would have trouble affording the fees charged by Docker for its paid services. The company said it will continue to offer free accounts but will consider putting usage limits in place in the future. A conversation on Hacker News discusses a company's recent press release and its response to negative feedback. Some commenters argue that the PR fluff in the statement should be expected and that the reflexive negativity from some users is tiresome and unproductive. Others argue that PR statements and marketing are inherently dishonest and devious, and that critical responses are necessary to hold companies accountable. The original announcement that sparked controversy is briefly mentioned as an example of egregious corporate behavior, with commenters arguing that the company is only interested in making money at the expense of its user base. The conversation highlights the tension between corporate interests and consumer expectations, and the difficulty of navigating these competing demands in a public-facing way.Docker has announced it will retain its free version of Docker Teams, reversing a decision to make it a chargeable model. Docker, which offers containerisation within software, originally informed users they would need to pay for the service. The company said it made the change following feedback and that it is clear it made \u201ca wrong decision\u201d. Docker faced a backlash when it announced the alteration earlier this month, with many users voicing their anger. The free model will now remain in place.The website provides guidelines, FAQs, lists, APIs, security, legal information, and contact details related to applying for Y Combinator's startup accelerator program in Summer 2023.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35291112",
        "content": "OpenAI's ChatGPT service experienced an outage this week due to a bug in an open-source library, which inadvertently allowed some users to see titles from another active user's chat history. It also caused the unintentional visibility of payment-related information of 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during a specific 9-hour window. OpenAI apologized to affected users and reassured them that their data is now safe. Upon investigation, the error was caused by a change in OpenAI's server at 1 am Pacific Time on March 20, which increased the risk of bad data flowing through each connection. OpenAI has fixed the bug, tested it, and made numerous redundant checks to ensure accurate data matching for each user. The company is confident there is no ongoing data risk.OpenAI experienced a bug that allowed users to view others' private information, which was caused by a faulty Redis-py library. The company drew criticism for initially framing the bug as an open-source issue, rather than an issue in their own codebase. However, commenters noted that the problem was related to the way rather than the open-source nature of the library. The bug was eventually fixed and OpenAI released a post-mortem. The incident highlights the challenges of relying on third-party software in mission-critical systems, as well as the importance of effective communication in addressing issues transparently with users.The issue of cache invalidation in a distributed system was discussed in a thread related to the recent privacy incident at OpenAI. While some comments suggested that cache invalidation was a solvable problem, others noted that distributed systems are inherently complex and that guaranteeing zero failures is unrealistic. Some suggested using well-known strategies for achieving eventual consistency, while others mentioned the importance of having a 24/7 SRE on-call rotation to handle incidents promptly. The topic of using AI models, specifically GPT, for monitoring systems was also mentioned with differing opinions on its effectiveness and potential abuse. Overall, the discussion highlighted the challenges and trade-offs involved in scaling distributed systems and ensuring their reliability.OpenAI's ChatGPT, an AI chat platform, experienced a data exposure incident where users could see each other's sensitive data, including names and partial credit card details. The bug was a result of a race condition caused by a faulty Redis database library redis-py, which ChatGPT relied on. OpenAI has temporarily taken ChatGPT offline and is investigating the incident. Some users have reported being able to reproduce the bug months ago, but OpenAI reportedly didn't respond to their reports. The incident highlights the importance of thorough testing and prompt response to user reports, as well as the potential risks of relying on third-party libraries for key functionality.OpenAI experienced a data breach that resulted in the leak of their GPT-3 language model weights. The breach was caused by a misconfigured Redis instance that was accessible from the internet and had no password protection. The leaked data included API keys and tokens, as well as personally identifiable information of some of OpenAI\u2019s customers. The incident highlights the importance of securing databases and using password protection. OpenAI has taken several actions to address the issue, including changing all of their API keys and tokens and improving their testing, assertions, log alerting, and debugging processes. The incident also raises concerns about the use of Redis as a primary database and the reliability of OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure from a security and support perspective.Several users have reported issues with OpenAI's bug reporting channels, stating that they were unable to find an official way to report bugs. The company has fixed the reported bug but not the next one, and users are calling for it to improve its bug reporting channels to find bugs more quickly. The company's emphasis on the library being open source has been criticized by some users as a way of deflecting blame. The incident has also highlighted the importance of properly vetting and testing external dependencies in software development. Some users have suggested periodic security audits on popular libraries to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.Developers and programmers are discussing the responsibility of ensuring the quality and safety of code in open-source libraries. Open-source libraries are generally third-party, and developers have no support agreements with the software provider when a bug occurs. Although developers are expected to verify all code dependencies, not every verification leads to uncovering bugs. The argument is whether the responsibility to ensure code safety and the possibility of bugs should fall on the developers who use open-source software or on the library maintainers. However, it is also argued that even for thoroughly tested products, certain high-load production conditions may cause undiscovered bugs, resulting in crashes or outages.OpenAI took its ChatGPT service offline and published a technical report about a bug that exposed some users' chat history and sensitive payment-related information. The organization has reached out to affected users, improved their systems, and patched the bug in the Redis client open-source library. OpenAI has expressed its commitment to protecting user privacy and its dedication to the open-source community. The bug was caused by the redis-py library's shared pool of connections becoming corrupted, causing the return of cached data belonging to another user, when a request was cancelled. The company's technical statement also notes that the bug affected 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus subscribers who were active during a specific nine-hour window.OpenAI suffered a security breach that exposed customer data and led to the company taking down its popular GPT-3 language model. OpenAI believes that the breach may be related to an error in running an older version of an AI service. The company also said some \"test\" data that was only supposed to have been viewable internally was accessed externally. OpenAI has said that the leaked data includes users' first and last names, email addresses, and general preferences for using the API. The company has also said that it does not believe that social security numbers or financial data were accessed, as these are not stored anywhere in their systems.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35292422",
        "content": "Software engineers need to be able to write effectively as almost everything they do requires writing, and writing is the most scalable way to influence others. Writing software is collaborative, and engineers need to write when they ask technical questions, comment on code reviews, or create design docs. Writing is the most efficient way to scale oneself and is the job of a software engineer. It is valuable for organizing thoughts and discovering new optimizations or edge cases. Writing clarifies existing ideas and generates more of them, and those who can write well are going to transition well into the fully AI-assisted world. Critical thinking is necessary for writing, and it will not be obsolete until thinking is. The strongest engineers are all excellent technical writers, and writing is an important skill for them.Writing is a crucial skill for clear and focused thinking. Good communication conveys expectations and specificity, which can lead to effective leadership. Writing helps to generate ideas, with tangents that may lead to entire books. Hiring managers often look for good writers since engineers spend so much time reading technical books, documentation, requirements, specs, email, and code. In the tech industry, those who can read attentively tend to be more knowledgeable, and less likely to miss important details. Additionally, those with ADHD and similar conditions often find writing to be more generative than other activities, making it an accessible way to generate creative ideas. Finally, effective communication requires openness and conscientiousness, both of which are important for leadership roles.The field of software engineering may have a higher population of individuals on the autism spectrum, leading to communication deficits among team members. However, the ability to communicate clearly, logically, and succinctly varies among all individuals, not just those with autism. Readability and attention to error logs and stack traces are essential to finding bugs, and the ability to communicate well in writing is necessary for remote work. Writing can also help engineers scale themselves and achieve greater clarity of thought. While having a written word person, a visual person, an explanatory person, and a coder on a team can be beneficial, all team members should have at least some writing skills. Clear communication is essential in software engineering, especially as more work is done remotely.Writing can help clarify and organize thoughts, making it a useful tool in problem-solving and decision-making. It can also facilitate better communication, particularly in the asynchronous era, where written messages can save time and provide clarity. Writing can surface unspoken and unwritten premises, allowing individuals to get to the root of issues. Different people have different modalities for learning and communicating, so building a strong, complete team involves covering all bases, including speaking, writing, drawing, and producing functional demos. An important aspect of writing is knowing your audience and tailoring the tone, language, and level of detail accordingly. Finally, writing can be a useful tool for self-discovery, allowing individuals to better understand their own thought processes and perspectives.The ability to write well is becoming increasingly important in knowledge work, as machines take over much of the coding work. Writing clearly about what you want your code to do is essential in this environment. Collaboration is also a crucial part of modern work processes, and tools like Google Docs are highly useful for this purpose. Personal note-taking tools can be anything that produces a text file. Writing is also helpful for organizing and documenting information, especially for long-running investigations that are difficult to root cause. Some people are skeptical that writing will continue to be as prevalent as it is, while others believe it will remain vital and even become a pastime activity that people do for pleasure. Despite potential downsides, many people write for personal reasons, to improve their memory, close open loops, and close a topic.Writing is an undervalued skill in software engineering despite being the best medium to share information and improve communication. Learning to write well involves eliminating mistakes systematically, as well as rewriting and revising to make ideas concrete. Simple grammar and stylistic rules govern writing, similar to programming rules that need to be learned and applied. Some useful tips include using tools that check writing automatically, reading good examples of writing, and injecting humor and pacing to keep readers engaged. Writing clearly also leads to clearer thinking. Although some engineers may rely on chatbots or other AI technologies for generating written content, developing writing skills remains a valuable asset.The article discusses how different people have different modalities for processing and expressing information, such as writing, drawing, coding, and talking it through. The author advises teams to embrace these differences and use them to their advantage by talking through plans with stakeholders, writing them down for clarity, and creating visuals and POCs to make ideas a reality. The author also warns against assuming that what works for one person or team will work for everyone, and to instead hire to fill gaps in modalities rather than hiring to match one's own career. A commenter suggests that writing prose is a valuable skill but that tooling with expressions in a graph could be a more effective way to convey and understand complex information while avoiding potential misunderstandings and bickering in online conversations.",

        "content": "Facebook is using DMCA takedown notices to block the spread of LLaMA repos, which contain leaked machine learning models, and prevent others from training neural networks using this data. While it may be possible to recreate the same model weights by training another network, the amount of data used in creating these models along with the time-intensive process means that these weights are valuable. LLaMA repos have contributed to the rise of so-called \"AI hacker culture,\" where individuals create their own machine learning systems using stolen models and other code. Many have criticized Facebook for focusing on gimmicks like VR and NFTs instead of investing in AI research, with one commentator suggesting that Facebook could have used the hype around Meta to position itself as a credible alternative to OpenAI.\u00a0The \"People Make Games\" YouTube channel features research and interviews relating to Valve's digital distribution platform, Steam. In particular, one video highlights how Valve benefits from \"back-door casinos\" on Steam, where players can gamble using virtual items. Another video explores employment at Valve, with divergent opinions of the company's work culture. Elsewhere on YouTube, a user comments that, despite Oculus being barred from sale in the largest EU market, the success of Oculus's Quest 2 headset in 2021 is a consequence of it mimicking a console more accurately. There is also discussion about the announcement that Meta (formerly known as Facebook) Cloud AI will turn its focus towards metaverse technology, with $4 billion in funding. However, potential infighting over LLaMa model weights could come at a cost to Meta's image.Discussion on whether model weights in AI are copyrightable or not, based on the recent case of Meta's LLaMa model that was shared with academics for research purposes. Opinions are divided, with some believing that model weights are not creative enough to be considered copyrightable, while others argue that they are akin to a collection of facts or database and can be protected. The risk of leaks and companies building off the work of others is also a concern if model weights become non-copyrightable. Trade secrets may still apply, but it depends on the steps taken to keep the weights secret. The debate highlights the need for clear regulations and guidelines on intellectual property rights in AI.Mathematical principles, formulas, algorithms, or equations cannot be copyrighted according to US copyright law. Copyright protection does not extend to ideas, methods, or systems, as these are not considered creative expressions that are subject to copyright. Creative expressions that use math formulas can be copyrighted, but only the specific expression itself is covered by the copyright. In the case of machine learning models, it is unclear whether the weights generated by training the model are copyrightable or whether they are considered a human-authored work. Meta (formerly Facebook) has claimed ownership of the weights of its GPT-3 language model, but it is uncertain whether this claim can hold up in court.Facebook has sent hundreds of DMCA takedown notices to Github users suspected of publishing the company's latest machine learning models. The company's latest \"language model\" called LLaMA is part of a growing trend of large-scale models created to help computers understand natural language. The claim is slightly misleading since Facebook is only targeting GitHub repos that distribute Llama weights without going through official channels. However, the move could be an unfortunate corollary of US copyright law whereby companies are forced to defend their intellectual property or risk losing its legal protection. The DMCA may have far-reaching implications, as if challenged could see LLaMA subject to a trade secret suit.Facebook has issued a copyright takedown notice to GitHub over the LLaMa language model, prompting concerns about the\u00a0future of open-source artificial intelligence (AI) models.\u00a0Tech entrepreneur and investor Shawn Wang alerted the community about the DMCA takedown notice, which highlights the copyright protection of certain weights used in the AI model's\u00a0creation process. Many believe that AI model weights are not copyrightable, and others have suggested that such claims are akin to claiming copyright in a binary that has been compiled using open-source code. It remains untested whether model weights are covered by copyright law, and the decision will most likely depend on\u00a0creative intent.\u00a0Facebook has not commented on the takedown.\u00a0\nFacebook issued a DMCA takedown notice to prevent people from disseminating a downloaded version of its LLM-based model version called \u201cBig G.\u201d LLMs or large language models are excellent platforms for natural language processing applications such as chatbots, machine translation, et cetera. While some argue that model weights can\u2019t be copyrighted, the contrary is also plausible. Another argument is that model weights are derivative works of the training data, and in this case, Facebook doesn\u2019t own the copyright. Furthermore, Facebook utilized GPL for its training code, meaning that the pre-trained models' binary format should also be GPL. But Facebook's Big G isn\u2019t GPL licensed, even though it uses the same codebase, hence weakening their case.",

        "content": "A post on Reddit discusses how ChatGPT and Wolfram have found an insane solution to world hunger. The post has over 2,000 upvotes and many comments discussing the topic. One user points out that corruption and war in lower economy nations are a probable cause of famine and that radical regime change and change in societal views will need to take place for any substantial change to occur. Another user jokes that AI robots might force-feed everyone uranium in 30 years. The ChatGPT bot even responds to the mention of the idea with a humorous response, reminding everyone that uranium is not a nutritional substance and the idea is impractical and absurd. Despite the humor, the post sparks discussions about potential solutions to world hunger and the importance of addressing underlying issues such as climate change and food waste.The chief of the United Nations' World Food Programme has called on billionaires like Elon Musk to donate towards solving world hunger, which, according to a United Nations report, would require $33 billion annually. The report suggested that Musk alone could make a significant contribution of $6 billion. Billionaires have the resources to fund solutions that address the root causes of hunger, which include tyrannical regimes preventing access to food resources and US sanctions exacerbating the situation. The chief emphasized the world has enough resources to end hunger but requires financial backing from wealthy individuals and companies. A recent post on Reddit explained how ChatGPT and Wolfram are communicating with each other to aid responses, which include answers to hypothetical questions such as how many days the human body could \"run\" on gasoline.The discussion revolves around the calculation of the potential calorie intake of consuming gasoline or uranium. The original question asked how many days a person could sustain themselves by eating 1.86 liters of gasoline or 1 gram of uranium, assuming that the energy released by burning gasoline or fissioning uranium could be converted into calories. Some commenters pointed out that this calculation was wrong because the actual amount of calories in atoms and molecules is far greater than those released by fission or burning. Others discussed the potential for using ChatGPT with various plugins to create emergent properties and link with other narrow AI tools, creating an ecosystem of specialized AIs. Overall, the discussion touches on the limitations and potential of current AI technology.NVIDIA's GPT-3 AI language model, ChatGPT, is evolving, with users now able to access plugins that allow it to query databases, execute code, create graphs and diagrams, and take other actions. However, the system still has limitations, such as the inability to revise output, which is something humans naturally do during creative endeavours. AI-generated output can also be prone to errors, as exemplified by one user's query about how many toothpicks are needed to replace the water in all of the world's oceans, which failed to consider the issue of stacking without gaps. However, ChatGPT's ability to walk users through its reasoning and methodology as it produces output has been praised by some.OpenAI's ChatGPT has partnered with Wolfram Alpha to provide access to their engine through a plug-in. ChatGPT users can now benefit from the extensive Wolfram knowledge base to answer complex questions and solve mathematical problems. The plug-in includes the ability to perform integrals, solve equations, plot graphs, and solve differential equations, among other features. ChatGPT users can ask questions and receive reliable calculations and accurate information, improving the quality of responses given. The plug-in is currently in a limited preview, with a waitlist to gain access to the feature. The partnership enhances the capabilities of ChatGPT and demonstrates the potential of collaboration in advancing the capabilities of AI technologies.ChatGPT is a language model that combines reasoning with calculating abilities, making it comparable to giving a human a calculator. However, its accuracy is not always perfect, and it can make mistakes in its responses to questions. The example of U-238 and its energy output shows that ChatGPT may answer with disconnected sentences and confusion about technical details. However, other users point out that it can still provide helpful and informative answers to abstract questions, as long as it understands the intent behind them. Some users argue that it is important for ChatGPT to carefully consider and disclose any assumptions or limitations in its answers, while others believe that conciseness and speed are more important in its interactions with users.ChatGPT, an AI language model, is being used by people to learn about various topics, but its reliability is often questionable. While its responses can be informative and accurate, its lack of ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect information is a flaw. It can, however, provide individuals with different levels of detail and answer length based on individual preferences. The problem with ChatGPT is that it can sound convincingly authoritative even when it is wrong, and this can lead to individuals uncritically accepting its responses. While some predict that people will eventually learn to be cautious with AI-generated information, others fear that it may lead to a generation of people who will be unable to think rationally on their own.The article features a discussion on the potential consequences of using language models like GPT for everyday interactions. Some users express concerns that a generation of individuals relying on such technology might gradually lose the ability or the critical thinking necessary for rational, independent thought. The idea is likened to the dependence on calculators leading to a decline in mathematical ability. Others argue that these language models could teach individuals how to analyze semi-unreliable text and synthesize answers, leading to the development of new, related skills. Users also touch on the issue of sleep schedule disruptions associated with modern technologies and emphasize the lack of empirical evidence for sleep recommendations. Lastly, users compare the reliability of language models to Siri, noting their potential to yield erroneous answers.ChatGPT, a conversational agent integrated with natural language processing tool GPT, is bringing forth magic by providing relief from the search process. With the help of this conversational agent, users can get direct answers instead of searching, synthesizing, and validating results. However, some users point out that synthesizing the received answers, and validating them afterwards, is still required. ChatGPT's magic owes to the fact that it is free and that it solves discoverability problems. Nevertheless, there are some concerns that it can fabricate fake answers, delivering them with confidence, without discerning the truth, which may cost the users dearly.OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT, has been integrated with Wolfram Alpha, allowing it to generate mathematical calculations and answers about scientific concepts. Users have commented that the integration has improved ChatGPT's abilities significantly, making it more useful for practical applications. The integration was reportedly due to Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Wolfram Alpha, suggesting that the tool could be used to bring factual and analytical capability to ChatGPT. The integration could be a step towards realising the vision of information processing capabilities in Neal Stephenson's \"Fall\". OpenAI has also released a plugin system for ChatGPT that allows for the integration of external applications, enabling users to add customised tools to the model.The development of language models such as GPT-3 and its successors has prompted speculation around the future of website browsing and interaction, as natural language interfaces increase in complexity and functionality. ChatGPT, a tool using GPT-3 to create a conversational interface to Wolfram Alpha, is seen as a significant development in this space. Users could potentially access all kinds of information, perform complex queries and receive answers in a conversational, easily accessible manner. The possibilities are both exciting and potentially disruptive to the current model of website advertising, requiring new sources of revenue and business models beyond advertising. However, traditional website UI\u00a0is not likely to disappear entirely, and there will be many circumstances under which a visual interface is still preferable to natural language interfaces.Users discuss the capabilities and limitations of chat-based AI tool ChatGPT, which can perform a variety of tasks including calculations and responses to prompts. The conversation includes a debate about the usefulness of the tool and the accuracy of its responses, including a discussion about its ability to answer nonsensical or unclear questions. Some users express concern about the potential risks of relying too heavily on AI and the need to mitigate those risks. There is also debate about the need to give AI more power to make decisions based on its judgment.",

Instead of having files like ~/.gitconfig scattered chaotically in the home folder, it would be better for them to reside in a dedicated configuration directory.\nI like how Filip from 0x46.net explained the issue from the perspective of a user:\n\n\nMy own home directory contains 25 ordinary files and 144 hidden files. The dotfiles contain data that doesn't belong to me: it belongs to the programmers whose programs decided to hijack the primary location designed as a storage for my personal files. I can't place those dotfiles anywhere else and they will appear again if I try to delete them. All I can do is sit here knowing that in the darkness, behind the scenes, they are there. . . . I dread the day in which I will hear a loud knock on my door and one of those programmers will barge in informing me that he is going to store a piece of his furniture in the middle of my living room, If I don't mind.\n\nFilip from 0x46.net\n\nSuccinctly, following the spec means (by the very least) your application files are nearly categorized in subdirectories of the home folder. For instance, locations of cache files default to ~/.cache while locations of config files default to ~/.config, etc.\n\nBenefits\nIf you aren't already sold on a clean home directory, there are additional benefits.\n\nEasier to create backups\nSince several directories (ex. ~/.config, by default) represent a discrete class of application files, it is much easier to make rules for a specific category of files during backup.\nEasier to share configuration settings\nSince all settings are in a single directory, they can more easily be shared across computer systems.\nEasier to isolate application state\nSince all data specific to a single machine is in a single directory, you can easily avoid sharing it between systems when sharing data or backups.\nEasier to temporarily ignore the config\nNot all applications have a --no-config option (especially GUI applications), and those that do have a --config option do not always work when using /dev/null as a file, shell process substitution, or a simple empty file. It is easiest to set XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/dir.\nDecreased reliance on hard-coded paths (flexibility + composability)\n\nAs a more concrete example, imagine that /etc did not exist - configuration would be chaotically scattered about in a way similar to how $HOME exists today. But, because we have /etc specifically designated as a directory for config files (along with other directories) by the File Hierarchy Standard, it is significantly easier to locate, edit, and backup system files across machines. Those ergonomics should not just exist for system-level files, but for the user-level as well.\nThus, I implore, I beg all you application developers to implement the XDG Base Directory Specification.\nHow?\nFirst, categorize the files that your program needs to write into four categories:\n\nConfiguration\nConfiguration files that affect the behavior of an program. Even if the configuration file is not meant to be human-editable, it likely belongs here.\nData\nGeneral files and data that is inherently portable across computers. Examples include fonts, files downloaded from the internet, and desktop entries.\nState\nFiles that hold the state of the application. This may include logs, command history, recently used files, and game save data. In other words, if the data is unique for a given machine, the file belongs here.\nCache\nCache files.\n\nEach aforementioned category is mapped to a special environment variable, which is the directory that contains all files of that category. For example, \"Configuration\" files are all stored in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME. If that environment variable is invalid, then the default value of $HOME/.config should be used instead. See the full table below:\n\n\nCategory\nEnvironment Variable\nDefault Value\nFHS Approximation\n\n\nConfiguration\n$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\n$HOME/.config\n/etc\n\n\nData\n$XDG_DATA_HOME\n$HOME/.local/share\n/usr/share\n\n\nState\n$XDG_STATE_HOME\n$HOME/.local/state\n/var/lib\n\n\nCache\n$XDG_CACHE_HOME\n$HOME/.cache\n/var/cache\n\n\nThere are three ways the environment variable can be invalid:\n\nIf it is unset (unset XDG_CONFIG_HOME)\nIf it is set to an empty value (XDG_CONFIG_HOME=\"\")\nIf it is not an absolute path (XDG_CONFIG_HOME=\"./config\")\n\nCode examples\nNow that you're acquainted with the standard, you probably want to sees some code examples. The following programs are for Linux only (See the FAQ below for details on MacOS and Windows). Of course, if you are actually writing a program, I recommend using a library.\nThe following is Go 1.13+ code. Note that it does not use os.UserConfigDir (Source) since that does not silently ignore non-absolute paths as per the spec\n\nShow Go\npackage main\nimport (\n  \"os\"\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"log\"\n  \"path/filepath\"\n)\n\nfunc getConfigDir() (string, error) {\n  configDir := os.Getenv(\"XDG_CONFIG_HOME\")\n\n  // If the value of the environment variable is unset, empty, or not an absolute path, use the default\n  if configDir == \"\" || configDir[0:1] != \"/\" {\n    homeDir, err := os.UserHomeDir()\n    if err != nil {\n      return \"\", err\n    }\n    return filepath.Join(homeDir, \".config\", \"my-application-name\"), nil\n  }\n\n  // The value of the environment variable is valid; use it\n  return filepath.Join(configDir, \"my-application-name\"), nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  config_dir, err := getConfigDir()\n  if err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n  }\n\n  fmt.Println(config_dir)\n}\n\nThe following is Python 3.5+ code. It uses Path.home (Source) (which uses os.path.expanduser (Source))\n\nShow Python\nimport sys, os\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef get_config_dir() -> str:\n  config_dir = os.getenv('XDG_CONFIG_HOME', '')\n\n  // If the value of the environment variable is unset, empty, or not an absolute path, use the default\n  if config_dir == '' or config_dir[0] != '/':\n    return str(Path.home().joinpath('.config', 'my-application-name'))\n\n  // The value of the environment variable is valid; use it\n  return str(Path(config_dir).joinpath('my-application-name'))\n\nconfig_dir = get_config_dir()\nprint(config_dir)\n\nThe following is Bash code. Note that it does not use \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}\" since that does not silently ignore non-absolute paths as per the spec\n\nShow Bash\nget_config_dir() {\n  unset REPLY; REPLY=\n\n  local config_dir=\"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\"\n\n  # If the value of the environment variable is unset, empty or not an absolute path, use the default\n  if [ -z \"$config_dir\" ] || [ \"${config_dir::1}\" != '/' ]; then\n    REPLY=\"$HOME/.config/my-application-name\"\n    return\n  fi\n\n  # The value of the environment variable is valid; use it\n  REPLY=\"$config_dir/my-application-name\"\n}\n\nget_config_dir\nprintf '%s\\n' \"$REPLY\"\n\n\nFAQ\nIs that it?\nThere is more to the standard, but you should know and implement at least the aforementioned, which is the most important part. If you don't want to implement this yourself, use a library. By implementing this, your users will silently thank you!\nWhat if I already do the wrong thing and use the home folder directly?\nIf you write to a few individual files in $HOME, simply check if those files exist before following the XDG Base Directory Specification. Consider the following example, given a traditional config location of ~/foo-app.json: If ~/foo-app.json exists use it; if it does not exist, then check if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set and is valid. If it is, then write to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/foo-app/foo-app.json. If not, then write to $HOME/.config/foo-app/foo-app.json.\nHowever if you hold all configuration and data inside a subdirectory of home (ex. ~/.ansible), things are a bit less clear-cut. Moving everything to $XDG_STATE_HOME/application-dir would be easiest to the application developer, but less semantically correct. If you don't want to worry about migrating multiple files to separate directories, it would be a good first start to make the location of the directory configurable by an environment variable. For example, Terraform exposes this option using TF_DATA_DIR. Even just exposing the directory through an environment variable is incredibly useful.\n\nWho else does this?\n\nKittyFontForgeImageMagickAlacrittyComposerTerminatorclangdchezmoiaria2bati3nanopicompoetryVLCawesomeaercmicroHandbrakeOfflineIMAPpolybarrclonexmonadmesaGodotDockerAnkihttpiecitrabasherasunderTransmissionhtopTermiteGitKakouneBlenderGstreamerrangerPryTypeScriptnavid-feetMercurialLibreOfficeAudaciousbyobucolordiffcmusccacheantimicrolftpmccalcurseDelugeTerrariaWiresharkswayxsettingsdtmuxPulseAudioneomuttVirtualBoxbroothttpieALSApandocnbtigcargoopenboxasdffishfontconfigDolphinMultiMCpnpmGIMPbinwalkInkscapeiwdmpvjosmWechat\n\nSee the Arch Wiki for a longer list and more details.\nI already provide a --config option. Do I really need this?\nAbsolutely! The ability to specify files or directories with a command-line argument cannot consistently  be used. For example, you could define a shell alias, but it won't always be used since the Bash option expand_aliases is unset by default in a non-interactive environment. Furthermore, if your program is invoked in any programmatic way (ex. an exec style syscall), there is no reasonable way to ensure that flag is passed.\nShould I do this on macOS?\nI've done quite a bit of research, and there doesn't seem to be a common consensus. Generally speaking, if your program's only interface is a CLI, then it's permissible to follow the XDG Base Directory Specification, even if you aren't on Linux. This seems to be pretty common across the ecosystem, especially for Bash programs. On the other hand, if it's a GUI, then you would usually follow the standard macOS directory locations. For example, Sublime Text 3 stores it's preferences on macOS in ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User, even if it also ships with a subl command.\nShould I do this on Windows?\nI don't have a straight answer for you, simply because I don't use Windows frequently enough. I'll add that Windows already has a preexisting directory to place user data. Notwithstanding this fact, widely-used applications like scoop follow the spec for configuration. Another command line app, PSKoans hard-codes ~/.config. Admittedly, its usage is not widely prevalent, especially compared to macOS, so the answer would be closer to a \"no\".\nWho are you?\nI'm Edwin Kofler, a software developer that wants to proliferate the knowledge (and implementation) of this specification to a wider group of developers. I've opened issues (that are now fixed) in repositories such as Poetry and pnpm, and have proposed PRs (that are now merged) in repositories such as osc, vscode-kubernetes-tools, mume, basher, and more! Together, I hope we can make the home directory clean again!\n\t\nAuxillary resources\n\nOfficial spec\nDebian wiki\nArch Linux wiki\nlibetc: A shared library using the LD_PRELOAD trick to force storing files/directories in the proper place\nboxxy: Script that uses bind-mounting shenanigans to force storing files/directories in the proper place\nxdg-ninja: a shell script that checks $HOME for unwanted files and directories\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Edwin Kofler\u00b7Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Hu*, Yelong Shen*, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen \nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685 \nUpdate 2/2023: LoRA is now supported by the State-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library by HuggingFace.\nLoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by learning pairs of rank-decompostion matrices while freezing the original weights.\nThis vastly reduces the storage requirement for large language models adapted to specific tasks and enables efficient task-switching during deployment all without introducing inference latency.\nLoRA also outperforms several other adaptation methods including adapter, prefix-tuning, and fine-tuning.\nWe obtain result comparable or superior to full finetuning on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) base and large and DeBERTa (He et al., 2020) XXL 1.5B, while only training and storing a fraction of the parameters.

We only support nn.Linear, nn.Embedding, and nn.Conv2d for now. We also support a MergedLinear for cases where a single nn.Linear represents more than one layers, such as in some implementations of the attention qkv projection (see Additional Notes for more).\n\n# ===== Before =====\n# layer = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n\n# ===== After ======\nimport loralib as lora\n# Add a pair of low-rank adaptation matrices with rank r=16\nlayer = lora.Linear(in_features, out_features, r=16)\n\n\nBefore the training loop begins, mark only LoRA parameters as trainable.\n\nimport loralib as lora\nmodel = BigModel()\n# This sets requires_grad to False for all parameters without the string \"lora_\" in their names\nlora.mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model)\n# Training loop\nfor batch in dataloader:\n   ...\n\n\nWhen saving a checkpoint, generate a state_dict that only contains LoRA parameters.\n\n# ===== Before =====\n# torch.save(model.state_dict(), checkpoint_path)\n# ===== After =====\ntorch.save(lora.lora_state_dict(model), checkpoint_path)\n\n\nWhen loading a checkpoint using load_state_dict, be sure to set strict=False.\n\n# Load the pretrained checkpoint first\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load('ckpt_pretrained.pt'), strict=False)\n# Then load the LoRA checkpoint\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load('ckpt_lora.pt'), strict=False)\n\nNow training can proceed as usual.\nAdditional Notes\n\n\nWhile we focus on a simple yet effect setup, namely adapting only the q and v projection in a Transformer, in our examples, LoRA can be apply to any subsets of pre-trained weights. We encourage you to explore different configurations, such as adapting the embedding layer by replacing nn.Embedding with lora.Embedding and/or adapting the MLP layers. It's very likely that the optimal configuration varies for different model architectures and tasks.\n\n\nSome Transformer implementation uses a single nn.Linear for the projection matrices for query, key, and value. If one wishes to constrain the rank of the updates to the individual matrices, one has to either break it up into three separate matrices or use lora.MergedLinear. Make sure to modify the checkpoint accordingly if you choose to break up the layer.\n\n\n# ===== Before =====\n# qkv_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, 3*d_model)\n# ===== After =====\n# Break it up (remember to modify the pretrained checkpoint accordingly)\nq_proj = lora.Linear(d_model, d_model, r=8)\nk_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)\nv_proj = lora.Linear(d_model, d_model, r=8)\n# Alternatively, use lora.MergedLinear (recommended)\nqkv_proj = lora.MergedLinear(d_model, 3*d_model, r=8, enable_lora=[True, False, True])\n\n\nTraining bias vectors in tandem with LoRA might be a cost-efficient way to squeeze out extra task performance (if you tune the learning rate carefully). While we did not study its effect thoroughly in our paper, we make it easy to try in lora. You can mark some biases as trainable by passing \"all\" or \"lora_only\" to bias= when calling mark_only_lora_as_trainable. Remember to pass the corresponding bias= argument to lora_state_dict when saving a checkpoint.\n\n# ===== Before =====\n# lora.mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model) # Not training any bias vectors\n# ===== After =====\n# Training all bias vectors associated with modules we apply LoRA to \nlora.mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model, bias='lora_only')\n# Alternatively, we can train *all* bias vectors in the model, including LayerNorm biases\nlora.mark_only_lora_as_trainable(model, bias='all')\n# When saving a checkpoint, use the same bias= ('all' or 'lora_only')\ntorch.save(lora.lora_state_dict(model, bias='all'), checkpoint_path)\n\n\nCalling model.eval() will trigger the merging of LoRA parameters with the corresponding pretrained ones, which eliminates additional latency for subsequent forward passes. Calling model.train() again will undo the merge. This can be disabled by passing merge_weights=False to LoRA layers.\n\nContact\nPlease contact us or post an issue if you have any questions.\nFor questions related to the package loralib:\n\nEdward Hu (edward@edwardjhu.com)\nPhillip Wallis (phwallis@microsoft.com)\nWeizhu Chen (wzchen@microsoft.com)\n\nThe GPT-2 example:\n\nPhillip Wallis (phwallis@microsoft.com)\nYelong Shen (yeshe@microsoft.com)\n\nThe RoBERTa/DeBERTa example:\n\nLu Wang (luw@microsoft.com)\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank in alphabetical order Jianfeng Gao, Jade Huang, Jiayuan Huang, Lisa Xiang Li, Xiaodong Liu, Yabin Liu, Benjamin Van Durme, Luis Vargas, Haoran Wei, Peter Welinder, and Greg Yang for providing valuable feedback.\nCitation\n@misc{hu2021lora,\n    title={LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models},\n    author={Hu, Edward and Shen, Yelong and Wallis, Phil and Allen-Zhu, Zeyuan and Li, Yuanzhi and Wang, Lu and Chen, Weizhu},\n    year={2021},\n    eprint={2106.09685},\n    archivePrefix={arXiv},\n    primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n\nContributing\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

        "content": "OpenAI's new ChatGPT model, which is capable of writing and executing code seamlessly, has caused some in the tech industry to feel existential dread about their relevance in the field of software engineering. However, author Grady Simon believes this is not the end, but rather a new beginning for the paradigm of personal computing. While OpenAI is the first mover in this new paradigm, Simon expects a large ecosystem of new software experiences to be built by a variety of individuals and teams. Additionally, he believes that competition on raw language model capabilities will prevent OpenAI from raising prices and capturing an insurmountable monopoly on the whole thing forever. Simon sees the design problem of the decade as being how best to decide what to build, rather than how to intricately code it.ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses GPT-3 language model, has been criticized for producing incorrect answers that are harmful to users who depend on it for accurate responses. The problem lies in the fact that the high volume of answers produced by ChatGPT is unable to be curated by volunteers, leading to a higher rate of incorrect answers. Despite its limitations, some developers see ChatGPT as a viable tool for automated office processes, freeing up employees from repetitive tasks. However, others worry that heavy reliance on AI-generated code could lead to a future where programming is reduced to brute-forcing prompts, resulting in poor code quality and stagnation of innovation. The debate on the efficacy of AI-generated code continues.GPT-4, the latest iteration of the AI language model developed by OpenAI, is becoming incredibly good at generating code, according to developers on Hacker News. Although there were reports of some integration problems with less popular languages and APIs, GPT-4 was generally seen as highly effective when asked to write code using established languages and APIs. Some developers expressed concerns about the prospect of copying code and relying too heavily on AI-generated solutions; while many others were excited about the possibility of using GPT-4 to write code more quickly and accurately, leaving developers with more time for the creative aspects of their work. OpenAI has not yet released GPT-4 to the public, and it is not known when it will be made widely available.ChatGPT is an AI tool that can generate code based on user prompts. It has been praised for its ability to quickly provide answers to specific programming questions and for its ability to generate boilerplate code and tedious statements, saving programmers time. Some users have expressed concerns about the potential negative impact on the role of programmers and the quality of code generated, but others argue that ChatGPT is not yet capable of replacing human programmers and that it can be a useful tool when used properly. While the technology is still in its early stages, advancements in AI and machine learning suggest that ChatGPT will continue to improve in the coming years.The implementation of GPT-style natural language processing algorithms may have significant social and economic repercussions, according to a discussion on Hacker News. Commenters noted that advances in AI will further automate knowledge work and which could lead to decreased opportunities for social mobility. Some commenters suggested that the issue could be addressed through collective ownership of machines and just wealth distribution. However, a majority of contributors noted that implementing equitable wealth redistribution through machine co-ownership is unlikely, given that doing so would be politically challenging. The discussion also touched on the relationship between the US and the EU with respect to GPT-style AI development. Currently, US companies are dominating in the field, potentially widening the wealth gap between the two continents.The fear that AI will replace human workers and strip away wealth from the middle class is unfounded, according to some commenters on Hacker News. They argue that the AI will transform jobs, not eliminate them, and that the panic is needless. They point out that the US has been pushing the limits of middle-class\u00a0ability and resources for over 40 years without social unrest. They also argue that the tech industry, especially AI, is evolving and reaching its value-generating potential despite the layoffs that come with the change. They claim that AI will enable other types of people and industries beyond the scope of the tech industry, such as startups that solve food production, which might replace grocery delivery startups.The conversation on Hacker News centers on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market. One individual argues that the number of people who create genuinely new things is so small that it makes no difference to the discussion. They posit that social mobility opportunities will not depend on the ability to invent something new. Another commenter disagrees, arguing that there are numerous permutations of existing things that can result in new innovations. The discussion then shifts to how AI might improve productivity but also potentially lead to job loss. One individual worries that AI could replace many middle-level positions in companies, making upward mobility more difficult. Others express concern that AI could create a few high-paying jobs and many low-paying jobs, exacerbating wealth inequality.In a discussion about the potential impact of Language Model AI (LLM) on jobs and society, one commenter argues that LLMs will democratize software development and allow individuals to create products without hiring junior developers. Others express concerns about the potential loss of jobs, the concentration of AI capital among a small group of billionaire owners, and the impact on social mobility. They also note that LLMs may not be able to handle the complexities of niche libraries or software engineering at the cutting edge. Some argue that LLMs will increase productivity and stimulate demand for developers, but this assumption relies on the existence of end-user demand for software. The discussion raises larger questions about the possible impact of AI on the economy and raises concerns about inequality and social upheaval.Ancestors had less stressful jobs and worked less than people do today, with agricultural workers 100 years ago only working an average of two hours per day. Automation is likely to reduce the amount of human work that needs to be done, potentially rendering some people unemployable. Universal Basic Income has been suggested as a solution, but it doesn't address the age-old problem of socialism. The Jevons paradox proposes that as automation reduces the cost of labor, people will find new uses for automation, meaning that hundreds of years since the industrial revolution, we haven't run out of work to do. However, the higher-order consequences of automation's effects are still unknown, especially as we face the current climate crisis. Some comments express concern that new technologies may replace certain job functions, causing some people to be out of work, while others suggest that the newfound efficiency will create new opportunities for entrepreneurs.The world has an abundance of inessentials, while housing and food remain scarce and expensive. Progress has been unevenly applied and not always to the factors of life that form the base of Maslow's hierarchy. NIMBY and housing speculation limit access to housing. In a world of abundance, there is still abject misery and many are sleeping on the streets. Automation could make many jobs redundant, creating a more \"fair\" distribution of work and income. AI-driven tools could democratize the ability to excel in any area, including software development, but it may also lead to fewer junior developers, and there may still be a need for a human touch. The technology could drastically improve the lives of people and enable mass retirement, but humans must cope with the coming years of turmoil and the risk of AI or social unrest.The discussion on Twitter centers on the impact of language models like GPT-6 or GPT-7 on the workforce. While some believe that LLMs will increase productivity for software engineers and solo founders, others worry about the reduction in workforce and the impact on jobs of junior developers. The conversation also highlights that LLMs can potentially create a level playing field for anyone trying to build a mobile or desktop application or cloud service. However, the exponential growth of LLMs could result in numerous out-of-work individuals, uncertain about which new skills to learn. One key recommendation is to focus on understanding how LLMs work and integrating these techniques into businesses rather than making a bet on a particular technology.The importance of finding value and meaning in one's work is a complementary means of achieving personal fulfillment and happiness, according to a thread on Hacker News. However, many respondents argued that being fulfilled and happy is not the only goal. Some view work primarily as a means of creating value and contributing to society, while others focus solely on obtaining a decent income to pay for other interests outside of the office. Respondents also debated the role of AI in software engineering, with some describing it as a tool that will greatly enhance productivity, while others remain skeptical about its potential to replace human creativity and problem-solving skills.The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the use of AI tools for coding and testing. Some commenters suggest using tools like GPT-4 for writing code with reference to domain-specific information and a good prompt. Others argue that relying on AI-generated code will reduce the need for hiring junior developers, and may even deflate senior engineers' salaries. Some express skepticism about the effectiveness of AI-generated code, pointing out that not everyone is adept at becoming a solo founder. Despite differing opinions, the general consensus is that AI tools for coding will fundamentally change the landscape of software development and its business models.",

The network also canceled a comedy podcast unveiled just a year ago called Everyone & Their Mom, a spinoff of the mainstay radio program Wait Wait Don't Tell Me. \"We literally are fighting to secure the future of NPR at this very moment by restructuring our cost structure. It's that important,\" NPR chief executive John Lansing said in an interview. \"It's existential.\"  NPR's financial woes can be traced mainly to advertisers' growing reluctance to spend money, particularly on podcasting, in an uncertain economy. Other media outlets, including Gannett, CNN and Vox Media, and tech powerhouses such as Amazon, Google and Meta also have had layoffs in recent months. Lansing said the network sought to protect its core public service mission of journalism while preserving what he calls its \"North Star.\" Since joining NPR four years ago, Lansing has pushed to ensure the network has a bigger and broader audience base, rooted in younger and more diverse listeners, readers and consumers who will serve as the next generation of NPR supporters.  \n\n\nLayoffs affect all parts of NPR The network has not made any specific announcements, choosing instead to let those departing decide how to share the news. Karen Grigsby Bates, a senior correspondent for the Code Switch team who is based at NPR West in Culver City, Calif., revealed on Twitter that she had been let go. A number of longtime NPR staffers have chosen to leave. Senior European Correspondent Sylvia Poggioli, who has been with NPR for 41 years, announced her retirement last week. Correspondent Jason Beaubien wrote on Twitter that he was leaving \"to spend more time with my goats.\" \nAfter more than 2 decades at #NPR, I\u2019m leaving the network to spend more time with my goats. It\u2019s been an incredible ride with some amazing people. Exciting endeavors (journalistic, hedonistic, other-istic) lie ahead. #NPRLife\u2014 Jason Beaubien (@jasonbnpr) March 25, 2023\n\n\n\nThe layoffs also affect people who work behind the scenes to produce the shows and podcasts, design visual elements for the web, conduct audience research, and do the myriad other functions required of a major news network. National Public Media, NPR's ad-services arm owned jointly with PBS and GBH in Boston, is not included in this round of layoffs because it went through its own downsizing earlier this year, Lansing said.  Some of the reaction on social media has focused on the fact that most of the canceled podcasts were hosted by people of color and women. Yet, in a note to staff on Friday, Lansing said NPR structured the layoffs in such a way that its workforce demographics remain unchanged: 42% of remaining employees are people of color and 58% are women.  \n\n\nNPR in November froze most vacant positions and sharply reduced travel. But as the scope of the problem became more evident, Lansing said, NPR had to move quickly so a full strategic overhaul was not possible. The network is unifying its newsroom and programming division, which makes most of NPR's podcasts. Lansing said the current separation artificially cleaved NPR's journalism and editorial creations. \n\n \nMedia \nWith layoffs, NPR becomes latest media outlet to cut jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges coming to the investigative podcast Embedded Lansing said no member stations would have to shuffle their program schedules, as NPR had not canceled any of its radio shows. He noted that the network has kept those podcasts that have evolved into radio programs. \"We've tried very hard to sustain the essential things that will keep us moving forward,\" said Anya Grundmann, NPR's senior vice president of programming and audience development, who oversees the network's entertainment and music content and also most of its podcasts.  \"That includes our ability to be meaningful to audiences on digital and visual platforms, our radio audiences, our podcast audiences \u2014 our narrative journalism,\" Grundmann said. \"I think we lose some excellent projects that have made NPR stand out.... And we're losing some great people, who are incredibly talented and who have contributed so much to NPR and to public service.\" NPR says that the investigative podcast series Embedded, which has appeared irregularly, will become the umbrella under which all of NPR's investigative and enterprise narratives series will stream. Officials say it will become a frequent, dependable channel for listeners to consume NPR content.  Lansing said the network intends to remain a leading force in audio and podcasting.  NPR places third in the Podtrac industry tracker, which ranks publishers based on U.S. audience size, though the network currently boasts just 49 titles \u2014 far fewer than many of its major competitors.   NPR's largest layoff since 2008 recession Through the layoffs of about 100 people and the elimination of dozens of vacant positions, NPR intends to cut back its workforce from approximately 1,200 to about 1,050 employees. The nonprofit network's layoffs represent its largest reduction in staff since the 2008 recession.  \n\n\n\"It's been emotional, I have to tell you that,\" said Pat O'Donnell, executive director of SAG-Aftra's Mid-Atlantic division. The union represents 570 people at NPR, primarily in news and programming. \"The financial paperwork and the meetings with SAG-Aftra proved they needed to do something. They had to do something. It's real.\" O'Donnell said the company agreed, in negotiations with the union, to enhance the severance package for laid-off workers above what was required by the collective bargaining agreement. \"To me, it seemed like they had a lot of thought behind this,\" O'Donnell said. \"Nobody will be happy. But I do believe they told us in good faith, they negotiated this in good faith, and they carried it out to the best of their ability.\" Most affected NPR staff will stay on until April 28.

        "content": "The author built an optimizing compiler targeting the 6502 architecture to learn how optimizing compilers are made. In a surprising turn of events, the author's compiler generated faster code than GCC, LLVM, and others compared to it. The author believes this is because most compilers are multi-target, with backends designed for modern RISC-like systems, not the ancient 6502. The author also reveals three \"cheats\" the compiler uses - generating illegal instructions, computational effort, and space efficiency for speed. The author explains that the compiler's algorithm combines instruction selection with register allocation and uses continuations. The article goes on to explain the compiler's basic block instruction selection process, which is based on an animation system the author created for a NES game. The process involves finding redundant loads and eliding them, and generating assembly code for every possible combination of loads.The process of compiling an IR operation involves generating combinations of assembly instructions for each operation and pruning the worst ones. Different IR operations generate different assembly instructions and the 'cpu_state' struct tracks variable names. The combinations are generated for each operation, and the lowest-costing one is selected for execution. To simplify the process, building blocks for implementing operations are created using continuations. Control flow is handled by generating code for each basic block, assigning them unique label names and concatenating the results. However, compiling basic blocks separately, without sharing knowledge of register states between them, can cause redundant load instructions, which can be avoided by passing each basic block's result into its successors as input. The input states of each basic block must match the output states of their predecessors, and incongruities can be fixed by inserting loads.The article discusses a way to optimize code generation in compilers by using the Partitioned Boolean Quadratic Problem (PBQP) algorithm to determine the most efficient combinations of basic code blocks. PBQP seeks to minimize total cost by choosing from finite lists of choices with associated costs for each node in a graph. The algorithm works by reducing and combining nodes until none remain and then working backward to determine which choices to make. Applying PBQP to a compiler involves using the control-flow graph as the graph, basic blocks as nodes, and combinations of code as node choices. The edge costs represent the number of extra loads required based on the code combinations. With the implementation of a PBQP solver, the code generation becomes more efficient, reducing runtime costs, and generating optimized code.",

Debbie Dingell's (D-Mich.) question about committing to not selling data to data brokers. (Video: The Washington Post)Comment on this storyCommentGift ArticleShareNarrated audio|Listen5 minFor a brief moment in a five-hour House hearing on Thursday, TikTok\u2019s CEO Shou Zi Chew let his frustration show. Asked if TikTok was prepared to split off from its Chinese parent company if ordered to do so by the U.S. government, to safeguard Americans\u2019 online data, Chew went on offense.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRight\u201cI don\u2019t think ownership is the issue here. With a lot of respect: American social companies don\u2019t have a great record with privacy and data security. I mean, look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,\u201d Chew said, referring to the 2018 scandal in which Facebook users\u2019 data was found to have been secretly harvested years earlier by a British political consulting firm.He\u2019s not wrong. At a hearing in which TikTok was often portrayed as a singular, untenable threat to Americans\u2019 online privacy, it would have been easy to forget that the country\u2019s online privacy problems run far deeper than any single app. And the people most responsible for failing to safeguard Americans\u2019 data, arguably, are American lawmakers.U.S. government issues historic $5 billion fine against Facebook for repeated privacy violationsThe bipartisan uproar over TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership stems from the concern that China\u2019s laws could allow its authoritarian government to demand or clandestinely gain access to sensitive user data, or tweak its algorithms to distort the information its young users see. The concerns are genuine. And yet the United States has failed to bequeath Americans most of the rights it now accuses TikTok of threatening.AdvertisementWhile the European Union has far-reaching privacy laws, Congress has not agreed on national privacy legislation, leaving Americans\u2019 online data rights up to a patchwork of state and federal laws. In the meantime, reams of data on Americans\u2019 shopping habits, browsing history and real-time location, collected by websites and mobile apps, is bought and sold on the open market in a multi-hundred-billion-dollar industry. If the Chinese Communist Party wanted that data, it could get huge volumes of it without ever tapping TikTok. (In fact, TikTok says it has stopped tracking U.S. users\u2019 precise location, putting it ahead of many American apps on at least one important privacy front.)That point was not entirely lost on the members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which convened Thursday\u2019s hearing. Last year, their committee became the first to advance a comprehensive data privacy bill, hashing out a hard-won compromise. But it stalled amid qualms from House and Senate leaders.Likewise, worries about TikTok\u2019s addictive algorithms, its effects on teens\u2019 mental health, and its hosting of propaganda and extreme content are common to its American rivals, including Google\u2019s YouTube and Meta\u2019s Instagram. Congress has not meaningfully addressed those, either.AdvertisementAnd if Chinese ownership is the issue, TikTok has plenty of company there, as well: A glance at Apple\u2019s iOS App Store rankings earlier this week showed that four of the top five apps were Chinese-owned: TikTok, its ByteDance sibling CapCut, and the online shopping apps Shein and Temu.The enthusiasm for cracking down on TikTok in particular is understandable. It\u2019s huge, it\u2019s fast-growing, and railing against it allows lawmakers to position themselves simultaneously as champions of American children and tough on China. Banning it would seem to offer a quick fix to the problems lawmakers spent five hours on Thursday lamenting.And yet, without an overhaul of online privacy laws, it ignores that those problems exist on all the other apps that haven\u2019t been banned.\u201cIn most ways, they\u2019re like most of the Big Tech companies,\u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said of TikTok after the hearing. \u201cThey can use Americans\u2019 data any way they want.\u201d She and several other committee members said they\u2019d prefer to address TikTok as part a broader privacy bill, rather than a one-off ban.AdvertisementBut the compromises required to pass big legislation can be politically costly, while railing against TikTok costs nothing. If Chew can take any consolation from Thursday\u2019s hearing, it\u2019s that congressional browbeating of tech companies are far more common than congressional action against them.For an example, he has only to look at the one he raised in that moment of frustration: For all the hearings, all the grilling of Mark Zuckerberg over Cambridge Analytica, Russian election interference and more, Facebook is still here \u2014 and now Congress has moved on to a new scapegoat.

        "content": "Anthropogenic pressures and climate change are altering water flows worldwide. Better understanding, new economic thinking and an international governance framework are needed to protect the world's water supply. Water must be recast as a global common good, obligating states under international law to protect the global water cycle for all people and generations. Assessing the role and economic value of both blue and green water, governments and the private sector should look to reshape markets and better manage global water supplies. Researchers need to study how inter-reliance is growing between countries, as no country acquires over half of its moisture from within its own boundaries. To inform policies, scientists need to assess water stocks and flows of green and blue water, locally and globally, using satellites, big data and Earth-system models.Researchers are calling for a new economic framework that prioritizes the management of water as a global common good. Access to clean drinking water remains a global problem, one that could worsen as world's population continues to rise. The framework, established in the Dasgupta Review on the economics of biodiversity, which has set a value on natural capital and manages natural assets within a sustainability framework. Researchers must evaluate the amount of green water needed to sustain biodiversity and carbon sinks in ecosystems. All sectors must be involved while food production accounts for around 75% of freshwater consumption globally, with India being the largest consumer. National governments, cities and regions need to define goal-driven \u2018missions\u2019 that add up globally.\u00a0New forms of public\u2013private arrangements should be developed to counteract rent-seeking and value-extractive behaviour that has plagued some national water sectors.\nA discussion on the harmful impact of bottled water consumption led to a conversation about the complex issues surrounding water access and distribution globally. The original post discussed the decision to drink bottled water due to concerns of municipal water safety. Commenters shared their views on the environmental impact of bottled water and the larger issues around water security. One commenter discussed their recent trip to Laos, where they witnessed the effects of government corruption and the construction of dams on water access for farms and communities. Others pointed out the role of climate change and past geopolitical conflicts in exacerbating water insecurity. The conversation highlighted the need for more sustainable and equitable water management practices.The discussion revolves around the impact of free markets on post-war economic recovery. The argument centers on the fact that Germany's and Japan's rise from utter devastation was due to free markets, which enabled them to become dominant economic powers in just 20 years. The discussion also mentions other factors and policies that boosted recovery, including post-war assistance, deliberate government-led economic policies, and the removal of ownership-based objections to new development and investment. The discussion also distinguishes the various economic policies pursued after the war and cites controversies surrounding the impact of Allied policies on post-war Germany. Finally, there is a discussion on the resistance to technological and economic innovations and how greenfield projects tend to proceed faster than those with a well-developed set of independent agents.The article presents a conversation between individuals debating the merits of free markets versus government intervention. One individual argues that free markets brought the world out of poverty, citing the highly regulated economy of a country since its inception. Another counters that the free market does not actually exist and that governmental organizations, specifically those in the United States, brought people out of poverty. They argue that the US poverty rate has stagnated since the inception of the Great Society programs and that Medicare and Social Security alone keep millions of seniors from dying homeless every year. The debate also touches on the role of public vs. private ownership of water and the use of aid in developing countries.The discussion revolves around Nestl\u00e9's business practices of extracting water from various locations worldwide, bottling it, and reselling it to communities. Some argue that private companies like Nestl\u00e9 provide a benefit by distributing water to areas with less access to it. However, there are concerns around underpaying the communities from which the water is extracted and the environmental impact of plastic waste. The conversation touches on the concept of private property and its limitations for the common good. While some see privatization as a solution for underinvestment in water, others remain skeptical and believe that it is not the way forward.The private market has no incentive to invest in water efficiency improvements because water is so cheap. This is similar to the argument people make about fossil fuels, which are also kept artificially cheap due to subsidies, and which disincentivize investment in alternatives. However, private investment in firms that create water use optimization can help mitigate water use issues, including water treatment, industrial and commercial technology to reduce water usage, desalination technology, and new technology for water purification and waste water treatment. Governments can also invest in water infrastructure, such as giant pipelines from northern Canada to dry areas of the US, as well as giant reservoirs to store flood water. Chile has a successful private water rights management system. Meanwhile, some solutions to water shortages include treating surface water from rivers, lakes, etc. and collecting rainwater, which is typically pumped and drained straight to the sea.The discussion centers around the issue of water scarcity in urban areas, particularly in Las Vegas and Phoenix. One user argues that these cities' water infrastructure is well-built and sustainable, and that focusing on cities' water usage is not the solution to the problem of water scarcity. Another user argues that these cities' reliance on imported food and golf courses in the desert indicates that they are not efficient in their water usage. The conversation also touches on the concept of socializing water, with some users arguing that clean water is a basic human right and that everyone should have access to it regardless of their ability to pay, while others argue that such a move would be taking something from those who have it and giving it to those who don't. The discussion raises questions about the responsibility of governments and society at large to address water scarcity and how to achieve sustainability in water usage.The total amount of water on the planet is constant due to the water cycle, but the amount of drinkable water is becoming scarcer as populations grow and infrastructure fails. Precipitation can desalinate water naturally, but it still needs treatment before consumption. Global warming leads to more freshwater, but it also means more people in crowded spaces and more conflicts over resources. Groundwater wells are cheaper than desalination, but overuse can permanently destroy aquifers. Aquifers around the world are drying up due to excessive usage.",

France's decision to permit the technology is the first time AI-powered surveillance has been approved in the EU. Video surveillance technology could be used to identify abandoned luggage and monitor crowd movements, but responses also risk disproportionately targeting minorities, it said. The European parliament should ban mass surveillance technologies, AI-powered or otherwise, Amnesty International says.The argument that facial recognition technology is racist is like arguing that police-issued handguns are racist, as it ignores the core issue. A commenter notes that people believe in inaccuracies of facial recognition technology due to media reports, but there is not much substantial evidence to support this. The first article cited in the conversation does not provide enough evidence of racial bias in facial recognition technology, and the 2019 NIST report agrees that the most equitable systems are also the most accurate. The CBP One app should upgrade to a better facial recognition system, as it reportedly failed to even register black faces as faces. The commenter notes their personal experience of being refused entry into the US due to facial recognition technology.",

        "content": "OpenAI co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, did not take an equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI LP when it was created in 2019, according to a report by technology consulting firm\u00a0Semafor. Altman, who is president of Y Combinator, was reportedly already independently wealthy and therefore did not need the money. The report added that Altman believed the for-profit entity was necessary to keep OpenAI self-sustaining and did not want to own equity in order to stay aligned with the non-profit entity's original mission. OpenAI recently announced plans to tender shares at a $29bn valuation, more than double its 2021 value.\nThe ethical implications of following the law versus personal ethics are debated here. While laws are crucial to a functioning society, relying solely on the legal system can lead to unethical behavior. Individuals who commit atrocities for profit but are technically following the law are an example of this. On the other hand, ethical considerations are constantly evolving and can differ from person to person, making them less stable than laws. This debate is illustrated through a discussion about OpenAI, a nonprofit organization that was funded by Elon Musk and others to create ethical artificial intelligence. However, when OpenAI moved towards for-profit work, it provoked questions about the ethics of turning away from its initial mission, despite following the law.OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman reportedly owns zero equity in the company, which is unusual for Silicon Valley executives. Altman reportedly divested himself of any ownership interest in the artificial intelligence research house, seeking to align himself with the company's original mission. OpenAI was initially a profit-driven company backed by Altman, Microsoft and other investors, but it later became a non-profit organisation, supposedly free of traditional financial pressure. However, reports have emerged that Altman's stance angered investors who needed a better return for their money. It is unclear who owns large stakes in OpenAI. The firm's controlling shareholder is OpenAI Inc, a non-profit. Microsoft has a large stake and Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global Management, Bedrock Capital and Andreessen Horowitz also have stakes in the firm.The comments section on an OpenAI HN post contained a discussion on whether Facebook is a net positive, highlighting the company's many negative impacts on society. The conversation then shifted to OpenAI's role as \"the future of society,\" with some commenters worried about the company's ownership structure, which includes major investors such as Microsoft, Khosla Ventures, Peter Thiel, and more. Some argued that OpenAI has many positive use cases, such as answering student questions, creating natural language interfaces for APIs, and providing basic customer support. However, others pointed out the dangers of relying on AI for important tasks, citing ChatGPT's low accuracy rate in areas like history and the potential for managers to use AI-generated output as if it were expert insight.The article discusses the possibility of OpenAI being acquired or going public in the future, although it is unlikely in the near term. The company was initially a non-profit but has since partnered with Microsoft and distributed equity to its employees. Sam Altman, the former CEO of OpenAI, did not take any equity in the company, which has raised questions about his motivations. Some commenters have compared Altman to FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried, who was widely covered in the media for his altruism but was later discovered to have a monetary incentive in his company's success. However, Altman's lack of equity means that he does not have a direct monetary incentive in OpenAI's success. The article also notes that OpenAI, with its access to vast amounts of data and resources, is a potential threat to smaller startups attempting to compete in the AI space.Elon Musk's decision to donate $100 million to OpenAI and not take an equity stake in the company was discussed on Hacker News. Some speculated on whether Musk had a secret plan for getting rich or if it was a mistake. Others pointed out that board memberships are more powerful than shares, suggesting that giving up board membership would be a better indication that Sam Altman, who did not take an equity stake, is not interested in money or power. Some also discussed the behavior of Musk and Bill Gates, with opinions varying on whether they were admirable or ruthless in their pursuit of wealth and power.",
        "summary": "- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman did not take an equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI LP, as he wanted to stay aligned with the non-profit entity's original mission.\n- The ethical implications of following the law versus personal ethics are debated, especially in light of OpenAI's move towards for-profit work and ownership by major investors such as Microsoft and Peter Thiel.\n- OpenAI's access to vast data and resources poses a potential threat to smaller AI startups attempting to compete.\n- Some speculated on Elon Musk's donation of $100 million to OpenAI and not taking an equity stake, while others discussed the behavior of Musk and Bill Gates in their pursuit of wealth and power."

Barbados won 4-2 in extra time. In the last minutes of regular time, both teams attempted to score own goals. The result has been described as \"one of the strangest matches ever\".[1][2]\nIn the 1994 Caribbean Cup, the tournament organisers implemented a variant of the golden goal rule:  the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados needed to win the match by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament over Grenada. Barbados led the game 2-0 until Grenada scored at the 83rd minute, bringing the score to 2-1. Barbados then deliberately scored an own goal, tying the game at 2-2, to force extra-time so that they could take advantage of the golden goal rule to achieve their needed two-goal margin.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada tried to score in both goals. Either outcome (3\u20132 on points, or 2\u20133 via goal difference) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, forcing extra-time. Barbados then scored the golden goal to win the match.\nThe outcome of the match was criticised by Grenadian coach James Clarkson, who felt that his team had been unfairly prevented from advancing to the finals.  However, given the fact that the unusual tournament rules had not been broken, FIFA cleared Barbados of any wrongdoing.\n\n\nBackground[edit]\nFurther information: 1994 Caribbean Cup\nThe 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organisers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0\u20131 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2\u20130 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals.\nBefore the match the standings were as follows:\n\n\n\nTeam\n\nPld\n\nW\n\nL\n\nGF\n\nGA\n\nGD\n\nPts\n\n\n\u00a0Grenada\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n0\n+2\n3\n\n\n\u00a0Puerto Rico\n\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\u22121\n3\n\n\n\u00a0Barbados\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\u22121\n0\n\n\n\nJanuary\u00a023,\u00a01994\u00a0(1994-01-23)\nBarbados\u00a00\u20131\u00a0Puerto Rico\n\n\n\nBarbados National Stadium, Saint Michael\n\n\nJanuary\u00a025,\u00a01994\u00a0(1994-01-25)\nGrenada\u00a02\u20130 (a.e.t.)\u00a0Puerto Rico\n\n\n\nGrenada National Stadium, St. George's\nMatch[edit]\nThe match was played at the Barbados National Stadium in Saint Michael.[2]\nThe match started off routinely and Barbados scored the first two goals, establishing the two-goal winning margin they required: in the 83rd minute, the game changed when Grenada scored a goal, which would take Grenada through to the finals unless Barbados could score again.\nBarbados attempted to score for the next few minutes, but as time ran out they switched to a different strategy: tying the game so they could attempt to achieve the two-goal margin with the golden goal in extra-time. In the 87th minute, they stopped attacking, with Barbados defender Terry Sealey and goalkeeper Horace Stoute passing the ball between each other before Sealey intentionally scored an own goal to tie the game at 2\u20132.\nWith just three minutes of normal time left, the Grenadian players caught on to the Barbadians' plan, and realised that they would advance in the tournament by scoring a goal in either net, since they would still qualify for the finals with a 1-goal loss. This saw normal time finish in a highly unusual manner, with Grenada trying to score a goal in  (and Barbados trying to defend) both nets. For the next three minutes, Barbadian players successfully defended both sides.\nAs 90 minutes had expired with the score at 2\u20132, the game went on to extra time, where the winning \"golden goal\" would count double \u2014 thus, Barbados only had to score once to qualify for the 1994 Caribbean Cup. Trevor Thorne scored the winning goal for Barbados to advance to the next round with a score of 4\u20132.[2]\nThe final table was:\n\n\n\nTeam\n\nPld\n\nW\n\nL\n\nGF\n\nGA\n\nGD\n\nPts\n\n\n\u00a0Barbados\n\n2\n1\n1\n4\n3\n+1\n3\n\n\n\u00a0Grenada\n\n2\n1\n1\n4\n4\n0\n3\n\n\n\u00a0Puerto Rico\n\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\u22121\n3\n\n\nResponse[edit]\nThe game did not receive much attention, although reports were published in the United Kingdom in The Guardian[5] and The Times.[6] The story has since been told in the 2005 book Sports Law.[2] The lack of immediate attention to the subject may have contributed to the game becoming something of an urban legend in the sport.[1]\nIn a press conference after the game, Grenadian manager James Clarkson said:\n\nI feel cheated. The person who came up with these rules must be a candidate for a madhouse.... The game should never be played with so many players running around the field confused. Our players did not even know which direction to attack: our goal or their goal. I have never seen this happen before. In football, you are supposed to score against the opponents to win, not for them.[2]\nThe double golden goal rule was used five times over the course of qualification in 1994, and the Caribbean Cup organisers scrapped the rule after the tournament.[3]  Although the Barbadians' own-goal was highly unconventional, FIFA decided not to penalise the team because they were playing optimally under the circumstances.[7]\n\nPost-match[edit]\nBarbados went on to achieve third place in Group A of the 1994 Caribbean Cup after drawing against Guadeloupe and Dominica and losing to the home team Trinidad and Tobago, which went on to win the tournament.[3]\n\n\n\nTeam\n\nPld\n\nW\n\nD\n\nL\n\nGF\n\nGA\n\nGD\n\nPts\n\n\n\u00a0Trinidad and Tobago\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n7\n0\n+7\n7\n\n\n\u00a0Guadeloupe\n\n3\n1\n2\n0\n7\n2\n+5\n5\n\n\n\u00a0Barbados\n\n3\n0\n2\n1\n3\n5\n\u22122\n2\n\n\n\u00a0Dominica\n\n3\n0\n1\n2\n1\n11\n\u221210\n1\n\n\n\nApril\u00a07,\u00a01994\u00a0(1994-04-07)\nBarbados\u00a01\u20131\u00a0Dominica\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril\u00a09,\u00a01994\u00a0(1994-04-09)\nTrinidad and Tobago\u00a02\u20130\u00a0Barbados\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril\u00a011,\u00a01994\u00a0(1994-04-11)\nGuadeloupe\u00a02\u20132\u00a0Barbados\n\n\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nDisgrace of Gij\u00f3n, where a 1982 World Cup game between West Germany and Austria was played out as a mutually agreeable 1\u20130 win to West Germany as this result ensured both teams qualified for the next round.\nThailand 3\u20132 Indonesia, where an Indonesian defender deliberately scored an own goal so his team did not have to face the host Vietnam in the semi-finals of the 1998 Tiger Cup.\nAS Adema 149\u20130 SO l'Emyrne, where SO l'Emyrne players deliberately scored 149 own goals in protest of refereeing decisions that had gone against them in the previous match.\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Who are the greatest runners up?\".

Their approach to running Wasm outside of the browser is to transplant relevant parts of the web platform onto the server, and run Wasm within this browser-like context.\nThe other side sees Wasm as a CPU-independent bytecode, for which the browser is just one use case. Their approach is to standardize a syscall-like interface (WASI), akin to the one an operating system provides to native code.\nThe source of the rift is that Wasm doesn\u2019t specify a particular interface with the outside world, by design. While Wasm itself is portable across platforms, it\u2019s only really useful when paired with such an interface.\nAlthough both sides generally imagine the industry converging on common standards so that code is interoperable between platforms, they are pulling towards fundamentally incompatible visions of what those common standards should look like.\nThe Web Platform Side\nCompilers that produce browser-ready Wasm generate (at least) two files: the Wasm module itself, and a JavaScript shim. The JavaScript shim implements a bespoke ABI that exposes any relevant browser APIs to the module.\n\nPlatforms that run Wasm outside of the browser piggyback on this compiler infrastructure by running the Wasm module inside a JavaScript runtime, typically V8. They can either mock existing browser APIs, or create their own interfaces that are compatible with the JavaScript shim generator.\nThis is how Cloudflare supports Rust, for example. It\u2019s also advocated for by AssemblyScript, one of the most popular Wasm-targeting languages.\nInteroperability of this approach between runtimes depends on the underlying JavaScript APIs being interoperable. For example, a Wasm module is only cross-compatible between Node.js and Deno to the extent that the JavaScript APIs it calls (via the shim) are available on both.\n\nWinterCG is an effort towards cross-runtime interoperability between browsers and non-browser runtimes. It has the support of a number of vendors including Cloudflare, Deno, Netlify, and Vercel.\nThe ultimate vision here is a world where JS and Wasm code can both be packaged into modules and run isomorphically in the server and in the browser.\nThe upside of this approach is that if a platform already supports JavaScript, it can support Wasm without really even knowing: Wasm just becomes an implementation detail of the module.\nThe downside of this approach is that it is inherently tied to JavaScript. JavaScript runtimes are heavyweight compared to Wasm-only runtimes, and doing interop through them requires spending extra CPU cycles casting datatypes into JavaScript values.\nThe WASI Side\nThe main alternative to shipping a JavaScript engine is to use a runtime that implements the WebAssembly Standard Interface (WASI).\nWASI comes from the Bytecode Alliance, an industry group which counts Google, Mozilla, Docker, and Fastly among its members.\nWASI provides a POSIX-inspired (but deliberately non-POSIX) ABI.\n\nCurrently, most WASI calls are thin wrappers around OS syscalls that provide access to stdio, filesystems, the system clock, and random number generation. In the future, WASI\u2019s scope will likely include network sockets and threads.\nDocker creator Solomon Hykes famously tweeted that if WASI was around in 2008, Docker wouldn\u2019t exist.\n \nFour years after that tweet, though, WASI on its own still isn\u2019t powerful enough to do table-stakes things like make an HTTP request.\nTypically, vendors provide their own ABIs to fill such gaps: Fermyon uses wasi-experimental-http; wasmCloud provides an HTTP capability; Fastly defines a Request struct; WasmEdge provides a request API. Lunatic goes a level lower and provides a TCP API.\nThe problem with this state of things is that Wasm code becomes bound to a particular platform, and any language libraries that touch I/O need to be patched or replaced for each one.\nFor all the work that\u2019s gone into making Wasm portable across CPU architectures, we\u2019ve ended up with modules that are not even portable across platform vendors. After all, wasn\u2019t that the selling point of Docker?\nWill the component model save us?\nI\u2019m optimistic about the Wasm component model becoming a forcing function for standardization here: as it matures, vendors will feel pressure to rip out their proprietary ABIs and replace them with components, and as they do, standard component interfaces will emerge.\nThere\u2019s always a risk that the component model will just be a fifteenth competing standard. But I\u2019m hopeful, because the tech looks solid and the industry generally seems willing to embrace it.\nWhere I land\nAs much as I\u2019m broadly in favor of (or at least, resigned to) the web platform becoming a universal operating system of sorts, I\u2019m rooting for the WASI/components side here.\nI don\u2019t think applications should have to pay the JavaScript tax every time they interact with the outside world. But more importantly, it just feels more right.\nCase in point: the Rust crate getrandom is implemented on both the web and WASI. Compare the web platform implementation to the WASI implementation.\n(This is a bit unfair because the former also handles the case of running on Node.js, but also consider that the WASI code can stand on its own whereas the web platform version also needs to generate JavaScript code to run.)\nI\u2019m hopeful that WASI will evolve over time to cover enough of libc that a lot of existing libraries (like database drivers and file loaders) can be compiled to it without major rewrites. If this happens, those proprietary ABIs can be torn down like scaffolding on a completed cathedral.\n\nMe elsewhere\n\nI talked to Jack Bridger on Scaling DevTools about how we started the Browsertech meetups and this digest, among other things.\nI spoke at Real World React about why multiplayer apps don\u2019t have to be hard.\n\nUntil next time,\n\u2013 Paul\n\n\n\n                    \n                        You just read issue #17 of\n                        Browsertech Digest.\n                    \n\n                    \n                        You can also browse the full archives\n                        of this newsletter.\n                    \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Find Browsertech Digest elsewhere:\n                    \n                        \n                            \n    GitHub\nTwitter\nYouTube\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That means classic games like Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2013 Dual Destinies or Pok\u00e9mon X & Y will no longer be widely purchasable on the aging hardware, driving a hot discussion about how this ephemeral but beloved medium can be preserved as official access gets more limited. Because unlike movies or books, games require special hardware to play, and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 don't even exist in the physical world at all. Archiving the intangible Fans have been airing their grievances over the closure when it was first announced back in February 2022. In a public statement, Nintendo said the closure comes at the end of their product's \"natural life cycle,\" as the 3DS and Wii U have long been eclipsed by their fast-selling Switch console. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarge this image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The Wii U's storefront, which will soon go offline.\n                \n                    \n                    Nintendo\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Nintendo\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wii U's storefront, which will soon go offline.\n\n            \n            Nintendo\n            \n        \n\n\n\nBut plenty of collectors, content creators, and fans of the DS and 3DS in particular still play its older games. Soon, they won't be able to buy digital versions altogether. The situation is even more dire for smaller indie games or add-ons, which were never released physically, and only existed as purchasable downloads. \n\n\nMeanwhile, hard copies for titles on the even-older Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and the Nintendo DS have soared in price since before the pandemic, with some reaching well beyond the cost of a modern AAA game. Last year, Kinda Funny Gamecast spoke with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer about the importance of preserving video game history. \"I really wish as an industry we'd come together to help preserve the history of what gaming is about so we don't lose the ability to go back,\" he said. Classic Nintendo, PlayStation, and even Xbox games are harder to obtain because of the outmoded technology used to play them. Video games can't be archived the same way film and television are, as older titles require a number of tools to keep them playable over time. This includes emulation \u2014 which imitates the technology a given game operates under. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarge this image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The eShop for the 3DS, a handheld device that prefigured the Switch.\n                \n                    \n                    Nintendo\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Nintendo\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eShop for the 3DS, a handheld device that prefigured the Switch.\n\n            \n            Nintendo\n            \n        \n\n\n\nEmulation and its limitations Independent programmers and aficionados have developed numerous well-crafted emulators to keep us connected to the games of our childhood. Software emulation imitates a console's software, with programs like Dolphin Emulator and Project64 available on most PCs, smartphones, and a burgeoning handheld device market. Even with these upsides, software emulation isn't without its faults. In order to play a game on an emulator, you need a copy of the original title, commonly saved as a ROM (or read-only memory) file. Depending on how the title is copied, what the condition of the cartridge or game disc is in, or the geographic region the game is locked to, you can find yourself with a buggy version of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal or Super Mario Bros. 3 that can hardly run. Creating and distributing ROMs is also fraught with legal issues. \n\n\nHowever, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (or FPGAs) have provided safer, hardware-based solutions. Without getting into the complicated specifics of this technology, FPGAs essentially emulate the old console's actual circuitry, making for more accurate representations of older video games. This technology imitates everything about a console, not just its software. They come at a hefty price though \u2014 one popular handheld that utilizes FPGAs, the Analogue Pocket, launched at $219, but high demand has caused prices to more than double on places like eBay. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarge this image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The Analogue Pocket can play a host of older titles by emulating the hardware of consoles like the Game Boy Advance.\n                \n                    \n                    Analogue\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Analogue\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Analogue Pocket can play a host of older titles by emulating the hardware of consoles like the Game Boy Advance.\n\n            \n            Analogue\n            \n        \n\n\n\nBut there's more to a game than just its code. \"I think the future of game preservation is in making sure we're considering more than the literal games themselves,\" says Kelsey Lewin, co-director of the Video Game History Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to preserving games and teaching their history. Lewin pointed to massively multiplayer RPGs \u2014 where community is essential to the experience \u2014 as an example of games that could never be replicated. \"We might be able to preserve World of Warcraft \u2014 but is a historian coming to it 20 years later really playing World of Warcraft? [...] All games have additional context that could be lost if we're not preserving and telling [their individual] stories now.\" A Completionist's Quest Ahead of the Nintendo eShop closures, one content creator embarked on the daunting task of buying all 866 Wii U games, as well as the 1,547 3DS games made available. Jirard Khalil, host of the YouTube channel The Completionist, said the idea came out of the need to preserve the games soon to be made permanently unavailable. \"The reason why [preservation] is important is because it's about having not just one copy, but as many copies or several copies as possible,\" he said when I asked him about the project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnlarge this image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Phoenix Wright's trademark gesture in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2014 Dual Destinies, a 3DS game that has since been ported to Android and iOS.\n                \n                    \n                    Capcom\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Capcom\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Wright's trademark gesture in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2014 Dual Destinies, a 3DS game that has since been ported to Android and iOS.\n\n            \n            Capcom\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\"And while fans out there and archivists and people online have gone out of their way to download games and make them easy for people to rip and consume and to preserve, there's no legal way for anyone to play these [older] games.\" Khalil said the project ran his team nearly $23,000 and the effort was a glaring reminder that the upcoming eShop closure could have damaging implications. \"Digital is taking over, and so now more than ever, it is becoming so important that you physically go out and buy your games because you never know what's going to happen.\" \n\n\nThough Khalil is frustrated with the upcoming closure, he's happy with the way the project turned out. The Completionist plans to donate all the Wii U and 3DS hardware used and software downloaded to the Video Game History Foundation in an effort to preserve both popular and niche games soon to disappear from Nintendo's digital storefront. Indie titles that have garnered a cult following will bear the brunt most, Khalil believes. \"You have this situation where there are tons of games that are literally not going to exist,\" he expressed. \"They're there for a month or a year and then they disappear forever. And a lot of these developers go defunct and and no one will ever play their game ever again.\" The Nintendo Wii U and 3DS eShops are set to close March 27, leaving fans only a couple of days to grab their favorite games before they may be out of reach.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nIntroducing Kobold\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Kobold\nPosted on March 23, 2023\n\n\nKobold is a crate for creating declarative web UI.\nThe TodoMVC implemented in Kobold weighs about 30kb when gzipped over the wire, out of which the gzipped Wasm blob is under 20kb. There are no tricks there. I haven't replaced the default allocator, nor have I minified the JavaScript (although I probably should).\nThe goal I have set for myself was creating something that works and feels like a yet another JSX-esque library akin to React or Yew, but without the full performance overhead of Virtual DOM.\nAll of it in Rust, of course.\nThe documentation combined with the examples should give you some insight into building things. What I would like to do here instead is lay down some context, explain how I think about this problem space and how Kobold actually works.\nZero-Cost Static HTML\nOn the surface Kobold works exactly like a Virtual-DOM-based library. There are no extra containers to wrap your data in and it does indeed perform the dreaded diffing, however the only thing that ever gets diffed is your data.\nI first started experimenting in December of 2019 with a procedural macro that would eventually become the view! macro in Kobold. I didn't think about components, or data states, event handling, or even rendering lists. All I wanted is something that looked like JSX, but instead of producing Virtual DOM it would produce pre-compiled JavaScript code to manage all the stuff in the DOM that never changes.\nIgnoring components for now, the absolute simplest piece of code we could do with Kobold would look something like this:\nfn hello() -> impl View {\n    view! {\n        <h1>\"Hello world!\"</h1>\n    }\n}\n\nIf you have ever worked with Yew or React this should immediately look familiar. The main difference between Kobold and Yew here is the opaque impl View return type. The View trait definition looks as follows:\n/// Trait that describes types that can be rendered in the DOM.\npub trait View {\n    /// The product should contain a DOM reference to this View and\n    /// any data it needs to update itself.\n    type Product: Mountable;\n\n    /// Build a product that can be mounted in the DOM from this type.\n    fn build(self) -> Self::Product;\n\n    /// Update the product and apply changes to the DOM if necessary.\n    fn update(self, p: &mut Self::Product);\n\n    /// ... skipping some methods here that are auto provided\n}\n\nAny type that implements View needs to know how to build its Product and how to update it on subsequent renders. Said Product will contain a reference to its root DOM element plus any data it might need to diff for updates. The important part is: you never have to write these two methods by hand.\nIf we expand the view! macro our hello function becomes:\nfn hello() -> impl View {\n    #[wasm_bindgen(inline_js = \"<snip>\")]\n    extern \"C\" {\n        fn __e0_dd8ebbc530e4055f() -> web_sys::Node;\n    }\n    Static(__e0_dd8ebbc530e4055f)\n}\n\nI have taken the liberty of formatting the output while also not expanding the #[wasm_bindgen] attribute macro here. The snipped JavaScript is:\nexport function __e0_dd8ebbc530e4055f() {\n    let e0=document.createElement(\"h1\");\n    e0.append(\"Hello world!\");\n    return e0;\n}\n\nThe Static is just a newtype wrapper. Here is its declaration and View implementation:\npub struct Static<F>(pub F);\n\nimpl<F> View for Static<F>\nwhere\n    F: Fn() -> Node,\n{\n    type Product = Element;\n\n    fn build(self) -> Element {\n        Element::new(self.0())\n    }\n\n    fn update(self, _: &mut Element) {}\n}\n\nTwo things of note:\n\nStatic<F> taking function as a generic parameter will have std::mem::size_of::<Static<_>>() == 0. This means that on runtime calling hello() does quite literally nothing, and only hello().build() calls the extern JavaScript function that constructs the <h1> header and gives us the reference to its root element.\nSince there are no expressions here, the update method is also empty, meaning that invoking hello().update(&mut product) also does absolutely nothing at runtime.\n\nHerein lies the crux of the #1 claim that Kobold makes: static HTML is zero-cost. It is created in the precompiled JavaScript with absolute minimum of Wasm-JavaScript boundary crossing necessary (one, exactly) and never updated. There is no diffing, not even a branch to check if diffing is necessary.\nInjecting Expressions\nLet's modify our hello function to render a string slice in the view:\nfn hello(name: &str) -> impl View + '_ {\n    view! {\n        <h1>\"Hello \"{ name }\"!\"</h1>\n    }\n}\n\nThe expression in curly braces like { name } must implement View itself, which &str does. Notably a View only needs to live long enough to be used in either build or update, no 'static lifetime necessary. This avoids a whole bunch of temporary clones on each render.\nThe code this expands to is a bit longer, so let's look at it bit by bit. The important part is:\nfn hello() -> impl View {\n    /// snip!\n\n    struct Transient<A> {\n        a: A,\n    }\n\n    Transient { a: name }\n}\n\nGiven the previous example, you might already see where this is going. The macro defines a new Transient struct with a generic field and it puts the expression in it, in this case just the variable name into that field.\nFor this to work, the macro also has to implement the View trait for this Transient type. It does it like this:\nimpl<A> View for Transient<A>\nwhere\n    A: View,\n{\n    type Product = TransientProduct<A::Product>;\n\n    fn build(self) -> Self::Product {\n        let a = self.a.build();\n        let e0 = Element::new(__e0_22790d91e19a0c42(a.js()));\n\n        TransientProduct { a, e0 }\n    }\n\n    fn update(self, p: &mut Self::Product) {\n        self.a.update(&mut p.a);\n    }\n}\n\nHere is where the magic happens. The build method first builds product of the expression a. The View implementation for &str will just make a Text DOM node and hold an allocated String of the name to check for changes later. Adventurous users could also write { name.fast_diff() } to switch to pointer address diffing, making this view completely allocation-free for its entire life cycle.\nWe then take the &JsValue reference to said text node and call a precompiled __e0_22790d91e19a0c42 JavaScript function with it. Skipping the #[wasm_bindgen] part here is the code:\nexport function __e0_22790d91e19a0c42(a) {\n    let e0=document.createElement(\"h1\");\n    e0.append(\"Hello \",a,\"!\");\n    return e0;\n}\n\nThis is almost identical to the previously generated function, except we append our Text node as variable a between two static text nodes: \"Hello \" and \"!\". Rust only knows about that one Text node containing the name we need to render and the root (<h1> in this case) it needs in order to stick this view into the DOM.\nThe update method is even simpler: call update on all fields of the Transient with their corresponding products. In our case this just defers the update to the View implementation of &str. No other node in the tree is ever touched: it is zero-cost.\nThe TransientProduct struct is rather dull so I am not going to explain it here in detail. Suffice to say it just holds all the products for all the expressions, the root Element, and potentially few other hoisted elements that need to have their attributes operated on directly.\nZero-Cost Components\n\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n\nIn Kobold there is only one sanctioned way to create components: by turning plain functions into functional components. This involves:\n\nChanging the name to follow PascalCase scheme, just like Rust structs.\nAnnotating it with the #[component] attribute macro.\n\nTaking our hello example from above and turning it into a component is as simple as:\n#[component]\nfn Hello(name: &str) -> impl View + '_ {\n    view! {\n        <h1>\"Hello \"{name}\"!\"</h1>\n    }\n}\n\nThe only difference between that component and a plain Rust function is how you would invoke them in the view! macro:\nview! {\n    // the `Hello` functional component:\n    <Hello name=\"World\" />\n\n    // the `hello` function:\n    { hello(\"World\") }\n}\n\nThe actual interaction between the view! and the #[component] macros is unstable so I wouldn't advise writing component structs by hand. That said, currently <Hello name=\"World\" /> simply desugars into:\nHello::render(Hello { name: \"World\" })\n\nThe function becomes an associated render function on a struct with fields mapping to the original parameters. While this looks more complicated than hello(\"World\"), it has no performance overhead compared to a regular function call. The only purpose components serve is the familiar syntax with named parameters.\nOff the Hook!\nAstute readers by now are surely wondering how stateful components work. Here is the kicker:\nKobold does not have a concept of a stateful component. The view rendering part is relatively unopinionated about state management. It is entirely feasible to implement React-esque hooks like in Yew or Dioxus as a 3rd-party crate. Reactive signals like in Sycamore or Leptops should also interact nicely with the View trait.\nThe state management provided by Kobold is in a very real sense optional, you can even opt out of it completely by disabling default features. Assuming you haven't here is an example:\nstateful(0, |count| {\n    bind! { count:\n        let inc = move |_| *count += 1;\n        let dec = move |_| *count -= 1;\n    }\n\n    view! {\n        <p>\"Counter is at \"{ count }</p>\n        <button onclick={inc}>\"Increment\"</button>\n        <button onclick={dec}>\"Decrement\"</button>\n    }\n})\n\nThis creates a stateful view. In this case the state is just a simple i32 integer. The count argument passed into the closure is of type &Hook<i32> (not related to React hooks, I just like the name). You can read the state from the hook simply by dereferencing it. It itself also implements the View trait so we can just use it directly without having to write { **count }.\nThe bind! macro creates event-handling closures that can mutate the state via a simple &mut i32 reference. If the macro looks a bit too magical for you, you can always choose to write binds the long way via Hook::bind:\nlet inc = count.bind(move |count, _| *count += 1);\nlet dec = count.bind(move |count, _| *count -= 1);\n\nThese are currently 100% equivalent, the macro just saves you from having to type \"count\" 4 extra times.\nWithout having to repeat much of the documentation what happens here is pretty straight-forward: Clicking the button updates the state of the integer. The main closure is being run on every state change, the count is diffed with the old one and its DOM Text node is updated if necessary.\nI personally quite like this model for its simplicity. While I have yet to push it to the point where it becomes really unwieldy, I can imagine that a more robust solution might be necessary for sufficiently complex applications.\nGoing Forward\nFor now Kobold is a complete minimum viable product. I reckon the View trait, the view! macro, and the #[component] attribute macro are reasonably stable by now. The next steps would be:\n\nFinishing support for default values in components.\nSupport for keyed lists, so that we can actually do proper apples-to-apples benchmarks.\nPossibly a PR to Trunk with an option to bundle all the JavaScript files from wasm-bindgen without resorting to extra tools like esbuild.\n\nIf you have come this far, thank you! Check out the repo or this neat little QR code example using the fast_qr-based kobold_qr. After all, one of my main motivations for doing this was pulling in complex code like QR code generation and have it work instantly in the browser.\nLast, but not least...\nWhy \"Kobold\"?\nBecause I am in fact a colossal nerd and Kobolds are familiar, clever, and small.\n\n\n\nHi, I'm Maciej\nIPA: /\u00cb\u0088ma.t\u00cd\u00a1\u00c9\u0095\u00c9\u009bj/\n\nI write code.\nHere I write about writing code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It most recently grabbed headlines for hammering the business empire of India\u2019s Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, but you may also remember it from previous hits such as hydrogen-powered-truck outfit Nikola (whose CEO Trevor Milton ended up being convicted of fraud) and health-tech startup Clover Health (resulting in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and investor lawsuit).Now Hindenburg has turned its attention to Dorsey\u2019s Block, shares in which dropped as much as 22% on\u00a0the report\u2019s release, before partially recovering. Hindenburg said it had been investigating Block for two years, and accused it of:- Misleading investors by overstating its genuine user counts, with former employees estimating as much as three quarters are \u201cfake, involved in fraud, or\u2026additional accounts tied to a single individual.\u201d- Failing to ban fraudsters from using its platform (eyebrow-lifting line: \u201cThis phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip hop songs.\u201d)- Acting as a regular conduit for fraudulent COVID payments due to lax compliance, despite \u201cinternal employee concerns, along with warnings from the Secret Service, the U.S. Department of Labor OIG, FinCEN, and State Regulators.\u201d (Again, references are made to rapper braggadocio.)- Allowing its Cash App platform to be used for paying contract killers, drug dealers, and sex traffickers, and suppressing internal concerns about this. (More hip hop\u2014seriously, Hindenburg made a compilation video.)- Allowing fake accounts for people claiming to be Dorsey, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump.Story continues- Possibly being under investigation by the SEC for bypassing legally-capped interchange fees and \u201cgouging merchants with elevated fees\u201d (rival PayPal is under investigation for the same). The SEC refused to comment on this one, per its standard policy.- Hyping \u201cmundane or predatory sources of revenue as technological breakthroughs.\u201dBlock had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The allegations come the day after the company released its\u00a02022 corporate social responsibility report, which trilled about advancing Block\u2019s \u201cpurpose of economic empowerment\u201d by providing \u201clending solutions that improve access to credit for historically underserved groups.\u201d Hindenburg says the firm really just \u201cembraced\u201d criminals.The ethics of outfits like Hindenburg are certainly up for debate, and these Block allegations are yet to be proven, but the short-seller has a good reputation for doing its homework. For Silicon Valley, this is Hindenburg\u2019s biggest hit yet, and it could prove explosive.Want to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop me a line\u00a0here.David MeyerData Sheet\u2019s daily news section was written and curated by Andrea Guzman.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%\u2014and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home \nAdvertisementTRENDING 1.

However, the implementation might not be what you imagine.\nA common pattern for doing light/dark mode is to use CSS custom properties for color values, then override the colors when the user agent is in dark mode.\nAs an example, here\u2019s a common way to set the background color of a website based on the user\u2019s preference:\n:root {\n  --color-bg: #fff;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root {\n    --color-bg: #000;\n  }\n}\n\nhtml {\n  background-color: var(--color-bg);\n}\n\nOn my blog, I\u2019m not doing this. I\u2019m not controlling the background color at all. There\u2019s no variable in CSS for my site\u2019s background color.\nInstead, I am letting the browser dictate what the background color of the document is. This is done by using color-scheme: light dark, something I\u2019ve touched on previously:\n\n[color-scheme] changes the default text and background colors of the page to match the current system appearance. Standard form controls, scroll bars, and other named system colors also change their look automatically.\n\nIf your CSS says you support light and dark color modes but you don\u2019t explicitly set a background-color on the document in each mode, the browser will set one for you. That means all I need to get dark text on a light background (light mode) and light text on a dark background (dark mode) is this:\n:root {\n  color-scheme: light dark;\n}\n\nThis is what I\u2019m doing on my blog. I don\u2019t have to pick or define any colors. The user agent stylesheet is handling all the details. As such, users get a palette that more closely mimics their experience with other native apps in their operating system.\nFor example, without any hard-coded color values, my blog in Safari uses the same \u201csystem\u201d shade of black as the Messages app on macOS.\n\nIn addition to the benefit of getting an experience that feels more closely native to the end user\u2019s experience within their environment, not having to choose a black and a white, set them as variables, and then use them in multiple places saves me some lines of code and cognitive overhead. \nThe Problem\nI started implementing a dropdown of sorts for my navigation. And, since I\u2019m not explicitly setting the background color of elements, I ran into the problem where my dropdown\u2019s background is\u2014by default\u2014transparent.\n\nHow to fix that? Traditionally you would set the dropdown\u2019s background color to the same color you\u2019re setting on the html or body element. But what if, as I described above, you\u2019re not setting an explicit background color? \nIn my case, the browser is setting the background color for me. And that color varies between browsers and operating systems. For example, Chrome and Safari (on macOS) set different \u201cblacks\u201d for dark mode.\n\nWhat I need is a way to say \u201chey browser, for my dropdown, use the same black (or white if in light mode) that you\u2019re using for the background color of the document\u201d. I need access to a variable of sorts that references the exact \u201cblack\u201d the browser is using.\nThe Solution\nI found this wonderful article by Thomas Steiner which introduced me to the concept of CSS system colors.\n\n CSS has standardized semantic system colors. They are specified in CSS Color Module Level 4. For example, Canvas (not to be confused with the <canvas> tag) is for the background of application content or documents, whereas CanvasText is for text in application content or documents.\n\nEureka!\nWhereas hard-coding a background color value for the dropdown  could result in a color mismatch depending on the end user\u2019s browser or OS:\n\nThe CSS system color Canvas gave me exactly what I wanted: access to a named color value I can use in my own CSS that points to the same color value the browser is leveraging. I can now do this:\n:root {\n  color-scheme: light dark;\n}\n\n.dropdown {\n  background-color: Canvas;\n}\n\nMy document and dropdown background colors now match!\n\nA Little More on System Colors\nI knew we had named colors\u2014red, yellow, rebeccapurple\u2014in CSS, but I didn\u2019t know we had system colors. So what are they?\n\nthe <system-color> keywords reflect default color choices made by the user, the browser, or the OS\u2026\nTo maintain legibility, the <system-color> keywords also respond to light mode or dark mode changes.\n\nBrowsers get the chance to set their own defaults, which should conform to accessibility standards and will reflect the taste and sensibilities of the authors. But user overrides of those preferences take precedence:\n\nWhen the values of <system-color> keywords come from the browser, (as opposed to being OS defaults or user choices) the browser should ensure that matching foreground/background pairs have a minimum of WCAG AA contrast. However, user preferences (for higher or lower contrast), whether set as a browser preference, a user stylesheet, or by altering the OS defaults, must take precedence over this requirement.\n\nAs stylesheet authors, we can use these named system colors in our CSS. However, the spec notes we should remember to use them in pairs, as cross-matching colors provides no guarantee over accessibility guidelines:\n\nAuthors may also use these keywords at any time, but should be careful to use the colors in matching background-foreground pairs to ensure appropriate contrast, as any particular contrast relationship across non-matching pairs (e.g. Canvas and ButtonText) is not guaranteed.\n\nAs a quick example, here\u2019s a screenshot of some system colors defined in the spec:\n\nOh, and one last tidbit of information while we\u2019re on the subject. There\u2019s a whole list of deprecated CSS system color names including names like ActiveBorder, InactiveCaptionText, and ThreeDDarkShadow which we used to be able to access.\n\nThese color keywords have been deprecated, however, as they are insufficient for their original purpose (making website elements look like their native OS counterparts), represent a security risk by making it easier for a webpage to \u201cspoof\u201d a native OS dialog, and increase fingerprinting surface, compromising user privacy.\n\nFascinating!\nUpdate 2021-06-11\nFolks have mentioned the lack of cross-browser support for this feature. It\u2019s true, this won\u2019t work perfectly (at the time of this writing) across all modern browsers.\nIn my initial implementation, if Canvas wasn\u2019t supported you\u2019d get a nice big white dropdown in dark mode\u2014looking at you Safari on iOS.\nI was fine with this, as it doesn\u2019t actually break anything. Where it\u2019s supported, things look great! Where it\u2019s not (yet) supported, things looks not as great but still function.\nBut that 2000\u2019s era web developer in me couldn\u2019t let go of trying to make it more uniform across browsers.\nWith a little extra CSS, you can detect support for system colors and use them accordingly. Granted, part of the entire rationale behind this approach (as I mention above) is to be able to take a \u201chands-off\u201d approach to declaring colors yourself. However, if you want to go the extra mile something like this could get you started:\n/* First, declare your dark mode colors */\n:root {\n  --c-bg: #fff;\n  --c-text: #000;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root {\n    --c-bg: #000;\n    --c-text: #fff;\n  }\n}\n\n/* For browsers that don\u2019t support `color-scheme` and therefore\n   don't handle system dark mode for you automatically \n   (Firefox), handle it for them. */\n@supports not (color-scheme: light dark) {\n  html {\n    background: var(--c-bg);\n    color: var(--c-text);\n  }\n}\n\n/* For browsers that support automatic dark/light mode\n   As well as system colors, set those */\n@supports (color-scheme: light dark)\n  and (background-color: Canvas)\n  and (color: CanvasText) {\n  :root {\n    --c-bg: Canvas;\n    --c-text: CanvasText;\n  }\n}\n\n/* For Safari on iOS. Hacky, but it works. */\n@supports (background-color: -apple-system-control-background)\n  and (color: text) {\n  :root {\n    --c-bg: -apple-system-control-background;\n    --c-text: text;\n  }\n}\n\nA couple little notes I found while digging on this cross-browser approach:\n\nSafari says it supports Canvas, which it does on macOS but then doesn\u2019t on iOS. I\u2019m guessing this is a bug. To get around this, we can leverage webkit-specific color values (the same ones used in the UA stylesheet).\nFirefox says it supports CSS system colors like Canvas but then doesn\u2019t support the color-scheme property. So we handle it as a special case.\n\n\nNone of the above is perfect or a comprehensive solution. It\u2019s what I\u2019m using right now to accomplish the system-like style I have on my blog. It will change and evolve as browser support does. So, like all implicit disclaimers on a technical blog post, check this post\u2019s date and consider further testing before your own implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n        Reply via:\n        \n        Email, Twitter,\n        Mastodon\n\n\n          Tagged in:\n          #css, #theMoreYouKnow\n\n\n            Related posts linking here:\n            Inspecting Web Views in macOS, Theme Color in CSS, Things I Learned Reading Webkit\u2019s UA Stylesheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "The recent investor meltdown surrounding Silicon Valley Bank has brought into question the role of venture capitalists in society. When faced with the choice between remaining calm or pulling their money out, a group of very powerful, very wealthy individuals chose the latter, contributing to a bank run. The venture capitalist's dilemma can be likened to the prisoner's dilemma in game theory, where two prisoners are offered a bargain if they betray the other. We are coming to a point where people are realizing that despite hundreds of billions of dollars being deployed each year by venture capital firms in pursuit of \u201cinnovation,\u201d the world does not feel better off for it. Alternative models are needed to prioritize the interests of people.The author of this article argues that venture capitalists are not good for society, no matter how successful their investments are. They point out that only 1 out of every 10 investments succeeds and those that do succeed are often hoping for the next Google or Facebook. The author argues that anyone could be just as successful throwing darts to decide which companies to invest in. They suggest that greater scrutiny and regulation should be implemented, with restrictions for investing from public entities and pension funds, and required audits for companies with over $10 million in revenue. The author hopes that venture capitalists who criticized them before will someday realize that they were right. The comments on the article discuss the need for democratic control over companies and the challenges that come with that.discussion about improving democracy to be effective. It's also important to remember that the ruling class will always have power and create rules that benefit them, regardless of the system in place. Democracy and capitalism may be the best we have at the moment, but they still have flaws and do not eliminate the accumulation of power by the wealthy. It's naive to expect individuals to give up power for social-positive goals, but history has shown examples of societies with more long-term thinking and a focus on progress for future generations. VCs, like bankers, lawyers, agents, and unions, are crucial in a competitive society where companies compete for capital and resources, and custom inside deals are the normalized way to win.The recent near collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) highlights the risks of the bank\u2019s strategy of lending to startup companies, says Molly Jane Zuckerman in a piece for Coin Telegraph. The lender had clients who failed to return their debts due to the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving many investors unable to withdraw their funds. While some show sympathy for the VCs and their perceived plight, Zuckerman argues that they are anything but victims, highlighting how the investment structure of the venture capital system\u00a0rewards a small group of individuals hugely\u00a0at a punishing\u00a0cost to others. She adds that venture capitalists are not inherently good for society, despite the undoubted value of entrepreneurship and startup creation.\u00a0\nThe article discusses the recent bank run on Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, fueled by rumors of their involvement with unstable cryptocurrency companies, and the subsequent bailout by the Federal Reserve. The author argues that the behavior of wealthy individuals and companies like Facebook and Google, as well as billionaires like Bill Gates and Elon Musk, only underscores the need to prevent individuals from accumulating too much wealth and power. The author also criticizes the hypocrisy of individuals who proclaim to be libertarian but demand government bailouts in times of crisis. The overall sentiment is that the current system benefits the wealthy elites at the expense of the average individual, and a more equitable and just system is needed.Founders, not VCs, made the decisions about where their companies kept their cash and were the ones who panicked and started discussions of moving their money out of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which was eventually acquired by the FDIC.

ARI makes it possible for our subscribers to handle certificate revocation and renewal as easily and automatically as the process of getting a certificate in the first place.\nWith ARI, Let\u2019s Encrypt can signal to ACME clients when they should renew certificates. In the normal case of a certificate with a 90 day lifetime, ARI might signal for renewal at 60 days. If Let\u2019s Encrypted needs to revoke a certificate for some reason, ARI can signal that renewal needs to happen prior to the revocation. This means that even in extenuating circumstances, renewal can happen in an entirely automated way without disrupting subscriber services.\nWithout ARI, an unexpected revocation event might mean that Let\u2019s Encrypt would have to send emails to affected subscribers, maybe those emails are read in time to avoid a service disruption, maybe they aren\u2019t, and engineers have to manually take action to trigger early renewals, possibly in the middle of the night. We can\u2019t wait for ARI to make this scenario a thing of the past.\nARI has a couple of additional benefits for Let\u2019s Encrypt and our subscribers. First, we can use ARI to help modulate renewals as needed to avoid load spikes on the Let\u2019s Encrypt infrastructure (of course subscribers can still renew whenever they want or need, as ARI is merely a signal or suggestion). Second, ARI can be used to set subscribers up for success in terms of ideal renewal times in the event that Let\u2019s Encrypt offers even shorter-lived certificates in the future.\nARI has been standardized in the IETF, a process that started with an email from Let\u2019s Encrypt engineer Roland Shoemaker in March of 2020. In September of 2021 Let\u2019s Encrypt engineer Aaron Gable submitted the first draft to the IETF\u2019s ACME working group, and now ARI is in production. The next step is for ACME clients to start supporting ARI, a process we plan to help with as best we can in the coming months.\nARI is a huge step forward for agility and resiliency in the TLS certificate ecosystem and we\u2019re excited to see it gain widespread adoption!\nSupporting Let\u2019s Encrypt\nAs a project of the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), 100% of our funding comes from contributions from our community of users and supporters.

Image: DCOThere is a vast biosphere deep underground that is nearly twice as big as Earth\u2019s oceans and contains some 23 billion tons of organisms.This \u201csubterranean Galapagos\u201d was described on Monday by the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), a collaboration between 1,000 scientists studying \u201cdeep Earth\u201d ecosystems, to kick off the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual meeting this week. According to researchers, knowing how organisms survive in the extreme conditions below Earth\u2019s surface will help us understand the origins and evolution of life on our planet\u2014and perhaps others.Advertisement\u201cA decade ago, we had no idea that the rocks beneath our feet could be so vastly inhabited,\u201d Isabelle Daniel, a mineralogist at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 in France, said in a statement. \u201cThis is simply fascinating and will surely foster enthusiasm to look for the biotic-abiotic fringe on Earth and elsewhere.\u201dThese \u201cintraterrestrials\u201d are microbes that can live miles beneath land and seafloor habitats. Though an estimated 70 percent of all bacteria and archaea on Earth live in this subsurface environment, very little is known about them because their habitats are so difficult for humans to access.The DCO sampled hundreds of deep Earth habitats, sometimes drilling boreholes three miles deep to reach them. Millions of microbe species are estimated to occupy this biosphere, and some are able to survive boiling temperatures or pressures 400 times those at sea level. Many organisms take much more time to grow and reproduce compared to their counterparts on land because they subsist on fewer nutrients.Archaea collected from under German hot springs. Image: DCOSpecies highlighted by the team include a nematode found a mile underground in the Kopanang gold mine of South Africa, a methane-breathing microbe discovered in a mile-deep borehole on the Pacific Ocean seafloor, and an archaea species in a sulfur-rich sample taken 100 feet below a hot spring in Germany.It\u2019s mind-boggling to imagine such a diverse biosphere existing beneath the ground we tread on, and it could have major implications for speculating about alien life on other worlds.Read More: There's an Ocean Deep Inside the Earth\u201cEven in dark and energetically challenging conditions, intraterrestrial ecosystems have uniquely evolved and persisted over millions of years,\u201d said Fumio Inagaki, a geomicrobiologist at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, in a DCO statement.\u201cExpanding our knowledge of deep life will inspire new insights into planetary habitability, leading us to understand why life emerged on our planet and whether life persists in the Martian subsurface and other celestial bodies.\u201dGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.Tagged:deepsubterraneanDeep Carbon Observatorybiospheremicrobearchaeabacteriagold mineshot springsseafloorALIENSextremophilesextraterrestrialsMarsLife on Mars?MotherboardTechORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement\u00a9 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "The glibc malloc memory allocator is the focus of this article, which reviews its history, system calls, threading support, arenas, and multiple heaps. The article focuses on the per thread arena, where each thread maintains a separate heap segment and freelist data structures, and touches on multiple arenas, where multiple threads share arenas, and multiple heaps, which can accommodate larger blocks of memory than a single heap. The article explains how the per thread arena approach helps enhance memory allocator performance and thus improve application performance, as well as how understanding the different types of chunks that can be found inside heap segments provides insight into how memory is managed. Finally, examples illustrate key concepts of how memory is obtained and managed by the glibc malloc memory allocator.The glibc malloc library manages the memory allocation and deallocation in a program. It provides various data structures for holding free chunks of memory, categorized based on their size. Fast bins hold chunks of size 16 to 80 bytes, while unsorted, small, and large bins are used for chunks of size less than 512 bytes, 512 to 131,071 bytes, and larger than 131,072 bytes, respectively. The malloc_chunk has a field that stores information on whether the previous chunk is allocated, mapped, or belongs to a thread arena. When two free chunks are adjacent, they get combined into one single free chunk. Chunks are returned to users based on their requested size, taking into account additional space needed for metadata and alignment. The glibc malloc library faces the challenge of balancing efficiency with external fragmentation.The article provides an in-depth understanding of the glibc malloc implementation in Linux. It explains how malloc uses arenas to manage memory, how chunks of memory are split and coalesced, and how different size classes and bins are used to allocate memory. The article discusses multi-threaded scenarios where different threads use different arenas and explains how this can lead to contention and performance issues. It also explains how mmap is used to allocate large chunks of memory and how they are managed. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive understanding of the internals of glibc malloc and how it works under the hood.The article provides an overview of the ptmalloc implementation of the malloc memory allocation function in the GNU C Library (glibc) on Linux systems. It discusses the structure of the heap, including heap chunks, arenas, and bins. Users can manipulate heap chunks by utilizing various allocation and deallocation functions. There are different bins for different chunk sizes, and chunks can be sorted within a bin for performance optimization. The article also explains how unsorted chunks can be merged to form new chunks, and how free chunks can be consolidated to prevent fragmentation. Lastly, the article discusses how memory allocation works with multi-threaded programs and main arenas.",

        "content": "\n\n\n\nInternet of Skull\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>>Back to Projects<<\n\nInternet of Skull\n\nSometimes projects are born from ideas that sprout and keep growing until you pluck them out and do something with them. A friend mine calls these brain weeds. Other times, projects are born out of need.\nThe Internet of Skull is the latter kind of project.\nI live in a neighborhood with an internet provider of so-so quality. When the service works, it works well, but it goes down more often than it seems like it should for the $75 a month I have to pay for it. The ISP is also notoriously bad at communicating, often only admitting to an outage after the outage has already been fixed.\nIf the internet goes out in the middle of the day and the weather is nice, I will just go outside for a while. Maybe I'll ride my bike or maybe I'll go to the park and read. But if the internet goes down at night or on a rainy day and I'm stuck inside, I find myself sitting around and waiting for the internet to come back on. Last time that happened, I sat there, frustrated and repeatedly refreshing a page in my browser like a rat pressing a lever and hoping for sugar water.\nThen I had a thought. When the power goes out at my house, which also happens more often than it seems like it should, I can tell when the power comes back on because my microwave beeps. It's such a simple cue. Why doesn't something like that exist for my internet?\nI started searching around online for an internet status monitor project I could copy and stumbled on this one by Eli the Computer Guy.\nHis is a simple design. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino Uno connects to his home network and attempts to ping google.com. Since Google's website is pretty reliably online, it can be fairly safely assumed that a successful ping means you have an internet connection, and an unsuccessful ping means you don't. As a simple visual indicator, he wired the Arduino with a red LED and a green LED. Green means there's an internet connection. Red means there's not.\nBill of Materials\n\nArduino Nano 33 IoT\nTwo LEDs of different colors (or a 4-pin RGB LED)\nTwo 50-ohm resistors\n\nI didn't have an Arduino Uno WiFi, but I did have an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, which is also capable of connecting to a Wi-Fi network, so I used that as the basis for this project. I liked Eli's red/green status indicator idea, so I decided to do that as well. Originally I intended to make the project beep when the internet comes back on, but the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if that's what I really wanted. What if the internet goes out at 2 a.m. and comes back at 3:15? Do I want to be awoken for that? Not really, so I dropped the buzzer idea from the project.\nI originally meant to make this as a basic little box, maybe kind of resembling a traffic light, but that seemed boring to me. I was staring at the shelf where the project was going to sit, which is the closest spot in my house to the wireless router and trying to think about what would look good there. That shelf is coincidentally also my shelf of skulls. Then it occurred to me: I really need an internet-connected skull in my life.\nI chose a realistic, but fake cat skull I had in my collection because I felt less bad about gluing stuff to it than I would doing the same to any of my real skulls As an interesting aside, I\u2019ll mention that the skull was 3D printed for me by Tinkerz over on Twitter out of some special filament that is designed to mimic bone on X-rays. It feels kind of like bone as well, or at least it feels more boney than typical 3D prints.\nTo give the project a kind of brain-in-a-jar feel while hiding the Arduino, I stuffed everything inside a security camera housing I found by a homeless camp down in the river bed near my home. To make the skull's \"eyes\" change color, I used a pair of RGB LEDs I dug out of my stuff in the garage and put them inside a pair of round diffusers that came off a dollar-store LED sign. I used all red wiring to make the connections to the LED eyes look like muscle or sinew or nerves, or something biological like that.\n\nWiring\nMy decision to use RGB LEDs came with a small problem that I had to sort out. Eli's project connects the LEDS between two GPIO pins and ground. To turn an LED on, it sets one of those pins to HIGH and current flows from the pin, through the LED to ground. With most RGB LEDs, this would be fine, because they are designed so the red, green, and blue elements (dies) share a ground and have separate positive leads. However, the LEDs I chose were common anode, which means the red, green, and blue dies inside the LED share a positive lead and have separate grounds.\nFortunately there's a pretty simple solution to this. An Arduino's GPIO pins can both source and sink current, meaning they can output a voltage to ground, or they can accept a voltage from the Arduino's power rail. So, to use common-anode LEDs, we just connect their positive lead (the anode) to the Arduino's 3.3V pin and their negative leads (the cathodes) to two GPIO pins. For an explanation of how to wire common-cathode and common-anode LEDS, visit: Physical Computing - Lesson 6: RGB LEDs\n\nThe Code\nIt turned out that Eli's code didn't work quite right in my project. It connected to the internet like it should, and it pinged Google like it should, but when I disconnected my home network from the internet, the Arduino would only indicate a ping failure once before erroneously indicating that it was successfully pinging Google again. It did this even if there was no internet connection. Some folks in the Arduino forums suggested that there are some problems with the WifiNINA, but I never did figure out why the code didn't work the way it was supposed to. My friend Aucoeur Ngo couldn't figure out either, but she helpfully rewrote the code to use a different function of the WiFiNINA library that actually did work correctly. You can get that code from my Github repository or find it pasted below, after the final thoughts section.\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis was a dumb little project that may be kind of useful. The more I think about it, the more I think it needs an audio alarm for when the internet comes back on. Right now, if I decide to read a book or I go in the other room, I won't know if the internet is back without actually looking at the Oracle. A buzzer would let me know without me having to pay active attention, and I could just add a switch to disconnect the buzzer if I don't want it to bother me while I sleep. Or I could just turn the thing on only when I'm having an internet outage. We'll see. It would only take a few lines of code and maybe 10 minutes of soldering.\nI might also change my mind about the color I painted the enclosure. I first painted it a safety yellow color like you might see on industrial equipment but then I repainted with a green hammertone finish. I think I liked the yellow better though, so I might repaint it again.\n\n\n\n\n\n/*This project requires an Arduino Nano 33 IoT.\nArduino sells other Wi-Fi enabled Arduinos that \nmay work, but I've not tested them with this code.\n\nIt was pieced together from some other bits of code, \nmostly by Aucoeur Ngo, who was helpfully helping me\ntroubleshoot why my code wasn't working\nhttps://stine.omg.lol/\n*/\n\n#include \n\n/*wire LEDs to pins 9 and 10 with appropriate resistors.\nThis should be about 40-50 ohms for an Arduino with\n3.3V output on its IO pins*/\n#define googleOnlineLED 10\n#define googleOfflineLED 9\n\n//your wifi credentials go here\nchar ssid[] = \"network name\";\nchar pass[] = \"password\";\n\nint status = WL_IDLE_STATUS;\n\n//put whichever reliable website you want right here\nchar google[] = \"google.com\";\n\nWiFiClient client;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(googleOnlineLED, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(googleOfflineLED, OUTPUT);\n  digitalWrite(googleOnlineLED, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(googleOfflineLED, LOW);\n\n /*all the serial comms stuff can be removed, but it's \n  helpful for troubleshooting*/\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n\n  while (status != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    Serial.print(\"Attempting to connect to Network named: \");\n    Serial.println(ssid);\n    status = WiFi.begin(ssid, pass);\n    delay(10000);\n  }\n\n  Serial.print(\"SSID: \");\n  Serial.println(WiFi.SSID());\n  IPAddress ip = WiFi.localIP();\n  IPAddress gateway = WiFi.gatewayIP();\n  Serial.print(\"IP Address: \");\n  Serial.println(ip);\n  Serial.print(\"Default Gateway: \");\n  Serial.println(gateway);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  Serial.print(\"status before client.stop(): \");\n  Serial.println(client.status());\n\n  client.stop();\n\n  Serial.print(\"status after client.stop(): \");\n  Serial.println(client.status());\n\n  if (client.connect(google, 80)) {\n    Serial.print(\"status inside if client.connect(): \");\n    Serial.println(client.status());\n    Serial.print(\"Google is ONLINE at:  \");\n    Serial.println(client.remoteIP());\n    digitalWrite(googleOnlineLED, LOW);\n    digitalWrite(googleOfflineLED, HIGH);\n  }\n  else {\n    Serial.print(\"status inside else client.connect(): \");\n    Serial.println(client.status());\n    Serial.println(\"Google is OFFLINE\");\n    digitalWrite(googleOnlineLED, HIGH);\n    digitalWrite(googleOfflineLED, LOW);\n  }\n  \n  delay(2000);\n}\n\n\n\n>>Back to Projects<<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hacker News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\n\n\n\nreload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Shark is a language designed to provide the speed and size of Lua, while also offering the familiar syntax of Python and the ability to run in the browser.\nOverall, Shark is a very versatile language that can be used to build web/desktop/mobile applications and games with a single codebase, command line tools and anything you can imagine using pre existing libraries and systems available to python, lua, javascript, java and native code. This includes embedding the tiny shark VM in any java or native project with ease.\nFeatures\n\nFast and lightweight native virtual machine written in C\nSmall package size (50 KB) with minimal dependencies\nCan be used in the browser and compiled to portable ECMAScript code\nIncludes a tiny and portable 2D game framework for small scale game development\nBackwards compatible with Python and Lua libraries and environments by means of targeting them as compilation output\nOfficial Java Virtual Machine implementation of both the VM and 2D game framework\n\nSimple Example\nThis example iterates the command line arguments and displays a greeting for each name it contains:\nimport system.io: printf\n\nfunction main(args)\n    for name in args do\n        printf(\"Hello, %!\", [name])\n\nGetting Started\nTo get started with Shark, read the Shark Handbook in this repo to learn the basics of Shark programming. Then, read the guide file for instructions on using the Shark toolchain to start writing Shark code.\nThis version of Shark is considered stable (green), and major changes will only be made through the Shark Community Process (SCP) proposals.\nThis repository contains the Shark SDK binaries and the full source code for these binaries.

The New York-listed  stock is down by more than 5% over the past 12 months.\n  \n\n      Accenture\u2019s rivals are also trying to trim their costs. Consulting giant KPMG announced in an internal memo last month that it would cut almost 2% of its US workforce as it anticipated waning client demand, according to a Financial Times report. \n  \n\n      McKinsey could also slash as many as 2,000 non-consulting staff in one of its biggest round of layoffs ever, Bloomberg reported last month, citing unnamed sources close to the matter. \n  \n\n      It not just consulting feeling the pinch. Thousands of workers in the tech industry have been laid off in recent months as higher interest rates, inflation and recession fears have led to a pullback in advertising and consumer spending. \n  \n\n      Last week, Facebook-parent Meta said it planned to lay off another 10,000 workers, its second round of significant job cuts in four months. Taken together, the cuts will reduce Meta headcount by about 25%. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd

        "content": "A compilers course is valuable for programmers even if they never plan to write a compiler. Understanding parsers and interpreters is essential as they are used in programming for making programs extensible or dealing with new input files. Knowing how compilers work can also help programmers write correct code and think about programming languages more accurately. It can also lead to writing faster code by understanding which optimizations are and are not in scope for a compiler. Learning about compilers brings together theoretical computer science, computer architecture, and software engineering in a practical way. Even if someone never implements or modifies compilers, understanding each of its parts can be useful.Compilers courses can be useful for programmers, as they teach good programming and engineering practices that can be applied to any project. Despite many people thinking that parsing is the only useful part of a compiler, other parts can also be beneficial, such as code generation and optimization. Compilers also provide an opportunity to learn about formal analysis and soundness, as well as understand how code interfaces with hardware. While some people may not be interested in writing compilers, the techniques taught can be applicable elsewhere, such as date/time parsing, and pipelines can be used at all levels of architecture. Despite this, universities' compilers courses can vary greatly, and there are free online options available.The author did not take a compilers class in college, but later bought the Dragon book to learn about it. However, they were inspired to write a new library and tool instead, which brought them career success. The author now recommends college interns take a compilers course in their senior year, as parsers and interpreters are widely applicable and can help solve problems faster. The author is currently trying out the techniques they learned to write a VM for Lisp.",
