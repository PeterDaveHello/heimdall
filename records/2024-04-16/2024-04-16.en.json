Never understood why this concept didn’t become a whole genre. No actual up, 360 degree freedom, enemies that were smart and could snipe you. Wasted many hours back then and very eager to try this out. reply jaegrqualm 5 hours agoparentNot that you asked, but there's exactly one (popular) game that utilizes the same control scheme in modern times, Outer Wilds. Although it's not a shooter, it's quite a nice adventure game. https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/ There is, however, an outright continuation of the subgenre, in Overload. https://store.steampowered.com/app/448850/Overload/ reply kevin42 5 hours agorootparentOverload was mostly the same people who built Descent (I helped a tiny bit). Those guys are really good. reply tmikaeld 3 hours agorootparentOne of the most polished \"flight\" games in VR too, extremely immersive and perfect controls. reply nier 2 hours agorootparentDid you have trouble with nausea? reply dncornholio 2 hours agorootparentEveryone has nausea initially when using VR. It will go away eventually. You need to train your brain to not feel G forces when you see movement. reply erikbye 2 minutes agorootparentI've owned multiple VR headsets and have many, many hours of VR experience. With seated experiences (vehicles/aircrafts/rollercoasters) I never got nausea, not even initially. The only experiences that made me nauseas were the ones that simulated movement of characters, where pressing a button would move the character and camera forwards. That was just too much of a disconnect. Movement by teleporting was not a problem. It was worst the first few times, and I did not last long before I had to take a break, powering through was not possible. With experience it got better, the nausea/dizzyness was less intense and I could play longer sessions, but it never went away completely. int_19h 1 hour agorootparentprevNot everyone has it even initially; it really varies from person to person. I suspect that to some extent it is influenced by past exposure to fast-paced first-person games (e.g. FPS when played using the mouse). reply ftrobro 55 minutes agorootparentI used to get nausea when playing Doom in the nineties, it never got better. But I never get nausea from fps games with slower movement. I suspect the problem with Doom is how quickly you can change direction while running. You can run quite fast and a 90 degree turn doesn't slow you down at all. reply cyberax 1 hour agorootparentprev> It will go away eventually. No. It can actually get _worse_, as you get more sensitized to VR. The recommendation seems to be to _stop_ using VR if you get motion sick, rather than trying to power through it. reply palata 58 minutes agorootparentNot sure if the two of you are disagreeing or not, so genuinely asking: Could it be that you are both right? As in, you should stop right away when you start getting motion sick, but with time it will get better? Something like: play 15 minutes everyday, stop as soon as you are sick, and after a while you will be able to play 30min, etc. I have no idea, just asking for a friend :-). reply benterix 38 minutes agorootparentThis is interesting for me to, but I'd be surprised to learn someone actually has an authoritative answer. reply palata 18 minutes agorootparentData points would be interesting too. Someone saying \"I used to get sick after 15min, and now I can play for 60min without a problem. I always stop playing right when I start getting sick\". You know, just to see that it has happened to someone :-) cyberax 1 hour agorootparentprevThere also was a nice game called \"Parkan\" (and then Parkan 2), but it's not really well-known outside of Russian-speaking markets. It looks like it's available on Steam now. reply OrwellianChild 4 hours agorootparentprevSuper cheap on GOG right now... https://www.gog.com/en/game/overload reply nier 2 hours agorootparentThere’s this review that stands out: «I am the CEO of Orbital Design Studios, and am the designer behind the canceled \"Descent IV\" project in 2002. This game is a thing I thought I'd never see, aside from prototypes in my company's archives. A very warm welcome back to Matt & Mike and all of the old crew of Parallax and Outrage Entertainment who have returned to create this long dreamed of and hoped for creation. Thank you for putting my regrets that D4 couldn't get made, to rest. Overload will stand for all time in its place.» reply h0l0cube 1 hour agorootparentprevI'm probably in the minority, but I wish Overload kept the Mass Driver from Descent 3. Particularly handy in Monsterball. Glad D3 is in open source now, because the Steam version has broken multiplayer. I'd be glad to have a multiplayer session again one day. reply meekins 3 hours agorootparentprevOverload is awesome! However I wonder if some remnants of 90s game design like tight time limits and repeating enemy ambushes that make the game such a familiar and intense experience for the old school in reality disadvantage the game and the genre from reaching wider audiences. There was also another classic Descent contender, Forsaken, that got remastared in 2018 to run on Linux and macOS in addition to modern Windows platforms. The original game was actually used as a graphics benchmark for early 3d accelerators due to its lighting effects. That said, looking forward to playing Descent 3 on a modern platform! reply pixelpoet 2 hours agorootparentThe Forsaken soundtrack was so good! reply mvdtnz 5 hours agorootparentprevOther than the control scheme Outer Wilds really could not be more different to Descent. reply two_handfuls 4 hours agorootparentYou are correct. It’s an awesome game though. reply Osiris 4 hours agorootparentI tried it and literally couldn’t figure it out. I got like 15 minutes into and had no idea what to do. What makes it so good? reply Zelizz 3 hours agorootparentAs someone who also bounced off it initially - I would recommend getting through the tutorial area and flying out somewhere in the ship before you put it down for good. Once I started going out there and visiting places, it really grabbed me. The more stuff you scan and read, the more intrigued it made me, and eventually I couldn't stop until I'd unraveled every story thread and mystery the game had to offer. reply dudus 4 hours agorootparentprevThe fact the game has no items, no power ups, no levels, no enemies. Just one question: what is going on? And your job is to figure it out. Knowledge is your only way forward. Unfortunately that means the game can only be played once and any spoiler will ruin it for you. reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agorootparentI disagree with \"ruining\", I've resorted to looking up some hints; mind you, in hindsight I would've figured it out myself if I spent a bit more time on it. reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agorootparentprevGet past the tutorial into space, then open up the panel in your spaceship into Rumours mode, showing the equivalent of a madman's red yarn walls; there will always be one item in there that is incomplete. Else, open the map, pick an unexplored planet and go there. There is no wrong way to go. reply easyThrowaway 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's quite intentional on the game part. The best advice I can give you is reach the observatory / museum on your home planet, and from there try randomly exploring the entire solar system (Hint: what's literally the first thing you see when your character open their eyes?). reply likpok 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s all fits together in a very nice way. It’s very much a space archaeology game — if you like exploring the game universe and understanding how it works, you’ll like it, but that exploration is the bulk of what it has going on. reply PetitPrince 1 hour agorootparent> It’s all fits together in a very nice way. This. Everything or at least nearly everything is consistent and logical. The goal of the game is for you to piece out how all the element relates together. reply InvOfSmallC 4 hours agorootparentprevFor me it's how you discover one by one elements of the history of the \"aliens\" and how you use the physics to solve some puzzles. I also love the story. IMHO is one of the best videogames ever made together with Obra Dinn reply vincentpants 4 hours agorootparentprevThe way Outer Wilds rewards curiosity is incredibly novel. More subjectively, I’m quite partial to how the narrative reveals itself. Wish I could relive that experience all over again. reply tankenmate 1 hour agoparentprevI know why it didn't make it as a concept for me; the rendering in the game wasn't quite correct, so I used to get sea sick playing this for more than 30 minutes. And I hardly get sea sick on boats. So I stopped playing it after about a month. reply jbm 2 hours agoparentprevThis entire thread led me down a long, long rabbit hole; I remembered the name \"Descent\", but I couldn't recognize anything about it in the online videos I saw on Youtube. After hours of searching google, I realize that I was actually thinking about Terminal Velocity. Great soundtrack, fun game (although I never finished it). reply sbierwagen 3 hours agoparentprevThere was Shattered Horizon from 2009, a zero g multiplayer shooter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWsHxTFPxSE One fun feature was you could shut off your suit power to go into a stealth mode. This turned off all the HUD elements, and, amusingly enough, turned off most gameplay noises (the explosions and bullets whizzing by) because, in-universe, all those noises are generated by the suit computer, because space is silent! reply gsich 2 hours agoparentprevI think it's called 6dof games. reply dclowd9901 3 hours agoparentprevFreespace was the (un?)official successor. Freespace 2 was incredible and I’d be willing to bet it holds up to this day. Nowadays we have the modern version of Elite Dangerous, but its flight mechanics are too close to aeronautic flight mechanics to compare to Descent. reply mark_undoio 15 minutes agorootparentWhen I bought Free space it was actually titled Descent: Freespace - The Great War. I wish the series had carried on, I really wanted to find out where the confusing plot threads of Freespace 2 went! reply massifist 1 hour agorootparentprevI thought I had gotten this (Descent 3) for free with a graphics card I purchased, but Freespace was what I was thinking of, though it might have been Freespace 2. The graphics card was the Diamond Viper V770, if I recall correctly. Good times! reply telman17 3 hours agorootparentprevWith mods, Freespace and Freespace 2 are still especially awesome. reply Analemma_ 5 hours agoparentprevThere's a weird effect where sometimes one game in a genre will become so iconic that nobody wants to try and make another one, possibly out of fear of seeming like they're ripping it off? It happened to Descent, and I feel like it happened to e.g. Myst as well - everyone was expecting the huge success of Myst to launch a whole genre, and then it just... didn't. reply bostik 3 hours agorootparentMyst may not have launched a genre, but it did establish its own kind of game style. 3D world. Adventure game mechanics, with problems and puzzles - but where progress opens up more puzzles, and where instead of developing the character skills, you develop the story. Slow paced. There have been plenty of games to tap into that style, but not enough or frequently enough to warrant calling them part of a genre. Black Dahlia. The Witness. Talos Principle. In a way, even a visual story like All That Remains of Edith Finch can trace its root to Myst. reply cubefox 2 hours agorootparentI think Myst's innovation was mainly using a first-person perspective with (pre-rendered) scenes of a continuous 3D world. Otherwise it was a point-and-click adventure that arguably didn't reach the heights of some earlier Lucas Arts games. Unfortunately these games went out of fashion because most people want some amount of real-time action in their games. But they still get made occasionally by smaller developers on Steam or Android/iOS. reply theodric 4 hours agorootparentprevForsaken. Similar enough that I'd call it a ripoff. I got the boxed version with the girly calendar. reply Daz1 4 hours agoparentprevHellbender on PC was a good one too reply Skywalker13 4 hours agorootparentTerminal Velocity and Fury3 before it... reply matheusmoreira 2 hours agoparentprevElite Dangerous delivers 6 DOF piloting goodness. https://youtu.be/T2-IHgNYaKA https://old.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/16xi20a/dua... https://youtu.be/9U0KNVQmlcM I miss this game... > Never understood why this concept didn’t become a whole genre. Spaceflight simulators have always been niche, unfortunately. Even more niche than flight simulators. reply Joel_Mckay 5 hours agoparentprevIt certainly helped develop 3D spacial memory, and most people adapted to the game play in a few hours. Probably needed to develop a less-repetitive story-line to keep people engaged... The traps were so cheesy sometimes. =) reply jimbob45 2 hours agoparentprevAquanox fell mostly into the same genre. reply dcanelhas 4 hours agoprevAs a 12 yo I learned about IRC from reading the Descent FAQ and tried setting up IHHD to play over a 14,4k modem. I made levels in DEVIL. Today I'm an engineer and game developer. Thanks for putting Descent out into the world. It had a huge impact on me personally. reply fileeditview 44 minutes agoparentI often think about what you could learn from trying to run games back in the old days. It was a huge motivation to fix some problem to get a game running. Optimizing the memory in ms-dos because the game needed more etc. Most often getting a game was a journey on its own. Today kids just have 1 gazillion games on their phone. There is no more connection to the system beneath. No work or effort needed. Just download and play the next best thing. I think this generation is missing out. reply Lammy 4 hours agoprev> Someone recently asked if the source code from Descent 3 will be released. For reference: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40009248 Very cool — thank you! reply hd4 1 hour agoprevWhat did it take behind the scenes to get this approved? Can you go into some of the decision-making? This is nice but a far too rare event these days. reply winrid 5 hours agoprevNice! I sent this to the guy that helped me convert NetPanzer (20+yo code base) from SCons to Meson and he also took the time to setup GH actions etc. Hopefully you get some help! reply throwup238 5 hours agoprevIf this was Interplay, any chance someone might have Hardwar's [1] source code? Total long shot, but I thought I'd ask. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwar_(video_game) reply kevin42 5 hours agoparentWe didn't have any interaction with that team. Interplay was just the publisher, the developer was outrage Entertainment in Ann Arbor Michigan. This is back when 10 programmers seemed like a pretty big team for a game. reply tanepiper 4 hours agoparentprevI'd love to see this - Hardwar was such a fun game and amazing sound track. reply readyplayernull 5 hours agoprevI heard many people loved Descent and it looked great to me, it even seemed like a mix between X-Wing and Quake... but I couldn't play it for more than a few minutes, probably the first game in my long career as player that I dropped that quickly. There is something unnerving about it, it's like playing with magnets while wearing boxing gloves. Even watching gameplay videos I get the same sensation. reply mvkel 5 hours agoprevI love the \"version control\" being comments at the top of the file with a timestamp. Simpler times! What a ton of work building a game is. reply kevin42 5 hours agoparentWe originally used Microsoft Source Safe, which added the comments for us. I think Source Safe made us lock a file to make changes, which was a PITA. I think we made a lot of the decisions on where to break out code on a file by file basis because of that. Later, we moved to Perforce, which is good for larger binary files. reply roca 48 minutes agorootparentI remember my wife working remotely and Source \"Safe\" corrupting the repo when the modem dropped while she was committing her work. Good old days. reply dep_b 2 hours agorootparentprevI would still like Git to have some kind of memory of a file being edited in some kind of branch. It would make it easier to communicate work done on the same file because you can discover what is being done to it. reply opello 4 hours agorootparentprevI worked with VSS for a while and remember the workflow you're describing (lock, edit, check in) and there being a culture of not bundling related changes into commits but instead tossing files in as you realized they were out of date. It's cool that this was done, thanks! reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparentprev> I think Source Safe made us lock a file to make changes That's right. Good times! reply bun_terminator 5 hours agoparentprevwe still do that, sigh reply codewiz 5 hours agoprevGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDGbsbdDC5o&list=PLiEu3n9ms7... reply MaximilianEmel 1 hour agoprevFound this gem on the Wikipedia page[0]: > A study published in 2002 used Descent 3 to study hawkmoth flight activities.

[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_3#Other_uses reply stevage 5 hours agoprevI could never get into Descent. I liked the flying around in 3D bit, but the fact that the levels were truly 3D (ie, didn't have a ground and up/down) meant I was always getting disoriented and lost. I just didn't enjoy that feeling. reply shrubble 4 hours agoparentJust remember, \"The enemy is always down\" ... reply jcrites 2 hours agorootparentIs this an Ender's Game reference?

Back then I played the trailer over and over and over, waiting for the release... That line is carved deep and immediately pops up every time I think of Descent 3: > Now, after years of waiting, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Just as fitting today as it was back then :D EDIT: ha, an internets uploaded it. What a trailer that was... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IHFazkfmBE4 reply KingOfCoders 3 hours agoprevFond memories of Descent. I bought a flightstick to play it. Also Descent was the first game in the 1990s I've played with a VR headset. reply johng 5 hours agoprevI played the original Descent over kali.net back in the day. Man, what great memories. reply seattle_spring 1 hour agoparentI've brought up Kali a few times on HN and never had anyone say they used it too. Glad to finally see another person! What an amazing piece of technology. I used it to play a modded version of Diablo's expansion Hellfire, which without Kali was single player only / LAN with a little hack. There was a great little community on that app. reply johng 53 minutes agorootparentYes, the world (and the net) seemed much smaller back then. My first real taste of multiplayer like that (not counting LAN parties) was playing 4 player doom over modem... it required some expensive hardware and software back in the day. I even paid long distance to do it. The BBS running it had to have a special dongle and then the APCiDoom software. Man that was cool. https://kangaroopunch.com/view/ShowSoftware?id=1 reply evan_conway 5 hours agoprevThis is awesome. I played the shareware demo version to death as a kid. Really looking forward to seeing where this goes. reply johnnylambada 5 hours agoprevGreat! Brings back memories of descent 1 & 2. I played d1 for hours over the early internet. My favorite level was Minerva and my arch enemy was named “upinya”. Amazing what the brain remembers from so long ago. reply amatecha 5 hours agoparentI know what you mean about remembering weird stuff from many years ago. I still remember the IP address of the server of my first website in 1995 (because it had no domain name, I had to know the IP address to show people the website). Occasionally I'll think of the name from a random IRC/AIM/etc. user I talked with 20+ years ago. :) reply disillusioned 3 hours agoprevThis is fantastic. I was obsessed with Descent and played with my friend over our... 14.4 Kbps modems (along with Warcraft II). When Descent II came out, I would go to Best Buy to play it on a demo machine. I remember how amazed I was at the missilecam. That absolutely blew my mind. I don't think I ever really played 3, watching the trailer. But I _did_ make the jump to Volition's Descent: Freespace. THAT game was the first one where I made the concerted effort to save up, as a 9th grader, for an NVidia Riva TNT after seeing my friend's, and how awesome the particle rendering was in it. If only I just, you know, dumped a few hundred bucks into $NVDA at the time instead. But man, these games were so great. reply theboogieman 5 hours agoprevThank you for releasing this! Many good memories of playing this as a kid. reply orthecreedence 5 hours agoprevOh man, used to play this sooo much. Single player and multi...what a wonderful game. This was back when Softice ruled the world so I'd have infinite health/ammo in SP mode =]. I'd love to get this building.

I'd play that after coming home from working on Descent 3.

I've been working on and off to decompile EarthSiege 2. Might take another stab at it this summer... maybe there are code similarities, I wouldn't be surprised at all. reply mark_undoio 14 minutes agorootparentEarthSiege 2 was amazing - many hours spent there.

Or is that under lock and key still? reply kevin42 4 hours agoparentI don't. That was developed by Volition. Parallax was split into Outrage and Volition. I never had access to that code, and I think Mike Kulas would need to be the one to release it. reply dvaun 4 hours agorootparentWas worth a shot asking :) thanks for the info!

I enjoyed descent, but did not like freespace, I am sure there is fun subtlety to the game, but I bounced off it hard, combat in open space ended up being just these really boring circle battles.

Awesome. reply XorNot 5 hours agoprevOoh, time to take another crack at a level scripting language - AFAIK the original was ripped out right before release due to being too limited and replaced with just compiled C libraries. reply kevin42 5 hours agoparentYes. The original language was custom and turning into a nightmare. We talked about it over lunch one day and came up with the idea of building a c++ code generator so the level designers could do most of the work with the GUI we made, but the code could be edited by hand as well. Fun fact, the editor was called DALLAS, which from what I remember stood for \"Don't ask Luke for Levels And Scripts\". Luke was the only designer who could make things work with the original language.

    "originBody": "PuTTY vulnerability vuln-p521-bias HomeFAQFeedbackLicenceUpdatesMirrorsKeysLinksTeam Download: Stable · SnapshotDocsChangesWishlist summary: NIST P521 private keys are exposed by biased signature generation class: vulnerability: This is a security vulnerability. priority: high: This should be fixed in the next release. absent-in: 0.67 present-in: 0.68 0.69 0.70 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74 0.75 0.76 0.77 0.78 0.79 0.80 fixed-in: c193fe9848f50a88a4089aac647fecc31ae96d27 (0.81) Every version of the PuTTY tools from 0.68 to 0.80 inclusive has a critical vulnerability in the code that generates signatures from ECDSA private keys which use the NIST P521 curve. (PuTTY, or Pageant, generates a signature from a key when using it to authenticate you to an SSH server.) This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-31497. It was discovered by Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann of the Ruhr University Bochum; see their write-up on the oss-security mailing list. The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to compromise the private key. An attacker in possession of a few dozen signed messages and the public key has enough information to recover the private key, and then forge signatures as if they were from you, allowing them to (for instance) log in to any servers you use that key for. To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly compromise any server you use the key to authenticate to, or momentarily gain access to a copy of Pageant holding the key. (However, these signatures are not exposed to passive eavesdroppers of SSH connections.) Therefore, if you have a key of this type, we recommend you revoke it immediately: remove the old public key from all OpenSSH authorized_keys files, and the equivalent in other SSH servers, so that a signature from the compromised key has no value any more. Then generate a new key pair to replace it. (The problem is not with how the key was originally generated; it doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen or somewhere else. What matters is whether it was ever used with PuTTY or Pageant.) The good news: the only affected key type is 521-bit ECDSA. That is, a key that appears in Windows PuTTYgen with ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 at the start of the 'Key fingerprint' box, or is described as 'NIST p521' when loaded into Windows Pageant, or has an id starting ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 in the SSH protocol or the key file. Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key algorithms, are unaffected. In particular, Ed25519 is not affected. Details of the error: All DSA signature schemes require a random value to be invented during signing, known as the 'nonce' (cryptography jargon for a value used only once), or sometimes by the letter k. It's well known that if an attacker can guess the value of k you used, or find any two signatures you generated with the same k, then they can immediately recover your private key. This means that it's dangerous to generate DSA signatures on systems with no high-quality source of randomness. Significantly more dangerous than generating the encryption keys for a single session: a leak of the private key compromises far more than one SSH session. For this reason, since PuTTY was developed on Windows before it had any cryptographic random number generator at all, PuTTY has always generated its k using a deterministic method, avoiding the need for random numbers at all. The clever trick is to compute a secure hash whose input includes the message to be signed and also the private key. Secure hash output is indistinguishable from random data (or else the hash function isn't doing its job), and this generation method can't be repeated by an attacker who's trying to find out the private key – if they could generate the same hash input as you, they'd already have the private key. This technique is now mainstream, and RFC 6979 documents a specific well-known way of doing it. But PuTTY didn't follow that specification, because we started doing the same thing in 2001, and the RFC wasn't published until 2013. PuTTY's technique worked by making a SHA-512 hash, and then reducing it mod q, where q is the order of the group used in the DSA system. For integer DSA (for which PuTTY's technique was originally developed), q is about 160 bits; for elliptic-curve DSA (which came later) it has about the same number of bits as the curve modulus, so 256 or 384 or 521 bits for the NIST curves. In all of those cases except P521, the bias introduced by reducing a 512-bit number mod q is negligible. But in the case of P521, where q has 521 bits (i.e. more than 512), reducing a 512-bit number mod q has no effect at all – you get a value of k whose top 9 bits are always zero. This bias is sufficient to allow a key recovery attack. It's less immediate than if an attacker knows all of k, but it turns out that if k has a biased distribution in this way, it's possible to aggregate information from multiple signatures and recover the private key eventually. Apparently the number of signatures required is around 60. To fix this vulnerability, we've completely abandoned PuTTY's old system for generating k, and switched to the RFC 6979 technique, for all DSA and ECDSA key types. (EdDSA keys such as Ed25519 already used a different system, which has not changed.) However, this doesn't affect the fact that information about existing P521 private keys has already been leaked whenever a signature was generated using the old k generator.

The problem here is the distinction between an n-bit random number and n-bit modulus. In DSA, if you're working with a 521-bit modulus, and you need a random k value for it, k needs to be random across all 521-bits. Systems programming intuition tells you that a 512-bit random number is, to within mind-boggling tolerances, as unguessable as a 521-bit random number. But that's not the point. A 512 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, which are legible to cryptanalysis as bias. In the DSA/ECDSA equation, this reduces through linear algebra to the Hidden Number Problem, solvable over some number of sample signatures for the private key using CVP. Later Here you go, from Sean Devlin's Cryptopals Set 8: https://cryptopals.com/sets/8/challenges/62.txt reply keepamovin 9 minutes agoparentThe article has a good writeup. Clear, actionable, concise. If you have a bit of instinct for this, it feels obvious that 'reducing' a smaller number by a larger one is not going to obscure the smaller 1 in any meaningful way, and instead it will leave it completely unchanged. I don't think this is so much what you make it out to be, but a poor understanding of basic discrete maths (also I think you mean the 521 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, the modulus normally refers to the divisor not the remainder) https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Modulus.html reply rainsford 12 hours agoparentprevWhat's really interesting to me is that there was a known solution to the DSA/ECDSA nonce generation problem, RFC 6979, which was published 4 years before the vulnerability was introduced into PuTTY. And it sounds like the developer knew about this RFC at the time but didn't implement it because the much earlier version of deterministic nonce generation that PuTTY already had seemed similar enough and the differences were assessed to not be security critical. So I think the other lesson here is that deviating from a cryptographic right answer is a major footgun unless you understand exactly why the recommendation works the way it does and exactly what the implications are of you doing it differently. reply akerl_ 12 hours agorootparentThe article addresses this: they wrote this code path in 2001. RFC 6979 was authored in 2013. reply rainsford 11 hours agorootparentBut elliptic curve support and this vulnerability weren't introduced until 2017, and the commit log (https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...) makes it clear the developer was aware of the RFC but chose not to upgrade the 2001 code. Doing so prior to the elliptic curve support being added would have completely avoided this vulnerability. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentprevI think 6979 is a bit of a red herring here. 6979 is about deterministic nonce generation, which is what you do to dodge the problem of having an insecure RNG. But the problem here isn't that the RNG is secure; it's more fundamentally a problem of not understanding what the rules of the nonce are. But I may be hair-splitting. Like, yeah, they freelanced their own deterministic nonce generation. Either way, I think this code long predates 6979. reply rainsford 11 hours agorootparentI was going based off the commit link posted further down the thread (https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...). You're right that the PuTTY deterministic nonce generating code does appear to significantly predate the RFC, but it sounds like the developer made a conscious decision when 6979 came out not to switch from what PuTTY already had because they looked similar enough. The PuTTY release that introduced support for elliptic curve cryptography (and introduced this vulnerability) was 0.68, which came out in 2017, 4 years after the RFC. You're right that this was not an RNG security problem and instead was a problem with not understanding ECDSA nonce rules. However the notable fact for me was that the developer was apparently aware of the recommended way to deterministically generate nonces prior to the vulnerability being introduced and made a choice not to implement the RFC because what PuTTY was already doing seemed close enough, without fully understanding the implications of doing so. To put it another way, understanding ECDSA nonce rules would have avoided this vulnerability, but so too would implementing the RFC recommended way even if the developer did not fully understand why it was better than the existing implementation. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentRight, the reason I'm splitting hairs is that in my intuition, the whole rationale for 6979 is to eliminate the possibility of fully repeated nonces, for instance because your RNG is \"unseeded\". You can still end up with a biased nonce even if you're using a perfectly seeded random bit generator (as you can see here). But yeah I think we understand each other. As you can probably see, I just love this bug class, is all. reply rainsford 11 hours agorootparent> As you can probably see, I just love this bug class, is all. I agree! DSA nonce issues are a great class of cryptographic bug in that they're sort of weirdly unexpected failure properties when you first hear about it. reply nmadden 3 hours agorootparentAnd then you find out about special soundness and that this is not only expected behaviour, but crucial to the security definitions and you realise that signatures are absolutely cursed. reply kwantam 11 hours agorootparentprevRFC6979 attempts to guarantee that the nonce is unbiased (under the assumption that HMAC's output is indistinguishable from random). It's definitely attempting to give a stronger property than simply preventing a repeated nonce. See step (h) in Section 3.2. The nonce is selected by rejection sampling. Thus, under the above assumption about HMAC, the result is indistinguishable from uniformly random in the [1, q-1] range. reply taspeotis 33 minutes agoparentprevI feel like there should be some intuition like a cable rated for 100kg is not suitable for holding 110kg, therefore 512 bits of entropy is not rated to be 521 bits of entropy? Oh well, there’s this very popular library which generates 256-bit keys setting the last 128 bits to a value derived from the first 128 bits. So I guess in agreement with your post: actually achieving full entropy is not obvious. https://chilkatforum.com/questions/622/algorithm-for-generat... reply saagarjha 3 minutes agorootparentNo, it’s actually far worse than that. This is like if you bought prestressed concrete rated for 100kg and you loaded it with 50kg. This is less than the limit, so it’s good right? Nope, the way it works is that you have to give it exactly 100kg of load or else it’s weak to tension and your building falls over in the wind. The problem here is that not that they needed 521 bits of entropy and 512 was too little but that 521 bits of entropy of which 512 are legit and the top 9 bits are all zeroes breaks the algorithm completely and makes it not secure at all. In fact I think copying 9 bits from the other 512, while not great, would have probably made this basically not a problem. reply garaetjjte 12 hours agoparentprevI don't think anybody consciously looked at 9 zero bits and thought this is fine, but it rather looks like unfortunate effect of plugging old code into new algorithms without proper verification. reply rainsford 11 hours agorootparentYou could be right. If you look at the old code, dsa_gen_k(), that was removed during the commit (https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...), it does basically no bounds checking, presumably because at the time it was written it was assumed that all modulus values would be many fewer bits than the size of a SHA-512 output. So it would have been pretty easy to just reuse the function for a modulus value that was too big without encountering any errors. And the old code was written 15+ years before it was used for P-521, so it's entirely possible the developer forgot the limitations of the dsa_gen_k() function. So maybe there's another lesson here about bounds checking inputs and outputs even if they don't apply to anything you're currently doing. reply throwaway984393 6 hours agorootparentI mean, bounds checking should really be caught by complete test coverage, shouldn't it? Or fuzzing? It doesn't address the more fundamental problem of cryptanalysis attacks, but it would definitely help mitigate the simple mistakes which can lead to exploitable implementations. reply acer4666 4 hours agoparentprevIt's not the difference between an n-bit random number and an n-bit modulus. It's the difference between a 512-bit random number and a 521-bit random number. It's very simple, but wording it as number vs. modulus is needlessly confusing, just adding to the problem you are bemoaning. reply tankenmate 54 minutes agorootparentThe issue with cryptography is that you have to be precise, that means the communication needs to involve far more detail, even if it can initially be confusing. This is one of the major reasons that crypto is hard and if you try to get around the \"hard\" bit your \"shortcut\" will probably come back to bite you. When it comes to crypto and accuracy (and hence security), more communication, and detailed communication are probably the solution not the problem. reply kijin 3 hours agoparentprevThe very existence of 521-bit ECDSA is a footgun just waiting to go off.

The issue is with ECDSA: any use of ECDSA with biased nonce generation, regardless of the elliptic curve it's implemented over, immediately causes secret key leakage. (Rant: All these years later, we're all still doing penance for the fact that Schnorr signatures were patented and so everyone used ECDSA instead. It's an absolute garbage fire of a signature scheme and should be abandoned yesterday for many reasons, e.g., no real proof of security, terrible footguns like this.) reply djao 7 hours agorootparentSchnorr wouldn't have helped in this specific case, since Schnorr is equally vulnerable to biased nonces (https://ecc2017.cs.ru.nl/slides/ecc2017-tibouchi.pdf). EdDSA, which is essentially deterministic Schnorr, does solve the problem. Also, the use of P-521 didn't specifically cause the vulnerability, but the bad interaction between SHA512 and P-521 did play a role. It is unfortunate that nature conspired against us to make 2^511 - 1 a composite number. The fact that you have to go up to 521 bits to get a Mersenne prime whereas the natural target length for a hash output is 512 bits is the fatal interaction here. reply kwantam 5 hours agorootparentExcellent points all around, and thank you for the pointer to the ECC slides :) (And indeed, nature could have been kinder to us and given us a Mersenne between 127 and 521...) reply GoblinSlayer 41 minutes agorootparentprevShouldn't there be another close enough prime?

Anyone care to explain how exactly? How it it any different to the top 9 bits being zero by chance (which happens in 1 out of ~500 attempts anyway) reply lambdafu 12 hours agoparentFor the attack all 60 signatures need a nonce that is special in this way. If for example only one out of the 60 is short, the attack fails in the lattice reduction step. The reason is that in the attack, all 60 short nonces \"collude\" to make up a very special short vector in the lattice, which is much shorter than usual because it is short in all 60 dimensions, not just one out of 500 dimensions. The approximate shortest vector is then obtainable in polynomial time, and this happens to contain the secret key by construction. As an analogy: Imagine you had a treasure map with 60 steps \"go left, go right, go up, go down, go down again\" etc. If only one out of 60 instructions where correct, you wouldn't know where the treasure is. All of the instructions need to be correct to get there. reply janmo 7 hours agoparentprevDoesn't make sense to me as well, even when fully random after 30,000 signatures you would get around 60 signatures where the nonce starts with nine zero bits.

For Pageant you should be able to select view keys from the system tray icon context menu and it should show the key type in the list. For ssh-agent I think ssh-add -L should list the public keys (with key type) in the same format as the authorized_keys file I'm not an expert, so if anyone is please correct me where I'm wrong! reply ajb 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can look in the key file.

Do these need to be rotated after my users upgrade their PuTTY clients? reply germinator 13 hours agoparentThis exposed client keys, not server keys. The client keys are at risk only in a handful of specific scenarios - e.g., if used to connect to rogue or compromised servers, or used for signing outside SSH. This is not exploitable by simply passively watching traffic, so even for client keys, if you're certain that they were used in a constrained way, you should be fine. The difficulty is knowing that for sure, so it's still prudent to rotate. reply Skrillor 13 hours agoparentprevNo, only NIST P-521 client keys used with PuTTY are affected. The server host key signature is computed by the server (most likely OpenSSH) which is unaffected. reply strbean 13 hours agoparentprev> (The problem is not with how the key was originally generated; it doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen or somewhere else.

The spec for that system includes its own idea of how you should do deterministic nonce generation - completely different again, naturally - and we did it that way rather than our way, so that we could use the existing test vectors.) reply gruez 13 hours agoprevedit: ignore below, I misinterpreted what q meant in this context and thought it was the private key. >The clever trick is to compute a secure hash whose input includes the message to be signed and also the private key [...] > PuTTY's technique worked by making a SHA-512 hash, and then reducing it mod q, where q is the order of the group used in the DSA system. For integer DSA (for which PuTTY's technique was originally developed), q is about 160 bits; for elliptic-curve DSA (which came later) it has about the same number of bits as the curve modulus, so 256 or 384 or 521 bits for the NIST curves. I know hindsight is 20/20, but why did PuTTY implement it this way to begin with? Given the description in the first paragraph, I'd naively implemented it as SHA-512(message || private_key)[:number_of_bits_required] or if I was being paranoid I would have done SHA-512(SHA-512(message) || SHA-512(private_key))[:number_of_bits_required] Moduloing it by q makes no sense unless you're trying to save a few cycles. reply smarx007 13 hours agoparentSHA-512(...)[:521] would still produce the same vulnerability, there would be 9 unchanging bits (assuming the [:521] would pad the 512 bits to 521). Those 9 guessable bits are enough to recover the key from 60 signatures, as the post explained in detail. A more interesting question (while we are on the 20/20 hindsight express) is why the dsa_gen_k() function did not include an assert(digest_len512, not that they used modulo. To get a sufficiently large nonce out of the hash, you need to think in terms of expanding the number of bits, not reducing it. reply gruez 13 hours agorootparentAh okay, after re-reading the message it looks like using the SHA-512 result directly (without modulo) would still have the issue. I originally thought the problem was moduloing by the key, which was approximately 521 bits > In all of those cases except P521, the bias introduced by reducing a 512-bit number mod q is negligible. But in the case of P521, where q has 521 bits (i.e. more than 512), reducing a 512-bit number mod q has no effect at all – you get a value of k whose top 9 bits are always zero. reply tptacek 13 hours agoparentprevPresumably because 512 of bits (a) seemed \"random enough\" and (b) was the nicest block size that fit comfortably in 521 bits of modulus. This is a common mistake. reply Denvercoder9 12 hours agorootparentFrom TFA it seems more like they already had the SHA512-based implementation for DSA (where it was fine), and reused it when implementing ECDSA without realizing that it wasn't suitable in situations with moduli larger than 512 bits. reply tptacek 12 hours agorootparentI'd have to look at the code, but a DSA modulus is much larger than a P-521 modulus. Maybe it just happened to line up nicely? reply kwantam 11 hours agorootparentThe nonce is taken modulo the order of the prime-order subgroup. For DSA that's generally a 256ish-bit prime (e.g.: choose a 1024-bit prime p such that a 256-bit prime q divides p-1; then there exists an order-q subgroup of Zp). For P-521, the base field is 2^521 - 1, but the modulus used when computing the nonce is not that value, it's the order of the P-521 curve. By Hasse's theorem, that's roughly p +- sqrt(p), which is essentially p for such large numbers (the cofactor of P-521 is 1, so the order of the group is prime). So: both are 521-bit numbers, but the group order is less than 2^521-1. Its hex representation is 0x01fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa51868783bf2f966b7fcc0148f709a5d03bb5c9b8899c47aebb6fb71e91386409. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentAhh. Thanks! (I don't think about FFDLP much, as you can see). reply aidenn0 13 hours agoparentprevIsn't modulo the same as truncation when dealing with powers of two? reply lambdafu 12 hours agorootparentCaution here. If your modulus is too close to the maximum truncated value, there can be a bias in the upper bits, too. For example, if you reduce a number between 0 and 15 by the modulus 13, the values 0, 1 and 2 will be twice as likely as the values 3-12. This means that the highest bit will be 0 in 11 out of 16 cases. Even such a small bias might be exploitable (for example, sub 1 bit bias up to 160-bit ECDSA here: Gao, Wang, Hu, He https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/296.pdf) reply aidenn0 12 hours agorootparentNeither 15 nor 13 are powers of two. reply some_furry 11 hours agorootparentThe interval [0, 15] represent 16 possible values, which is a power of 2. The correct way to get an unbiased distribution from a sample of 2^x to a modulo that is not an even power of 2 is to use rejection sampling. This is what RFC 6979 says to do https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979#section-3.2 But you can also see this technique in CSPRNG code; i.e. https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/d40726670fd2915dcd807673... reply aidenn0 11 hours agorootparentI missed it was [0,15] This doesn't make 13 a power of two.

I only use keys generated by and stored on hardware tokens like yubikeys and openpgp smartcards. Edit: To clarify further, the key in that case is not even handled by putty. All crypto ops are done on the token and the private key never leaves it. It can't be exported even because that defeats the purpose of using a hardware token. So putty will just tell the token or smartcard what to sign and the token returns the output. That's why it's safe against this attack. Putty never handles the private key material in this scenario. So I never imported the private key in putty or pageant and I couldn't even if I wanted to. The agent just declares the public keys on the token. I see all the downvotes but I didn't explain it properly. I've been using smart cards so long that these things are kinda a given for me. I can really recommend doing it this way or doing the more modern fido2 auth. Hardware authentication is amazing and it even works on Android over nfc these days. The biggest vulnerability I see is the issue of malware connecting to the unlocked token via the SSH agent, but I'm only using tokens that have touch to sign for this reason. They require a touch on the token for every operation. reply Bootvis 12 hours agoparentFrom the article: > (The problem is not with how the key was originally generated; it doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen or somewhere else.

I have never trusted EC crypto because of all the magic involved with it, a sufficient reason to move from RSA has never been presented with compelling evidence as far as I am concerned. I do not care that it is faster, i prefer slow and secure to fast and complicated. It's a lot easier to explain RSA and why it's secure than the mile long justifications on curve crypto. The issue doesn't need to be in the algorithm, if the implementation is sufficiently difficult that works just as well as an intentionally misdesigned algorithm. reply kbolino 6 hours agoparentThe benefit of EC is not speed, it is much smaller key sizes. Roughly speaking, an RSA key has to be 8 times as large as an EC key for the same security level. reply wkat4242 12 hours agoparentprevYeah I never bought into the EC thing much either. It's supposed to be safer against quantum but it's also a lot less proven. reply lambdafu 12 hours agorootparentActually, with currently common key sizes, ECC up to 384 bits will fall to QC before RSA with 1024 bits, because fewer bits means fewer qubits needed. The main disadvantage of RSA is the structure of finite fields, which allows specialized solutions to factoring (number field sieve). We do not know similar structures for elliptic curves, so for those we only have general attacks, thus allowing shorter key lengths. reply cyberpunk 4 hours agoprev [–] One time putty took down our prod rac cluster on Xmas eve, and I spent three days fixing it..

All over the world. Week in and week out. Big embezzlers, small embezzlers, smart embezzlers and very smart embezzlers… That’s right, no dumb embezzlers because almost all the embezzlers we encounter are smart. Some are very smart. Some are brilliant. And, almost always, most would have made more money and had a more profitable career if they had simply stopped stealing and starting working honestly. I mean, figure it out. An embezzler has to not only do his or her job well so that no one is looking over his or her shoulder but has to do their job so well that they can steal for months or years and it won’t show up. They have to be charismatic and knowledgeable enough so that no one bothers to double check their work. They have to be very steady in their work so that it cannot be reviewed because they are on vacation or ill…in short, they have to be great employees. And either so boring that all ignore their existence or so well liked that no one would question their character. Most choose the latter mode since it also allows access to more accounts and financial secrets. And when embezzlers run entire companies, they have to create a bottom line successful enough for long enough that investors and business colleagues respect and trust them after review of the books…at least for a time. Took me a long time to figure that out…for the first few years of practice, I found it incredible that such brilliant and attractive people would be dumb enough to risk it all for the relatively paltry gains that embezzlement can earn. I kept looking to see the underlying motivations since, I figured, I could better advise clients what to look out for if I could figure out precisely what makes an embezzler embezzle. Now I know. They embezzle because they like it. They like the rush. They need money now, not in five years. They like being smarter than the drudges they figure are around them. And they embezzle, I am convinced, because they want to get caught sooner or later and that pattern is usually repeated over and over. Take one of my favorite embezzlers, a guy who once owned the famous Flamingo Hotel in California until his world crumbled around him during a case our client brought against him in the late 1970’s. I had represented a minority shareholder in the venture and after perhaps a year of very aggressive litigation, Eddie Chan (not his real name) called it quits, transferred the shell of a company that was left to my client along with most of the rest of his assets, settled for a suspended sentence with the district attorney (to my fury) and then called me to invite me to lunch. I had only been practicing for five years at the time and was unused to the foibles of opposing parties. I was nonplussed and immediately called his counsel to ask if that would be OK…as required by the Code of Ethics. “Sure,” the relatively famous criminal defense attorney chirped, “and tell him to pay my bill while you’re at it.” So there I was two days later with Eddie at his favorite Italian restaurant, Orsi, watching him fiddle with his fettuccini, his hands nervously twitching every so often, but immaculately dressed in a conservative business suit, expensive cufflinks and watch, the picture of a successful and conservative business man. He had greeted me in a rather distracted manner, looking about the room, but friendly enough. Since I had been instrumental in destroying his economic well-being, and since he knew I had been demanding his incarceration for his embezzlement with the district attorney, I wondered why we were having this lunch. Cautious, I figured I’d let him tell me. And, in turn, I’d try to figure out what made him tick. The waiters all knew him. He was a regular and his waistline showed it. Friendly but not effusive, soft-spoken and understated, he appeared now as he had been throughout the trial…a typical intelligent businessman slightly shocked that people were upset with him, but just maybe a hint of irony somehow mixed into his replies. On the stand he had been asked what he had done with the money. “Spent it. I have none left. If I did, perhaps I would pay it back.” “On what did you spend it? Are those assets in the United States at this time?\" He had stared at me for a moment, knowing I was looking for assets to attach, then suddenly smiled sadly. “I spent it on sweet, stupid things that make life an appropriate journey. Little things with some elegance attached. Things only worth buying because they have little value in the long run. Like life, itself.” There was some laughter in the court room but my client had begun to mutter darkly at my side, furious that these “little things” had bankrupted the hotel. As I sat there in that elegant restaurant, I decided that he had, for once, been telling the truth. “Is this lunch a little elegant thing to make life bearable, Eddie?” I now asked. I thought he would smile but he looked at me steadily for the first time that afternoon. After a moment’s silence, he said softly, “Your courts are not used to hearing an honest statement, are they?” “What's that? You’re telling me that you spent it all, nothing is left?” “You are still cross-examining me. You are still looking for assets. I am speaking of honest answers. Of course I spent it. Why else take it? Money taken like that should not be spent on necessities of life but on luxuries of life. Necessities of life are the proper destination of grim jobs with little men working at little desks.” He waved to the water to refill his wine glass. I was suddenly reminded of the movie Casablanca in the coffee house with Sidney Greenstreet making a deal. I was also angry. “Those little people were your victims, Eddie. They work years and you take what they make and bankrupt businesses left and right. For luxuries.” “Of course I do. You are stating the obvious. What you are not stating is why it matters so much to arouse such passion. I am the one losing all. Not you and not your client. Do I appear upset?” He didn’t. He appeared bemused, not upset. He leaned forward. “Look, that is the past and I want to move forward. I want this to be a constructive meeting.” “Meeting? Constructive meeting?” “Yes, I have an opportunity. You represent many clients who might be interested. It should be very profitable.” And for the next ten minutes he explained in some detail a new business venture he was considering involving Hong Kong property. Finally I could take it no longer. “Look, Eddie,” I interrupted, “I can’t believe this. I’m the guy who wanted you in jail. Remember? I know you and your past. You seem to think I’d tell my clients to invest in you. Are you nuts?” He was shocked. “Of course you would. You already know who I am and what I do. You don’t have to worry about checking out my background. You can build all the safeguards you need. This isn’t about me. It’s about the deal. If it’s a good deal, you should jump at it. Better the thief you know than the thief you don’t know. This is a perfect opportunity for you. Who else would think of investing with me?” And off he went again with his business plan. I pushed my cannelloni around while he expounded on the future of Hong Kong and when he finally wound down, asked, “Does it not occur to you that people want to do business with honest people they can trust? Not dishonest people they have to watch?” He became exasperated. “Didn’t you tell your client you have to create checks and balances in the company and watch each and every employee?” “Yes, but…” “And don’t you insist on systems being created in every company so that no one can get away with cooking the books or taking from the company no matter who is in charge?” “Yes…” “Then what difference does it make if someone you don’t trust is involved? You don’t trust anyone anyway. If your systems work, they work. I am not any more of a danger to you than any other person. I don’t see the problem.” And he didn’t see a problem. Either with his plan or his actions--except that he was caught. Oh, perhaps a little guilt now and then…but nothing that good wine could not assuage. Business was business, and his was stealing if he could get away with it. There was a certain splendor in his lack of hypocrisy, a certain attraction in his blunt appraisal of his own role. But I would not recommend business with him to anyone. Since what Eddie didn’t understand is that people are not only in business for the money. Oh, it’s important, but it’s never just the money in my experience. It’s a dozen other things, the joy of creating something from nothing, the excitement of success, the comradeship one gets from working in a team that is good and effective, etc, etc. Business may be competitive, but there are rules and it is not war. To Eddie, business was not only war, but war with the only rules being do not get caught if you can and make all the money you can. And trust no one. I had another client about the same time, an elderly business man disliked by almost all that knew him, a truly unpleasant individual who never praised anyone, made more money than anyone I knew and could be cast as Scrooge except for his enjoyment of fishing which was all that he truly cared about other than money. But honest…he often would give more to the other side in the bargain than they asked because it was better business tactics to have a vendor who was making good money with you than not. During a break in a negotiation I told him about Eddie, laughing. He didn’t think it was funny. “Eddie’s just more honest than a lot of the business men I know. Get the money any way you can, any time you can, short-term thinking, everyone is a crook anyway, so what’s the big deal? I know a lot of people like that. They think they’re smart. They’re not. They grab a nickel here and lose a dollar in the long run. Like him…but he’s just crude and a little stupid.” “Crude?” “The smarter ones do it legally.” He grinned and the negotiation began again. Eddie died about three years later. I read in the papers that his funeral was well-attended, even by some of his newly created victims. Perhaps they were gloating. Or perhaps they liked him. Because, all in all, he was a pretty nice guy. Being a nice guy is how he made his living, after all. Who would entrust their money to a grouch?

An embezzler has to not only do his or her job well so that no one is looking over his or her shoulder but has to do their job so well that they can steal for months or years and it won’t show up. Performance and pay aren't 1:1, and sometimes quite far from it. That imbalance or perceived imbalance could certainly drive some to embezzle. Bit of a just world fallacy there. reply PaulHoule 16 hours agoparentI remember a story of a bank branch manager who got into embezzling because of his gambling debts in this classic book https://www.amazon.com/Crime-Computer-Donn-B-Parker/dp/06841... I would not say he had a master plan but was making it up to go along and figured he’d win big at the track one day and pay everyone back, (We had someone like that who stole $750k from our county’s bus operator because of gambling too.) Boy if these people were cogs in the machine and probably didn’t see a lot of upward mobility. The perp told the author of the book that he’d “learned his lesson” and that he came across as sincere but FBI agents told him that people like that (gambling addiction + embezzling) will reoffend almost always if given the chance. (One reason I think the European “right to be forgotten” is a problem is because it is a shield for people who use their social skills as a weapon.) reply soneca 15 hours agorootparent> ”probably didn’t see a lot of upward mobility” There was a case in Brazil recently where a medicine student in a top university embezzled from her graduation party funds (she was at the party committee) to invest in cryptocurrency, make profit and return the money to the fund keeping the profit. But she lost money on crypto. Then she tried to gamble (playing a lot of money on the lottery) to earn what she lost. Lost everything and got caught. Expelled by the university. She had a lot of potential for upward mobility as a doctor from the most prestigious school in Brazil. Still did it. reply TeMPOraL 14 hours agorootparent> She had a lot of potential for upward mobility as a doctor from the most prestigious school in Brazil. Potential, and after couple more years of exhaustion and suffering (as graduating from a medical school is typically only first half of the journey)? If potential far-away reward like this didn't discount to approximately 0 for most people, the world would've looked entirely different. reply xmprt 14 hours agorootparentMost countries other than the US don't have such rigorous training for doctors. After graduating medical school (which is typically done while others are doing their bachelors), you have your medical license and can start practicing. Medical school is 6 years in Brazil as opposed to the required 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of medical school, and 3-7 years of residency (not counting any fellowship that you may opt to do afterwards). Which is all to say that she was right on the finish line before deciding to throw it all away. reply the_af 12 hours agorootparent> Most countries other than the US don't have such rigorous training for doctors Where do you get this notion? If Brazil is anything like Argentina -- and I bet it is in this context -- the study and internship stages of doctor training are positively grueling. Many doctors in training do drugs to cope. They work long hours and make all sorts of mistakes. Many are in terrible moods. And patients and people can get really rude and impatient with them. It can be a really thankless, grueling job.

More like offering a potential counterpoint, motivated by general experience that people generally aren't stupid - even the most seemingly dumb behavior tends to have a motivation that feels reasonable(ish) to the person doing it. I don't think playing Devil's advocate is misanthropic. > To see it, who are there all these rubes who stay in middle school even though most people discount far-away reward to 0? High school? Do you even remember middle/high school? Obviously, kids stay in it because the law mandates so, and tolerate it because they meet other kids there and have some degree of autonomy over their social life. Consequences and rewards are both immediate. Compare with: \"you need to learn because it will be useful for you in the future / will help you get good job\", an argument that's well-known to work on nearly zero teenagers ever. > College? Mixed motivations, but the fact that social life gets taken up to 11 definitely doesn't hurt :). It's easy to keep long-term motivations in mind when following the path towards distant reward keeps yielding smaller rewards along the way. Take that away, and people check out or burn out. reply RugnirViking 3 hours agorootparentI feel like you're very close to the realisation/philosophy that I hold here, which is that hard work doesn't pay off. In the sense that you cannot willpower your way to a goal that requires a great deal of sustatined effort. You simply can't. People dont become olympic athletes by training hard so they can win. They become olympic athletes by training hard because they like training. They have friends there, and feel good at it, and get fulfillment from it, and found all sorts of little tricks to make it easier and not exact a psychological toll from them. This all is to say, if you want to make a change in life, its not enough to try really hard. You have to set up structures, often social structures, to help it become fun. reply sandspar 2 hours agorootparentYou're right and I think you could go further. There's a carrot and there's a stick. You can join communities where change happens by force. Think of the guy who runs someone over in his car then becomes a priest to atone. He's not necessarily having fun. Think of slaves: they're not having fun, but the social structure ensures they'll remain slaves. As we speak there are teenage boys fighting each other in the Middle East and Europe - not because it's fun but because their society ensures they'll be thrown in jail or killed if they don't fight. reply ngc248 1 hour agorootparentprevhard work is a necessary but not sufficient factor to achieve success. reply stcredzero 10 hours agorootparentprevMore like offering a potential counterpoint, motivated by general experience that people generally aren't stupid I would say that everyone is smart and stupid at the same time, about different things at different times.

Yeah I'm an economics college dropout from nowhere with a 2.8 GPA who couldn't make it to class. I flushed a 1560/1600 SAT and 173/180 LSAT down the toilet (read: Ivy League tier standardized test grades). I ended up working for Google as a SWE. How? After dropping out, I worked as a waiter, thought that rumored iSlate thing sounded pretty cool, and maybe I should make a restaurant app for it. Taught myself programming, launched after 2.5 years, sold it after 4, interviewed for Google expecting to fail. To peer poster's point: everyone is smart and stupid at the same time, about different things at different times. reply smaudet 4 hours agorootparentSomeone who experienced the changing and flippant tides of fortune... You learned your numbers at least mostly meant nothing, and seemingly learnt the valuable lesson of hardwork and luck (and a brain cell or two to rub together). Maybe, someday you will be able to notice the rest of the drab populous, some of whom have no braincells, some that never learnt to work, or have never managed to have lady luck on their side, instead courting her cousins disease and malady, and you may regret your shortsighted and uninformed comment(s).

Sometimes they get 'forced' to continue, the initial fraud case involved a fictitious vendor, or a subscription, or some other thing that is expected to be ongoing and would raise suspicious to suddenly stop. In other cases I've seen the root cause just be straight up drugs and gambling addictions.

Repeat offenses as a signal? Sure! Therapist's recommendation? I'm skeptical.

In this view, for example, people start using an addictive drug because it makes them feel good, but once addicted they use the drug in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

A huge proportion of drug addicts (and I suspect addicts of sex, gambling etc I'm just less familiar with those addictions) started taking their drugs because of how tough their life was. And even if you know that starting to take opiates or whatever drug of choice might not be a sensible plan long term, if you feel so bad that you'd rather kill yourself than live in your head sober, it's possible to actually want to keep using what you re addicted to because you don't believe that life without that drug can be any better. I don't know how common this is, but anecdotally I've known two people who used high dose prescription painkillers (obtained illegal) to give them enough positive feelings to be able to work on their mental health problems, both who would've been described as problematically addicted by most medical professionals, but who managed to use the opiates to work on their core mental health issues until such a time that they felt ready to not need opiates, at which point they found it relatively easy to stop. Because as horrible as it is to get the withdrawals, it's actually not very last longing and it can be considerably less painful than the pain of having such severe mental health issues that you were desperate to kill yourself before you started the drug use, not because you started the drug use. (Of course there's also people who get addicted because they think it will be fun, and end up suicidal because of it. And I also wouldn't recommend using opiates to work on your mental health, because despite my two anecdotes I believe the almost universal knowledge in medical circles is that it's much more likely to worsen your mental health than to improve it. reply tacon 13 hours agorootparentYes, that agrees with the addiction theory of Johann Hari, who has a TED talk and a book[0]. Experiments with rats show a rat will quickly be addicted when the choice is only between water and an opiate.

The short term pleasure is always more compelling than the long term benefit of not being an addict. reply swores 14 hours agorootparentBut my point is that's not the only way people find it hard to stop. If you're addicted because your life was roughly fine, but you discovered that a drug make you feel amazing, keep taking it too much, and get to the point where withdrawal is so painful that it's impossible to resist taking another dose to feel good again, then that's exactly how you describe it. But if you're using heroin or whatever drug as a mental health treatment, e.g. because if you hadn't started using you would instead have killed yourself, then sure you'll still have the nasty withdrawals when you stop, but it's a totally different equation. For many addicts, taking illegal drugs is the only way to feel OK about life. Some of these people never manage to get clean, but the ones with this reason for addiction who do (or who try to) get clean, it can be surprisingly easy to deal with the withdrawals, because they're aware of how shit life was before they first started using the drug, and the idea that the rest of your life will be as shit as before you started using drugs can be a far more scary thought than someone who's life was basically good except for their getting hooked on a drug. To quote one of the all-time great TV shows, and surely the best about authentic portrayals of drug users, dealers, and cops - The Wire - Waylon, a former addict and narcotics anonymous sponsor, says “Getting clean’s the easy part. And then comes life.” I guess that's true for both types of addict I've talked about, but it's even more true for the addicts who turned to drugs because they hated their lives than for people who had lovely lives until they accidentally got addicted to a drug that they thought was fun to try. reply forgetfreeman 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah and we could have a pretty interesting conversation on the success rates of court-mandated rehab programs. reply nine_k 16 hours agorootparentprevDon't at least some of them want to gain control of their impulses? reply SkyBelow 16 hours agorootparentprevGiven the number of possible things wrong with a human that leads to bad behavior, it seems like an extreme claim to suggest that desire to make a change is a necessary component in any successful therapy. Part of therapy can be building that desire. For example, therapy for issues stemming from learned helplessness are a counter example, as learned helplessness implies lacking a desire to make a change as they have already been conditioned to seeing it as impossible. The therapy involves building up that desire by having minor successes that end up breaking down the mental block which formed. reply lelanthran 14 hours agorootparentNone of what you said is quantitative and/or objective data. reply jacobgkau 14 hours agorootparentA \"sincere desire to make change\" isn't quantifiable in the first place. reply lelanthran 2 hours agorootparent> A \"sincere desire to make change\" isn't quantifiable in the first place. Well, that's my entire point: why use it as a metric or target? How do you tell if you achieved the objective when the target metric is unmeasurable? When the goal is (in GP's words) \"building that desire to make a change\", you can never tell anything about progress towards your goal: when you've achieved the goal, when you've not achieved that goal, when you're making progress, when you're making it worse - those things are all subjective.

Those non-managerial pay ceilings were laughable pre-Covid, and now it's gotten just surreal, still based on a flat national average of what they consider the job role to be, something that's also gotten surreal, with Kinkos employees being included in sw engineer pay codes. It's worsened by the fact they can't really take advantage of remote workers, somewhere with less CoL, in Alabama or Pakistan or whatever. Everything's on site, and it really does seem like every defense company I've ever worked is sited in some random shitty place where the local economy - if there is one - is composed of the company and three Applebees-like chains that service it. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentprevMost defense industry contracts are awarded to the low bidder, so contractors underbid just to continue operating. But then that leaves them without sufficient revenue to pay market rate wages to employees with the specialized skills to deliver on the contracts. Most defense companies still manage to muddle through somehow but it's messy. reply bequanna 12 hours agorootparentI don’t think that's true. Most large contracts are cost-plus. Contractor direct costs + some agreed upon margin. reply Retric 10 hours agorootparentContracts where all profits scale 1:1 with costs are a relatively small slice of total spending due to obvious poor incentives. Fuel and similar commodities may look kind of like a cost+ contract, but it’s market price + X$ not market price * some profit margin so the incentives are different. It’s a net win for both sides if such variables are removed from the equation. reply selimthegrim 12 hours agorootparentprevPlease tell me this doesn’t happen in medtech too reply duxup 16 hours agoparentprevI worked with a guy who had multiple jobs like that, was supposed to be on call 24/7 for the job that he had in common with me. One day he finally answered the wrong phone with the wrong company name when his boss was out of town and some director tried to contact him in an emergency. He was highly skilled, but also was not well liked by his peers. He knew how to suck up to no end, deflect blame for his own mistakes, and how to get out of work (presumably so he could do his other jobs) and get it dumped on others. He was hated by his peers and it was no surprise (to anyone who worked with him as a peer one on one) when he got caught. It was a similar situation where his skills were excellent when tried, but he chose to put them to use put to use to shaft other coworkers and honestly not do much at all / work elsewhere. I ran into him later and as usual he was all about the excuses and about how he felt the folks at the company were bad people and so on, but it was like everything with him, a little truism that he bent to mean that he should get his no matter what the cost to anyone. reply Teever 9 hours agorootparent> but he chose to put them to use put to use to shaft other coworkers and honestly not do much at all / work elsewhere.

And was that about creating/delivering something specific? Or did you pay him for sitting on a chair for 8+ hours thinking exclusively for you?

I see this edit added later: >But he simply didn't have the time to execute because he was secretly splitting his time between 3 companies. So he was fired for low productivity, even though he had all of the skills needed to be extraordinarily productive. That would be a legit reason to fire them! Or it could be a post-facto rationalization (\"he worked elsewhere too, so he couldn't have been productive\").

If someone is seems smart and skilled enough to have high output, but actually has low output, most companies/managers will spend a lot of effort and time trying to improve the situation. Obviously the guy is smart, so perhaps we just haven't onboarded him properly, or $POTENTIAL_REASONS. It might take 2-4 months before you're sure enough it's never going to work out. You hope things will improve. But if, during that 2-4 months, you find out the guy has another job, that hope disappears instantly. This is my most charitable read of what happened, and I've heard of cases just like this. reply listenallyall 9 hours agorootparentIf you've got the \"best engineer I ever worked with\" in your employ, is firing him really the best option? Was he even asked how to get 100% of his time, effort and attention? Or even 50%? What if instead of trying to squeeze 3 jobs into Mon-Fri 9-5 he was given free reign to schedule his own hours, including nights and weekends? It just seems that terminating the relationship without exploring other options is more of a jealousy/pissed-off reaction than a rational decision. reply rahimnathwani 9 hours agorootparentSo let's imagine this is how it went down: 1. The person impresses everyone during the interview process with their skills and potential. 2. Initially, the person doesn’t meet the expected productivity levels. They give various plausible reasons and commit to improving. 3. Time passes but there is no significant improvement in their output. Management invests time and resources in identifying possible support and interventions to help enhance their performance. 4. It’s eventually discovered that the person is only dedicating 2-3 hours per day to their role with your company, instead of the agreed 8 hours, because they are simultaneously pulling the same scam with two other companies. In this situation, I don't think it would be rational for a manager to try and work out a suitable working relationship. The person has already shown they are dishonest and cannot be trusted. This not about envy or anger, but about using past behaviour to predict future behaviour. reply listenallyall 8 hours agorootparentThere was no mention of any warnings or interventions or probationary periods. The OP said he was fired for working 3 jobs, and then later edited that to say it was due to low productivity. Lets be real -- a \"brilliant\" engineer knows what is expected, knows how to do quality work, and certainly is capable of meeting minimum output to avoid getting fired, even just putting in 10-15 hours a week. The whole story seems kind of off. reply rahimnathwani 8 hours agorootparentOK I think the point I was trying to make is getting lost. All I'm saying is: 1. The fact that someone hasn't yet been fired for underperformance doesn't mean they're meeting expectations, and will be retained indefinitely without improved performance. 2. If someone in that situation is subsequently discovered to have a secret second job, then the reason for underperformance will be obvious (they never intended to put in the effort that would be reasonable to expect for a full time job), so there's no longer any good reason to believe their performance might improve. reply listenallyall 7 hours agorootparentAnd I'm saying, the \"best engineer you ever worked with\" is fully capable of avoiding the low, low bar of being fired for underperformance, even splitting his time 3 ways. So something about the story doesn't seem exactly right. reply ffgjgf1 3 hours agorootparent> is fully capable of avoiding the low Maybe you’ve just worked with different engineers and at companies that have different minimum standards? reply listenallyall 2 hours agorootparentOr, maybe the original story was true that he was actually fired simply for having multiple jobs, because the bosses were butthurt, and the later edit about low performance was not really entirely accurate. It doesnt sound a bit strange to you when the OP states that \"his talent went to waste\"? Don't you think the \"best engineer you ever worked with\" could pass an interview rather easily (I mean, he already did at least 3 times) and get back to work somewhere else? Is the OP implying that losing this particular job was so devastating that this brilliant engineer quit the industry? reply rahimnathwani 7 hours agorootparentprevThe bar depends on the level at which they were hired. reply nlitened 4 hours agorootparentprevYou never want to work with a dishonest person, even if they are brilliant. reply fragmede 15 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like X job wasn't getting done. If one hires an X, and only gets .2 X, it becomes material that there are 4 other jobs trying to happen. reply listenallyall 5 hours agorootparentprev> Parent already said he was fired when they found out he working at another 2 places, which is different from the new story that they saw \"low productivity\". Exactly, which is reason to be at least a bit skeptical that this story went down as described. > post-facto rationalization Highly likely. Once the entire world suddenly shifted to remote in Q2 2020, everybody and their mother thought about juggling multiple jobs, and a few went ahead and tried it. Why wouldn't a brilliant engineer give it a shot? Instead of firing this dude, management should have taken a hard look in the mirror and ask if they have failed to compensate top-tier talent sufficiently, and whether they provide proper motivation, freedom, and insulation from bullshit meetings and time-wasters. I'm not saying don't ever fire him, but that should be an absolute last resort. The initial steps should be to figure out a way to retain his services and contributions. reply kevmo314 17 hours agoparentprevSince he could've been valued at up to 3x what the company was paying him, why doesn't that make the company the con artist? reply tadfisher 16 hours agorootparentHis fraudulence created an illusion that suckered 3 employers into paying him a salary. I don't think that implies he's worth 3 salaries. reply ryandrake 16 hours agorootparentSeriously though, -if- he's performing up to expected standards at each of this three jobs, and there is no conflict of interest between these companies, why is it a problem? The only real problem seems to be that he didn't disclose it--not that there was anything inherently immoral about taking more than one job. When someone holds down three low-paid service jobs, we congratulate them for working their ass off.

Don't over-extend yourself! reply atomicfiredoll 8 hours agorootparentprevI'm not a lawyer, but in general I think it would come down to the laws where this took place, the nature of the work, and the impact on the employee's ability to fulfill their job duties. My understanding is there could be a common law duty to the employer at play, even when the employee didn't sign a noncompete and there's nothing specifically called out in the employment agreement. It's also my understanding that if the employee acted to the detriment of the employer, such as compromising their own ability to perform job duties (as happened here) or competed against that employer, they may be in breach of that duty and could be terminated for cause depending on the specific laws. So, if anybody is thinking about trying this, it's probably worth checking into local laws and potentially keeping records such as the hours worked for each employer. I would assume it's slightly more cut and dry when an hourly employee is in breach, since the hours are normally already tracked. reply free_bip 16 hours agorootparentprevWhere's the fraud if he did what was asked of him? reply ziddoap 16 hours agorootparentEvidently, he didn't. >So he was fired for low productivity reply free_bip 16 hours agorootparentMy comment was posted before the edit.

In California, any dollars of taxable income you earn over $1 million gets taxed at this rate. So if you earn $2 over this threshold, the majority of these two dollars, rounding up, will be taxed.

(Incidentally, I don't approve of working multiple jobs simultaneous like this without your employers knowing, I think it's unethical.

Ultimately as long as I get my job done to my employer's satisfaction, that should be all that matters. Seems like that was the real problem with the guy who got fired upthread; the discovery of the multiple-jobs thing was a convenient way to fire him without having to deal with documenting the low performance, a PIP, etc. What I think is unethical is companies making employees sign a \"I won't work anywhere else while employed here\" thing when they start work. reply shawabawa3 15 hours agorootparentprevBeing fired for low productivity is usually a long and slow process even in the US Having a solid reason can mean instead of PIPs etc you just immediately terminate reply jrochkind1 8 hours agorootparentSo if they were fired more quickly than they could be fired for low productivity, it sounds like they were fired for something other than low productivity, no? reply listenallyall 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen we're talking about a \"brilliant\" engineer, the \"best I ever worked with\", the wise manager looks for ways to adjust the employer-employee relationship keep him, not seeks reasons to immediately terminate. reply rjbwork 17 hours agoparentprevProbably should have paid him triple the salary to be the best engineer you ever worked with then. reply sbrother 17 hours agorootparentNah.

You even give your own examples of a non-financial motivation before you got \"wise\". Only caring about money sounds like hell to me. Look at everyone that chooses a calling or career that doesn't pay well like teaching or much of our health system. Please don't assume they are stupid people making bad decisions - they often know exactly what they are doing (e.g. my extremely smart teacher friends) and part of their gross income is the non-financial payoffs of the job. Personally I think society depends strongly on people chasing satisfaction from their jobs, and sectors which only chase the money have a rather sick ambiance (although perhaps necessary sectors?). Every good tradie is proud of their work.

Anything and everything you asked him, he was: - always the victim - going to get his lawyers - subtly threatening violence - demanding something strange or bizarre, like documents he didn't need access to. For people not used to it, it was a shock. He seemed affluent by every standard. reply DoreenMichele 13 hours agoprevI found it incredible that such brilliant and attractive people would be dumb enough to risk it all for the relatively paltry gains that embezzlement can earn. I kept looking to see the underlying motivations... In one of the Star Wars movies, Luke takes a starfighter and flies to another planet, pursues training with Yoda etc. I'm pretty sure the other timelines in the movie don't reasonably match up and I don't recall this causing a big hullabaloo. What people will blithely accept in a popular movie tells you something about their mental processes. It tells you something about how tolerant they will be of half-truths and stories not quite adding up IRL. And some people like exploiting that fact for some reason. They usually have an excuse -- \"I'm some minority group or other and we never get a fair shake.\" But the reality is, as the author says, they just like it for some reason. Most people have partial info and make decisions based on simple rubrics, not comprehensive overviews of some unknown future. People routinely see what they want to see -- \"Look! Free money -- again!\" -- and blithely ignore inconvenient truths -- \"Oops! Arrested again.\" Comments suggesting \"right to be forgotten\" is problematic are correct.

They have the trust of a company or person and know that they can take a few bucks without anyone knowing. It starts small at first and grows to levels where they get caught. I knew a guy who was a cashier. The company he worked for decided to save a few bucks and got rid of the person who cashed him out each night and verified his transactions. He decided that he could steal a few bucks since no one would know. He started small and increased a bit. It was never a lot but he did it regularly. He continued and eventually, he got caught. What's interesting is that it wouldn't have happened had he not had the easy opportunity of take the cash. reply omoikane 16 hours agoprevThis reminds me of \"All The Queen's Horses\"[1], where a woman embezzled $53 million through careful accounting.

If anything, I think the takeaway is that grifters will always grift, because it's in their nature to find cracks in society they can use to their advantage. It's not about right or wrong, it's about seeing the world in a different way than most people do.

There are two classes of people in this world, those who sell their labor to live and those who live off the labor of others, neither because of their ingenuity or efficiency or lack thereof but the circumstances of their birth. The latter gets to enjoy all that the world has to offer at a baseline, and the former gets a taste of it when the latter deems it appropriate.

I can assure you that the majority of such people worry only about the appearance of honesty and morality, not the substance.

Or rather, we created it, by allowing such people to gain power and influence, and even seeing it as a good.

The \"nice guy\" is likewise a conman, because his whole dishonest performance is to ingratiate himself with someone, as if doing so entitles him to something in return (think of the \"nice guy\" who tries to please women in order to receive attention, affection, or sexual favors, and then either pouts and whines, or becomes nasty, either overtly or in passive aggressive ways, when he doesn't receive them).

    "originBody": "T-MobileNewsLeaks T-Mobile Employees Across The Country Receive Cash Offers To Illegally Swap SIMs JMAN100 APRIL 15, 2024 3 MIN READ We’ve reported previously on the issue of “SIM Swapping”, where a bad actor illegally and fraudulently obtains access to someone’s phone line by swapping the SIM card on the line to one they possess. This allows the criminal to use the line to obtain two-factor authentication codes sent to the victim for the purposes of accessing online accounts. Often, this results in the victim losing money, either from their bank accounts or crypto wallets. Separately, T-Mobile has had issues with data breaches in the past, including one back in September affecting employees of a third-party retailer named Connectivity Source. Now a bad actor appears to be using employee data to contact them offering to pay for SIM swaps. According to multiple posts on Reddit, as well as separate individuals sending us tips here at The Mobile Report, T-Mobile employees from all over the country are receiving texts offering them cash in exchange for swapping SIMs. The texts offer the employee $300 per SIM swap, and asks the worker to contact them on telegram. The texts all come from a variety of different numbers across multiple area codes, making it more difficult to block. The text also claims they acquired the employee’s number “from the T-Mo employee directory”. If true, it could mean T-Mobile’s employee directory, with contact numbers, has somehow been accessed. It’s also possible the bad actor has live/current access to this data, though we consider that less likely due to the fact that some impacted people are former employees who have not worked at the company in months. Where did this private information come from? Still, the biggest issue here is how this person (or multiple people) obtained the employee phone numbers. We’re not sure yet which employees are impacted, but based on comments online it seems at least a few third-party employees are affected, and we’ve independently confirmed current corporate employees have also received the message. Though we can’t say for certain, this likely means the information is not the same data as what was leaked during the Connectivity Source breach. We can’t, however, eliminate that possibility. As mentioned, there are reports that some of the contacted people are former employees, and haven’t been employed at T-Mobile for months, so the information being acted upon is likely a few months old at the very least. That being said, we’re pretty confident based on corporate employees being included that this is a different source of data being used. We reached out to T-Mobile PR and received the following response: We did not have a systems breach. We continue to investigate these messages that are being sent to solicit illegal activity. We understand other wireless providers have reported similar messages. T-Mobile What it means for customers This news isn’t exactly comforting to customers, either. The fact that criminals still see SIM swapping as a viable way to make lots of money means companies haven’t done enough to help prevent them from happening. Plus, with so many employees being offered a way to make some quick cash, it’s conceivable that a few of them might take up the offer, which means customer accounts (and money) could be at risk. What you should do as a customer Fortunately though, as a customer, you have ways to protect yourself. If you’re concerned about a possible SIM swap, you should take a few precautions. First and foremost, if you use any services online that have two-factor authentication, be sure it is not SMS-based. Use an app like Google Authenticator or Authy for this purpose instead. Sometimes, services may have SMS as the only option for two-factor. If this service is a bank or a crypto wallet, consider switching, because that isn’t great. That being said, you should also enable SIM protection on your T-Mobile account. To do this, you can follow the instructions in our guide here. Hopefully, this isn’t a new breach from the carrier known for data breaches lately. The best case scenario is the affected employee numbers are from the leak back in September, but it’s just as possible this is a new breach or method of access that affects many more. As always, we’ll keep you updated if we learn more. Enjoy this post? Consider supporting us on Patreon!

There was a time many years ago when Google Voice would intermittently fail to ring or even forward calls to another number when I tried that, and then give no indication that a call was ever made to your number that you missed (I verified it by asking when people I knew called me and said I never got back to them), which is pretty bad when you're expecting to receive important calls sometimes. This went on for months. I received bare minimum support which didn't even come close to helping the issue even though my issue was voted to the top of the support boards because many other people were having the same issue at the time.

Because you can port a landline to Google Voice for $20, and, in my experience, random Internet \"phone number lookup\" sites still show it as a landline years later. reply yurishimo 2 hours agorootparentThe number gets classified differently in the \"official\" phone number database when you port it to a new carrier, including Google Voice. I used to have my US number in GV but ran into a lot of the 2FA issues as as well as trying to use it overseas extensively. Eventually, Google will figure it out to the point where it is no longer tenable to try and keep working around it. I caved and bought a $5/mo eSIM plan from Tello. They don't seem to care that I'm not in the US 10 or 11 months out of the year. I can use wifi calling to send/receive texts for 2FA for free, and iOS even supports using the data of one SIM/eSIM as the \"wifi\" for a different phone line also present on the device. So even if I'm out, I hop into settings, turn on the second line, it uses my EU data plan to fetch new messages via \"wifi calling\" and then I get my 2FA code or whatever. Takes about 30 seconds in total. Is it the most convenient thing ever? No. I have an older iPhone because I'm a cheap bastard so I turn off the other line when I'm not using it, otherwise it will constantly look for a compatible roaming signal which it will never find because I have not authorized any international charges on that account (battery drain). reply aosmith 6 hours agorootparentprevCNAM is the database you're looking for, maybe LIDB too.

It's not even clear whether they protect against a port-out attack, which is probably worth worrying about as well. reply twright0 10 hours agorootparentPresumably Efani accomplishes that additional protection by maintaining a human support staff they put more resources into training than the average carrier. That's expensive, especially when you consider that it's a relatively niche service (so small user base to amortize that cost over) and presumably only used by people that really care about sim swaps, likely because they are frequently targeted for sim swaps, and thus the training needs to really work. They also have no other lines of business like device sales/financing that could help cover those human operational costs. That, plus the fact that it's a premium service that is mostly only useful to higher net worth / higher income people, makes it seem reasonable that it would be quite expensive relative to a regular provider. reply gruez 9 hours agorootparent>Presumably Efani accomplishes that additional protection by maintaining a human support staff they put more resources into training than the average carrier.

Whatever training they give to staff to resist sim-swap attacks, I can't imagine they can't be more complicated than the certifications that \"Computer User Support Specialists\" have to get through, so I think it's reasonable to model their support costs at $30/hr per person. With the premium they're charging over a budget MVNO they can afford two support people per customer. How many fraudulent sim swap attacks could the worst client possibly attract?

T-Mobile is easily the biggest offender for this, most people reporting they use it, so this has been going on for a long time. The other big problem with Twitter security is you can have your account taken over even if you use non-sms 2FA!

Carriers should have procedures in place to ensure that the identity of someone who presents themselves with this situation is verified, but it can often be bypassed. In the case of the article, corrupt employees of the carrier are being bribed to bypass the ID and security checks that should take place in the above situation. In other attacks, there are social engineering ways of bypassing the ID checks - such as claiming to be the victim of a robbery where both the phone and wallet were taken - so they don't have any ID, credit cards, or phone to prove who they are and that getting a new SIM would really help them out. reply flutas 13 hours agoparentprevSim swapping is typically \"put their phone number on this sim card I control\" the point being to bypass any SMS based 2 factor auth / alerts. reply hotpotatoe 11 hours agoprevThis isn’t limited to T-Mobile employees, I work for a T-Mobile MVNO and received the offer reply hn_throwaway_99 13 hours agoprev> Where did this private information come from? > Still, the biggest issue here is how this person (or multiple people) obtained the employee phone numbers.

SMS is actually a perfectly good channel for 2FA for most customers in most cases. Because most customers, most of the time, are not under a targeted or even semi-targeted attack. SMS 2FA protects quite well against large-scale brute force or credential stuffing attacks. If someone is checking 10k accounts against the 3 top passwords (yes, this is a very common attack type), those customers will be very well served by having SMS 2FA. SMS is a terrible channel if anyone is trying to target you directly though, that's absolutely true. edit: also, in case this wasn't clear - I'm not talking about any services that allow password reset through SMS alone - that's beyond idiotic, obviously. reply ImAnAmateur 12 hours agoparentThat is a very convincing argument for why SMS should be replaced entirely for everyone. reply snarf21 12 hours agoparentprevWhile you are right, you're missing the real problem. SMS 2FA is a systemic threat vector for identity takeover. Buy out one employee for $20 and you have access to take over any one of millions of users. Additionally, the victim won't figure out there was an attack right away. And the attacker can live anywhere in the world. If someone wants to rubber hose me, they have to physically come to my area and that doesn't scale except for high value targets. Tolerating SMS as 2FA is absurd with built in passkey capabilities backed biometrics/code built into a device you can buy for $100 and already carry with you 24/7. reply patmcc 11 hours agorootparent>>>and that doesn't scale except for high value targets Real-world activities (kidnapping, rubber hose, fingerprint stealing, whatever) aren't worth it for medium-value targets, true - but my point is that SIM swaps aren't either - for low-value targets. From the article, they're offering $300 per - so the expected value from these specific compromised accounts must be more than that (I'd guess $1k min). This makes it pretty clear that if you're protecting accounts worth ~$50, SMS is probably \"good enough\". And for some users that's the right trade off. reply pyrophane 12 hours agoparentprevBut isn't it the case that most sites will tell you if you pass a password check before hitting you with a SMS verification? In that case I could see someone attempting a sim swap attack for accounts where they pass a password check for higher value stuff like primary email or anything that is probably linked to a spending account reply patmcc 12 hours agorootparentThat assumes the attacker even has the phone number - best practice is to not display the full number, just the last 4 (xxx-xxx-1234) - so again, for the typical case, the attacker isn't going to know what number to sim swap. SMS is bad at protecting one account, it's good at protecting 10000. reply ImAnAmateur 12 hours agorootparentThe minnow security model is bad at protecting one fish, it's good at protecting 10000. What would you say is an advantage unique to SMS that would be lost if text messages were switched to another model? I'm asking sincerely. There aren't many people arguing in favor of SMS here, so you seem like the right person to ask. reply patmcc 12 hours agorootparentIt's pretty simple - there are people who don't have smart phones, plus people who couldn't manage to install/use a TOTP app. Something like ~10% of users probably fit in that category. So either you offer them no protection (if 2FA is optional), no use of the service (if 2FA is mandatory), or ok-but-not-great protection (if you allow SMS). (In reality, some users don't even have SMS (no cell phone) - so automated voice calls can be offered too. Those without any phone at all...will not be considered as valid customers, in most cases.) reply pyrophane 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but say I am an attacker doing some kind of brute force password hack, and I have a certain number of successes. Given the funnel there, it might well be worth it for me to put some energy into figuring out who the person at the other end of that account is. Phone numbers aren't secrets. reply patmcc 11 hours agorootparentYeah, agreed. But again I'm not arguing that SMS is the best second factor, I'm arguing that (used correctly) it's better than no second factor, which is what it's actually competing with in the real world. Generally, I think services should offer TOTP, email, and SMS, and strongly encourage TOTP. But not offering SMS just means some segment of customers won't have a second factor at all. reply Terretta 12 hours agoparentprev> SMS is actually a perfectly good channel for 2FA You might have different definitions of both \"perfectly\" and \"good\" than the researchers who found in every case with every major phone provider, the SIM could be stolen.

SMS is a horrible authentication mechanism. The entire industry has regressed from the bad combo of email + password to something almost universally worse in a matter of years, and it's incredibly frustrating. The only saving grace is that SMS are quite expensive in some countries, so companies there have an incentive to not actually send them out if they can at all avoid it. Unfortunately they're effectively free in the US. reply TimJRobinson 10 hours agoparentprev> I'm not talking about any services that allow password reset through SMS alone - that's beyond idiotic, obviously. Twitter allows this, it's been a security flaw for years they've never fixed, and it's possible even if you have non-sms 2FA enabled!

[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37736318 amluto 16 hours ago> Just one problem: you won’t find any SDR on the market that will claim to be able to sample a wave oscillating over a billion times a second. This was true, but not any more. You can get truly impressive “direct RF sampling” or “direct RF conversion” receivers that are more than fast enough for GPS. For example: Xilinx RFSoc: https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/903/ds889_zynq_usp_rfsoc_... A nice National Instruments article: https://www.ni.com/en/solutions/aerospace-defense/radar-elec... And their referenced off-the-shelf hardware: https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/category/flexrio-custom-instru... One might be forgiven for being a bit puzzled as to why NI thinks that direct RF conversion is cost-effective but nonetheless sells the device for $30k :) That being said, if I were prototyping a system that wanted phase-coherent wideband reception around 3 GHz and I had a proper lab and budget, I’d buy a few of these. If I were to go to production, I’d either wait for costs of a homemade board to come down a bit or see whether a traditional heterodyne receiver could do the trick. Hmm. For military applications, if I were concerned about really advanced RF-seeking weapons pointed at me, a direct conversion receiver is probably great — there won’t be any leakage of the LO that an enemy device could try to detect. reply elevation 16 hours agoparent> there won’t be any leakage of the LO that an enemy device could try to detect Why would an LO be more of an issue than your sample clock? edit: missing word reply amluto 15 hours agorootparentI don’t know all the details of this kind of technology, but I would imagine that one direct RF receiver’s sample clock looks effectively identical to any other similar receiver’s sample clock. So if these devices become popular, then a military sample clock is indistinguishable from a civilian sample clock. In contrast, an LO is rather application-specific. reply londons_explore 13 hours agorootparentFor military use, where you are trying to blend in with civilian equipment, either the direct sampling clock, or the local oscillator frequency, could be randomly chosen in quite a wide range at bootup and still have the device work. In todays world with everything software reconfigurable, changing the sampling rate or local oscillator frequency is very do-able. reply AnarchismIsCool 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's very hard to prevent the LO from leaking into the ADC input. Putting the filters in the right places would cause a lot of issues for the signal chain so a common workaround is trying to null it with a 180 degree out of phase LO signal. reply kaitocross 4 minutes agoprevDoes it only support the US-made GPS (NAVSTAR GPS) or other GNSS systems like Galileo as well? reply AdamJacobMuller 18 hours agoprevCool article. Whenever I see \"from scratch,\" I'm always curious to see how from scratch the author actually means so I'll admit I was a bit disappointed to see that the hardware was just RTL-SDR. Still, the protocol decoding was very interesting and the result is great. > GPS was launched in 1978, which was 45 years ago at time of writing. Five billion people are currently under 40 years old, so well over half the world’s population has never existed in an environment but this. A note based on this. While GPS was around since 1978 the signal was intentionally degraded with a process known as \"selective availability\" until 2000. This largely rendered GPS unusable for many many purposes, definitely useless for road navigation, it had some limited utility in areas like backcountry navigation and was definitely useful for marine navigation. > gypsum can go from a cold start to a fix on the user’s position, and the precise time, in less than a minute of listening to the antenna This is very impressive and outclasses what I see even commercial receivers doing today, do you have any idea how? I remember on road trips in the early 2000s I would have to sit on the side of the road and wait for the GPS receiver to get a fix (a 15-20 minute process, when it worked) before we could leave. Or, more likely, my mother would just start driving with paper maps. reply londons_explore 13 hours agoparent> GPS was launched in 1978, I would like to point out the insanely good design of the GPS radio layer (the L1+L2 signals). Even 46 years on, the radio layer is fully forwards and backwards compatible, and a bunch of important metrics like time to first fix and user equivalent range errors have both improved by factors of 10-1000, with no incompatible change needed to the protocol. The total RF transmit power to provide service to the whole earth is less than the electricity consumption of a typical US house (far less than 5G or TV or AM/FM radio), and well below the noise floor. That's possible due to clever use of stacked gold codes. The design has allowed frequency-sharing with competing systems (eg. Galileo) - you don't see mobile phone networks doing that! The actual signal sent has allowed things like carrier phase decoding, due to the locking of the phase between the modulated data and the carrier, which in turn gives far better pseudoranges and accuracy. Overall, the designers either had incredible forethought, or incredible luck, or some combination of the two. reply codyd51 17 hours agoparentprevHi! Yes, \"from scratch\" is definitely always a bit of a funny term. I also implemented the receiver in Python, which is quite far from \"scratch\" =). What I mean by it in this context is that I'm taking a piece of hardware that knows nothing about GPS, and just has the ability to sample the EM field, and building up a receiver from there. Re. slow TTFF, or time-to-first-(position)-fix on older hardware, this essentially stems from advancements in processing power. Traditionally, GPS receivers would need to download the ‘almanac’ of all the satellites, which takes a minimum of 12.5 minutes (under certain conditions) due to the GPS data transmission format and speed. With modern processing power, though, receivers (including gypsum) can just ‘brute force’ the search space to find the in-view satellites, instead of using the hints downloaded over the air. This is the technique described at the end of Part 1. reply tialaramex 17 hours agorootparentThe fast TTFF on a typical modern device e.g. your phone is because the device has the Internet, and so it can obtain all the information it needs from the Internet up front, it isn't magically brute forcing everything needed, that's not practical at all. The 12.5 minutes includes a rough multi-week almanac which you could perhaps brute force given available compute and receive capability (original GPS receivers have a single channel receiver and minute compute capability) but they more importantly include the ephemerides, precise data about exactly where the birds are and the atmospheric conditions, replaced hourly by a ground station. You can't \"brute force\" these - they're parameters measured by someone with objective truth like \"I, a massive NASA satellite ground terminal in Florida, am definitely not moving, therefore this GPS bird #14 is 0.08 metres away from where it should be, I will adjust the data for the next hour accordingly\". reply codyd51 17 hours agorootparentYes, I forgot to mention downloading the orbital parameters over the network! Thanks for mentioning this as well. In this case, I was meaning to refer to brute-forcing the Doppler-shifts and PRN phases of each satellite, not the orbital parameters themselves. The project in the OP is able to get a position fix in less than a minute because, if the subframe timings are convenient, you can retrieve the necessary ephemeris parameters from the subframes in that span (and down to as little as 18 seconds in ideal conditions, if my back-of-the-napkin is right). reply makomk 16 hours agorootparentYeah, the key reason this enables so much faster time to first fix is that the precise ephemeris parameters are transmitted much more often than the full almanac, but only from the satellite they apply to whereas each satellite broadcasts the entire almanac covering the whole constellation. If I'm understanding the info out there correctly, every transmission of the ephemeris data comes with only 1/25th of the almanac. Most decent modern-ish receivers tend to have pretty speedy aquisition time without any assistance data. For example, the reasonably ancient GPS running watch I use can usually get a GPS lock in a couple of minutes from cold with no internet access (in a wrist-sized device running on battery!), and even the two decade old SiRFstarIII chipset is specced to have a sub-minute cold start time without assistance and much shorter with - though I think that chipset was pretty advanced for the time. reply michaelt 15 hours agorootparentprevYou don't need to brute force the almanac - why would you? But it's very much feasible to 'brute force' your initial signal lock by searching for all gold codes at a range of frequency offsets. And it doesn't take 12.5 minutes to get the ephemerides - the almanac is sent in paginated form which is why it takes so long, the ephemerides are sent more often - they repeat every 30 seconds, and they're enough for a navigation fix. Although 30 seconds isn't amazing, so cell phones do use their data connection to shortcut that wait. reply tialaramex 13 hours agorootparent> You don't need to brute force the almanac - why would you? I have no idea, but the claim was that you get faster fix with brute force when I know that's not why it's fast in practice. > But it's very much feasible to 'brute force' your initial signal lock by searching for all gold codes at a range of frequency offsets. I hadn't even imagined this constituting \"brute force\". Is my phone using \"brute force\" to find the WiFi router? At some point it's not really \"Brute force\" it's \"There are a handful of options, try all of them\" and GPS seems past that point especially on modern hardware. This actually reminded me of a (possibly no longer extant) design choice in Encrypted Client Hello - we don't necessarily know if the encryption was done with key F we gave out yesterday afternoon or key G which we just began using an hour ago, do we need a way to signal that in the connection? No, just try all valid keys. If you can't afford to try more than two keys, make sure you only roll them slowly so you won't need to. reply michaelt 12 hours agorootparent> I hadn't even imagined this constituting \"brute force\". Is my phone using \"brute force\" to find the WiFi router? Early receivers were a lot less advanced than modern receivers - one of the key functions of the almanac is to help receivers figure out what satellites they can expect to see - thus greatly reducing the range of gold codes and time offsets they have to check. Unlike wifi, GPS signals are below the noise floor until the gold code is applied to despread the signal, and the gold code has to be synchronized with the received signal to detect it. The gold codes are pseudorandom and designed to stop signals interfering with one another. Unless you know which gold code you're looking for, and find its time offset (accurate to about 2 chips in 1023) you can't tell it apart from noise. You also don't quite know the frequency you're looking for - partly due to the imprecision of the receiver clock, partly because GPS satellites move very fast and so can have a lot of Doppler shift (depending on where they are in the sky relative to the receiver of course) Back when receivers had more limited physical hardware, searching through ~30 different satellites, multiplied by ~500 different gold code offsets, multiplied by a few different Doppler shifts could be a slow process. Especially if you'd found a handful of satellites, so some of your receiver channels were tied up with tracking leaving you with fewer for searching! So ignoring the almanac and brute forcing every satellite, gold code offset and doppler shift is one of the many ways performance has increased since this stuff was developed in the late 1970s. reply myself248 10 hours agorootparentSmall note -- the codes are named after Robert Gold, so being a proper noun, they should be capitalized, just like Gray, Hadamard, or Golay codes. reply error503 13 hours agorootparentprev> I hadn't even imagined this constituting \"brute force\". Is my phone using \"brute force\" to find the WiFi router? At some point it's not really \"Brute force\" it's \"There are a handful of options, try all of them\" and GPS seems past that point especially on modern hardware. Your phone only needs to listen to the WiFi router on one channel at a time in operation, and the signal parameters are well enough defined that they can be scanned quickly. A GPS receiver requires at least 4 parallel channels to achieve a position solution, and there are up to 32 possible codes the satellites could be at. Scanning 6 channels across 32 codes, and then also sweeping phase and doppler shift to lock them , just to 'discover' if there is a valid signal there takes time, and this is what older receivers had to do. Modern receivers tend to just 'brute force' this by having an entire receive pipeline dedicated to every possible PRN all the time, and possibly even correlate multiple doppler shifts simultaneously as well, so they effectively have 32 (or more) receive channels, despite only ever expecting a maximum of 12 birds being visible. The extra channels are necessary more or less exclusively to reduce acquisition time, so I think it's fair to call them 'brute force'. reply aaronax 17 hours agorootparentprevRelated: Satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), of which Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is the USA implementation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNSS_augmentation reply Cyph0n 17 hours agorootparentprevAs an EE grad, I would still consider what you did to be “from scratch”.

I took a roadtrip in 1999 using a Delorme Earthmate Hyperformance GPS receiver, the RS-232 version, plugged into a Toughbook running Delorme Street Atlas USA, I believe it was version 6.0. It provided perfectly usable directions all the way across the country. It didn't do lane guidance (which I don't find terribly helpful anyway), but some time in advance of every turn, it would announce the turn, including the street name. That version even had voice recognition, so you could say things like \"are we there yet?\" and it would announce the ETA to both the next stop and the final destination, along with current location. Lots of fun! 30 meters (typical worst-case CEP under SA) is plenty accurate for road navigation in all but the densest areas, and even then, just glance at the map. Once you're out on the open road, it's brilliant. Rock out to some mp3's until the voice pipes up with the next maneuver. reply aspenmayer 10 hours agorootparent> Delorme Earthmate Hyperformance GPS receiver, the RS-232 version I have one of these, but don’t really know how useful it is or what I can do with it, but like all of my random antique hardware, I don’t really have any good reason to part with it either. Do you have any ideas for what to do with it? For that matter, what is a good GPS unit in modern times? reply myself248 8 hours agorootparentIt's a SiRFstar chipset and speaks the SiRF binary protocol, not standard NMEA0183, so it was difficult to use it for anything else back in the day. Apparently there's a simple command to put it into NMEA mode, but I think that's not preserved across power cycles or something? It was a long time ago... I'm tempted to snag one off eBay and go on a roadtrip down memory lane. These days, it depends on what you're doing with it, but it's hard to go wrong with this thing that claims to have a U-Blox 8-series chipset: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32816656706.html Uniquely among such cheap receivers, that unit can even be configured to report raw data, and is thus the darling of the Galmon project for low-cost observers starting up. Also fun if you want to play with (single-band) RTK, etc. (Dual-band has gotten \"affordable\", by which I mean \"under a kilodollar\", which is tremendous given where it was just a few years ago, but you'd probably know if you had a use for dual-band.) reply michaelt 17 hours agoparentprev> I'll admit I was a bit disappointed to see that the hardware was just RTL-SDR. Somewhat surprisingly, if you went back 15-20 years, a lot of what the author is doing in software here would have been done in hardware. GPS receivers used to market themselves by the number of tracking channels they had, as cheaper receivers might only have the hardware needed to track 6-8 satellites while a more expensive receiver might track 12. So this software-defined receiver actually implements quite a bit of what would otherwise be hardware. And of course it can track every satellite in view. The software-defined approach has some powerful benefits - for example, initial satellite acquisition involves calculating cross-correlation between the received signal and various gold codes. Being able to do this in the fourier domain lets you acquire signals pretty fast! If you want a hardcore DIY GPS receiver, going right down to the transistor level, you'd probably enjoy reading https://lea.hamradio.si/~s53mv/navsats/theory.html - an 1990s era DIY GPS receiver, complete with hand-drawn schematics, hand-drawn PCBs, even a hand-made antenna. reply makomk 16 hours agorootparentI think even these days, a lot of what the author is doing here is still generally done in hardware for power efficiency reasons - it's just that nowadays, the hardware looks a lot like the software-defined architecture used here with a conversion to digital at the frontend followed by hardware accelerators for doing cross-correlation in the fourier domain. Actually, this kind of approach of implementing the architecture an SDR-based receiver would use as specialised hardware seems to be pretty common in general nowadays. reply epcoa 16 hours agoparentprev> While GPS was around since 1978 the signal was intentionally degraded with a process known as \"selective availability\" until 2000. This largely rendered GPS unusable for many many purposes, definitely useless for road navigation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_navigation_system. Moreover, while often not ideal in dense urban environments(modern receivers often struggle here anyways), by the late 90s differential GPS augmentation was available in cars as well, which was available in dense coastal population areas like NYC. Old auto nav systems were clunky and with overall shitty map data but they weren't \"definitely useless\" due to SA. EDIT: I'll concede they were pretty bad, but SA was only one factor. With today's computing power and higher quality maps you could more easily adapt to the SA position error if it were an issue as well. reply kube-system 16 hours agorootparentThe truth here depends on the definition of \"useless\". Automotive GPS systems existed pre-2000. So did dead-reckoning systems. Did people use them at the time? Some did. It was an amazing technology compared to the alternative, which was manually navigating a paper map. But you'd often get errors large enough (50m avg) that it wouldn't accurately identify your location on roads close enough to provide accurate instructions. If you gave any of that tech to someone today to use, they'd think it was broken. reply sllabres 14 hours agorootparentAs example the TravelPilot IDS/1989 first prototype from 1983 (see [1] if you want a picture) IIRC the system used a compass, a shunt for the heating wire from the rear window (it would alter the compass because of its magnetic field) and two wheel sensors measuring the rotation of the wheels.

You're supposed to be an employee, not a slave. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 10 minutes agorootparentUnfortunately, most countries don't have, or don't enforce, penalties for companies claiming rights they don't have. So that's the first part: Companies claim, often using vague or misleading wording, to have more rights than they can legally claim. And what they can claim varies but can go quite far. For example, even employee-friendly California with a law specifically to limit far reaching clauses (https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/lab/division-3/...) allows terms in employment agreement that assign to the employer the ownership of \"invention[s] that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employers equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information\" as long as they \"Relate ... to the employers business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer\". For a megacorp, that can be basically everything. The second part is that in some countries you can be fired for any reason, or no reason, except for specific protected reasons. \"We didn't like your blog post and are worried that you might accidentally reveal company secrets in one of them in the future, so we're letting you go\" would be legal in many places. \"All social media or personal web site content has to be reviewed to make sure you're not leaking company secrets\" is also a demand some companies make. Likewise \"we want you to give 100% at work and your side project clearly shows you're spending too much time elsewhere so we don't believe you're working to your full potential\", even though stupid, would be a perfectly legal justification to fire someone in many countries. Or just the manager silently thinking that and silently retaliating through e.g. denying promotions. reply noman-land 18 hours agoprevI really love how this article is paced in real time from the first person as a learning adventure.

The P code itself is publicly available in publicly available specification IS-GPS-200. They are xor-ed by W code, which like the sibling comment says, is cryptographically generated, which runs at a lower rate. This results in P(Y) code signal, which is then transmitted over the satellites. If you know whats the P code roughly is, which you can know from L1CA code and handover words, you can try using both possible W code value (its 0 or 1) and that W code practically dissappear, until the W code move to its next iteration and you need to guess again. This strategy is called semi-codeless tracking. People did this so they can access the signals at L2 frequency (1227.6 MHz), which because its at a different frequency than L1 (1575.42 MHz), they got slowed down by different amount through the ionosphere. So by comparing the signals together, you can remove the ionospheric effects and get more accurate position.

Only with a jammer? reply codyd51 17 hours agoparentGPS jamming or spoofing on a wide scale is definitely a viable attack! As another commenter noted well, making everyone appear at exactly the same location would be nigh-impossible, though. GPS receivers will look for the 'strongest' PRN signal in the noise, so broadcasting louder than the (incredibly weak!) C/A signal is a valid way to jam or spoof GPS. It is, however, generally illegal for civilians. GPS receivers operating with good practice do tend to try to mitigate this sort of attack, by (for example) ignoring signals with a too-high power level. It's a bit of a cat and mouse game, and there are academic papers exploring each side. Lastly, GPS receivers also need to deal with interference from GPS itself! If GPS signals bounce off surfaces before reaching the receiver, the receiver might see two sets of GPS signals: one that arrived directly, and one that was scattered off a surface and arrives a bit later. This is called ‘multipath interference’, and part of what goes into making GPS receivers work well is mitigating multipath interference. reply error503 13 hours agorootparent> making everyone appear at exactly the same location would be nigh-impossible, though. I don't think this is actually the case. In a spoofing scenario, all of the rogue signals would typically be generated by a single terrestrial station. The time of flight of all of the generated signals will be the same, so all that matters is the position solution reflected in the transmitted signals, as the fundamental principle of GPS based on TOF is no longer in play. So I'd think that in a typical spoofing scenario, all receivers thinking they're in more or less an identical location is what you'd expect. It might be possible in a borderline case for the receiver to receive some spoofed signals and some real signals simultaneously, in which case you'd expect weird results, but I think you'd definitely see a correlation around the position being broadcast by the spoofer. reply pictureofabear 17 hours agorootparentprevJust to be a little clearer, jamming and spoofing are the not the same thing. Jamming obfuscates a signal, usually through noise. Spoofing impersonates the signal. reply pictureofabear 17 hours agoparentprevYou are talking about spoofing, not jamming.[1] This may be theoretically possible but is, in reality, practically impossible. Embedded within the GPS signal is the ephemeris data which, among other things, includes each satellite's location in space. Receivers calculate position by calculating the difference between the time a signal was received and the time stamp encoded in the signal itself. By analyzing the signals from a minimum of four satellites (one for each dimension in time and space), a receiver calculates where it is. To spoof all phones on Earth, you would need to trick each receiver individually. Since receivers are passive, they don't identify themselves, and there would be no way to target each individual receiver, making them think they're somewhere they're not. 1. Jamming is obfuscating a signal, usually by creating a lot of noise that makes the real signal hard to find. Spoofing is impersonating a signal. reply Rebelgecko 17 hours agoparentprevRegular jamming just degrades the signal quality. You can blast out fake data, but depending on what you mean by \"large area\" and a \"point\", I don't think what youre suggesting is possible. To trick GPS receivers you end up broadcasting fake signals from multiple GPS satellites, so receivers in different areas will be processing it differently and come up with different coordinates. reply darkhorn 17 hours agorootparentSo does this means that in recent days there wasn't GPS jamming but GPS satalites were broadcasting fake signals?

    "title": "Neon Revolutionizes Postgres Development",
    "originLink": "https://neon.tech/blog/neon-ga",
    "originBody": "CompanyApr 15, 2024 Neon: A New Approach to Database Development Neon is Generally Available ⚡ We just launched Neon in Product Hunt. Give us a review ⚡ Postgres continues to hold its position as one of the most popular developer databases ever created. While MySQL lost some of its luster after acquisition by Oracle, Postgres continues to win more developer trust. In 2023, it topped the poll in the StackOverflow Developers Survey and in the same year, was voted the DBMS of the Year by DBEngines. The current internet meme is “Just Use Postgres” for everything. Despite popularity Postgres suffers from the two problems that beset nearly all relational databases. It is difficult to scale up and down without interruption. Worse, it takes a long time to restore production operations when software bugs affect the data. This happens because with Postgres it’s hard to create a high-fidelity developer environment as it requires copying the full state of the database. With that, maintaining multiple copies of data and schema for every developer is a major pain in the neck. The database becomes the nexus of development for most teams and invariably is the bottleneck constricting developer velocity. What developers need When the Neon engineering team approached these issues they knew they had to solve several problems with today’s database development lifecycle: They wanted Postgres cluster creation to be fast (sub-second) They wanted Postgres clusters to be able to scale up and down automatically as the load changed. You don’t need to worry about over or under provisioning. They wanted to be able to create branches with full data copied instantly so developers could work independently while still being able to collaborate effectively They wanted to restore to a point in time in seconds instead of hours or days Almost every app needs a database, and while developer tools and workflows evolved with platforms like GitHub and Vercel, databases did not evolve to match the developer experience of these systems. Evolving developer experience around the database requires a fundamental rethinking of the database architecture. But this is not a “look at our cool new database” engine. We know developers love and want to use authentic open-source Postgres. So, at Neon, we looked at how we could change the experience of developing on Postgres without losing everything that makes Postgres great. We borrowed an idea from Amazon Aurora, the separation of storage and compute; and we aren’t talking about simply using a network-attached disk like EBS. True separation of storage and compute opened up the possibility to scale both parts of the service independently. Unlike AWS Aurora we decided to open source all the changes in Postgres and also send them upstream as well as fully open source our cloud native storage. We made architectural decisions that ensured that our users have the complete Postgres experience, including Extensions, internals, command line and management tools. Everything that worked on-premise should work in our cloud service. An additional benefit from separating storage and compute is – well we have a brand new cloud native storage implementation and we can “do things” in it. Controlling storage allows us to implement branching – a flagship feature that unlocks a better developer experience for building database apps. What does this mean for the user? This means we can create branches at any point in time and start a compute instance pointing to that database version. So, every developer can work on a different branch without colliding with their colleague’s work. Compute can now scale independently of storage so the CPU size and count can accurately match the load. Even large database loads have peaks and troughs. We wanted to avoid developers having to size for the largest expected load. A database branch is copy-on-write, so it only points to a set of already created and stored pages. So, branches take less than a second to create. Because they are copied on write branches incur no space overhead until data is written to them. Suppose a developer fat fingers a table or a database out of existence? No problem, move the branch to the second before that event happened. Starting a new database or recovering from a production failure happens in seconds because the Neon architecture doesn’t require you to ship hundreds of gigabytes of data to create new instances of databases and servers. Users don’t want databases, they want data. Neon is designed to take the overhead of starting, stopping, creating, and cloning databases from hours to seconds. The major velocity inhibitor of modern development is the relational database. Imagine if data was easy, what would it do to your developer productivity? With Neon database branching is integrated directly into the developer workflow and without interruption. When database data and/or schema changes take hours to propagate across the development team everyone suffers. Neon is the next big pivot for Postgres, and all of these changes have been offered upstream to the Postgres community. They are available in our public repo today. Our mission is to provide everything Postgres developers need and less. Less waiting for clusters to start, less waiting for databases to restore, less waiting for colleagues changes to deploy, less waiting for the DBA team to schedule their updates. How did we get here? During our Preview we’ve been focused on building a solid technical foundation for Neon. Some of our favorite milestones: In December 2022, we removed the invite-only gate to Neon. Today, thousands of new Neon databases are created weekly. Neon includes a generous free tier that is here to stay: the Neon architecture makes it efficient for us to support it. We made database branching available to everyone. Today, tens of thousands of branches are created weekly by Neon users. Neon branches include data and schema, allowing developers to create isolated copies of their data in 1 second. Neon also included API support right from the start. The Neon API has now matured into a robust tool that enables Neon partners to easily manage fleets of hundreds of thousands of databases. They automate all database operations via the API, removing the need for dedicated DevOps for managing Postgres fleets. We also released a serverless driver. Today, the Neon serverless driver has +100,000 weekly downloads. Developers use it to speed up their JavaScript and Typescript deployments. On the topic of speeding up deployments, we launched our Vercel integration, which creates one database branch for every preview. Today, thousands of Neon database branches have been created via the Vercel integration. A few months into our Preview, we released the first version of autoscaling, a foundational feature that expands the Neon serverless experience. Today, thousands of autoscaling events are happening every week, saving developers the work of resizing manually. We also made the Neon CLI available to all users, so developers could simplify their integrations and automations by managing Neon directly from their terminal. Today, our CLI has hundreds of weekly active users (and counting). During the months of Preview, we put a special focus on improving our scale to zero and cold start behavior. Today, tens of thousands of Neon databases scale to zero every day, saving developers money. And we keep working hard on our cold start metrics: we are now at a P50 of 500 ms to start a database, and we’re working to reduce it further. Try Neon Neon Postgres is Generally Available. Serverless autoscaling and instant branching are built for modern developers who have to iterate fast. Go faster with Neon, it’s ready, give it a spin.

How much had you played with pg before you tried Neon? Can you expand what you mean by 'glitchy, slow and laggy'? Slow connection due to cold starts? Scale-up? General inconsistency in performance? What kind of data volumes were you working with? I ask because my experience with Neon has been completely different to what you just described. Ever since their 'closed beta' days, it has always 'just worked'. Their CLI has been great, none of my automation has ever bombed out without good reason, and I've never seen it cost me more than I expected. Notably, I was also able to self-host it with relative ease, and found that they actually encouraged people to do so. (In contrast, there are a number of similar 'open source' offerings such as Supabase that I've tried self-hosting, and found that while their core codebase is on GH, it is extremely difficult to deploy outside of their own environment. Not intended as a dig at Supabase, they do some really great work and contribute a ton back to the Postgres community - I'm just using them as a relevant example). As an aside, I've also met people from Neon at various conferences, including co-founder Heikki. They all struck me as genuine Postgres enthusiasts & great fun to geek out with. Neon (like Supabase) have been _really_ pushing the envelope on Postgres for the last couple of years, and have sponsored some significant developments & proposals. In my view they're a 'real OSS company'. While that probably does rose-tint my view of them a little, that's important to me & makes me happier to give them my money. They've certainly done more for Postgres than AWS ever has. reply mattashii 12 hours agorootparentThank you for the confidence and praise!

I have nightly backups dumped to Cloudflare R2 from a GitHub action. If Neon announces they're shutting down, migrating the database to another provider is a bash 1 liner and an hour of downtime. If Neon just \"goes dark\" I can recover from the nightly backup and lose at most 24 hours of data - data that is denormalized into other systems and can be manually recovered if absolutely necessary (but probably not). Not every company is the same, but for many use cases the database layer is an inconsequential decision as long as the API is fungible for your use case. Not every decision is a 1-way door.

R2 for storage. Neon for database. HTML/JS/CSS for the frontend. Neon wasn’t a micro-optimization. It was the only vendor in town that would own that much of the DB layer’s responsibility (D2 wasn’t prod ready yet). 12months in and so far so good.

Depending on the plan it looks like it can cost anywhere from $1.50 to $1.75 per GB. That feels pretty excessive; maybe I’m missing something that causes it to be so pricy?

However, many production databases won't scale to zero often. The serverless proposition is still valuable if you factor in the development, test, and staging environments scaling to zero plus our autoscaling that doesn't require downtime or dropped connections. For guaranteed message delivery, you're probably best of using a messaging system designed with that in mind instead of listen/notify. reply pc86 18 hours agorootparentIs it possible to set the production database to have a minimum scale of 1? So even if it \"should\" scale to zero it won't? reply joshstrange 18 hours agorootparentYes, you can set the min/max for scale. I scale down to “.25” as my min. reply mj4e 19 hours agoparentprev(Neon PM) This is true and very often production applications need access to their database 24/7, so they benefit from the serverless nature of autoscaling. reply bilalq 19 hours agoprevStorage is the most surprisingly expensive part now. $1.50/GB is kind of a tough pill to swallow. We've been exploring the idea of shifting from Aurora to Neon. With the recent pricing changes, our bill has exploded even with almost zero usage of compute time. reply GordonS 18 hours agoparentThis almost feels like how cloud providers charge excessive fees for excess bandwidth.

If you're willing to discuss your project's specifics, contact me directly mike@neon.tech as I'd love to chat. reply csomar 18 hours agoparentprevYeah, I am not sure what \"scales to zero\" really means. The storage costs + pre-paid compute could essentially buy you an AWS instance. Sure you do get things configured from the get-go but if you can get your way through Terraform that can work too. Either way, if you get big enough (will use more storage + compute), it makes sense to move. I'd be against such platforms as they make changes to Postgres that might make you depend on them. reply tristan957 11 hours agorootparentOne case where scale to zero can help is if your main branch scales to zero, that means more compute hours for your non-main branches. FWIW, Neon is really \"just\" Postgres. I can't think of anything Neon specific that would lock you in, other than that we don't support certain kinds of extensions yet. But if you were going to use those extensions, then you probably wouldn't have picked Neon in the first place. I also wouldn't consider that a lock-in. Do you have any examples that you might be aware of in Neon? Postgres compatibility is something that we take very seriously. (Neon employee) reply nikita 19 hours agoparentprevWe are currently lumping storage retention history (we store all the history for a period of time so you can time travel) and backups together. We are rethinking this, please stay tuned reply bilalq 18 hours agorootparentEven if backups/history were taking up zero space, $1.50/GB seems really high for raw storage. The rest of the pricing seems reasonable to me. We're only around 100GB right now, but can see that ballooning up in the future and raising some concerns. By the way, I do want to say that branching is a game changer. The recent usability improvements like graphs/metrics and being able to reset a branch to the state of another one without affecting the endpoint is so nice. We previously had a messy script that took care of creating a new branch, moving endpoints, renaming, deleting, etc. More fine-grained permissions for users on projects would be my number one ask at this point, but overall, I really appreciate the improvements the Neon team has made in recent months. reply tristan957 11 hours agorootparentPermissions improvements have been duly noted by others, so expect that work to begin sometime in the near future. Reducing our COGS is very important, and also something that we will be working on. I would definitely reach out to our sales team for a more custom quote. (Neon engineer) reply throwaway5959 17 hours agorootparentprevI’m confused, are we talking about object storage here? Like $0.023/GB in S3 storage cost? reply est31 17 hours agorootparentNeon keeps an NVME cache in the Pageservers, and it also keeps copies of the data in S3, one for the main storage, and one for the backup case. The data also gets stored on special replicated storage (Safekeepers). So it might be in 6 different places at the same time (3 safekeepers, 1 pageserver, 2 S3 buckets), details depending on the data's lifecycle through the system. This architecture delivers really good safety: Once your transaction commits, the data is already replicated across different AZs, and this is done without there being an S3 request each time. It also means that Neon can deliver features like branching. (Neon engineer) reply leftcenterright 16 hours agorootparent> So it might be in 6 different places at the same time (3 safekeepers, 1 pageserver, 2 S3 buckets), details depending on the data's lifecycle through the system.

I can imagine that it is substantially slower. But would be happy to be surprised, if not. Or to learn how Neon compensates the missing filesystem cache. reply sakras 15 hours agoparentNeon engineer here. We implemented our own local cache between the pageserver and Postgres (called LFC).

Perhaps Neon could swap to something like this internally: https://github.com/porsager/postgres. Having run a local dev environment connected to Neon and tests connected to Neon got in our way of adoption. We'd prefer to develop and run tests against a regular Postgres localhost database.

For the staging server, I just locally installed postgres, configured it, and it works perfectly fine. On the flip side, I'd rather just focus on code, and if there's a free tier (which neon has), I'd rather shell that off to a service. So, my question is, what trade offs am I making other than a persistant/local db to off-site (ie probably a degree of speed). Since it's free, does that mean my data might be inspected? I'm under an NDA, and my client would prefer his data stays in-house unless there's a good reason for it not to be. reply mbil 18 hours agoparentThe free tier gets spun down to idle after five minutes of inactivity.

You can read our privacy policy here: https://neon.tech/privacy-policy. Neon will never be as fast as a database local on your computer, but performance is always something we are paying attention to. reply devjab 18 hours agorootparentIf you’re aiming for EU compliance you’re going to need to host the data within the EU and only have EU staff have any sort of access, like running support on it. Microsoft is exempt from that last bit for some reason, but they are Microsoft so they probably cheat. Won’t be a lot of EU enterprise that will be capable of using your services without rather strict compliance. Which may or may not be in your interest but you might as well just be up front about it. With the way EU is heading in regards to data protection it may not just be enterprise organisations either by 2025. Those compliance laws are getting stricter and stricter by the day. reply tristan957 17 hours agorootparentWe support EU regions.

I’ve used it a number of times and am impressed at how quickly databases become available. Leaps and bounds faster than RDS. it’s amazing when you need something now. reply amluto 18 hours agoprevHave you considered publishing pricing for larger databases? It would be interesting to know whether the offering would be useful at sizes not covered by the listed tiers. edit: given the headline feature of infinite PITR capability, knowing the price tag could be quite important. Especially if purging old data isn’t supported (is it?) reply tristan957 11 hours agoparentOur Sales team is more than happy to communicate about custom deals. I don't know if our team has given thought about more plans on the web page. I would think we want to keep the number of plans small to give users an easier time parsing the page. I think competitors typically have similar number of plans, but I haven't checked in a while. reply amluto 10 hours agorootparentAha, I see the $15 per 10 GiB/mo extra in the little info box. That’s … steep, especially for cold data. I have an application on MySQL that I’d love to move to a service like Neon. Maybe I’ll port it to Postgres some day. But not at those storage prices, at least not without serious care. reply aargh_aargh 18 hours agoprevReading the pitch and this solves all of the problems I don't have (as a developer and operator of services that don't need to scale to millions of users). How often do you need to clone/restore whole databases, really? But I may be misunderstanding the pitch. reply mj4e 18 hours agoparent(Neon PM) instant branching in a development workflow because it's like git but for your database. You can develop or test against an exact copy of production without the risks of testing on production. Autoscaling is useful if the load on your datbase varies (you can save money, even if your app isn't serving millions of users). reply figassis 17 hours agorootparentUntil you start firing emails and texts to your production customers :-) That aside, I think Neon is pretty cool. I will wait some time to see how stable a service it is, whether price hikes happen often, or whether VC money destroys it. I think Autora for me is too pricey, but I settled for self hosting PG on Hetzner. I'm there bc Hetzner has been stable for me for years. What I fear the most is having to migrate a db off of some service bc I stopped being their target audience. I know this sucks for startups trying to make it but a risk is a risk. I'll wait and see. reply neeleshs 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is very cool for troubleshooting in production. Testing/developing against a production copy is a no-no, if I'm hosting my customer's data. reply sgammon 18 hours agoprevI tried Neon for our startup but ended up going with Planetscale. The stability guarantees seemed weak and still scare me. I would be happy to take another look, but I've had no problems with Vitess, it has been a dream. congrats on your guys' launch to GA. reply tristan957 11 hours agoparentI don't really see a reason to move off of Planetscale, which is a very mature offering, if it works for you. There is always a cost when moving Postgres providers, doubly so, when you're moving from MySQL to Postgres. I think the Postgres ecosystem has many differentiating factors where MySQL and MariaDB just can't compete. (Neon engineer) reply yawnxyz 19 hours agoprevThat pricing is quite \"less generous\" than Turso: https://turso.tech/pricing I'm wondering what accounts for the difference; is Turso just bleeding money on smaller tiers, etc? reply SwiftyBug 19 hours agoparentThe founder of Turso explained how they can have such a generous free tier in a tweet: > Lots of people have been reaching out to me asking if they should expect our free tier to be around, given recent news. > Yes, you can expect our free tier to be around. > The main reason we built a service on SQLite is that we knew we could build the most efficient thing in the market with that.

To me it doesn't really matter if it's Supabase/Neon, Turso, or D1 powering it as long as... it works Is this faster / more resilient? reply filleokus 19 hours agorootparentWith Turso you get an sqlite database behind a SDK or an (HTTP REST) API endpoint. With Neon you get a postgresql database over a postgres wire format connection. So if you have an already existing app speaking postgres to a database somewhere, Neon is a drop-in-replacement, while Turso would require adapting to their custom API. If you are creating a new service, you might need/want to take advantage of e.g postgres extensions [0] for storing geographical data or pg_vector for similarity searches etc. Or you simply need more stringent serialisability promises than what libsql / turso can provide. But if you just writing something new from scratch and have \"simple\" demands, I think something like Turso looks cool (and cheap!). [0]: https://neon.tech/docs/extensions/pg-extensions reply djha-skin 19 hours agorootparentprevI'd probably care because of the ecosystem. There's a bunch of developer tooling and mature ORMs around postgres. Granted, those same libraries/frameworks probably work with sqlite too. I guess it's just trust. I trust postgres more than I trust sqlite for building big apps. One last point: I'd look at feature set of both offerings. I suspect the features of the postgres offering to be more conducive to scale. reply nop_slide 19 hours agorootparentprevThey both could be faster or more resilient depending on your workload and what you want that to mean.

I assume I'm misunderstanding some fundamental part here. If the branches are achieved using a COW file system, how does this part from the blog post work? > Suppose a developer fat fingers a table or a database out of existence? No problem, move the branch to the second before that event happened. How can I go back in time arbitrarily here? I would have assumed that you can only go to existing snapshots if the underlying method is a COW file system. reply sakras 19 hours agoparentThis is achieved through our Pageserver. The pageserver ingests streams of WAL, and so contains both snapshots and deltas. This lets us efficiently seek to any LSN by replaying page deltas on top of the nearest snapshot (we call it the GetPage@LSN API). This blog post has a lot more details: https://neon.tech/blog/get-page-at-lsn reply mattashii 19 hours agoparentprev(Postgres hacker @ Neon) PostgreSQL writes changes to disk using WAL for consistency. Every WAL record is a set of changes to the PostgreSQL data directory (data files, metadata, ...) that need to be persisted together. Neon indexes this WAL, and restores pages to the right version by replaying all WAL from the previous page snapshot up to the right version, allowing full point-in-time for all persistent tables in the database. reply leftcenterright 16 hours agorootparentCalling it \"branches\" does seem misleading. For instance, would this also work across major PG versions? afaict, it is just not possible to merge two differently versioned postgres-es reply mattashii 13 hours agorootparent> Calling it \"branches\" does seem misleading. Branching in Neon should be interpreted more like the branches seen in graph theory's trees rather than the featureset exposed by git: the whole history of a Neon project is a unidirected graph with a single path between any two points in the history. > For instance, would this also work across major PG versions As for multiple major versions: We currently can handle multiple major versions in different tenants on the same pageserver/safekeeper servers, just not for the user's PostgreSQL instance. Major version upgrades (by way of pg_upgrade) are something we're working on, but that's still quite far down the road. > afaict, it is just not possible to merge two differently versioned postgres-es Correct, and AFAIK we don't actually advertise anything related to merging histories.

So that 300h of compute is for other branches? Still 24/7 for primary compute on Launch? reply mj4e 18 hours agorootparentThe Launch plan includes 300 compute hours. All your computes draw from this, regardless of whether or not it's a primary branch. For a simple comparison, let's assume you only use 0.25 vCPU computes and your primary compute runs 24/7 (~750 hours per month) to keep the comparison easy: 1. On the Free plan, you can have the primary running 24/7 plus an additional 20 hours for other branches. 2. On the Launch plan, you can have the primary running 24/7 plus an additional 450 hours for other branches. And of course the 10 GiB storage + other paid features.

    "originLink": "https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/",
    "originBody": "12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 9 April 11, 2024 A Curious Phenomenon Called ‘Etak’ Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007. But I’m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be. Today, I’d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world’s first practical vehicle navigation system. Here’s a picture of it: At the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon Valley’s San Jose Mercury News said about it: The Etak Navigator launched 39 years (!) ago in 1985. 😱 Back then Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating the end of the cold war. And it was the year Steven Spielberg released the film “Back to the Future”… Credit: Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Universal Pictures And I’m sure at that time many of you were but a twinkle in your mother’s eye… Back in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas Brother’s map of Los Angeles: As you can see, the maps weren’t always pretty. By today’s standards it was also supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult to work out how to get there. So, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future. It immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science: Nearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch. Most important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see “12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 — Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?“) Before GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‘dead reckoning‘. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are. To solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today. Like all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed. The second key invention was a ‘heading up’, moving map display. This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive. Third: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‘geocoding’. Here is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action: As you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives. The buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen. The top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north. The address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection. You could also store common locations like home and work. The Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen. These were soft programmed depending on the current function. In the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name: And after that you simply selected the street from a list: This is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode: Note that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take. The lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well! Etak Navigator System Details There were five key components to the Etak Navigator: The first was a vector CRT display — similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope. The navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8″) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80″) per second! There was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle. To determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers. Finally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk. The cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called “Etak Maps”. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area: The original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395: That’s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today. On top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system. Just Some of the Technical Hurdles Back in 1985 there were huge technical constraints. GPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive. In addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn’t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly. The most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass. Here the solution was topological map matching. This invention, above all others, made the product viable. Another issue was data storage and latency. The cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek times. The dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional medium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the tape. Years later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily available Etak’s highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in spades and resulted in very high performance maps. Another problem was heat. Users commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get very, very hot. You can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well: However, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of polycarbonate. Yet another problem was dealing with inclines. The map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a hill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the road was not equal to the distance traveled on the map. To compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute this Etak’s lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used fluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that Tequila worked quite well! Another problem were magnetic anomalies. Bridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass. The positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an anomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of the wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn’t quite machine learning, but at the time it seemed pretty close! The system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the rear window defroster. In 1985 there wasn’t the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip. Instead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz and only had 29,000 transistors. Thus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in C, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly. What about the digital map? Etak had to create it — more or less from scratch. Originally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the US Census Bureau had something called GBF DIME files (which predated TIGER). But they were stick maps and didn’t contain any shape to the roads. Etak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key metropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe. To reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as ‘USGS quads’ as a reference. Each map was photographed onto 10” transparencies and then scanned using a very expensive drum scanner. The entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX minicomputer. This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It cost about US$120,000 in today’s dollars. This little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported: 4 map digitizing workstations The engineers developing and compiling code Batch jobs to process and compile all the map data The company admins who used it for word processing This was the coding environment: A dumb monochrome terminal. You edited code using the ‘vi’ editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your programs to compile. The jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run … which was longer the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The engineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately after a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering a statistical fallacy). The map digitizing environment was also revolutionary: Each digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color graphics card and a 19” monitor. Initially there were four workstations which were manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak digitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends. The map editing system was the first ever to use ‘heads up’ digitizing and was a huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was never patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes — especially from the CEO of a particular company called ‘Environmental Systems Research Institute‘ — i.e. a gentleman called Jack Dangermond who I’m sure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept. 😉 Before this invention people used to digitize ‘blind’ using digitizing tablets which was highly inefficient and error prone. Etak’s map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics card very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad in greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on top. The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to digitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses: The Amazing Team Behind It Etak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, Stan Honey. Stan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class navigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by relying on his navigation skills. Before founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. Stan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the director of technology for the America’s Cup sailing races where he developed a system to track the America’s Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per second! The original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur, Nolan Bushnell, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to navigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu. Nolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for founding Atari. The story is recounted by Benj Edwards in his fantastic article for Fast Company: “Who Needs GPS? The Forgotten Story of Etak’s Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System“: [Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead reckoning and comparing one’s current location to known points on a map, a technique known as map matching. It wouldn’t need satellites at all, just a good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display the result on an electronic screen. Nolan reaction: “Yeah, let’s do that and I’ll fund it” Nolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might eventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said “Let’s say you’re in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You’ve got this box on the dash. You punch in ‘Japanese,’ then ‘cheap,’ then ‘good sushi.’ The box takes over and guides you to a place.” One of Etak’s key hires was Marv White. Marv was a map scientist and mathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program. Under Marv’s direction Etak’s map digitizing productivity was three times the industry standard. Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting ventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN. There were many other supremely talented engineers behind the Navigator, many of whom previously worked at SRI International: Ken Milnes, George Loughmiller and Alan Philips to name a few. Many of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations, including yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my colleagues were Etak alumni. Etak Staff in 1993: Terry O’Brien, Marv White, Walt Zavoli, Alan Philips, Jamie Buxton, Ken Milnes, Stan Honey, Gerry Russell So What Happened to Etak? The Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of the hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable business proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?) Instead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest automotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM in the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own navigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a ‘Personal Navigation Device’ from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and many others was born. During the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps an unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. It was News Corps’ John B. Evans that saw the potential. Like Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on the same platforms as Intel’s Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology megastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in John’s obituary in the Guardian: The defining deal of [John’s] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch’s US organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented, Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar. In the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet, travellers’ views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations, complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel reservation systems. It was thus that John had the vision to use Etak’s maps and technology to benefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak. Stan Honey recounts the conversations: John instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of “where is the nearest?” and “how do I get to it?”. Naturally, John and my shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and experience. I remained close friends with John until he passed away and visited him often. Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee’d up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record attempt under sail, I’d always invite John to come visit the boat, which he found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls. I doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch’s radar screen without John Evans’ vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak. At the time of his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then running Fox, for his opinion. Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry also supported News Corp’s acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps. John really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell. During the Etak days, both would visit and “wind-up” the Etak crew with their predictions. That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide open. But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which visionaries seldom are. It is interesting to note that all of the things that Nolan and John predicted, have happened. It is also interesting to remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits. But the times there are a changin’: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold the Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar sold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened. News Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele Atlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was originally Etak is now TomTom: But Why the name ‘Etak’? The answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days the ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of environmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them. They imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved past them. In the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it’s the maps that move past the vehicle… With that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a Polynesian term for moving navigational reference points. But Wait, There is One More Thing… When you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed something? Have you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location? Does it look familiar? Well, of course it does … So it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one originally invented by Etak. But why did Etak use that particular symbol? If you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller, he’ll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But you have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office building at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California. Because Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol that didn’t burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a symbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car — 🚗 — required too many lines. It also didn’t clearly connote direction. Something simpler was needed. Legend has it that one of Etak’s engineers got to see a pre-release demo of one of Atari’s latest games. And that game was… And what symbol did Asteroids use for their spaceship? And thus the symbol for vehicle navigation was born and is still used by all navigation apps globally today: So There You Have It… Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Etak’s many significant inventions included: the world’s first in-vehicle nav system that actually worked augmented dead reckoning using map matching moving map heads up display first use of geocoding in a consumer application algorithms for highly efficient map data storage and retrieval heads up digitizing the world’s first high volume digital map production system inventor of the universal map navigation symbol I was but a pimply engineer at the time. Little did I know when I joined Etak in 1985 that I was going to be part of such an illustrious team. My hats off and best wishes to everyone I worked with: it was a privilege, an honor and an amazing journey. Thank you.

    "commentBody": "A curious phenomenon called 'Etak' (maphappenings.com)285 points by MBCook 7 hours agohidepastfavorite74 comments SamBam 5 hours agoThe name is perfect. \"Etak\" refers to a system of navigation used by Micronesian and Polynesian seafarers to navigate from island to island in the vast Pacific Ocean. Much like this device, it operates by \"augmented dead reckoning\" (as it says in TFA). The etak system of navigation involves navigating by stars and ocean swells to get the heading, but a key issue when navigating by dead reckoning over long distances is that if you're a fraction of a degree off you may miss your destination and never know it, so it's also vitally important to know how far you've gone. This is hard when there are no landmarks. The navigators estimated their distance by using intermediary islands off to the side, which they viewed as coming towards them (from their point of view, the navigator stays motionless on the open ocean while the world moves towards them) and past them. These reference islands were called etaks. However, confusingly, the etaks were generally not visible, being beyond the horizon, and sometimes did not even exist. The navigators would have named etaks that they pictured being just over the horizon, whether they were there or not, and would track their procession past their boat. When the set number of etaks had passed, they would know they were in the vicinity of the destination island. If they were not at the right time of day for birds to be out, they would then hang out in the area waiting to spot the birds leaving or returning at dawn or dusk. So the system involves dead reckoning plus a system of turning the navigators' own well-developed intuition of how far they had travelled into a formalized system of generally-invisible islands that they used as a mental model to externalize this intuition. (My knowledge of this is from Cognition in the wild, Hutchins, E., 1995.) Edit: D'oh, I should have finished TFA. This is described at the end, although more roughly. reply Affric 4 hours agoparentThank you for the fascinating comment and book recommendation.

GUIs were still new, DOS was still king, I had experience working on the Mac OS as a beta OS developer, and I'd been working in a 3D graphics research lab (yeah, 3D graphics was research back then), and this company named TeleTrak needed a real time updating map. So I made the GUI for their mapping application, using my knowledge from writing early Mac GUIs, 2D video games and early 3D graphics. Etak was literally Alienware, in it's data structures and extremely efficient processing. Where I'd been expecting significantly slower performance, I'd made a foundation expecting to use various tricks used to the game industry to make it appear like things were happening while loads occurred and so on. None of that was necessary, as Etak was the fastest aspect of the entire software bundle. A single 386 PC with a some type of memory expansion so each had an additional 1MB of RAM above the ordinary 640KB would run the software, and the software was capable of real time tracking above 30fps around 20 vehicles. If tracking a single vehicle, the mapping was fluid with at-the-time incredibly sexy real time 30fps rotations of the map as the vehicle turned corners. While working there, PacTel bought the company. Renamed PacTel TeleTrak, the company suddenly had tours from US and Israeli military brass, so I quit. reply fs111 55 minutes agoprevWhen I started working at TeleAtlas Germany (former Robert Bosch Data; forever a part of TomTom now) in 2005 we still had production processes on the MapEngine technology coming from Etak.

Will share with my team (and I don't do that often!) It seems that Etak was to navigation systems what Jodorowsky's Dune was to 1980s sci-fi: a trail blazing endeavour that was wild and wildly innovative, did not fulfill its intended mission but rather set up an entire field for subsequent success. Also: the design must have included several masterpieces when considering the state of tech in the 1980s: even seeking to the right point on the map cassette is an untrivially hard problem. reply iainmerrick 50 minutes agoparentDo you mean David Lynch’s Dune?

The tech behind mapblast also powered the first version of Yahoo Maps, which was a pretty big deal at the time (this was before Google Maps eventually came in and overshadowed everyone else in that market). I was in my early 20s and working for one of my first tech startups at the time but Vicinity was primarily made up of graybeards who had previously worked for Etak (who was the primary map data provider for the online mapping system we made, so they had a lot of experience with it) and many of those people were also ex-Atari prior to Etak. reply ugur2nd 34 minutes agoprevI'm interested in this kind of thing.

Sure the unit ended up costing as much as the car it was mounted in, but given the limitations of the technology of the time that is simply amazing. To get an idea of how ahead of its time this is, it wouldn't be until a year after the release that High Sierra formatting for CD-ROMs would be proposed. A CD Drive would have added even more expense, but it should would have beat out swapping around dozens of cassettes. I wonder how much memory it had.

This compensates for minor GPS reception errors.

This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen.

Seems quite unwieldy (and how did the poor PC rotate raster graphics?) reply toast0 3 hours agoparentI don't think so... I think heads up for the digitizing indicates that the digital map was overlayed on top of the (scanned) source image? As opposed to digitizing from a paper map where you have the map on a surface in front of you, and a digital map hopefully on a screen in front of you (but they did say some were digitizing blind before this?) and you're trying to get the digitized version right by looking between the two. For the in car map, a vector CRT and vector data makes rotation reasonable. Much less hard than rotating rasterized scanned images on a PC with no rotation acceleration. reply ghostly_s 1 hour agorootparentI’m guessing the 'blind' method looked something like using one of the early graphics tablets to trace routes or tap control points on a paper map according to a sequence displayed on a text terminal, with no graphical feedback to confirm the vector data during input. reply myself248 7 hours agoprevI have a fantasy that someone reverse-engineers the tape data format and is able to render new maps to it.

That's, what, 20-80 rotations per second for a regular cassette tape?! reply light_hue_1 4 hours agoprev> To solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today. No way did they invent this. Not even close! This is called map matching. It predates Etak by at least 20 years, if not more. This paper was published a decade before which does exactly this: Lezniak TW, Lewis RW, Mcmillen RA. A dead reckoning/map correlation system for automatic vehicle tracking.

Maybe rendering maps directly to a vector display could be faster by skipping a rasterization process? Any other reason? reply Sharlin 4 hours agorootparentMaps are intrinsically vector data, and a raster graphics display back then would have been low-res, 320x240 at most, making the map (and text!) really difficult to read. And then you’d need the rasterizer itself, using precious CPU cycles and memory bandwidth to turn perfect mathematical line segments into crude pixelated approximations. And yes, the memory needed for the framebuffer was also likely an issue. The question is more, why would they ever have used a raster monitor? None of the advantages of raster were applicable, and the disadvantages were all relevant in their use case.

The device is using a CRT vector display, so instead of the CRT drawing each pixel row line by line, each shape on the screen is drawn one by one as small line segments. Curves are also possible, but you'd have to formulate the vector shape for it, which is harder than for straight lines. It also looks even cooler in person, as the refresh rate is also really good due to the CRTs, if there's an old arcade close with Asteroids or similar early vector games I'd really recommend going to see it. reply throwup238 6 hours agoprevDid that interface inspire the PipBoy in the first Fallout game 12 years later? reply ghostly_s 1 hour agoparentThere were CRT based in-car record keeping systems used in police cars for a long time before laptops replaced them which had a very similar form factor. reply treve 5 hours agoparentprevIt's possible, but it's also similar to other vector graphics from the time. reply skykooler 6 hours agoprevWhat happened to the original units?

The gyro was a motor spinning a flexible metal plate. As the vehicle moved, the plate would flex, and sensing the plate's position gave a rough turn rate. The inclinometer was a little sealed cup with four capacitive sensing plates. I was looking into using this for a robotics application, but it was too big for an R/C car sized vehicle. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 2 hours agorootparentI'm surprised they had a gyro (the article also only mentions a compass, which makes sense to remove accumulated errors in heading).

I'm quite perplexed about how your perception can be so very different from mine. How many people own a Tesla in your neighborhood?

Make the requirements less dumb: \"All designs are wrong, it’s just a matter of how wrong.\" - Musk 2. Try and delete parts (that seem unnecessary): \"If parts are not being added back into the design at least 10% of the time, not enough parts are being deleted.\" - Musk 3. Simplify or optimize: \"The most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.\" - Musk 4. Accelerate cycle time: \"You're moving too slowly, go faster! But don’t go faster until you’ve worked on the other three things first.\" - Musk 5. Automate. \"I've made the mistake of going backwards on all five steps.\" - Musk Evidently this issue with the accelerator pedal was caused by principle #2: The Cybertruck team at Tesla questioned the requirement to securely tighten the metal plate covering the accelerator pedal, and somehow concluded it seemed unnecessary. Now they have to add it back! --- Source: https://evannex.com/blogs/news/elon-musk-reveals-his-5-step-... reply cduzz 18 hours agoparentColin Chapman, \"guy who made lotus\" had the maxim \"Simplify, then add lightness\" had similar guidance. Take everything out of the race car, then if something breaks add the last thing you took out back in. I imagine he'd get frustrated at a car still running on the victory lap.... \"Darn, the wheels are still on we made the wheel hubs too strong.\" The problem here is safety. Making a race car that disintegrates as it crosses the finish line is best for winning a race, but probably isn't terribly robust in an accident. I don't think Musk is trying to make \"barely safe enough\" cars, but he is exploring a bunch of design limits. I think the CT specifically is an engineering sample or beta program for the model 2, designed to have low uptake and validate a bunch of _really_ big changes to \"normal car\" architecture. When some of those gambles turn out to be bad after 2 years, they'll have to fix thousands of dud trucks not millions of model 2s. reply MitziMoto 18 hours agorootparentThis seems like a misunderstanding of Chapman's quote. I don't think he implied a compromise on safety or reliability, just speed and handling. reply tame3902 16 hours agorootparentColin Champman's own words: 1. A racing car has only ONE objective: to WIN motor races. If it does not do this it is nothing but a waste of time, money, and effort. This may sound obvious but remember it does not matter how clever it is, or how inexpensive, or how easy to maintain, or even how safe, if it does not consistantly win it is NOTHING! 2. Having established this what do we have to do to make it win: (i) Simply stated it must firstly be capable of lapping a racing circuit quicker than any other car, with the least possible skill from the driver, and doing it long enough to finish the race. (ii) After this, and only after this, and with absolutely no compromising of objective (2)(i) one has to consider how expensive it is, how simple, how safe, & how easy to maintain, etc. NONE of these aspects must detract one iota from (2)(i). “Good enough” is just NOT good enough to win and keep winning.[1] [1]: https://jalopnik.com/colin-chapman-s-simple-and-chilling-def... reply jrflowers 15 hours agorootparentThis is a good point because if a race car accelerates into a wall and destroys itself and kills its driver it can still win a race reply cduzz 13 hours agorootparentOld time car races were really dangerous. I think the worst accident was the 1955 Le Mans Accident that killed 85 spectators.[1] It looks like the years (between 1952-1980) of 1956, 1963, 1965, 1972, 1976 and 1979 are noteworthy because those are the 6 of 28 years when a driver wasn't killed[2]... [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_Le_Mans_disaster [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_fatalities reply Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparentYep, but car racing today is orders of magnitude safer than it was decades ago, especially in F1. An insane amount of money, research and regulations has been poured into increasing safety by the FIA. F1 tracks, cars, suits and helmets today are so safe that even on violent crashes at >45G[1] or flaming infernos[2] of gasoline and lithium, the driver can walk out of the wreck with a just a broken rib or a burned hand, whereas in the past that would have meant certain death or at least being crippled for life. [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x45fLUTHCuk [2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ7_En2xEm4 reply cduzz 18 hours agorootparentprevEarly race cars were not paragons of safety. I don't think I'd go so far as to say that Chapman intentionally made his cars less safe to make them faster, but I also don't know that he'd have spent any weight budget to make them safer than the regulations required. IE \"if it's possible to make a winning car win by having the wheels fall off of it as it crosses the finish lines\" -- that's okay VS \"If it's possible to make a winning car win by having the wheels fall off of it as it crosses the finish line, then it bursts into flame and kills the driver\" -- that's probably no okay. But there's a lot of grey area between the two, and that's where winning teams won (and occasionally lost drivers / spectators). Old time car racing was blood sport. https://petrolicious.com/articles/lotus-f1-cars-were-so-frag... reply qwebfdzsh 17 hours agorootparent> Early race cars were not paragons of safety They were death traps, racing drivers were way more cautious back in those days because any slightly severe accident was likely to result in death or severe injuries.

I think the late Robert Dewar (of AdaCore fame) made a similar comment about fighter jets: Is it really a domain for safety-critical engineering if the only thing that prevents the plane from disintegrating mid-air is a continuously running computer program? reply CptFribble 18 hours agorootparentprevCars are not software, and it's ethically and morally wrong to test them in production. Musk is playing games he doesn't understand, and wagering other people's lives to do it. He should at minimum understand that he has many, many fans who trust that he knows what he's doing, and will not expect Tesla's products to be cutting corners on safety and testing because \"simpler is better\" and \"move fast and break things.\" There are ways to find optimizations without removing a bunch of stuff and just shipping it like that to the general public: it's called engineering. If Musk really wants to find ways to optimize the concept of a car further, he'll have to give up on point #4 and accept that it's going to take a lot of test cycles to figure out what works and what doesn't. Rushing out half-baked concepts that are likely missing key safety features because \"let's see what happens\" is exactly the kind of braindead approach to engineering management that is keeping me approximately 10,000 miles from anything Musk is in charge of. reply generalizations 18 hours agorootparent#4 is the feedback loop that enables rapid improvement.

Safety is the new snakeoil. Add just a drop and a sprinkle of \"think of the children\" and you can sell your BS to anyone. reply yndoendo 6 hours agorootparentNumber of European countries require safety to be engineered into the product. Example, where I work, a machine in automation had a risk assessment that it produced 1600 newtons of clamping force, same biting force of an adult panda, could take off limbs. This machine could be sold in the USA and not the Europe. Re-engineered to be safe and sold in Europe, machine cannot even take off a finger. USA is poorly regulated to keep operators safe. Designing for European mark means you can market safer than the competition in USA and sell in Europe at the same time. This also remove the need to build in safety guards or use light curtains. Which one would you or your family members like to use day-in day-out, the 1600 newton limb remover built on USA standards or the one built around safety for Europe? reply aeternum 6 hours agorootparentDepends, I might opt for the limb remover if it is simpler and works more reliably. Time is money and I'm confident I could use either properly so I'd likely waste more of my limited lifespan fixing the safe but more complex and more unreliable machine. If there's no cost to the safety factor then sure, put it in. However there's almost always a cost. We all pay with a portion of our life every time we stand in an airport security line and every time we click accept to one of those EU cookie popups in a futile attempt to keep our data safe.

How could you know anything really, you know? It's just impossible to know that you should securely affix, and test the security of, the cover of an accelerator pedal on a motor vehicle.

They are the 3rd leading cause of death since before Elon Musk and yourself were born. reply coldbrewed 15 hours agorootparentThere's a difference between selling a multi-ton vehicle that has crumple zones and curved lines and selling a multi-ton vehicle that is designed to tenderize pedestrian rib cages. This comment also applies to today's pickups and SUVs; but while those vehicles are pretty nightmarish for the safety pedestrians and other drivers the CT is a further escalation of matters through both design and build quality. reply eropple 15 hours agorootparentprevI don't understand the motivation behind such a question. We sell cars because the benefits to motor transportation outweigh the safety risks in aggregate. That aggregate tradeoff is nonresponsive to the singular case of YOLOing avoidable risks on a Tesla. reply dghughes 18 hours agorootparentprevHagerty has a video on Bugatti and mentions Bugatti buying Lotus.

The slice is not big, but it’s enough to satisfy Tesla. reply tsimionescu 15 hours agorootparentI think it's more likely that it's enough to satisfy Musk. Tesla as a company is probably hurt much more by selling the Cybertruck than if they hadn't made it and had focused on a normal car. reply cduzz 14 hours agorootparentThe CT's weirdness isn't just the silly exterior. I suspect they don't want to sell a lot of them because each one they sell is a potential liability. These new cars are 100% drive by wire; they're all in on their dry cell battery tech, it's 100% 48v for the \"normal\" electronics like power steering and HVAC and instrument cluster, etc. They want to sell the CT to the weirdos who're willing to put up with whatever the heck the truck dishes out. They want paying beta testers to put miles on these things, get them more tested than they can with an internal testing program. Only once the tech is more proven will it be \"safe\" to mass produce a \"normal\" car with all the same tech. The goal is to catch all the \"nissan leaf lizard chemistry\" or \"bolt self immolation\" bugs on the people willing to buy a CT. reply agumonkey 16 hours agorootparentprevMusk also enjoyed success in spacex context, which is similar to high performance race, and not very long term uncontrolled conditions as mainstream cars. reply CharlieDigital 18 hours agoparentprevThis approach makes sense when designing something novel. You just don't yet know what's necessary and what is excess when dealing with novelty. A decorative brake pedal faceplate? I'm pretty certain that there's decades of design and engineering precedence that has already coalesced on a basic fastener design that is low cost, durable, and safe. reply theturtletalks 18 hours agorootparentNormal car manufacturers look at things like: the door handle, physical controls, having lane indicators on their respective sides, a glove box handle, rear view mirrors As solved things.

Not to say this isn't bad, or shouldn't be fixed, or that there won't be a legitimate root cause analysis produced that tells us something interesting. But what you wrote seems poorly grounded. reply root_axis 19 hours agorootparent> Who Can Best Express the Situation as a Confirmation of Priors.

You can physically shift the transmission, which is a mechanical connection, into neutral. Worst case you can turn the key which electrically disconnects the ignition. And stuck accelerators were rarely a problem because the throttle was a physical cable. reply don_neufeld 19 hours agorootparentAs someone who was a passenger in a vehicle that had a stuck accelerator, going at highway speed, approaching a busy intersection, I suggest that you are dramatically trivializing the problem. We probably had a couple of seconds before multiple people were gonna be dead-dead. People don’t always think, or act, in the most sensible way in an emergency. In this case, the driver overshot neutral and threw the vehicle into reverse. We spun out and needed up in the ditch. reply steelframe 13 hours agorootparent> In this case, the driver overshot neutral and threw the vehicle into reverse. FWIW my 3-pedal daily driver is impervious to this failure mode. If the engine starts doing anything I don't expect my instinctive reaction is to push in the clutch pedal, which I am always prepared to do in a split second because I keep my left foot resting lightly on it. In the extremely unlikely situation where the clutch pedal also doesn't work I can still yank the shifter into neutral. The only way to get to get it into reverse is to pull up on a collar on the shaft of the stick and then shift into the \"first gear\" position, which I'm definitely not going to do while panicking. reply NickM 19 hours agorootparentprevpretty trivial It doesn't matter how trivial it is to override a stuck pedal, it's still a serious hazard, because even if you have the option to shift into neutral a driver may not think of that or may not react in time. It's also trivial to override it in the Cybertruck: just press the brake pedal. Braking is hard-coded to cut off the accelerator, so if both pedals are pressed the brake wins and the accelerator is ignored. Still a big problem though. reply organsnyder 19 hours agorootparentI had this exact situation happen a number of years ago when I was driving our '97 Ford Taurus (it had undergone a number of repairs at that point, including an engine overhaul, so it probably wasn't due to an OEM defect). My first reaction was to stomp on the brakes, but it was immediately clear that the engine was winning that battle; so, I quickly shifted into neutral and pulled into the turning lane. My wife was in the car with me and remarked that she didn't think she would have known what to do, especially to react that quickly. Our current vehicles are a manual transmission Civic and a PHEV Pacifica. The Civic is easy—just press in the clutch—but the Pacifica would be more tricky; I guess I'd start with the brakes, then the shifter (which is just an input to the computer, of course), then hold down the power button, and then look for a place to ditch. reply netsharc 15 hours agorootparent> then hold down the power button on APCI computers, the power button is software-controlled, i.e. it sends a signal to the OS, if the OS is currently frozen (or is configured to ignore it), pressing the power button does nothing. But to override this, if you hold it for about four seconds, a hardware shutdown still happens (is it done by the motherboard?). There are also other functions, like holding the power button for 30 seconds to enter into recovery mode on iPhones. I wonder if holding the power button on a running EV car does anything similar... reply dzhiurgis 13 hours agorootparentThere is no power button, but you can probably shift into neutral reply afavour 19 hours agorootparentprevIt isn’t ever trivial for two simple reasons: - it’s not something that happens regularly so drivers are not prepared for it - it can cause disaster in literal seconds (or even a single second) It doesn’t matter how easy it is to mitigate if there is going to be a delay in most drivers deploying that mitigation. reply mort96 19 hours agorootparentprevUh, the problem with stuck accelerators isn't that you can't get the car to slow down. I'm sure that's possible in the Tesla too. The problem is that by the time you've reacted to the sudden unexpected acceleration and found a way to get the vehicle to stop, you may have already crashed or run something over or something. This is true on your car with a physical transmission as well. This is all assuming that the brake overrides the accelerator (which it really really should, especially on an electric car where it's all computerized). reply stavros 18 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, this is true. By the time the average person debugs why the car is rushing full speed ahead, it's too late. Hopefully the brakes are strong enough to stop the engine torque, though. reply steelframe 13 hours agorootparentprev> This is true on your car with a physical transmission as well.

The ability to stick a Toyota accelerator with the floor mats due to design issues was very well documented, all over youtube, and the recall was very real. In fact the evidence looks just like this situation with the Cybertruck. So getting back to the confirmation of priors point: it's telling that you view one as a \"conspiracy\" and the other as The Truth. reply wredue 18 hours agorootparentYou should look up more on this time. The floor mats were blamed, but in at least a couple of these cases, it was found that the occupant claimed to have hit the brakes, but actually hit the accelerator. There is also a staggering number of “two foot drivers” out there. Incidentally, my sunfire also had the issue of the pedal getting stuck on the floor mat, and more than once I had to press in the clutch cause the pedal got stuck. The focus on toyota those years always stood out as a hit job to me (and that was a time when I generally disliked Japanese cars cause I was young and impressionable). reply ajross 15 hours agorootparentAgain, though, the evidence that you could get a Toyota accelerator to stick was clear and obvious and available via copious video on the internet. That part wasn't made up. You're saying that it may not have been the cause of an accident. Which may be true, but (1) isn't evidence that there wasn't a clear design flaw and (2) is also true of the Cybertruck, which hasn't had any reported mishaps at all. Yet to you the Toyota thing was a \"hit job\" where this isn't? It's 100% symmetric, so why the difference in interpretation? I mean, we know why. But \"because Elon\" makes for poor logic. reply wredue 8 hours agorootparentAfter watching the video, it looks like a very serious design or QC issue, for a company widely known for QC issues. The mats were a hit job because most of the cases were not actually the mats, and one company was getting a hard focus for this issue when it was prevalent in many different brands. The cybertruck is not a hit job because this is just another in the laughing stock line of quality control and design issues from a company known for it. reply notaustinpowers 19 hours agorootparentprevI may not be part of the collective here, but I find it within the realm of acceptable that a $30,000 car would have issues that should absolutely not be present on a $100,000 car.

Not impressed. reply mikem69 7 hours agorootparentWell that’s not true- I frequently access the Tesla while it’s doing an update. reply dragonwriter 18 hours agorootparentprevWell, greater quantity (both static and flow rate), but greater quality is less clear. reply cjk2 17 hours agorootparentprevThe only car I've had software that worked at all in, and I've owned a Tesla, was a Citroen. And that was because it had no software worth mentioning other than a BT receiver. reply FireBeyond 16 hours agorootparentprevI don't agree with all their UX/UI decisions, but I will grant you that Tesla has better -aesthetics- than most of the auto manufacturers. That doesn't correlate to inherent software quality, though. reply smt88 20 hours agorootparentprevCars in the US are highly scrutinized by reviewers and enthusiasts, and they're highly regulated. It's been basically impossible to disguise poor quality in cars here for a long time, so the failure of shiny chrome is the least of the Cybertruck's problems. reply nebula8804 19 hours agorootparentMaybe in very recent cars but man the lack of government standards allows the absolute worst cars to be driven on the road because a lot of manufacturers (mainly American and Korean) have had on and off decades of pretty bad low quality cars. Cars that would fail inspection in Japan or Germany are perfectly fine here and as a result the overall fleet is on the crappier side. reply thfuran 18 hours agorootparentI don't think most states in the us even have vehicle inspections. Certainly not all do. reply bananapub 17 hours agorootparentprev> Cars in the US are highly scrutinized by reviewers and enthusiasts, and they're highly regulated. lol, very good reply Mockapapella 19 hours agorootparentprevIt’s doomed because of the material choice of their pedals? Come on now, don’t be dramatic reply yareal 19 hours agorootparentThe cars are terribly manufactured, there are many videos of them falling completely, sometimes right off the lot. They don't meet their reported towing spec, they haul about as much as a cargo bike, they can't off-road. The only reason to own one is to participate in the culture war. That sort of thing tends to cycle quickly. reply cjk2 19 hours agorootparentYeah this. Total shit. I had a Model S P100D and the doors didn't even shut or line up properly. If you can't get the basics right then there's going to be a lot of problems hiding away that you can't see and serious procedural and process problems. On mine I had unintended braking randomly in the middle of the motorway. I think that's less fucked than unintended acceleration at least. Maybe not for the guy behind me. I now don't own a car. It was the most money I've lost in one go and the worst vehicle I've ever driven. reply mikem69 13 hours agorootparentWas this back when they had radar? Unintended braking is/was a common issue for all manufacturers - my Prius would randomly slam on the brakes whenever I went underneath a bridge. reply cjk2 13 hours agorootparentYes it was. Probably signal aliasing. I drove a dumbcar after (shitty bottom end Citroen) which exhibited no problems! :) reply MSFT_Edging 19 hours agorootparentprevIf the pedal, one of the 4 primary ways of controlling the 3 ton vehicle, is this egregiously faulty, then where else has Telsa skimped on vital QA in the design? The culture that leads to cheap glue holding on a piece that can jam the pedal down likely cut corners in 100 other places. reply jasonlotito 19 hours agorootparentprevThat's not at all what was said. It's fair to assume that this is one additioanal issue we've seen with the Cybertruck, and when you add all those things up, you realize the Cybertruck is doomed. Why do you think this person meant that this single deficiency is the reason it's doomed? Have you thought that way in the past about things? reply kubectl_h 19 hours agorootparentprevNo it's doomed because it's a classic Elon Musk product: it was rushed into production, build quality is low and the aesthetics, which are unrefined and overwhelming, are used to mask an overall shoddy product that overpromised and underdelivered. The pedals are just one example of it. The body panel gaps and poor off-road performance are others. reply recursive 14 hours agorootparentMost companies wish they could release products as \"doomed\" as Elon's. reply arethuza 20 hours agorootparentprevI can honestly say I don't think I've paid much attention to what the pedals in any car I've driven look like. reply swozey 18 hours agorootparentSomeone interested in a $100k+ car potentially likes cars enough to be interested. A lot of people are A-B'ers. A lot arent. reply dragonwriter 18 hours agorootparent> Someone interested in a $100k+ car potentially likes cars enough to be interested Potentially, but I think the big factor for most people who buy $100k cars is wealth and status-seeking, not interest in conponent details. reply tyingq 20 hours agoparentprevThose close up photos are pretty revealing. Not just the cover, but everything around it looks cheaply done. reply NovemberWhiskey 20 hours agorootparentTBH that's what all parts of modern, mass-production vehicles look like if they're not expected to be user-facing. reply jazzyjackson 16 hours agorootparentthe pedals are literally the user interface of the car tho my prius isn't made of chrome but the plastic and rubber is made to hold up to a decade of abuse i guess with self driving cars the expectation is you don't need to bother with the gas pedal as much. reply ddalex 38 minutes agorootparentSee, this is where the problem is. > the gas pedal Tesla is electric, so they got confused about how to build a gas pedal. reply dboreham 20 hours agorootparentprevPresumably whoever thought that accelerator pedals shouldn't be very carefully designed to avoid jamming full throttle, because no car has ever had an unintended acceleration problem, is presumably now part of the 10%. reply moolcool 20 hours agoparentprevOh man, the cybertruck is a deeply unserious vehicle. reply KingMob 19 hours agorootparentI'm going to wait for it to render in higher resolution. reply numbsafari 20 hours agorootparentprevOh, it’s serious all right. Seriously dangerous. reply jazzyjackson 16 hours agorootparentprevprobably has some serious margins reply jonhohle 20 hours agoparentprevIf so, isn’t that the same issue Toyota dealt with [0] 15 years ago? Toyota’s recall didn’t include it, but we had a ‘92 Camry whose accelerator pedal would stick.

Reading the title, I thought that at long last electrical SUA had been demonstrated. reply r00fus 20 hours agorootparentprevSince Musk is a \"first principles\" guy, Tesla is \"speedrunning\" what the industry discovered years ago. reply gonzo41 19 hours agoparentprevThat is insane. especially in a car where you can't really just rip on the ebrake or throw the engine into neutral with a gear stick. It's terrifying to think these massive trucks are all around kids and families. reply jccooper 18 hours agorootparentYou don't need to do any of that. You just hit the brake, which overrides acceleration. For this particular problem, drive-by-wire is superior to those mechanical controls. reply jazzyjackson 15 hours agorootparentthe mechanical override would be to shift into neutral my gripe with touchscreens is they're no good in an emergency, you want an interface that reacts well to being grabbed :) does the cybertruck even have a proper \"off\" button or does it just read your mind to anticipate when you want to put it in standby mode? :p reply buffington 14 hours agorootparentAssuming the controls are the same as the Model 3, you can use the lever on the steering column to shift into neutral. It's not a mechanical solution, but it is doable without using the touchscreen. Edit: just out of curiosity I went to look at photos of the Cybertruck interior. No levers on the steering column. WTF. That alone would be a deal breaker for me. reply jazzyjackson 10 hours agorootparentholy shit I thought I was kidding but this thing doesn't have an off button, from pg 72 in the owners manual (note that shifting into park is also a touchscreen button that displays when stopped)[0]: When you finish driving and shift into Park, simply exit the vehicle. When you leave Cybertruck with your phone key, it powers off automatically, turning off the touchscreen. Cybertruck also powers off automatically after being in Park for 30 minutes, even if you are sitting in the driver's seat. Although usually not needed, you can power off Cybertruck while sitting in the driver's seat, provided the vehicle is not moving. Touch Controls > Safety > Power Off. Cybertruck automatically powers back on after a short period if you press the brake pedal or touch the touchscreen.

Also puts in question what is actually happening on Tesla's engineering org, one just needs to have a moderate amount of reasoning power to think about the scenario \"what happens in case this piece gets loose?\" on a critical feature of a car, not even an engineering-related study nor a big brain, it's just a reasonable thought to have, so how could this piece pass all the engineering process review? reply matthewdgreen 20 hours agorootparentWhat's happening in their engineering org is obvious: pressure is being applied to trim every unnecessary cost, even tiny ones, to maximize profit margin. And this pressure is clearly coming from the top. We've seen evidence of this from a number of high-profile changes that can't have escaped the notice of executive management: (1) the elimination of the radome, (2) the removal of sonar for parking, (3) the removal of turn signal and shifter stalks. What's different in this case is that now these penny-ante cost savings have reached safety-critical components. reply antonkochubey 19 hours agorootparentI'd argue that physical stalks for windshield wipers and turn signals are also safety-critical. reply Terr_ 15 hours agorootparent> (3) the removal of turn signal and shifter stalks. I remember reading about the removal of the turn-signal stalk, (moving it to buttons on the steering wheel itself) and IMO it's just bonkers. How the heck is someone already in some squiggly turns or a roundabout supposed to identify and touch the correct spot without taking their eyes off the twisting road or compromising their grip on the wheel that wants to return to the neutral position? reply Tempest1981 19 hours agorootparentprevWe've heard for years that this is also the case at all US auto manufacturers. That they're run by accountants, not enthusiasts. reply organsnyder 18 hours agorootparentMost accountants understand the financial implications of selling products with egregious safety issues. reply eep_social 17 hours agorootparentindeed: “.. should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.” reply nebula8804 19 hours agorootparentprev>(1) the elimination of the radome, (2) the removal of sonar for parking, (3) the removal of turn signal and shifter stalks Alternative explanation of this is if they have a vision to move users to a self driving future, it makes sense to start slowly transitioning users by eliminating things that don't make sense in that paradigm. If you can save some cost then its a bonus. (Their cars supposedly get ~30% margins so idk if cost was even really a primary rather than a secondary consideration). reply rsynnott 16 hours agorootparent\"You won't need that if the thing that might never exist one day exists, so we're taking it away now\" is a truly _deranged_ design philosophy. reply nebula8804 16 hours agorootparentWhy? Thats is SV tech company 101. When Apple does it they call it \"courage\". reply AlexandrB 15 hours agorootparentIt hits a little different with a $100,000 road missile vs a phone. reply jorvi 19 hours agorootparentprevHaving radar allows you to do neat tricks like bounce the signal off of the bottom of the car in front of you, meaning your car can detect slowdowns and collisions way ahead of what direct vision can do. LiDAR similarly augments camera vision to beyond-human capacity. reply bamboozled 19 hours agorootparentprevA break peddle in very important while it’s needed. It is needed. reply diydsp 20 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I think it should be, according to traditional (pre-y2k) values. But in a society of the spectacle, people find their meaning in relation to the larger show. Just listen to the satisfaction in the voice of the video above: He feels good because he was able to rectify the situation. He was also able to relate to a larger audience because of it. The Tesla's failure gave him meaning. Now other people will want to be like him and buy a cybertruck and find and fix issues and demonstrate them to a global audience... reply marcosdumay 20 hours agorootparentI dunno. But my impression is that thing is way too expensive to buy as a hacker toy. reply Der_Einzige 19 hours agorootparentprev\"Among the many commentaries on Debord's demise, one scholar noted: \"Guy Debord did not kill himself. He was murdered by the thoughtlessness and selfishness of so-called scholars (primarily trendy lit-criters) who colonized his brilliant ideas and transformed his radical politics into an academic status symbol not worth the pulp it's printed on…\"\" reply loceng 19 hours agoparentprevThankfully the break overrides the acceleration, and I imagine a driver's eventual instinct will be to hit the break - and once they notice the vehicle decelerating they can stop panicking. reply nvy 19 hours agorootparentDoes it override the accelerator? Do you trust Space Karen enough to make that assumption? Tesla vehicles have a lot of software onboard, and they build it like a regular SV tech company. That is frightening to me. reply AlexandrB 15 hours agorootparentThe TikTok video[1] that originally showed off this issue noted that he was able to stop because the brake overrode the accelerator.

Your inputs could be used elsewhere so you don’t want to build up unsellable WIP stock. reply judge2020 18 hours agorootparentThey're likely continuing manufacturing for everything except for the part of the line where the interior drive controls are assembled, depending on how much stockpile space they have (which should be a lot with how big GF Texas is). If they already have a fix that they is just a modification they would continue full line manufacturing then stage the completed vehicles for when the modification is ready. Chances are they _really_ want to make a fix that can be done at service centers, so that they don't need to ship all the CT awaiting delivery back to the factory for the fix. reply AlexandrB 14 hours agorootparentIn true automotive tradition I expect them to fix it with a blob of JB Weld to hold the pedal cover on. reply stetrain 18 hours agorootparentprevTesla at least has in the past continued manufacturing vehicles knowing that they need rework or are missing a part, and will then do that work while they are sitting in the inventory lot or at the service center before delivery. reply sidcool 19 hours agoparentprevAlso, for 7 days. reply dang 16 hours agorootparentOk, we've modified the title above to include those two details. reply sidcool 15 hours agorootparentThanks Dang! reply josefresco 20 hours agoprevI wonder what the Space X engineers think of the Tesla engineers.

In his other two companies, no one can check him so his instability ruins things. reply greedo 18 hours agorootparentprevSeriously? I'm as critical of Elon as anyone, but SpaceX is knocking it out of the park. Falcon is arguably the most reliable launcher ever created, and one of the most affordable. There's simply no contest. SpaceX could sit on their laurels for a decade and the rest of the worldwide space industry might catch up. But Starship will give them a further advantage that might last a century. reply drpossum 20 hours agorootparentprevI mean, it's not like spacex rockets are exploding regularly or anything. reply mavhc 19 hours agorootparentOnly the test ones, the finished ones have been re-flown 19 times, that's 19 more times than most rockets. Starship is the largest rocket to launch to orbit, it didn't land again, but neither has any other non SpaceX rocket reply MrSkelter 19 hours agorootparentStarship didn’t reach orbit. Starship isn’t a development of Falcon, it’s a new platform. You can’t use the performance of one to excuse the failure of another. Reuse is also meaningless without a public audit of what is done to turn them round. That’s not been shared. reply mavhc 2 hours agorootparentWhy should it be public, SpaceX is a private company. However Space X offer cheaper flights than everyone else, so unless they're losing money, it's not expensive to reuse them. It didn't reach orbit on purpose, it can with 1% more thrust. Who said it failed, it's the largest rocket ever to reach orbit (unless you're super picky, in which case wait 2 months) It's built by the same people who did Falcon, so it's likely to be as good. Also they're specifically designing it to not be over engineered, because Rocket Equation. reply tekla 19 hours agorootparentprevStarship didnt reach orbit because they purposefully shut the engines down early. It was literally seconds from reaching a stable orbit before MECO. > Reuse is also meaningless without a public audit of what is done to turn them round.

Talk about being ahead.. reply alienicecream 20 hours agoparentprevThe guys who've blown up a billion dollars of tax payer money because rather than carefully design it to work the first time, they slap something together and let it fail to 'iterate'? It sounds like it's same guys working at both companies. reply luuurker 19 hours agorootparentI'm not sure if SpaceX's approach to development is a problem. We don't have to like it, but they develop faster and cheaper than the competition... and as proven by Falcon 9, Dragon, etc, it works. The competitors designing it \"carefully\" are often slow and still have failures[0] while costing more. I'm not going to say that the SpaceX approach doesn't have disadvantages or that everyone should use it because I don't believe that, but it works for them, even if you get to see more failures (and I understand that many have a fear of public failure, but not everyone is like that). Their money comes from the same sources as the other space companies: public and private investment/contracts. If a different company takes twice as long and charges twice as much for the service and SpaceX does it faster while charging less for the same service, then if I was a tax payer, I wouldn't care much about the way they develop and test their rockets. It's important to not allow our views about Musk to cloud our view about what some of his companies are doing. Cybertruck seems to be a bad product. Falcon 9, Starlink, etc, are good products. It is what it is. --- [0] https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/04/ula-continues-invest... reply gravescale 19 hours agorootparentprevLoath as I am to say, but the SLS has a program cost over $20 billion and has launched only once to date (it did work, to be fair). Every single one they launch will be a one-way trip, so it's going to be a long time, if ever, until they can even get the per-launch cost down to under a billion. Starship/Super Heavy \"only\" cost 5 billion as a program and also has 1 successful flight (and two Earth-shattering kabooms). So far, they're the economical ones by quite some margin.

Also it is sad that NASA is being worn like a meat-suit by the MIC, but that really isn't a new thing, and its almost its true purpose really. But the engineers and even the managers at SpaceX really have done something very special. And the engineers at NASA too, for that matter - nailing it on the first go is bloody hard and a great technical feat. It's also extremely expensive, but the spec is the spec. reply ToValueFunfetti 19 hours agorootparentprevJames Webb alone cost NASA $10 billion, with $4.5 billion in overruns. It took 30 years to design and construct. Carefully designing things to work the first time is expensive and slow; blowing up a billion dollars is the more effective use of money here. reply mavhc 19 hours agorootparentLess than a billion, maybe $100 million per test launch reply bmitc 19 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn't compute at all. reply swores 18 hours agorootparentTheir point is that if you \"waste\" $1B as many as nine times with exploding rockets and it leads to working, good rockets, then its economically better than spending $10B to get it right the first time with no explosions. Of course there's also environmental harm from exploded rockets, and the potential to never find success before running out of money, but as long as they succeed in getting it working perfectly before they've spent as much as it would cost to be confident of it working on the first launch, they'll be happy. reply ToValueFunfetti 19 hours agorootparentprevBy all means, demonstrate that. I love to change my mind, but I still need more than an assertion that I'm wrong to do so. reply bmitc 18 hours agorootparentThey're just completely different projects that are not comparable. The Webb telescope had no choice but to work. The SpaceX team has a choice, and they choose \"fail fast\". There's a gradient that SpaceX can sit on for their development, and for a suite of companies owned by Musk, people would like to see less fail fast and often. reply arandomusername 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's not tax payer money, it's spacex's money.

The court's decision – involving a citizen who accused the Citrus County Sheriff's Office of misconduct – is the latest to provide new mechanisms for civilian oversight of law enforcement, even as others were curtailed in recent days by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-led Legislature. In its ruling last week, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach threw out five felony wiretapping convictions against Michael Leroy Waite, 63, of Floral City. Waite has been engaged in a lengthy dispute over access to his property with the Citrus County Sheriff's Office as far back as 2018. The situation escalated after wildlife officers – accompanied by deputies holding rifles – sprayed herbicides in a canal off the Withlacoochee River along Waite’s property in west-central Florida. “The sheriff jumped on the airboat, trespassed onto my private property and pointed assault rifles at me as they ripped up and stole my ‘No Trespassing’ signs,” Waite said in an interview. He called the court’s decision groundbreaking: “I think a lot of people are going to be citing my case in the future,” he said. Sheriff’s deputies said Waite aimed a rifle at the officials spraying the herbicides. “The people out there doing the spraying for the herbicides for the county, they were in fear that this guy was going to do something, try to shoot them, try to kill them,” deputy Ryan Glaze testified in the case. Glaze said Waite had “sovereign citizen ideologies,” referring to the anti-government movement whose followers believe that courts have no jurisdiction over them. Related Controversial Florida bill blocking civilian review boards from investigating cops heads to DeSantis: The measure would affect at least 21 cities with civilian review boards, including Orlando Waite disputed that he was a sovereign citizen. “Totally false,” he said. “The only time I ever used the word ‘sovereign’ was to claim my private property is not state sovereignty land.” In January 2021, Waite called 911 to report what he believed was a trespassing incident by the sheriff and said he wanted to have the call recorded for a complaint against the sheriff. That same day, Sergeant Edward Blair called Waite back – and Waite recorded the three-minute phone conversation but did not inform Blair he was doing so, the court said. Waite emailed his recording of the call to the sheriff's office records department and requested an internal investigation. A month later, Waite was accused of five counts of illegal wiretapping for recording the conversation with the sergeant and four other calls with sheriff’s employees. The appeals court on Friday overturned the trial judge’s decision and ordered the judge to dismiss the wiretapping charges. “Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that any of the deputies exhibited a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize,” the court said. The sheriff’s office on Monday declined to make Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast available to discuss the matter. It wasn't clear whether the court’s decision affects secretly recording the telephone conversations of other government employees in Florida conducting official business. It said Waite’s recording was allowed because there was “no dispute that all conversations concerned matters of public business, occurred while the deputies were on duty, and involved phones utilized for work purposes.” “This really broadens up the public’s ability to hold police officers accountable for their actions,” Waite said. “They have no expectation of privacy when they’re conducting official business and it doesn’t matter where they’re at.” The same day as the court’s ruling, DeSantis signed into law two bills affecting law enforcement in Florida. Two judges on the panel that issued the ruling Friday were DeSantis appointees. One new law makes it illegal after a person has been warned to approach first responders or remain within 25 feet while they are performing a legal duty if the intent is to interfere, threaten or harass them. The new law doesn’t prevent people from recording law enforcement but can require them to move 25 feet back, which can make it more difficult. The other requires that citizen review boards in Florida – intended to provide independent oversight of law enforcement actions – be re-established so that members are appointed by a sheriff or police chief and that at least one member be a retired law enforcement officer. Waite was separately convicted of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence after he was accused of striking a deputy with his elbow when they arrived to arrest him on the wiretapping charges. Waite urged the appeals court to throw out those charges, too, but the judges declined. “As soon as I grabbed his arms to put him under arrest, to put them behind his back, that’s when I catch an elbow to my face, to my lower right jaw,” said Glaze, the deputy who arrested Waite. He said Waite surrendered after a detective shocked him with an electrical device. The judge sentenced Waite on all the charges to two years’ probation. He had faced up to 25 years in prison and fines of $25,000. “Waite did not demonstrate a lack of good faith and should have complied without resorting to violence,” the judges said. The court ruling Friday also was silent on the issue of whether the sheriff committed any misconduct: “We in no way suggest the CCSO committed police misconduct,” the ruling said. “Rather, this was how Waite perceived the situation.” Waite said his case will help the public hold law enforcement accountable and prevent officer misconduct. “Bringing these subjects to lay helps us maintain a civil society and civil government to be accountable for their actions,” Waite said. “The public, we just try to enjoy our property without people coming on trespassing and destroying it.” ___ This story was produced by Fresh Take Florida, a news service covering business news from the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications.

I wonder if the first will stand up to Constitutional review. I imagine there are many First Amendment protected purposes for recording that may require the recorder to be within 25 feet of the officer. For example, if they're recording during windy conditions and need to hear what the officer says. I also wonder how the \"intent\" will be interpreted by courts. Probably in a way that is most favorable to LEOs. The second law is just a straightforward neutering of citizen review boards. reply morkalork 10 hours agoparentWhat's the point of a citizen review board if the sheriff or chief appoints everyone on it? Talk about fox guarding the henhous! reply roughly 10 hours agorootparent> What's the point of a citizen review board if the sheriff or chief appoints everyone on it? I don’t know, but I know what the point of the law was. reply sidewndr46 10 hours agorootparentprevTo make sure everything passes the citizen's review board. reply Phiwise_ 1 hour agorootparentprev>What's the point of a citizen review board if the sheriff... appoints everyone on it? Would you rather someone unelected by the citizens decide who sits on the citizen review board? reply csdreamer7 59 minutes agorootparent> Would you rather someone unelected by the citizens decide who sits on the citizen review board? Not sure what the point of this argument is. The mayor could appoint someone. The public can directly elect someone. Why is Florida making the boards charged with oversight of the police can only be appointed by the sheriff? It does not sound like a 'citizen review board' but it does sounds very prone to corruption. reply Phiwise_ 38 minutes agorootparentI'm still unclear on what defines a citizen review board if not a board selected by someone elected by citizens. Could you state your disagreement with that explicitly? reply xdavidliu 37 minutes agorootparentprevno, but it could be someone elected who is not part of the police. Of course you can argue that you believe that other someone would be corrupt anyway, but at least this removes the appearance of impropriety reply Phiwise_ 11 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure I can support throwing out review boards because they look improprietous by conducting reviews. Seems a little backwards. reply robertlagrant 27 minutes agorootparentprevAppearances might not be as important as actual issues, though - I think it is okay to do it this way. Doctors in the UK sit on ethics boards looking at other doctors' behaviour. I would think it would be good to say that not more than 50% can be ex-law enforcement though, to ensure a reasonable mixture. reply Analemma_ 10 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds like a case of \"the citizen review board was created by fed-up voters at the municipal level, and then the state stepped into neuter it\". Because DeSantis etc. are about local control except when the locals make a decision they don't like. reply stkdump 5 hours agorootparentI find it interesting how it probably evolved from \"people on the citizen review board don't know what it means to police\" to a moderate position of \"why not add a retired policeman, so he can at least explain it to them?\" to \"fuck it, let's dismantle the whole thing\" reply tadfisher 7 hours agorootparentprevSee also: the Texas \"water breaks ban\", which actually superceded all county and municipal employee protections in a wide array of classes that exceeded the state minimums. reply BurningFrog 5 hours agorootparentprevThe text isn't clear on if it's all or some members. I'm guessing the latter. Having a retired cop in the room who understands police work sounds pretty sensible to me. reply Broken_Hippo 4 hours agorootparentSounds like the police trying to influence the boards to me. Police already have power to ruin lives or at least make them seriously inconvenient. A retired cop generally still has friends and/or family that are active cops, and therefore has some influence. Which means folks aren't nearly as free to speak or do their jobs freely. This is true even if you personally don't feel this way around any sort of law enforcement - you know others do. reply mcBesse 50 minutes agorootparentIs the tradeoff with the potential positive influence worth it? Are there ways to mitigate the potential negatives? reply user_7832 43 minutes agoparentprev> I wonder if the first will stand up to Constitutional review. I imagine there are many First Amendment protected purposes for recording that may require the recorder to be within 25 feet of the officer. It may be possible to stand 25ft back and hold a 15ft long pole with a camera, or place a phone/camera on the ground and then stand back, to get past this issue. reply lvncelot 37 minutes agorootparentLegality aside, I can't imagine waving a 15ft long pole towards the police will go over well. reply smolder 28 minutes agorootparentYeah, very many people can't afford a decent lawyer when they need one, and might not get one even if they can, in which case legality really is... aside. reply dmichulke 5 hours agoparentprevIs recording someone an expression of > the intent [..] to interfere, threaten or harass them ? reply vkou 2 hours agoparentprevThe first is an absolute farce. All an officer who doesn't want to be recorded needs to do is get in your face (or have his partner get in your face) - at which point, you are now recording within 25 feet of an officer, and must either stop, or face arrest. If you take a few steps back, he can, of course, repeat this process ad-infinitum. Sure, you can argue this in a Florida court, and you might even win, but in the meantime, the law accomplishes exactly what it intends. reply renewiltord 10 hours agoparentprevHaha, this was pretty good. I think a bunch of them involved police walking towards the videographer, requiring them to walk farther back. reply jojobas 10 hours agorootparentIf the law forbids you from approaching, staying where you are would be fine wouldn't it? reply renewiltord 9 hours agorootparent28 It is unlawful for a person, after receiving a 29 verbal warning not to approach from a person he or she knows or 30 reasonably should know is a first responder, who is engaged in 31 the lawful performance of a legal duty, to knowingly and 32 willfully violate such warning and approach or remain within 25 33 feet of the first responder with the intent to https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/184/BillText/er/H... Like the original comment said, it's \"approach or remain\" reply jojobas 6 hours agorootparentThat's the usual phrasing of trespass laws, and remain here means \"remain after approaching\". I can't see any judge siding with a cop following someone and requiring him to stay 25 feet away. reply lazyasciiart 2 hours agorootparentYou’re overestimating judges. Even aside from the possibility of corruption, which has certainly happened before and will again, some judges are awful people or not very clever. Generally the minimum requirement to be a judge is to pass the bar and then get elected by people who don’t know anything about you. It usually helps to be a friend of cops. Here’s a judge who jailed a guy known for reporting on police misconduct under the excuse that he refused to become a sworn witness in the trial of a cop murderer - which he had nothing to do with, and was simply attending in the audience. https://therealnews.com/a-cop-watcher-attended-the-trial-of-... (I think what they were trying was just kick him out of the courtroom; my understanding is that when someone is a (potential) witness testifying in a trial they are not allowed to attend) reply jojobas 1 hour agorootparentYou can't legislate away corrupt judges. Also when one of the sides asks to question you as a witness and the judge proceeds to swear you in, you do just that and later complain, not start and argument there and then. reply tdeck 19 minutes agorootparentprevOnce the law is on the books it gives cops an(other) easy excuse to arrest you and throw you in jail for recording them. Many people can't afford to miss a day of work, let alone try a case in court. reply wombatpm 7 hours agorootparentprevAm I allowed to stand my ground with deadly force in such a scenario? reply bagels 5 hours agorootparentNo, you must retreat to your designated free speech zone. reply Thorrez 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat does that mean? reply lazyasciiart 2 hours agorootparentHe thinks he can outdraw the cops. reply avs733 7 hours agorootparentprevyou are expecting good faith from US police? reply jimbob45 2 hours agoparentprevThe FL Sunshine Laws still provide more police and governmental transparency than every other state. This is just another hypocritical attempt to smear FL without acknowledging how much farther ahead they are of everyone. reply ImJamal 10 hours agoparentprev>The second law is just a straightforward neutering of citizen review boards. It says reestablished. How are they neutering something that doesn't exist? reply llamaimperative 9 hours agorootparentThe “re-“ part of “re-established” suggests that this is a modification of an existing thing, no? reply ImJamal 7 hours agorootparentIt sounds like it used to exist. No longer exists and is now coming back. If it was currently in existence it would say modified. reply dragonwriter 7 hours agorootparentNo, it means that the boards have their power stripped until their membership is replaced by the new, captive appointees that can be relied on to not be independent of the agency they are notionally overseeing, at which point their powers are restored. That's what “required to be re-established” means. reply tadfisher 7 hours agorootparentprevRe-established in this case means, dissolve the existing boards and reconstitute them with the appointees. Review boards already exist in Florida. reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentprevWell, regardless of what it sounds like, they do exist. The wannabe autocrat is weakening them. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 10 hours agorootparentprevWhere does it say it is creating an entity that doesn't already exist? reply ImJamal 7 hours agorootparentThe word reestablished means that it used to be established but is no longer established. It is now coming back. reply wholinator2 6 hours agorootparentNot completely. It also means to disband something that currently exists, then recreate it, effectively reestablishing the board. You are paying attention to only one possible reading, which is the one not consistent with the truth. Citizen review boards exist in Florida. These currently functioning boards will have their power stripped immediately and members will be replaced with captive appointees. This is not creating citizen review boards, this is destroying them reply refurb 3 hours agorootparentUsing the word “reestablish” in that way would be the confusing and odd considering the multiple other word choices that would be far more precise. reply bee_rider 6 hours agorootparentprevFlorida’s website is a bit confusing to navigate, but I think I found the actual text of the law. https://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?B... I think it is under bill text/enrolled. I don’t find the word re-established in there. So, I think that’s just the wording that the newspaper picked. Regardless of any difference between establish or re-establish, it doesn’t really make sense to put too much weight on subtle implications of the newspaper’s wording. reply bena 6 hours agorootparentprevCongress gets \"reestablished\" every two years. The English government gets \"reestablished\" every year when the Prime Minister asks to form a government in the Monarch's name. So it could just mean when the current term is up and the new appointees are sworn in. reply qwerpy 11 hours agoparentprev> Probably in a way that is most favorable to LEOs. I think this makes sense. Would be bad if every time a police officer tries to stop a crime, suddenly 20 hard of hearing people need to crowd around him really close in order to record him. Oh look, the criminal got away again. There are situations where different laws will conflict, and I hope in those situations crime prevention and safety take precedence. Modern phone cameras are really good and 25 feet isn't very far. Seems like a good compromise so that cops can do their jobs but there can be some citizen oversight. reply JumpCrisscross 10 hours agorootparent> Would be bad if every time a police officer tries to stop a crime, suddenly 20 hard of hearing people need to crowd around him really close in order to record him It would. Do we have credible examples? Because we have a lot of evidence of cops lying, and only being caught on account of recordings, with disastrous effects. If one side is hypothetical and the other substantiated, it strikes me as reasonable to favour one over the other. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentThis isn't an either/or scenario. There's a reasonable distance that a law enforcement officer (or paramedic, or firefighter) need to be in control of, in order to focus on their job. Maybe it's 1ft, maybe it's 50ft: the courts should decide. There's also a reasonable public expectation to be able to record police officers doing their job, for subsequent review. Hopefully we can all agree that someone loudly \"recording\" shoulder to shoulder with police officer disrupts their ability to resolve situations? Just as we can agree that not having any recording of a police officer's potentially illegal actions is antithetical to ensuring justice? There are disingenuous protesters who abuse recording excuses to disrupt law enforcement. There are corrupt cops who abuse recording limitations to disrupt transparency. Both of these things are wrong. reply heavyset_go 8 hours agorootparent> This isn't an either/or scenario. Right, it's already illegal to interfere with police. reply parineum 6 hours agorootparentThere are a lot of laws passed to clarify or elaborate on existing laws. Unless there's common law that already specifies this exact scenario, this just specifies a specific case for judges, citizens and first responders. reply smolder 1 hour agorootparentI get the impression this law exists more for political reasons than for practical application --not that it won't be applied. Floridian voters seem to like the police but hate taxes. Granting powers to the police to help them harass \"undesirables\" without any added cost is the kind of law they get excited for. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentprevIf I'm on the ground and an officer is yelling at me, I do not want other people even within that officer's bubble of space. It's unreasonably escalatory in situations that instead need more calm. reply lazyasciiart 2 hours agorootparentYou don’t want more than one person to be close enough to notice if you’re still breathing? reply Clubber 8 hours agorootparentprev>If I'm on the ground and an officer is yelling at me, I do not want other people even within that officer's bubble of space. If you're in that position, particularly for something as simple as he took something you said the wrong way, the cameras might keep the officer from going overboard too. reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparentOh, always-on cameras are a 100% prerequisite solution. The presumption needs to be that if a body camera is ever off, the worst thing happened while it was. Along with ensuring that hardware reliability and UX clearly communicates camera functioning to officers. (I'm not young enough to still assume widely-deployed tech, procured by the government, in real world scenarios is always functional) reply JumpCrisscross 6 hours agorootparentprev> we can all agree that someone loudly \"recording\" shoulder to shoulder with police officer disrupts their ability to resolve situations Sure. We can also agree that throwing rotting sea slugs at anyone eating a hamburger is disagreeable. But absent evidence of it (a) happening and (b) going un(der)punished, any legislation to ban it is performative. Performative legislation isn't bad per se. Ideally, it would have no effect. But given almost any increase in legal surface area brings rise to unintended consequences, the result is a net negative. > are disingenuous protesters who abuse recording excuses to disrupt law enforcement Again, do you have examples of people recording police disrupting law enforcement where those recording weren't punished (sufficiently)? > Both of these things are wrong If one is occuring more frequently, and moreover going more-frequently unpunished, then tipping the scale further in that direction is counterproductive. If police abuse is running rampant while nobody can find unpunished instances of disruptive recording of the police, then these rules are more likely to further the abuse than facilitate legitimate law enforcement. (To say nothing of the wasted political capital, given the myriad of problems Florida has to deal with.) reply chatmasta 11 hours agorootparentprev> suddenly 20 hard of hearing people need to crowd around him really close in order to record him It’s already against the law to interfere with an arrest. A mob of people surrounding officers attempting to arrest someone is already illegal, whether they have cameras in their hands or not. reply nomel 11 hours agorootparentLaws that rely on an officers/departments personal reading of a situation/interpretation are easily confused and abused, especially when it's something as fuzzy as \"interference\". Having clarity is nice. I personally think it's fine to give an officer some sort of personal space. If I were an officer arresting someone, I wouldn't want someone affiliated with them standing 5 feet behind me, where I would have to worry about being attacked. Not sure how this works indoors though, where 25 feet would make observation impossible. This assumes sane body camera policies are in place, like immediate dismissal if the camera/mic is turned off/covered, during any part up to or during an arrest. reply clipsy 10 hours agorootparent> This assumes sane body camera policies are in place, like immediate dismissal if the camera/mic is turned off/covered, during any part up to or during an arrest. Assuming fantasies is rarely helpful when judging the effects of legislation. reply turdprincess 10 hours agorootparentprevThat seems about as realistic as immediate dismissal from your job if you forget to unmute yourself on zoom. reply yareal 10 hours agorootparentIt's OK to expect higher standards from police officers. Cameras should record all day and officers should only be allowed to mark timestamps they wish to be deleted later. The footage should still be logged in a black box, encrypted with something to make it not easily accessible. That way a cop could \"whoopsie\" their camera before beating someone, but it would still ultimately be possible to get that recording. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentBingo. Body cameras are a technically-solveable problem. Zero tolerance and enforcement should be the starting place. (Coupled with adjusting policies and procedures to be more in line with actual experience, if we're going fully transparent) reply samatman 6 hours agorootparentprevMy proposal is simple: a cop is someone deputized by the State to be a cop who is operating a body cam. Body cam is off? He's just a citizen with a nightstick. When he's tried, prosecution is held in contempt of court if they allow the jury in any way to know that, were his camera on, he would have been a police officer. Same with the defendant: if he mouths off about what was otherwise his job, he's going to jail for as long as it takes to convene a fresh jury, no bail, contempt. reply lazyasciiart 2 hours agorootparentSure it’s simple. You can get even simpler without changing the realistic probability of it happening: just don’t hire bad cops. reply yareal 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy would it be bad? Surely sunlight is the best disinfectant? Let people film as much as possible. It's been demonstrated that police cameras don't always function... mysteriously. reply FireBeyond 11 hours agorootparentprevI struggle to think of examples where a suspect has actually ELUDED law enforcement due to citizens recording an interaction or arrest, and I'd be very curious to see any such thing. I will agree that such recording has interfered with the arrest process at times, and that is more problematic. But I'm a paramedic/firefighter and often have to work on patients (in an MVA, for example) in much closer proximity to rubberneckers. reply parineum 6 hours agorootparentI've seen plenty of videos of police where the people filming are actively escalating tensions. It's usually by yelling though, not filming, but the yelling seems to usually be for the video, rather than anything productive. reply Teever 8 hours agorootparentprevHow come this kind of shit is only a problem in places where police are more likely to be involved in criminal events that involve brutalizing innocent people? Does Norway have a problem with an excessive number of people filming police interactions in public? reply gamepsys 7 hours agoprevI think this is an interesting decision for a two party consent state. Typically in a two party consent state all private conversations cannot be recorded unless both parties agree to have it recorded. This means it is illegal to secretly record a private conversation. However, the judge ruled that “conversations concerned matters of public business, occurred while the deputies were on duty, and involved phones utilized for work purposes.” have no expectation of privacy. As someone living in a two party consent state that is not Florida I am curious if this precedent will carry weight in my home state. reply ender341341 6 hours agoparentI'm not a lawyer so take this with a grain of salt, especially with the current scotus, but I wouldn't be super surprised if courts found it legal to record government officials in general. Other forms of communication (like email) for government employees are already subject to FOI requests, and the barrier for them to block FOI requests when it's about an interaction you were a part of is much much higher in general than for asking about interactions with other people. reply bagels 5 hours agoparentprevMore weight if you're in the 5th District. It doesn't set precedent in other districts. reply modeless 10 hours agoprevApparently all that's required to make recording a phone call legal is to play a 3 second recorded message saying \"This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes\" because that's what every corporation does. They don't ask, or verify consent. Why can't I do that on my phone? I will happily have my phone say \"This call may be recorded\" before every call I pick up, so that every call can be recorded. reply k8svet 10 hours agoparentFun times, try telling those same corporations that you're recording the call. I've yet to have any proceed other than (politely, but promptly) disconnecting the call. reply Seattle3503 8 hours agorootparentCheck your local laws. In some places, if either party announces the call can be recorded than either party may record it. Ie if the Corp says the call is being recorded, you can record as well without being required to say anything. It is already assumed the call is being record. reply clbrmbr 9 hours agorootparentprevHuh. I’ve bluffed that once when I was getting bad service because I thought it would get the agent to pay more attention. Can’t say it had the intended effect, but they did not hang up. I just got a “yessir”. reply joering2 9 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I always take \"This call may be recorded\" as two way consent :) one time someone was referring to person with hard to pronounce name and I said \"that's fine I will play it back\". Person responded: \"wait, are you recording? I didn't give you my consent\". To which I said yes you did, when I called your line answered with announcement that this call can be recorded. He wasn't too happy :) reply thaumasiotes 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy would you need to tell them that you're recording the call? They already know that the call may be recorded. reply probably_wrong 9 minutes agorootparentNot necessarily. Imagine the following: my company doesn't record calls, but we say that we \"may\" record calls because we think it will convince callers to behave. My employees know that their call is not being recorded, and getting one party to consent to something we don't actually want to do is business as usual. If this took place in a two-party consent state then your consent alone is not enough, you'd also need the caller's consent which my company doesn't have. If you were to record the call without letting the employee know beforehand, that recording would be illegal. reply rasz 9 hours agorootparentprevYou ask them if the phone call is recorder. They say Yes. You, in a surprised voice, ask if they are ok with that?

Probably goes without saying but — we don't want to condemn/bastardize/immiserate the entire institution... reply yareal 10 hours agoparentThe institution of uniformed police forces is relatively recent, established in the 1800s, and it reflects an 1800s era sensibility towards crime. In that it is predominantly focused on protecting the property interests of the wealthy. (The original police forces grew out of a desire to socialize the costs of protecting merchant investments -- the warehouses and docks and factories in much of the world, and slaves held as property in the south of the U.S.) Prior to uniformed police, communities maintained order themselves -- often through night watches in which everyone participated, or eventually through hiring people to \"cover my watch\". Police in the modern era have been used as a threat of violence against common people more or less since their inception in the 1800s, from slave patrols to strikebreaking. They've been used as political assassins killing the political opponents of the state (see Frederick Hampton) to the systematic oppression of gay and trans people (see, for instance, Stonewall inn). Lest these feel like old examples, just this year police shut down a gay bar in Seattle for having \"indecent apparel\" being worn by the gay men in attendance. I think it's absolutely fair for people to think critically about the history and legacy of the institution and wonder, is this the best institution we can imagine to fill this role? Are there better ways to imagine the roles it fills today? Are there systemic issues that need fixing with it? The reason I bring this forward is that any thoughtful critique of the institution is often painted broadly as, \"you are just an anarchist who cannot think beyond your slogans!\" Perhaps the institution could do with some immiseration. reply JumpCrisscross 10 hours agorootparent> Prior to uniformed police, communities maintained order themselves -- often through night watches in which everyone participated, or eventually through hiring people to \"cover my watch\" Dispensing violence as part of these watches was also generally accepted. I'm not sure how that would work in a modern environment. (You're also referring to a period during which most of the world was feudal or quasi-feudal. The people maintaining order had their own security forces.) reply thaumasiotes 4 hours agorootparent> You're also referring to a period during which most of the world was feudal or quasi-feudal.

I'm saying it should be possible to imagine societies without uniformed police forces, because we've had many models for justice without them in the past.

I'm an anarchist (not the purge, but instead self organizing local communities kind). I genuinely believe that much of the role can be done by local community, reserving only the most violent and extreme things for a uniformed force. reply edflsafoiewq 8 hours agorootparentprevPrior to uniformed police, law enforcement was a largely private matter, and private \"thief-takers\" were enlisted to apprehend criminals. My understanding is modern state-run police forces developed in response to public anger over misconduct and corruption in the thief-takers, such as the Macdaniel affair. Particularly they were infamous for playing \"both sides\" by taking money from a victim to arrest a thief, then taking money from the thief not to arrest them. reply quickslowdown 10 hours agorootparentprevThis was way better written than the expletive filled reply I had cooking in my head.

Could be a fascinating read, how societies through history have maintained internal order with various approaches to security. Did Rome have police? What about the Venetians or 16th-18th century europe? Any reading recommendation? Also, I’m now curious what a the future of homeland security could look like. Is anyone writing rationally about this? reply yareal 7 hours agorootparentRome had a few different approaches, the Vigiles mentioned elsewhere in this thread. Several countries had armies enforce legal codes. Some places had night watches run by their local communities. Some had night watches you could pay to avoid participating in. It was considered quite unpleasant and low class to perform a night watch, so the people paid to do it were often those who could not otherwise find work or found it difficult to work elsewhere. In some societies you could seek justice via a duel, essentially calling out the criminal and relying on social pressure to see the duel adhered to. In England there's a system of tithings, shires and shire reeves, individuals who were kept employed and told to keep the peace. The shire reeves could muster people to enforce the law, temporarily. In the 1600s-1800s the monarchs in various countries instituted police forces, but they were typically plainclothes or carried only a symbol of office. (E.g. a badge) These police were closer to what we expect police to be in the modern era, but were not typically or consistently in the same visible, standard uniform. (Though they may have carried, e.g. a sword that might mark them out.) The U.S. also had other police systems, including slave patrols, essentially self formed posses that would ride down escaped slaves. In the 1800s, police forces in England thought, \"you know what would deter crime? Visible police!\" And they began to standardize uniforms with the intent to prevent crime, rather than react to crime. Prior to this moment, policing was typically reactionary -- an aggrieved party seeking justice. The innovation was that if people saw a neighborhood patrolled by uniformed police, they might believe that area was safer and criminals might go elsewhere. Around the 1860s, this idea really took off, and you see many places copying it. I'm on my phone, I'll dig for sources later. reply red_admiral 1 hour agorootparentGreat post, but I feel an aside on the England situation is in order. Prior to police forces, for anything too big for the Shire Reeves or Justices of the Peace to handle, the solution was \"send in the army\". This came to head at the Massacre of St Peter's Field (often called the \"Peterloo Massacre\", for example on its wiki page) where several hundred protesting workers were killed in a cavalry charge in 1819. The massacre caused such public outrage that, among other things, London set up the Metropolitan Police (a.k.a. \"the met\") 10 years later. They were deliberately designed to be a non-militarised force: they wore visible uniforms, but they were black instead of the army's red; they carried truncheons instead of swords or firearms (this is also why most police in the UK to this day do not carry firearms); they were deliberately \"civilian\" not \"paramilitary\"; and they were \"answerable to the public\" in the words of Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel (under whom the force was set up). The preventative instead of reactionary nature of policing definitely fits into this context too. reply thaumasiotes 4 hours agorootparentprev> Several countries had armies enforce legal codes. We do that now. The division of the army responsible for that is called \"the police\". reply gattilorenz 3 hours agorootparentNo, you don’t. Police in the US is militarized but still police (which ironically is part of the problem, AFAIK. They would have better training had they been in the army in some cases). Countries like Italy have Army corps (the Carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza) that do police work but are still part of the army, in addition to also having regular Police. I think this is not uncommon in countries where Napoleonic France had a strong influence, but there’s plenty of commenters here with a better knowledge of the domain, so please correct me if I misremember:) But having part of the army do police work doesn’t really fix most problems with the police, of course. reply Terr_ 3 hours agorootparentprevNow I'm wondering about analogies to useful-but-dangerous technologies, where \"why do you worry so much about the police\" is a bit like \"why do you worry so much about butane lighters and cans of gasoline.\" reply magnetowasright 7 hours agorootparentprevBeautifully said. Your comment about slogans reminds me of the 'thin blue line between anarchy and order' slogan the police themselves use which, to me, is a bare-faced admission of existing to protect the property and interests of the wealthy by suppressing the rest of us. I've never quite understood why that slogan became so popular. reply lolinder 6 hours agorootparentBecause most people don't equate \"order\" with \"oppression by the wealthy\", they understand it to mean \"the stability that allows me to live my life without fear\", which is a pretty unambiguously good thing by most people's measurement. We can argue about whether the police deliver what the slogan offers, but your inability to understand why the slogan is popular stems from your very weird take on its meaning. reply magnetowasright 9 minutes agorootparentI don't understand how it's a 'very weird take' on its meaning. Is it any weirder than people finding comfort in it? It's just hilarious (and confusing) to me that it's just as easily a condemnation rather than praise; no leaps of logic required. At all. Other such slogans are usually a bit more obtuse and harder to challenge than 'yeah, that is exactly correct, and it horrifies me', hence the confusion. I suppose it is a very effective thought terminating cliche. reply yareal 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's especially funny to me, an anarchist, who believes that self organizing communities built around wellbeing for all would be radically better than today's world. If the police are the only thing between today's world and \"luxury space communism\", maybe the police need to be re evaluated. reply gjsman-1000 10 hours agorootparentprevAh, no; this is historically completely inaccurate. Even as early as 1285, King Edward I put into law rules on the minimum number of officers (“constables”) per area. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable reply yareal 10 hours agorootparentConstables are not the same as \"uniformed police forces\". Constables and shire reeves (from which we derive the word sheriff) did predate uniformed police forces, but they generally operated on the \"I'm the local law, and if necessary I can draw on local posses to enforce my law\". A constable with the power to draw men into his service temporarily is not the same as \"these hundred men are full time employed as police officers as their job\". The men hired by constables were typically not uniformed, full time workers, but temporary muscle. The first, iirc, police force was in Glasgow in 1800 with London following in the 1820s. reply hollerith 10 hours agorootparentAlso, IIRC, constables in England were not paid in money, they were paid in opportunities to dispense violence (which many men find rewarding for its own sake) without incurring legal liability and in opportunities to stick it to their enemies as long as the enemies were sufficiently low in rank. \"legal liability\": if you beat someone up in Medieval Europe, the big danger is not the authorities' sentencing you to jail, it was getting sued by your victim. England before 1780 or so was organized for the benefit of the artistocracy (barons and higher ranks). You can see just from the fact that constables were not paid a salary that they probably were a net harm (more of a menace than a help) to the common person, but they were a net benefit to the aristocracy because they generally kept commerce humming along at an faster rate than it would have without the constables and because any constable that messed with an aristocrat would be harshly punished. (The aristocrats specialized in military violence, but it was tedious for them to moderate disputes between commoners, so they farmed some of that work out the the constables, who of course were commoners.) When historians say the world's first police force started in England in 1810 or whatever year it was, they mean the first force with a monopoly on violence that was a net benefit to the every class of society including the commoners. reply JumpCrisscross 10 hours agorootparentprev> The first, iirc, police force was in Glasgow in 1800 They were a thing in Imperial Rome [1]. I believe they got the idea from the Egyptians, who seem to have invented civil policing (or the Chinese, depending on how you categorise police).

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigiles#Police_force reply yareal 10 hours agorootparentThe Vigiles come up a lot in this conversation, however, they were a military unit. In most cases when people think of police in the contemporary setting, they think of a non military force. But you are correct that I should probably say \"uniformed civilian police force\" rather than \"uniformed police force\", as there have been a couple historic examples of the military being used to police people in uniform. reply JumpCrisscross 10 hours agorootparent> Vigiles come up a lot in this conversation, however, they were a military unit Source? They certainly weren't organised under the Roman military. Until the 2nd century, Roman citizens weren't even allowed to serve as vigiles. We could argue they were a paramilitary, but then almost every contemporary police force would qualify as well. > there have been a couple historic examples of the military being used to police people in uniform This was the status quo. The exceptions were the civilisations which invested into legal systems and the investigation of crimes, and even then generally only for a minority. One could argue that industrialisation increased the value of a human life enough that a lord dealing with crimes by murdering random peasants (or a nightwatch \"cleansing\" its community by beating up a pariah) became untenable. reply yareal 9 hours agorootparentMy understanding of the vigiles was that they were under the direct command of centurions, despite being largely slaves, and were organized into barracks. Vigiles could achieve higher or more desirable ranks directly through their service. The vigiles centurions were military men. I think it's fair to say, \"welllll sorta\" to my assertion that they were military, given it was predominantly their individual commanders that were military. But I would assert most folks would find it unfamiliar to think of their local police force being commanded by a military commander. Edit: I want to address directly the idea that the role of police would be conducted by the army, historically. One, sorta, depends historically, but two that's reinforcing my point -- the role police fill has been achieved by many different things in human history, from mobs to armies to uniformed civilian police. We must not accept that the police as they exist today are the only way policing can be done. So often, people fail to imagine better or different ways of achieving that role because they assume it's the way it's always been. My whole point is that police, as we understand them today, is not the way they've always been. We can and should question whether this latest evolution of the role is still the right one. reply JumpCrisscross 7 hours agorootparent> the vigiles was that they were under the direct command of centurions, despite being largely slaves, and were organized into barracks I've had difficulty determining if these were military centurions, or a broader use of the term. Also realised: it’s uniquely difficult to draw a civil-military distinction in ancient Rome given how they thought about leadership--a good politician was a good general and vice versa. Within that context, given they were a mix of slaves and freedmen, had short life expectancies and were lightly armed [1], arguing they were more military than civil is like saying our police are military on the sole basis of being commanded by seargeants. > must not accept that the police as they exist today are the only way policing can be done Agree. A lot of things we administer today, on the other hand, were never publicly administered. Like mental health. [1] https://novelsofcolinhough.wordpress.com/2021/03/27/the-vigi... reply yareal 4 hours agorootparentFair enough. Of all the historical policing systems, the vigiles seem to be more similar to modern police forces than other systems. I still think the vigiles are probably notably quite different from police - operating mostly at night, being able to move directly into the military, sleeping in a barracks. Much of the policing during the day was carried out by cohortes urbanae, which definitely were military units. But they were an organized firefighting and policing force (and I haven't been able to find information on whether they were uniformed). I can see the resemblance, but they also existed in Rome for 300 years then disappeared. reply gjsman-1000 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah, like that’s a preferable system. Basically, the powers of a police officer on steroids. reply yareal 10 hours agorootparentI don't believe I said the historical systems were better or preferable. Please double check the post I made, I highlighted the existence of alternative systems not to say \"return to tradition\", but rather to say \"police forces as we know them today are not axiomatic. We can invent other systems.\" Police may be an improvement on those past systems, while at the same time be outmoded (if one believes they are outmoded.) reply Ajay-p 10 hours agoprevI think this is a good thing.

In places where there is one party consent it requires much more trust to have these types of private conversations, because any conversation could be recorded and placed on twitter. For example, I think it's awful that in some places it's legal to privately tell you friend about a mental health struggle you are having, and for that friend to, without your knowledge, share a recording of that conversation with other people. In my mind two party consent is a basic data-privacy law. You cannot create a record of something you expected to be private. You can have an expectation of a private conversation to be private. reply planede 50 minutes agorootparentTaking a recording and sharing the recording are two different things. I think the intention universally is to deter from sharing the recording. Punishing taking the recording is also a way to do that, but I don't see much harm in having private recordings for personal use. reply judge2020 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat a bad take. Private doesn’t mean “off the record”. Making it so that you can’t record unless you ask the other party for consent to record makes it harder to hold people accountable for their actions, gather proof of labor law violations, and confess to other types of crimes. If you’re saying something that “could be placed on twitter”, maybe reflect on the harm your statement is causing that the rest of society agrees about.

I've worked on bills where multiple members of law enforcement turned up to testify to say things that I'm pretty sure they knew were wrong, just to get their way in policy. The sad reality is that there are many cops out there who lie to get their way and hurt people they don't like, and so I really don't find it hard to believe that they would accuse this guy of being a sovcit to damage his credibility. edit: also in this case, remember that they've also accused him of resisting arrest when they went to get him for recording phone calls.

More than 25 million adults in the U.S., have a condition called tinnitus, according to the American Tinnitus Association. It can be stressful, even panic-inducing and difficult to manage. Dozens of factors can contribute to the onset of tinnitus, including hearing loss, exposure to loud noise or a viral illness. There's no cure, but there are a range of strategies to reduce the symptoms and make it less bothersome, including hearing aids, mindfulness therapy, and one newer option – a device approved by the FDA to treat tinnitus using electrical stimulation of the tongue. The device has helped Victoria Banks, a singer and songwriter in Nashville, Tenn., who developed tinnitus about three years ago. \"The noise in my head felt like a bunch of cicadas,\" Banks says. \"It was terrifying.\" The buzz made it difficult for her to sing and listen to music. \"It can be absolutely debilitating,\" she says. Shots - Health News Tinnitus Bothers Millions Of Americans. Here's How To Turn Down The Noise Banks tried taking dietary supplements, but those didn't help. She also stepped up exercise, but that didn't bring relief either. Then she read about a device called Lenire, which was approved by the FDA in March 2023. It includes a plastic mouthpiece with stainless steel electrodes that electrically stimulate the tongue. It is the first device of its kind to be approved for tinnitus. \"This had worked for other people, and I thought I'm willing to try anything at this point,\" Banks recalls. She sought out audiologist Brian Fligor, who treats severe cases of tinnitus in the Boston area. Fligor was impressed by the results of a clinical trial that found 84% of participants who tried Lenire experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. He became one of the first providers in the U.S. to use the device with his patients. Fligor also served on an advisory panel assembled by the company who developed it. \"A good candidate for this device is somebody who's had tinnitus for at least three months,\" Fligor says, emphasizing that people should be evaluated first to make sure there's not an underlying medical issue. Tinnitus often accompanies hearing loss, but Victoria Banks' hearing was fine and she had no other medical issue, so she was a good candidate. Banks used the device for an hour each day for 12 weeks. During the hour-long sessions, the electrical stimulation \"tickles\" the tongue, she says. In addition, the device includes a set of headphones that play a series of tones and ocean-wave sounds. The device works, in part, by shifting the brain's attention away from the buzz. We're wired to focus on important information coming into our brains, Fligor says. Think of it as a spotlight at a show pointed at the most important thing on the stage. \"When you have tinnitus and you're frustrated or angry or scared by it, that spotlight gets really strong and focused on the tinnitus,\" Fligor says. \"It's the combination of what you're feeling through the nerves in your tongue and what you're hearing through your ears happening in synchrony that causes the spotlight in your brain to not be so stuck on the tinnitus,\" Fligor explains. Enlarge this image A clinical trial found 84% of people who used the device experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. Brian Fligor hide caption toggle caption Brian Fligor A clinical trial found 84% of people who used the device experienced a significant reduction in symptoms. Brian Fligor \"It unsticks your spotlight\" and helps desensitize people to the perceived noise that their tinnitus creates, he says. Banks says the ringing in her ears did not completely disappear, but now it's barely noticeable on most days. \"It's kind of like if I lived near a waterfall and the waterfall was constantly going,\" she says. Over time, the waterfall sound fades out of consciousness. \"My brain is now focusing on other things,\" and the buzz is no longer so distracting. She's back to listening to music, writing music, and performing music.\" I'm doing all of those things,\" she says. When the buzz comes back into focus, Banks says a refresher session with the device helps. A clinical trial found that 84% of people who tried Lenire, saw significant improvements in their condition. To measure changes, the participants took a questionnaire that asked them to rate how much tinnitus was impacting their sleep, sense of control, feelings of well-being and quality of life. After 12 weeks of using the device, participants improved by an average of 14 points. \"Where this device fits into the big picture, is that it's not a cure-all, but it's quickly become my go-to,\" for people who do not respond to other ways of managing tinnitus, Fligor says. One down-side is the cost. Banks paid about $4,000 for the Lenire device, and insurance doesn't cover it. She put the expense on her credit card and paid it off gradually. Fligor hopes that as the evidence of its effectiveness accumulates, insurers will begin to cover it. Despite the cost, more than 80% of participants in the clinical trial said they would recommend the device to a friend with tinnitus. But, it's unclear how long the benefits last. Clinical trials have only evaluated Lenire over a 1-year period. \"How durable are the effects? We don't really know yet,\" says audiologist Marc Fagelson, the scientific advisory committee chair of the American Tinnitus Association. He says research is promising but there's still more to learn. Fagelson says the first step he takes with his patients is an evaluation for hearing loss. Research shows that hearing aids can be an effective treatment for tinnitus among people who have both tinnitus and hearing loss, which is much more common among older adults. An estimated one-third of adults 65 years of age and older who have hearing loss, also have tinnitus. \"We do see a lot of patients, even with very mild loss, who benefit from hearing aids,\" Fagelson says, but in his experience it's about 50-50 in terms of improving tinnitus. Often, he says people with tinnitus need to explore options beyond hearing aids. Bruce Freeman, a scientist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, says he's benefitted from both hearing aids and Lenire. He was fitted for the device in Ireland where it was developed, before it was available in the U.S. Freeman agrees that the ringing never truly disappears, but the device has helped him manage the condition. He describes the sounds that play through the device headphones as very calming and \"almost hypnotic\" and combined with the tongue vibration, it's helped desensitize him to the ring. Freeman – who is a research scientist – says he's impressed with the results of research, including a study published in Nature, Scientific Reports that points to significant improvements among clinical trial participants with tinnitus. Freeman experienced a return of his symptoms when he stopped using the device. \"Without it the tinnitus got worse,\" he says. Then, when he resumed use, it improved. Freeman believes his long-term exposure to noisy instruments in his research laboratory may have played a role in his condition, and also a neck injury from a bicycle accident that fractured his vertebra. \"All of those things converged,\" he says. Freeman has developed several habits that help keep the high-pitched ring out of his consciousness and maintain good health. \"One thing that does wonders is swimming,\" he says, pointing to the swooshing sound of water in his ears. \"That's a form of mindfulness,\" he explains. When it comes to the ring of tinnitus, \"it comes and goes,\" Freeman says. For now, it has subsided into the background, he told me with a sense of relief. \"The last two years have been great,\" he says – a combination of the device, hearing aids and the mindfulness that comes from a swim.

    "commentBody": "An FDA approved device offers a new treatment for tinnitus (npr.org)275 points by andsoitis 19 hours agohidepastfavorite159 comments tithe 15 hours agoI've had a mental visualization I've used to control tinnitus flares for about 20 years now - i.e., \"biofeedback\". I image the entire soundscape (what I'm possible of hearing) as a long, thin line which is warbling a bit, as I'm hearing things right now -- like the line in an oscilloscope. The present tinnitus represents itself as a sharp spike in this visualization, the location dependent upon its texture (sharp pings, or a low muffled warble). I then imagine a giant hand (my hand) on top of that spike, pushing it down, slowly, and as I push it down, the tinnitus subsides (since I know what that subsiding sensation feels like). Sometimes I have to do this pushing motion a few times before the spike slowly attenuates by itself and it joins the surrounding levels. The entire process takes about 30 seconds, and doesn't work every time. If after a few attempts it fails, I abandon the visualization exercise (lest my brain somehow learns the pushing motion to be ineffective). It's not entirely clear to me how / why this works: mapping a physical phenomenon onto an abstract mental visualization / picture, and then manipulating that mental picture and thus the physical phenomenon. I'm also very musical, so these sorts of visualizations tend to come very naturally to me. reply monknomo 15 hours agoparentI don't have tinnitus, but I do have this thing where when I'm falling asleep, my eyes (despite being closed and in a dark room) will start to feel like they are looking at a brighter and brighter light.

I wonder if there is a way to do it without opening them These feedback things are interesting, thank you for sharing reply mtalantikite 14 hours agorootparentThis is actually an experience that people that engage in the tantric practices in Vajrayana Buddhism -- of which Tibetan Buddhism belongs to -- cultivate. I've encountered the instructions as part of the dream yoga practices, to cultivate it so that you actually watch yourself fall asleep and enter the dream state completely lucidly. I've only ever been able to \"catch\" the dream and become lucid when already in the dream. Maybe you're way ahead of the rest of us!

Something about that repeated motion allowed me to keep some subset conscious as the whole transitioned into sleep. It was a very spooky transition! I descended until I felt a cold hand on my shoulder and whispers all around me, crescendoing to me opening my eyes to the lake in the neighborhood i grew up in. The fidelity of the simulation was very high as well, certainly beat my ability to distinguish! Eventually, as i was flying down the street a giant sand worm emerged from a darkness and closed in on me until i woke up. I could control some things but it felt like the dream telling me it'd had enough. reply mtalantikite 13 hours agorootparentThat's awesome, thanks for sharing that. I've gotten to the point of hearing dream sounds like you described while falling through the sleep stages, but it startled me enough to wake me up!

That should indicate if it's sleep-related or not. reply mtalantikite 15 hours agoparentprevOh this sounds really interesting, thanks! Sometimes during my daily meditation practice I use my tinnitus as an object of awareness, like you would with your breath, which, coincidentally, I did this morning. There's so many more frequencies and changes going on when you meditate with it, including tones that definitely only arise when you're practicing with it. I find it helps and I'm definitely going to try it with your visualization. reply jakeway 14 hours agoparentprevInteresting, I've done something similar for headaches.

Like you said it doesn't always work but surprised it has ever worked. reply krackers 12 hours agorootparentFrom this perspective, techniques such as Reiki are not that surprising, they may be methods of more effectively exploiting this mind-body connection: all of these techniques usually have in common some sort of visualization, and learning to associate certain colors/signs/symbols with desired effects.

I had two lots of \"gromits\" - tiny tubes stuffed into my eustacean tubes under general ana ... oh for fucks sake, why can't medics and doctors n that speak English. Law courts have dispensed with Latin and Greek, why can't medics? Tinnitus is generally consistent in my experience - the surrounding environment within my body allows it to flow in and out of my conscious experience depending on what I'm up to.

The audiologist did some tests and found I have one ear having a section of frequencies with poor response. His hypothesis is vascular damage due to Covid restricted blood supply to the hairs in that one part of the ear canal. The brain fills in the discontinuity from the resulting \"notch filter\" audio response (in Electrical Engineering terminology), and that hallucinated sound is the tinnitus. reply stuaxo 15 hours agoparentprevI had it already, Covid made it much worse. NHS tinnitus awareness course had a bit about accepting it as background noise (vs just concentrating on it and being annoyed), I rubbished that at first but it helped quite a bit in the end.

Got Covid in April '22 which caused my existing tinnitus to 2-3x in severity, lasting a couple months before it either reverted to baseline or I got used to the new normal. Very scary experience. The CEO of Texas Roadhouse famously committed suicide due in part to severe post-Covid tinnitus.

A few months followed of \"oh shit, is my life experience permanently broken now?\" and all the bad feelings that connotes. I was in a really bad place. I've always been someone who can hear electronics - when CRTs are popular, I'd know if one was in the upcoming room while I was still in the hallway. At some point, I realized that I heard all sorts of minor sounds just by existing in my apartment, and that tinnitus isn't much different than that. Helped me chill out about the whole scenario. My mom taught me \"lean into the good, and you'll feel more of the good; lean into the bad, and you'll feel more of the bad.\" That's certainly been my experience with tinnitus. Letting yourself panic and gloom about it is the worst part of having it. If you don't assign valence to it (don't let it be good or bad, just a thing you experience), it loses its power to drive you mad. reply PcChip 17 hours agoparentprevI feel the same way - I forget I have it until I read about it, then i can hear it again (unless I've had too much salt or caffeine or something) reply neilv 12 hours agorootparentWhat I was told: salt, caffeine, alcohol, and stress.

I can quite clearly high pitched noises such as CRT monitors and ultrasonic mosquito repellent.

My understanding of the underlying cause of tinnitus iirc, is that it's caused by damage to hair cells in your inner ear. Our brains interpret this damage and loss of signal as a signal; thus, we hear a high-pitched tone even when it is silent. Training your brain to ignore this seems like treating the underlying cause, which is a misinterpretation of auditory signals or the lack thereof. I have tinnitus but most times I don't notice it. Go to a loud venue for a while and even with earplugs it noticeably comes back for up to a week or two. reply hooverd 17 hours agorootparentAlthough, there are also people who are deaf as a doornail and never get it.

For both ears, close your ears with your index finger and than tap on the index fingers with your middle fingers - to make a loud pounding sound - a few times. As far as I know, these short peaks are not dangerous to the ear, but safely overload hearing sensitivity. You may gain a few (sometimes critical) moments of silent peace this way. reply fallinghawks 15 hours agoparentprevI can make mine go away temporarily (as in a minute or so) by sticking my fingers in my ears and jiggling them around to make a lot of noise for 10 seconds. I suspect it's just the contrast, but it is really nice to have something resembling real silence. A few years back I got a bad wax buildup in one ear and stopped hearing anything. After they took the wax out, my ear was hypersensitive for a day or so. I heard every little rustle, shifting in my chair, even fabric moving when I moved my arm. reply KomoD 15 hours agorootparentI can also make it go away temporarily (also just a minute or two) with the tapping technique \"Place the palms of your hands over your ears with fingers resting gently on the back of your head.

I think of it a little like phantom limb pains If you feel pain in a hand or foot that you no longer have, retraining your brain is one way to fix it. Maybe regrowing a foot would be better, but we don't know how to do that. reply TheBigSalad 15 hours agorootparentI'm not doctor or scientist, but I think of it like the nerves in the ear are signaling off constantly. The brain is operating normally by listening to them, but what you really want is for it to adapt and start to ignore the bad signals. The brain can phase them out, but it can never stop receiving the signal, so you still hear it if you consciously focus on it. It sounds like this person is already there but still looking for a real cure, something to stop the signals. reply idontwantthis 17 hours agoparentprevIt doesn’t sound to me like it would help you in that case, if it is just about attention. I have tinnitus as well and after months of focusing on it trying to “cure” it, I learned to adapt and now it is better and doesn’t keep me up at night or interfere with anything. This sounds like a shortcut to the acceptance that patients need to achieve in order to move on. But maybe it would make a real difference to very high intensity patients. reply frompdx 9 hours agoprevI would like to offer a more comical tinnitus anecdote as someone with a moderate hereditary hearing impairment. I have always had tinnitus for as long as I remember. Usually it's a constant ringing that gets more intense until it stops. When I was very young I described it to the school district audiologist as \"hearing trains\", or at least that's what I remember of trying to describe the sensation as a five year old. It never really bothered me to be honest. I was always a little baffled when I read stories about it ruining someone's life. Then two years ago I had just moved into a new house. After returning from a roadtrip I started hearing what I was convinced was a smoke detector beeping due to low battery in mostly my left ear. I looked everywhere for the source of the beep. In the attic, in the crawlspace, in the garage, everywhere. I started to wonder if maybe it was in my head, but from time to time I would hear the beep and once again scour the house for the source of the mystery beep. Finally, I went on another trip and lo and behold, I heard the beep in the dead of night in my hotel room. After that, I knew it was a new tinnitus symptom. My theory is that possibly having the windows down while I was driving on such a long trip caused new hearing loss and produced new tinnitus symptoms. Luckily, I feel that being able to recognize that it is no different than the tinnitus I have always had, and that it is something outside of my control seems to allow me to remain unbothered once again. reply joshspankit 15 hours agoprevI accidentally did something similar, but there’s a significant cost. Got tinnitus at 15 and over time my brain filtered out the sound. Unfortunately one of the tones was in the upper vocal range so I then developed trouble understanding people with higher-pitched voices as some syllables would be entirely filtered out. Second is that I stopped paying attention to sounds that aggravated it. This caused me to gather more damage and I ended up getting additional frequencies that my brain wasn’t filtering out. reply criddell 15 hours agoparentHave you tried hearing aids? I went to an audiologist a week ago and found that I have mild hearing loss in higher frequencies and as a result certain letter combinations are hard for me to hear. She told me hearing aids might help. I get a 30 day free trial, so the only thing I have to lose is the time to get them and get them dialed in. The audiologist also gave me a copy of the audiogram. In the health app I used the camera to scan it and it adjusted the frequency output on my ear buds to compensate for some of my hearing loss. reply technofiend 13 hours agoparentprevThat's the real problem with hearing loss: if you compensate by raising volume across the entire spectrum of sound to compensate for a few frequencies, you slowly make yourself more and more deaf. And I suffer from a notch in my hearing where speech is generally found, so I hear clinking glasses and shuffling chairs far easier than people. It's aggravating for everyone involved. If you're lucky enough to afford hearing aids, you'll soon discover hearing aid companies know the best fidelity comes from high discretion and narrow band amplification. And they're pricing hearing aids accordingly: the more and narrower the bands, the higher the price. Also aggravating. reply bradley13 15 hours agoprevMy case is classic: hearing damage at one particular frequency (from one stupid event). Apparently, the neurons got bored, and decided to create their own input at that frequency. As others gave said, you get used to it and rarely notice it. I suppose that is more difficult if it's not just constant noise. reply dtgriscom 11 hours agoparentAh, how we'd all benefit from a life rewind button... reply diego_sandoval 18 hours agoprevA similar device is being developed by Dr. Susan Shore.

It's fairly underfunded, as the symptom is just like \"tummy ache\". No clearly visible suffering with a million possible causes. During High School and Uni, I played violin in various restaurants a bunch. Close spaces, full volume to match a singing crowd. A year later of no active playing, suddenly I got 1 day of hearing loss on the left ear, followed by tinnitus after hearing restored on the side where the violin is played. E-String'ish tinnitus pitch. Loudly and constantly present, can't understand speech levels strong on the left ear. That was beyond horrible and sacred the hell out of me. Straight up torture. I think of myself as mentally strong, but that put everything into perspective of how fragile my psyche is, if pushed just at the right spot. ENTs got me on multiple rounds of steroid injections through the ear drum. Luckily it subsided within 2-3 months, though fully unclear if the steroids helped or not. Only then I found out, you are supposed to use ear protection when playing violin, specialized musician's plugs that attenuate the volume a bit. reply ineedaj0b 8 hours agoprevIf you’re worried you have tinnitus you can also be hearing air conditioner units whine or even the fridge.

It was in part exposure to loud noises over the years (military), but I think chemotherapy really did me in the past year as tinnitus has become more bothersome than ever; caveat I tend to register and take interest in anything physical after cancer. Its a constant beaming sound - I hear it right now. I can go most of the day distracting away from it, but there is no great aid or distraction when trying to go to sleep. The closest solution has been trying to cancel it out with mobile apps that allow to you build custom frequencies (white noise generators) but they aren't perfect its not something I really have been able to become accustomed to using. reply trimbo 18 hours agoprev> It includes a plastic mouthpiece with stainless steel electrodes that electrically stimulate the tongue.

It's frustrating. reply hcarvalhoalves 17 hours agoparentIt’s frustrating, I’ve been through that - hearing is fine, but tinnitus persists. There’s no single recommended treatment studied by medicine so far. I’m not a doctor but I visited multiple doctors and tried many things, and I’m doing better now. The obvious stuff: - Stress management. - Cut caffeine and alcohol. These substances affect blood flow of the inner ear. - Do you have neck pain? Pain in the neck region affects the inner ear. Seek physiotherapy. - Do you grind teeth or snore while sleeping? Seek TMJ disorder treatment. Less obvious stuff: - Supplement magnesium. Magnesium chelated is best. Most people are lacking it today, it is a muscle relaxant and also had an important effect to regulate blood flow. - Ginko biloba tea or extract can help on headache and promotes blood flow on the brain as well. Must be consumed in small quantities as it has a strong blood thinner effect, so if you can get standardized capsules is best. - B6/B12 rich diet or supplementation to help repair damaged nervous cells of the inner ear after infection. The treatments are a mix of things that help repair the inner ear, promote blood flow and avoid pain signals in the area. reply criddell 15 hours agorootparentCould you share the specific brand/dose for the magnesium and ginko that helped you? reply hcarvalhoalves 9 hours agorootparentThe chelated magnesium I asked a local pharmacy to manipulate, but any reputable brand should work. The protocol is 300-400mg daily for 3 months. Toxicity is hard to achieve, the body will store Mg on the bones for when you need and the excess goes in urine, but drink plenty of water.

I seem to be incorrectly remembering it as percussive tinnitus - all I can find now is pulsatile tinnitus. Whatever it's called, it was a tapping in my ear at about 120 bps, only noticeable when going to sleep. It was possibly caused by a bike fall, very jarring to the body, no head contact, and disappeared after two or three weeks. reply earslap 17 hours agoparentI had that in one ear for 2-3 years. By pulsatile tinnitus I assume you mean the loud \"whooshing\" sound that is in sync with your heart beat (hearing the blood flow basically). Doctors were pretty ignorant about the phenomenon, I gave up. It was not constant either, would go away for a few hours, start again for another few hours - repeat. One day, it stopped and never came back. Pretty mysterious. reply calf 16 hours agorootparentI'm having unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, and it's been 3 months so far. My doctor thinks its often just eustachian tube seasonal allergies, and so gets better on its own slowly. The steroid spray I've been using for months just hurts my nose.

I really hope it improves on this trajectory. reply foxbarrington 14 hours agorootparentI hesitate to recommend this because of how woo woo it sounds, but... I had terrible pulsatile tinnitus (both sides) for over a year and half. I went to doctors, specialists, tried steroids, the works. I had to sleep with headphones to drown it out.

Mine developed suddenly during one of the early peaks in 2020. Unfortunately I was also producing music at the time with headphones, which I've considered the likely cause. But who knows -- maybe it was a combo of things. My stress was through the roof, I wasn't sleeping much, I put on a lot of weight, and I was exposing my ears to moderately loud sounds.

    "originLink": "https://supabase.com/ga",
    "originBody": "We are moving to General Availability 15 April 2024 Watch announcement 1,000,000+ databases managed 2,500+ databases launched daily Top 125 GitHub Ranking GitHub repo star rating 01General Availability 02Open Source & Community 03Scale to millions 04Enterprise 05Our partners 06What's new 07What's next General Availability 01 During the first year of Supabase we set ourselves a goal: build a managed platform capable of securely running 1 million databases. Today we've proven that metric and we're announcing the General Availability of the platform that will serve the next 99 million. We've been production-ready for years now. We kept the “beta” label because we wanted to make sure that our organization can support all types of customers, no matter their demands. Today we're confident in our ability to take any profile of customer and help them become successful. We have a crew of amazing Postgres engineers and support staff who work tirelessly to educate customers with Postgres technicalities, improving our product simultaneously. Whether you're an indie hacker or a Fortune 500, Supabase can scale comfortably for your production workload. Rocketships like Udio, Krea, Humata, and Pika use Supabase to build fast and scale faster. Enterprise customers such as Mozilla, PwC, Johnson & Johnson, and 1Password use Supabase to manage their applications securely. 36% of the last Y Combinator batch used Supabase to launch their start up. Supabase has been great to develop applications. As a firm focused on security, we've been happy to work with Row Level Security Policies to secure database operations. Matthieu, Tech Lead. PwC France Open Source & Community 02 Our community is the driving force behind the development and adoption of Supabase. The GitHub community is the foundation of our company: submitting feature requests, discovering bugs, creating PRs, and pushing our team to develop a useful product. We're committed to our licenses - all of our public repos have OSI-compliant licenses. We have no plans to change this. Self-hosting is easier than ever. You can get started in less than 5 minutes on a hosted VPS. We're committed to our free plan - we know the importance of this for testing hobby projects and prototyping. Almost all of the largest databases on Supabase today started on the free plan, a clear indication that our free plan is important for building an enduring platform. 65,000 GitHub stars 106,000 Twitter followers 25,000 Discord members 23,000 YouTube subscribers 10,000 Reddit subs Build in a weekend, scale to millions 03 Our tagline is “Build in a weekend, scale to millions”. This isn't hyperbole. In the past, reaching 1 million users was an incredible challenge. It took Instagram 2.5 months, Facebook 10 months, and Twitter 24 months. In the past year, we've had 12 companies start on Supabase and grow from zero to over 1 million users. Most of these were AI companies, like Udio, Krea, Humata, Chatbase, Pika, Quivr, Mendable, Markprompt and MDN search by Mozilla. Postgres has been instrumental in our scalability and adoption. It's versatility is best demonstrated by pgvector: we were the first cloud provider to offer it, and today 15% of all new Supabase projects use pgvector for AI and ML workloads. Look out for a few related announcements this week. Enterprise 04 Supabase can now scale comfortably to any workload. Companies such as 1Password, PwC, and Johnson & Johnson use Supabase to build Postgres-backed applications. We've spent years working with larger organizations to meet their requirements for running Supabase in production. This includes enhanced security tooling, industry best-practices (SOC2 and HIPAA), round the clock support, and SLAs. This week we've added support for Supabase in the AWS Marketplace. Enterprise customers can now purchase Supabase as part of their committed AWS spend. We'll continue to expand the Supabase Enterprise offering to include more deployment options, including \"Bring your own cloud\". If you're interested in using Supabase in your organization, get in touch via the Supabase for Enterprise form. SOC 2 HIPAA Data Encryption Role-based access control Backups DDoS Protection Our partners 05 The Supabase community doesn't exist in isolation. It's part of a group of developer focused companies and communities who are constantly pushing the boundaries of developer experience and developer productivity. We've teamed up with Fly to bring Postgres to developers across the world. (More on this later this week). Vercel users can use the Supabase integration to connect Supabase to their Next.js projects, and we have deep integrations with Flutterflow, Resend, and Twilio. Cloudflare recently announced the Supabase integration for Workers and Hyperdrive. Developers have different preferences on how to connect to their database, and Supabase is \"just Postgres\" you can connect natively with Prisma, Drizzle, or Kysely. You can find the full list of partners and integrations on our Partners page. If you're interested in partnering with Supabase head over to the Partner Portal. What's new? 06 In addition to General Availability, we also have several other major announcements to make today. The Supabase Index Advisor is now available inside Supabase Studio. As its name suggests, this will analyze your database and make recommendations to add or remove table indexes. This is just the beginning of our plan to make automated data analysis tooling available to all developers. Supabase Branching works like Git branches. You can create and test database changes or try out features in a separate, temporary instance without affecting your production setup. Today Branching enters public availability. Supabase has acquired Oriole. Oriole is a company founded by Postgres Hacker Alexander Korotkov to solve the hairy problems of Postgres. We're constantly on the lookout for ways to remove the friction in getting started with your new projects. Supabase Bootstrap is now the easiest way to get started with Supabase and your favorite development framework. Today Supabase Swift SDK will join supabase-js as an officially supported client library, and supabase-swift maintainer Guilherme Souza will join the Supabase team full time. The goal of Supabase is to become the default backend for all kinds of developers. What's next? 07 One of our key metrics at Supabase is \"Time to Value\". How fast can a user go from idea to production? We'll never stop pushing on what's possible here. It is only the first day of Supabase GA Week. Today's releases are just the start: we have 4 more days of exciting announcements to come. Follow the new announcements here. If you want to try Supabase today, we just started an asynchronous hackathon. It's a great way to try out all the new features. Go here to read the rules and start hacking.

    "commentBody": "We are moving to General Availability (supabase.com)247 points by jimmcslim 22 hours agohidepastfavorite94 comments jmeyer2k 18 hours agoCongrats on the launch! Here's our experience with Supabase at https://automark.io (Next.js + Supabase). - First of all, Supabase let us launch fast which was amazing. Super powerful Postgres features without the pain of self-hosting (or so we thought). - We started out using their hosted product for both our DB, storage, auth, and functions. - Functions have a critical bug that prevent us from using in development so we decided to move to our own API servers: https://github.com/supabase/edge-runtime/issues/212 - Now, the connection between our API servers and the database was slow (a few hundred ms per query), so we moved to self-hosting Postgres which was pretty painful. We tried to use https://github.com/supabase/postgres, but the documentation was very lacking and we had to make a bunch of modifications to get it to work. After we got it working, it was pretty smooth though - pretty easy to implement backups, etc. - Our latest issue has been around auth where the cookie name options change. We've spent hours debugging random cookie issues deep in the auth framework (they finally released `@supabase/ssr` which is pretty decent, but we're still thinking about moving to handling auth on our side so we know and can debug the logic). One thing to mention: although our requirements didn't quite fit Supabase and we ran into these issues, we weren't locked into their hosting. We were able to completely move off of it over the course of a few weeks, but continue using the self-hosted version. This is a huge benefit over something like Firebase or Amplify. We're pretty satisfied with Supabase as an open source project, but not as satisfied with Supabase hosting. reply kiwicopple 17 hours agoparent> We're pretty satisfied with Supabase as an open source project As an open source company, we'll take that as a mark of success.

The server to database latency was very high(few hundred ms) whereas Planetscale DB in the same region gives sub 10ms.

I have a toy project with a server on Fly.io and the DB on Supabase within the same city When sending API requests to the server, my end user latency was around 25ms-100ms (depending on the endpoint and how many DB calls it was doing) Now with Supabase on Fly, that API latency is down to 17ms-70ms.

We always wanted to be \"Postgres plus useful tools\" so we started evolving the positioning over the past year you'll still see \"firebase alternative\" on our site: I think the comparison is apt and the aspiration remains the same reply jerrygoyal 5 hours agoparentprevMy feedback on Supabase: I would like to see a separate PGS offering instead of it being bundled with your other services. I already pay Vercel for hosting and functions, so the problem is already solved there. I can't move my hosting and functions because of the first-class support for Next.js by Vercel (vendor lock-in is strong here). I use Firebase for authentication, which is free for unlimited MAU. The only thing I'm looking for is PGS. I know the current cost is not much even if your other services are bundled together, but that may not be the case in the future. A separate PGS offering makes more sense for users like me. reply benreesman 8 hours agoparentprevI’ve just started dabbling so take this with a grain of salt. Overall, it’s great. I recommend it to people. The high signal part is what I would work on: - deeper integrations with common OpenID Connect providers, with a pretty foolproof “bail to browser view that looks like Kinde or Clerk”. there’s only so much you can do, but it’s not trivial to get wired up to a bunch of pick-and choose SSOs. - prisma should be front and center, the auth/public schema split is not a breeze, Prisma slays at being an ORM, Supabase slays at other things. It’s not obvious whether or not to use realtime or Pulse. - force the env footprint on e.g. next or expo or whatever, it’s a little glue, it’s a lot of people who don’t pop out of the funnel. - chat / dm is a common enough use case to be in the wizard (like avatars), Postgres handles it fine for small to medium apps, and arguably for big ones - have a pass through mode for the local deploy that’s easy to toggle, you guys are fast AF, it’s often sane to dev directly against the instance. - I’m sure you’re already building the kind of anonymized training sets that let you spot bad configs a mile away. Again, nitpicks on a great product. I love Supabase. reply kiwicopple 6 hours agorootparentthis is all great, actionable feedback.

I guess it just helps me to write fast when I'm not thinking about punctuation/grammar. I'll make more effort to capitalize. reply davetron5000 13 hours agoprevI built a toy app using this, with a front-end only app and postgrest + RBS. The app was seriously two forms behind a login. It was a huge pain. RBS is \"insecure by default\" meaning if you don't set it up right, all users can access all data. And, because it's SQL, it's really easy to write a valid and successful configuration that doesn't work. You have to test it. And for views, you have to do some real heroics to get them to respect RBS. PostGREST is very very basic and far less powerful than just writing SQL. I found it pretty frustrating to use, knowing that SQL would be far simpler. Yes, I know that I could make a direct SQL connection to the database, but at that point, it would've been easier to put a Rails app on Heroku and use their offering, which is far more mature. The Supabase dev environment was pretty slick and worked well, though I had to docker implode a couple times. I wish them luck, but I could not figure out what the use case was for their product, given that Heroku has an awesome managed Postgres and RDS is there if you have more knowledge and want more controls. I don't see how you could make a complex app that is front-end only with Supabase as your entire back-end. reply TOMDM 13 hours agoparentA few things, RLS is secure by default, it's postgrest that's insecure by default. RLS disables all operations on a table once enabled and is only operable once there's a passing policy unless you can bypass RLS. When it comes to access control, you should probably always have tests for anything halfway important. Views are a bit of a footgun when it comes to RLS, they bypass it by default. But getting them to play nice is as simple as defining \"security invoker\" in their definition; not what I'd call heroics. reply steve-chavez 11 hours agorootparent> A few things, RLS is secure by default, it's postgrest that's insecure by default. What makes you think that? PostgREST delegates all the authorization to PostgreSQL, which is secure by default. You have to explicitly assign privileges to roles for every operation.

I paid $20/mo for a while because of the free tier storage cutoff (500 MB), but have since stopped. I wish you had a $5/mo tier for \"small projects\" folks who need a database larger than that. For example, Cloudflare's Workers Paid is $5 for D1 databases up to 10GB, with 5GB included and 75¢GB after. I know this is comparing apples and oranges to some degree and that your business model may be incompatible with this use case, which is absolutely fair. reply kelsey98765431 19 hours agoprevThis is not a negative statement against Supabase, but heed my warning: Do not build out your MVP on supabase. If you need to scale and want a MSP do it after the MVP. Detangling the lock in is not fun. Everything offered by supabase is easily found elsewhere without the MSP lock in. reply Difwif 18 hours agoparentThis isn't fair feedback. You have to be more specific about the \"lock in\". Supabase itself is just managed Postgres and can be self-hosted. The entire point is that everything they offer is open source and easily found elsewhere. I can imagine they fall short in some aspects from that ideal and I would love to know your experience but even with your first sentence this is just a pretty damning write off. Disclaimer: I'm NOT a Supabase employee, just a happy user. reply BoorishBears 18 hours agorootparentPeople keep writing this, doesn't Supabase rely on spinning up additional services to leave, meaning you can't leave to another managed offering? Off the top of my mind, PostgREST and go-true? https://github.com/supabase/auth - If you use Postgres you're \"locked\" into Postgres: a technology with a laundry list of providers. If you leave Supabase, you'll lose the fully managed aspect of 99% of the Postgres providers out there, which confirms the pain the parent comment is describing. reply kiwicopple 17 hours agorootparentthis is no different than running, say, Rails on a managed service. You can take the service and you run it somewhere else: each individual service is wrapped into a docker image which should make it easy. You can use as many or as few of the services as you want - its designed it that way: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architectur... reply BoorishBears 16 hours agorootparentThis just sidesteps what I said? Supabase is most attractive to those without the skills to run an unmanaged service A bespoke solution, even if it's open, doesn't mean it's as portable as a very standard solution. If you want portability, the parent comment was right: don't embed Supabase deeply into your application. reply switchbak 15 hours agorootparentYou're suggesting a hosted Postgres offering isn't \"as portable\" as a very standard solution? This isn't DynamoDB here, this is about as standard as it gets. I'm failing to find the supposed lock-in being talked about here. reply BoorishBears 15 hours agorootparentIs having your frontend hook directly into to your database without a backend a standard? I almost exclusively saw it in locked in BaaS platforms over the years (like Firebase) I've barely even seen PostgREST offered managed: is even one managed Postgres provider with the right combination of PostgREST and go-true to let you move over today? Edit: I also don't get why this is such a point of contention... Since when is BaaS not just a trade off between initial velocity and later stage lock-in? The former is not worthless, but like most tools you should understand the tradeoffs involved reply antifa 5 hours agorootparentI'm guessing a \"managed postgREST\" would look like a docker container deployed to AWS App Runner or Google Cloud Run with the standard Postgres RDS hocked up to it. reply kiwicopple 15 hours agorootparentprevlet me have another run at it: > If you use Postgres you're \"locked\" into Postgres: a technology with a laundry list of providers. Supabase is just a Postgres platform, and you can use it like that so that you can migrate away to any one of those laundry list. We _also_ provide some tools which are nicely integrated but importantly: they are optional > doesn't Supabase rely on spinning up additional services to leave, No, not if you don't use those other services. If you _do_ decide to use another service, then yes, you need to spin it up to leave (or migrate to something else). Hence my comment: this is no different than running, say, Rails on a managed service. reply waldrews 14 hours agorootparentSorry, confused by the wording: what does 'spinning up' mean here? reply jddj 13 hours agorootparentConfigure and begin running reply szundi 13 hours agorootparentprevBetter step away from your keyboard then, until you start to use something and getting locked in. Point is that if you need to be free, the barrier is lowER. reply xytofs 18 hours agorootparentprevYou can just take the Auth server, run it yourself with an AWS RDS instance for example, keep up with updates and be good to go. Yes you get a good UI with Supabase, and even much of that can be hosted yourself. reply atonse 18 hours agoparentprevWe're using Supabase for a client project and even three sprints in, we're severely hobbled by having to play with a couple of architectural choices forced on us with Supabase and Supabase Auth. Any of the time savings benefits have been wiped out already just fighting the choices and also the subtle differences between the local dev environment, implementing RLS without good tooling. On an architectural level, it is also terrifying to have your database exposed to the public internet just hidden behind authentication and RLS policies (which are much harder to reason about for most developers, and for which there is very immature tooling, a recipe for disaster). Plus the local dev experience leaves a lot to be desired. We spent days trying to get file uploads working only to find that the issue was with local Supabase, and we had to create a remote Supabase database just to upload files successfully. But then we can't \"reset\" the database to run migrations. The product is definitely much less smooth to develop on and I've had to provide dozens of hours of free client consulting work to untangle my recommendation of Supabase (didn't feel right to charge them to fix a product choice that I recommended to them). Right now I'm in a strong \"never again\" view on this set of technologies. At least not for a long time until the tooling improves. But it seems like there are some happy customers. So would love to hear a counterpoint of how they overcame all the issues we've faced: - how are your security teams ok with exposing your PG server to the internet, relying mainly on RLS? And RLS isn't turned on by default, so full tables are exposed to the public internet by default, behind a rather nice REST API. - Reliance on RLS for a public service seems risky because RLS quickly gets harder to maintain as you have to get more complex policies in place without much tooling to help you. - how about the fact that some of your most important code, the RLS policies code, is hard to unit test with today's tooling? And they recommend pgTAP, which, who knows how big this community is? That combination seems highly risky to me. Our best bet right now has been to just install prisma and implement more traditional filtering on top of RLS, and just not rely at all on client side connections to postgres. So in a nutshell, moving away from Supabase specific architecture to more traditional architecture. The real \"It's just postgres\" reply xytofs 18 hours agorootparent> how are your security teams ok with exposing your PG server to the internet, relying mainly on RLS? And RLS isn't turned on by default, so full tables are exposed to the public internet by default, behind a rather nice REST API. Tooling is improving constantly and security really is at the top of mind for us. We've got some cool announcements this week that will keep reminding you if you're doing something sketchy! reply atonse 16 hours agorootparentGood to hear, thanks. I really am trying to provide constructive criticism (even if my tone is not great because the pain I'm continuing to feel with the platform is still fresh). I do think you guys are in a great position to actually improve all that tooling around RLS. Tools that can analyze your policies, that can visually map the recursive nature of policies that run, etc. reply omnibrain 16 hours agorootparentprevAn access-simulator where you can check if a user (or anon) has some type of access would be helpful. reply kiwicopple 15 hours agorootparentwe actually have this: https://supabase.com/blog/studio-introducing-assistant#user-... and you can expect to see another related launch this week with some more in-depth tooling: https://github.com/supabase/splinter reply listenallyall 17 hours agorootparentprevKinda sounds like \"client side connections to postgres\" was the poor decision at root of your security concerns, not the choice of provider reply atonse 17 hours agorootparentBut that is the path that Supabase strongly recommends if you use their tech stack. I fully agree that some of the issues (like poor RLS tooling) doesn't necessarily fall on Supabase's shoulders. But this is the path that Supabase strongly recommends. So you kind of can't have it both ways and say \"Supabase is just Postgres\" but then say \"this is not our problem, it's postgres\", right? I actually think Supabase is in a GREAT position to actually build some of this missing tooling. They're probably now the single largest beneficiary of more people using RLS. So I do think they will tackle this problem, it is a smart team. I just think that because of these issues, as a cohesive platform, it definitely doesn't feel fully baked (or \"generally available\" status) yet. reply srcreigh 17 hours agorootparentprevClient side connections and RLS are the Supabase blessed path in the getting started docs reply listenallyall 16 hours agorootparentDon't go to production with what's in \"getting started\". reply trolan 19 hours agoparentprevI've used it for a couple uni/personal projects to get some experience, and firebase for the same.

The whole stack is self-hostable and open source. All of the data are contained in Postgres. You're one pg_dump away from being able to switch to a different Postgres host.

We want this to be simple (and you can see that there are non-supabase commentors in this thread who are self-hosting, so it's not just lip service) reply TOMDM 12 hours agorootparentI self host a couple supabase instances. That said it feels like every other week there's an update that breaks the self hosted compose, looking through the GitHub issue tracker shows a few issues where the suggestion is \"oh yeah the latest X image doesn't work, regress the version to get it running\" I really like supabase, but stability on the self hosted images is my biggest gripe with it currently. reply BoorishBears 18 hours agorootparentprevThat does not track with anything I've ever seen out of using Supabase If you target Postgres, just about any Postgres instance works the moment you enter a connection URL. You can hop from one managed Postgres offering to another in 10 minutes and lose no functionality. Everything from auth to programming (and even RLS implemented in the query space) will work instantly: no additional software needed. Are you claiming that's the case with Supabase and its JWT auth/RLS entanglement? reply kiwicopple 19 hours agorootparentprevYou can use supabase simply as a Postgres provider.

Seems a little circular. The plot of Github Stars over Time: Supabase vs. MongoDB seems particularly silly (imo). Not a hater by the way, I think their YouTube channel is actually pretty good, and I think it will become increasingly common for startups/businesses to have something like this for product/brand awareness, getting users up and running, etc. I think if the goal of the post was focusing on platform maturation and growth, it might have been better to focus exclusively on the plots of database/users over time, and simply link out to the various social channels. Overall though still cool to see, and congratulations to the Supabase team! reply noob-4-life 18 hours agoprevAwesome, the Index Advisor sped my slowest query 4x! Is there a way to run that across all queries in pg_stat_statements at once or do I need to click on each one? reply oliverrice 18 hours agoparentIn Studio you'd need to click on a query to get the recommendations but the most important queries to optimize are on several metrics like \"Most time consuming\", \"Most frequent\", \"Slowest execution\" are sorted worst-to-best in tab views. But if you do want to scan all of your queries at once for possible indexes you can do it in SQL with ```sql create extension index_advisor cascade schema extensions; select ia., pss.query from pg_stat_statements pss, lateral( select from extensions.index_advisor(pss.query)) ia order by (total_cost_after::numeric - total_cost_before::numeric) limit 100; ``` reply breakingcups 10 hours agoprevI've been trying out Supabase for an MVP but while the hosted postgres part is quite nice, the C# SDK recommended (but not maintained) by Supabase falls quite short, leaving me to trace down all sorts of obscure issues that turn out to be a 2-year-old bug in the SDK that's still not fixed. It is kind of nice for a community effort but definitely not good enough at all for professional adaptation by .NET developers. On paper, Supabase really has all the ingredients I should need to make my application. In practice, I still end up struggling a lot with the development model. I wish there was an easier, safer way to create RLS rules that doesn't need me knowing (to me) obscure Postgres syntax. This is especially grating since the rest of the tooling seems to try to take me away from SQL a lot by using Postgrest. reply steve-chavez 10 hours agoparent> This is especially grating since the rest of the tooling seems to try to take me away from SQL a lot by using Postgrest.

It looks quite similar to me, has it the same target audience?. Is there any comparision chat? Thanks. reply ihateolives 2 hours agoparentI've tried briefly both, but mostly selfhosted versions. If you're interested only in managed versions then skip this comment. Both have docker based setups and getting them up and running is documented clearly enough. The biggest difference right off the bat (ignoring PosgtreSQL vs MariaDB) is that Supabase selfhosted just gives you default project and that's it. If you want to host several projects you either spin up new instance or make use of table prefixes. With Appwrite you can create new projects that are independent of each other, including auth. You can have organizations -> projects -> databases granularity. For sideprojects that's a huge win for me. Supabase gives you a way to run raw SQL on your tables via web interface which I really like, it gives a better way to gain insights into your data without wrestling with client side queries which may or may not do what you need. Appwrite doesn't have that, you have to make do with their queries. Documentation is fairly fragmented in both, code snippets and examples have not been updated for changes, some new features are only discoverable via search but not via documentation menu e.g. Appwrite's SSR documentation. Most complete documentation in both seems to be for Javascript. I managed to get auth working, but it may require some head scratching, especially if you want to use something different than their default examples. Appwrite gives you shell scripts for backup/restore right there in the documentation, Supabase does not. It's not anything fancy, but it's nice to have. There are no ways to generate backup from Supabase web interface either so you have to write your own scripts. Appwrite gives you basic dashboard of stats for your databases and simple charts for traffic and requests, Supabase selfhosted lacks that. Managed version has reports so they're clearly withholding this in purpose. The thing that made me not want to go with selfhosted Supabase in the end though was constant CPU usage when idling. Some usage is expected, but even on my workstation the load stays around 5-8% and is frequently peaking up to 12% or more. In contrast Appwrite stays between 0.6-3%. On my VPS idle peaks are up to 25% which is wild. The culprit seems to be Supabase analytics and health check which logs agressively and spams console several times per second. IIRC there was open issue about it but the response was \"maybe disable health-checks then\". This coupled with just having one single project makes it not suitable for self hosting for me. Haven't used functions or realtime in neither so can't comment on that. Overall Appwrite's self hosted solution is more polished, but YMMV. reply hackerman14 16 hours agoprevInteresting how they posted a self-host guide just a few hours before announcing this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqiQKRKsfZE Perhaps expecting criticism and preemptively creating a response that shuts people down? Ultimately I just see the same pattern in Supabase as in many of these \"easy scaling\" solutions: lock in. I think the future is something like those platforms are offering but we're definitely not there yet. Also it's not like I'm an old person refusing to accept new tech. I'm young and looking to create things but I recognize that these services are (currently) doing the complete opposite of giving me freedom. reply kiwicopple 16 hours agoparentthe video has been available on our self-hosting docs (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) for months (see comments age). I just noticed that it was \"unlisted\" instead of \"public\" when I was making this GA page so I made it public. There isn't anything sinister here > \"easy scaling\" solutions: lock in This has been hashed through in a few comments on this post: Supabase is Postgres. We offer tools on top which you can _optionally_ use. Some people love those tools (especially Postgres maxis). Some people prefer to just use the database with Django/Phoenix/Rails/etc. You choose your own level of comfort. reply vbezhenar 11 hours agoprevI'm not supabase client, so I guess my wishes do not matter much, but I'm self-hosting it and the experience was not pleasant.

My approach to self-hosting software is carefully learn about every service I'm going to run, disabling everything not needed for my use-case. That was not possible with supabase without significant time investments. So my wish would be for supabase to provide some kind of minimal bare-bones configuration and careful documentation for their monstrous docker-compose configuration with explanations why all parameters were set to non-default values. I don't think that I need all those services if I don't use any of them except database and sometimes admin UI. Also I think that I even had to edit some configs for api keys or something like that. It should not be like that, everything should be passed down via envs. Right now I've set up supabase for our developers but asked them to migrate to plain postgres as soon as possible, so I could move production workloads to our standard setup. My ideal setup would be one postgres instance which I can install myself from plain docker library image; one golang binary which embeds everything supabase offers turned off but with some envs to enable and that's about it. reply kiwicopple 6 hours agoparent> one golang binary which embeds everything supabase offers I understand the sentiment here, but truthfully we chose an architecture that scales, then made it as easy as possible to run. Each service has very different scaling requirements: connection poolers, auto-generated APIs, Auth servers, etc. Putting them in a single binary would trade one problem for another (IMO, bigger) problem > Also I think that I even had to edit some configs for api keys or something like that.

Which is plenty of backend for many of my purposes. Postgres's RBAC is sophisticated enough to use as your entire auth layer if you know what you're doing with it. After that it's a free rest API. I'm not like a supabase diehard or whatever but I have used it to great success in a handful of projects, especially early or proof-of-concept stage ones.

This is, I think, a part of wider issues with their documentation; it seems like whoever's doing documentation at Supabase is intelligent but stretched thin. Particularly for Sveltekit, the documentation and examples are incomplete, there isn't any guide to migration or how to modify your code, and if you Google things or follow any links or examples you quickly end up in a web of deprecated repositories where it's unclear what to do next or replace them with. One example: https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-ui If you produce a product for developers, you really need to have 1) quality, readable documentation with an introduction that noobs and pros alike can follow, 2) multiple complete, cloneable examples on how to integrate and use your product in several different libraries, 3) obvious migration guides and timelines whenever you deprecate something. Supabase lacks all three, which is extremely frustrating and means there's always a giant caveat when I recommend them. They're still the best, it's a very powerful and impressive product, and the possibility of self-hosting is amazing. reply kiwicopple 6 hours agoparent> They're still the best, it's a very powerful and impressive product first, thanks for these kind words - it's encouraging (as a maintainer, not just a team member) when we know we're on the right track sorry about the frustrations, especially around the ssr/auth-helpers.

Its whereabouts were unknown to all but a few mathematicians until it was rediscovered by George Andrews in 1976, in a box of effects of G. N. Watson stored at the Wren Library at Trinity College, Cambridge. The \"notebook\" is not a book, but consists of loose and unordered sheets of paper described as \"more than one hundred pages written on 138 sides in Ramanujan's distinctive handwriting. The sheets contained over six hundred mathematical formulas listed consecutively without proofs.\"[1] George Andrews and Bruce C. Berndt (2005, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2018) have published several books in which they give proofs for Ramanujan's formulas included in the notebook. Berndt says of the notebook's discovery: \"The discovery of this 'Lost Notebook' caused roughly as much stir in the mathematical world as the discovery of Beethoven’s tenth symphony would cause in the musical world.\"[2] History[edit] After Ramanujan died on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, his wife gave his notebooks to the University of Madras. On August 30, 1923, the registrar Francis Drewsbury sent much of this material to G. H. Hardy, Ramanujan's mentor at Trinity College, where he probably received the manuscripts of the lost notebook. ... Almost surely, this manuscript, or at least most of it, was written during the last year of Ramanujan's life, after his return to India from England. ... The manuscript contains no introduction or covering letter. In fact, there are hardly any words in the manuscript. There are a few marks evidently made by a cataloguer, and there are a few remarks in the handwriting of G. H. Hardy. Undoubtedly, the most famous objects examined in the lost notebook are the mock theta functions ...[1] Some time between 1934 and 1947, Hardy probably passed the notebook on to G. N. Watson, who with B. M. Wilson started on the project of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. However, Wilson died in 1935 and Watson seems to have lost interest in the project in the late 1930s.[3] After Watson's death in 1965, J. M. Whittaker examined Watson's papers (which were in disarray, due to be incinerated in a few days) and found Ramanujan's notebook, which he and R. A. Rankin sent to Trinity College Wren library on December 26, 1968. George Andrews (1986, section 1.5), following a suggestion by Lucy Slater, found the lost notebook in the spring of 1976 while on a visit to Trinity College. It was published on December 22, 1987, by Narosa publishing house. Andrews' account of the discovery[edit] George Andrews, an American mathematician, wrote in 2012 an account of the discovery for the 125th celebration of Ramanujan's birth.[4] In his account, Andrews states that he was already an advanced researcher in fields, such as mock theta functions and hypergeometric series, related closely to works of Ramanujan. In 1970, anticipating a sabbatical, he wrote to British mathematician Lucy Slater. Slater \"intriguingly\" stated in her reply that she had inherited a \"great collection\" of papers from mathematicians such as Watson, Bailey, Jackson and Rogers, which were unsorted, including one of the last by Ramanujan. She also mentioned other papers were held by the Trinity College library. Although unable to travel to Europe in 1970, Andrews became able to do so in 1976, when he was due to attend a European conference in Strasbourg, near the Franco-German border. He obtained permission and support from Slater, from the Trinity College library, and from his professor, Ben Noble, to visit Cambridge after the conference, in order to investigate the \"invaluable\" unpublished writings of Watson et al. Noble agreed, adding that if he could attempt to find a lost paper by James Clerk Maxwell at the same time, it would be appreciated. The library's documents included a list of matters held from Watson's estate. The list included the item: \"A 139 page manuscript by S. Ramanujan on q-series\", containing the work from Ramanujan's final year. Although not labelled as such, the identity of the papers was settled because Ramanujan's final letters to Hardy had referred to the discovery of what Ramanujan called mock theta functions, although without great detail, and the manuscript included what appeared to be his full notes on these. Contents[edit] Rankin (1989) described the lost notebook in detail. The majority of the formulas are about q-series and mock theta functions, about a third are about modular equations and singular moduli, and the remaining formulas are mainly about integrals, Dirichlet series, congruences, and asymptotics. The mock theta functions in the notebook have been found to be useful for calculating the entropy of black holes.[5] References[edit] Bibliography[edit] Alladi, Krishnaswami (17 February 2005), \"Ramanujan's lost notebook: a lecture series in Florida\", The Hindu, archived from the original on March 3, 2007 Andrews, George E.

Certain it is that a conviction, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality and intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order. > This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God. In common parlance this may be described as \"pantheistic\" (Spinoza). https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3800/3800-h/3800-h.htm (Ethics was one of the hardest reads I had back in modern philosophy class) And while it is a gross simplification of Ethics, from news://rec.humor.funny ( https://everything2.com/title/Existence+of+the+System+Admini... ) 1. The System Administrator is defined as the most perfect user possible. 2. The property of necessary existence means that anything which possesses it must necessarily exist. 3. If existence is better than non-existence (see the ontological proof), then necessary existence is better still. 4. Any perfect user must possess the property of necessary existence. 5. Therefore the System Administrator must necessarily exist. However: 6. Being perfect, the System Administrator cannot make mistakes, delete the wrong account, trash the root directory, mess up a tape load, etc. 7. Being perfect, the System Administrator can not be capable of goal-directed action, because such action would imply that the network is somehow less than perfect in its current state. 8. Therefore, the System Administrator is really more of a force of nature within the system. 9. Arguably, then the System Administrator *is* the system itself. Counter-argument: 1. None, since the System Administrator has been defined to the point where it is a totally useless concept, there's no point in arguing. At least this resolves one of the major issues: the Spinozist argument proves that *if* the System Administrator does exist, it cannot be intelligent. --- The God of Spinoza and Einstein is the magnificence of the universe as it reveals itself to us.

Firstly, when people use the word \"god\" they honestly ought to define what they refer to by using that word, and what the abilities of that god are supposed to be. If we're in a physical universe with energy, then it's been explained that a creator-like god can be argued to have 'created' the principle of existence, itself, on which all other things then evolved with energy. So then, what is that principle, stated concretely? Modern physics has already found out almost everything about it.

It was more by chance though, while looking up info on known movies. - Popularity of a piece of OSS may be important when choosing to use it for an org. Something alive and widely used has better chances of survival in the future, and/or speed of reaction to security incidents.

How do you keep spam out? You can figure that out next year or the year after. Then figure out why a person might want to visit your site. Curiosity? Interest in a person? To learn if a foss project is any good? To see who has traction to decide what to contribute to? Something else? Bonus points: a podcast with interviews with various community leaders; or try to encourage a volunteer to do such a thing. And try to get on other pro open source podcasts. I bet companies like purism would love any free publicity they can get Then, I’d you catch on, years from now, look out for Microsoft trying to crush you via some competing index tied to GitHub. Try to avoid the temptation to be acquired by Microsoft. Try to set up your company in a way that convinces foss people that this can never happen, Eg, put some fsf people on the board or something?

Design should be based on functionality, not anti-fugliness. In my experience, design considerations should come after building a successful growth \"feedback loop.\" (Or whatever you want to call it.) At that point, you may decide making your website look \"polished\" isn't even necessary. IMDB was certainly quite ugly for a long time.

IMDB is centered on reviews and ratings of a static media asset. Open source projects are often growing/changing. They might have a really intriguing seed of an idea with an interesting roadmap, but the prototype is poorly executed / buggy. Does that deserve a low ranking / poor review? reply lowercased 17 hours agoparentIdeally, the rankings should be associated with a time period. Something ranked high... but all those high rankings are from 2 years ago, and there's been none since... that's a different signal that current high rankings and current code changes. reply Moogs 16 hours agorootparentI think how Steam handles game rankings is a good example of this. They separate out \"All Reviews\" from \"Recent Reviews\". Helps identify current reception of a game which may have had a buggy release. reply warbled_tongue 16 hours agorootparentprevThere's a case to be made for done-but-not-dead projects that are feature complete and still the go to solution. reply pjerem 16 hours agorootparentIdeally those projects would still get reviews so timeframed reviews still makes sense. reply perlgeek 15 hours agorootparentYou probably need to adjust the time scale of what \"recent\" means based on the number of reviews. If a project has a total of 10 reviews, it's probably best to not just take the average of the 2 newest reviews. On the other hand, if a project gets dozens of reviews a month, taking of the last two months or so would totally make sense. reply simonw 17 hours agoprevHow certain are you that projects are actively seeking to attract potential contributors? Managing open source contributors is non-trivial work. It's actually one of the harder forms of engineering management, because you're dealing with volunteers - you can't even really directly tell contributors what to do, you have to deploy a whole bunch of (difficult) soft skills and influence and leadership to point people in the right direction. How confident are you that there's sufficient demand from projects to attract more contributors in this way? reply haswell 16 hours agoparent> The primary goal of this application will be to serve as a directory for discovering open-source projects Maybe an increase in potential contributors is a natural outcome of increased discoverability, but I’m not convinced that a new site that is primarily facilitating project discovery will drastically change contributions. If you’re the type of person to submit code to a project, you’re probably already scouring the web to find the projects that are most relevant to you, and a site like this just makes that process more efficient. Most users of OSS are not contributors, and this project seems to be aimed at one of the barriers to adopting OSS: knowing where to look for options when you realize you need Tool X for Project Y. reply simonw 15 hours agorootparentThat makes sense. As an open source maintainer a directory that helps people discover my projects in order to use them is a whole lot more interesting than one that helps me find contributors. reply kristopolous 16 hours agoparentprevI'd imagine there's almost always a door open for talented and competent people looking to make meaningful contributions and have substantive impact. reply dolmen 13 hours agorootparentThis is a wrong assumption. Opening the code doesn't necessarily mean that external contributions are expected. Reports of issues might be welcome, code contributions less. I've seen too many popular projects polluted by low quality contributions. When they get merged without care, the project's quality degrades. When they accumulate, the load on the maintainers shoulders becomes heavy. reply aendruk 9 hours agorootparentWhile you’re not wrong this is a confusing interpretation of the parent. almost always → necessarily talented, competent, meaningful → low quality reply simonw 16 hours agorootparentprevI love it when people contribute to my projects by opening an issue, discussing their idea, then contributing a clean PR with bundled documentation and tests. Actively soliciting contributions isn't necessarily the way to get that. Look at what happens with Hacktoberfest: there are hundreds of thousands of newer developers out there who want to earn their stripes by contributing to an open source project. The amount of work this creates for the projects themselves is enormous. reply nox101 11 hours agorootparent> then contributing a clean PR with bundled documentation and tests. I've never seen this. No tests, un-clean PR. Describing them how to fix it would take more time than re-doing the PR myself. Of course maybe if I thought they were going to contribute a bunch more PRs it would be worth spending time training them but I've never had that kind of contributor. reply simonw 9 hours agorootparentI had one of these recently! https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/pull/133/files They're /incredibly/ rare though. reply kristopolous 15 hours agorootparentprevSure but the pipeline of increasing responsibility needs to be open to new recruits for the long-term viability of a project.

The effort to build and attract open source projects is a monumental task. Unless you're offering something BIG - there's alot of inertia to overcome.

Not only will you focus your time on the unique stuff, GitHub can help with distribution and discovery. reply aendruk 17 hours agoparentprevYeah I have zero interest in actively soliciting attention to my projects.

Whenever I contribute to open-source, it’s typically because I found the project on my own, and, by extension, I already have an idea of how it should operate, and so I’m able to recognize issues or missing features. If an open-source project I’m using already works great, I make no changes. This is how people’s mindset should operate. Instead, a project like this seems ripe for people to come in and make any sort of change. OSS maintainers already deal with garbage PRs because of self-taught developers hearing that they should “contribute to open source to learn,” and then it’s just a README change or other unnecessary tweaks from absolute beginners. If an OOS maintainer put their repo on your platform, I feel like they would deal with a lot more of that. It also seems ripe for abuse from nefarious OSS maintainers, who will use that to just promote their own projects, rather than actively seeking contributions. If they have a limited scope as to the changes they’ll accept, and are using your platform just as a means to get more eyeballs on their Donation link, that’s bad for everyone. Just some things to keep in mind before you proceed. reply remram 16 hours agoprevhttps://alternativeto.net/ fills that role for me, it has crowd-sourced reviews, searchable facets, and of course recommendations. Not limited to open source products, but maybe that's a good thing so you can find alternatives. reply tutfbhuf 2 hours agoprevI think you can pull much of the data you need for such a project from the GH Archive https://www.gharchive.org/ They basically have captured every event that happened on the platform starting from 2011. IMDb works mainly by user reviews who rate videos from 1 to 10. But personally, I think any system can be gamed, just like GitHub Stars. When I'm interested in the GitHub Top 250 (as equivalent to IMDb Top 250), I just do a GitHub search with a filter for the language I'm interested in, e.g., Python, and then sort by stars. This works good enough for me. reply roshanj 17 hours agoprevThis sounds very similar to Ovio, which matches open-source projects with contributors that have relevant skills.

Github stars are maybe closest these days? - Maybe should be an aggregator-aggregator, using github stars and all the various metrics/lists you can find, making formal affiliations with those sites so there's no ill-will? - Maybe a decentralized governance (or clear neutrality in listing mechanism) to encourage people to participate knowing you're not gonna turn bad? - Maybe section off a bit more wishlisting projects people WANT to exist (and subscribe to updates on as others fulfill)? - Maybe a place to complain and critique existing software (closed or open source) and dream up alternatives (like a reverse engineering or UX critique forum?) - Maybe some affiliates program to get projects to backlink, and/or incentives program to manage a donation pool across projects to pay for advertising and bring more people into the space? - Maybe plan around inter-project architecture (common libraries in demand) and have people be able to push for the most needed ones? - Maybe plan around AIs becoming an increasingly large segment of contributors, certainly on more junior/intermediate things, and make workflows to direct their efforts in a simple-to-contribute way (e.g. hook up your compute to an open-source AI coder hosted in the cloud with a TODO list to churn on already vetted by other people/AIs) All ideas.

I spent countless hours navigating films, directors, actors and the like to discover hidden gems. Open-source may have a similar graph (projects, contributors, sponsors), and could make for a fantastic content/talent discovery mechanism. However, a lot of IMDb's content is user-curated. What is your content acquisition strategy? reply specproc 14 hours agoparentI put this on another comment, but I like it so much I'll do it again here.

That's a big use case for IMDB for me... _\"wow, what an actor/director/writer; I wonder what else they've done I should see\"_ I also like the idea of consolidating all the \"awesome*\" lists, which have been very useful for me for discovering software. But I also like the idea of automated rankings, especially if it can avoid being clogged with clickbait, astroturf, and SEO like some popular software comparison type sites I can think of. So I guess what you're considering might be kind of a list engine. Build a big meta-database, then provide both curated lists (top rankings, contributor lists, etc.), and user-generated lists. I think I'd check out such a site reply INTPenis 16 hours agoprevGiven recent supply chain attacks I think this can be a good idea. But it seems like a lot of work to centralize information in one place. A lot of unpaid work. Because no one is going to pay you for this information.

I could be specifically looking for, or flexible on details like: desktop GUI app (native? not electron? tauri ok?), a webserver with web UI (I might be picky about database, docker, backend language, front-end language), or CLI tool. reply JonChesterfield 10 hours agoprevI think there's something here. Discoverability of open source projects is not great, at least in the domains I spend time in. Github does a moderate job of telling me which projects have a lot of attention which sort of correlates with things of interest, but loads of people/projects use name-elided (and it has ~6.4k stars), and that's awful software I wouldn't wish on anyone. It's not particularly search that I'm interested in, more some semi-objective indication of whether a given project is competently put together or not. Broadly, would adding it as a dependency be a good idea. Does it work for other people, do developers already using it like it, do said developers vaguely correlate with things I care about. E.g. adding sqlite to a project is likely to make it better. C libraries are not all like that. reply chha 13 hours agoprevOne of the first things you need to think about is the inclusion criteria. Wikipedia bases all its content on the following: \"A topic is presumed to be suitable for a stand-alone article or list when it has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject.\" This is flexible enough to allow a lot of stuff, but also causes endless debates, discussions and complaints when content is removed. This is (in my opinion) one of the things that actually give Wikipedia value. If everything is permitted, separating spam from actual content is hopeless. Defining a scope for your application is a must; if you gain even the slightest popularity, every self-serving developer is going to try to piggyback on you. \"See, my project is listed on xyz, therefore it's famous and hence I'm a rockstar.\" -Do you want to include any project hosted anywhere? -Incomplete/unfinished projects? -Forks? -Do you want to limit yourself to particular licenses? -What about ecosystems such as PyPi, Nuget, npm and all the rest? Code is mainly hosted on github, but do you want to maintain any kind of relation between source and package? I think this could be handy, both for finding alternatives if you have an issue with a library or if you're looking for \"something\" that does . reply jayFellows 9 hours agoprevThere's a good read on a similar project called https://openalternative.co here: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-grew-a-side-project-... The HN post for it is https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639386. reply karaterobot 15 hours agoprevWhen I think of IMDB, I think about using it to get granular information about a movie, not to discover new movies. I use it for finding out who were the cast and crew (and what else did they work on), how much was the box office, when was it released. I assume that's not what you mean though. You wouldn't, for example, list the credits for each open source project, i.e. who were the engineers, who were the QA testers? Or maybe you would! But that seems like it'd be a ton of work, and supporting the changing roster over different versions seems like it'd be a scope nightmare. (I have always wanted this website to exist, though. I just think it's impossible without a software industry equivalent of the screen actors guild, or MPAA, or whichever entity it is that mandates rules about who gets credit for a film) Instead, do you mean more like a big searchable list of open source projects? If so, I'd still want to know what kind of information you plan on collecting about each project, to know whether I would use it or not. reply scoofy 11 hours agoprevI am the developer of https://golfcourse.wiki which I see as very conceptually similar to what you're trying to build. It's on App Engine, the front end is HTMX, my backend is Flask, and my DB is mongo. If you're in the SF area, I'd be happy to discuss the project with you, costs involved (pretty low), etc. I honestly had no idea what I was doing when I started it during the pandemic, but I now have about 2k unique users per month, and it seems to be holding itself together pretty well. My best metrics are the google search results which are going in a very positive direction. reply sdesol 13 hours agoprevThis is shameless plug, but I have an analytics tool for GitHub orgs and repos and my goal is to make the data freely available. Here are some examples as to how analytics can be used to help users decide if they should use and/or adopt open source projects. https://devboard.gitsense.com/zed-industries https://devboard.gitsense.com/supabase https://devboard.gitsense.com/ollama My value proposition isn't the data, but the ability to gather, organize and update data at scale, so giving it (data) away free is not an issue for me. reply heyts 11 hours agoprevI had an adjacent idea a few weeks ago, but centered more around the idea that it may be difficult for new open-source contributors to find appropriate issues to work on. Suggesting and allowing to discover interesting issues across multiple repositories would allow the prospective user to get a nice view of what interesting issues are available to make a first / second / third contribution to a project, and possibly to also track contributions / pull requests etc. reply phendrenad2 15 hours agoprevInteresting idea. I want this to exist. It's needed now that many projects have left github. The closest thing I can think of to what you want to make are those \"awesome x\" repos on github which list projects related to x (e.g.: https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm) It needs a memorable name like wesource or youcode. You'll probably want a way for maintainers to claim a project (like google allows businesses to do on maps). Community management in general seems hard. The other hard part will determining relevancy. What do you show on the homepage? Ad-supported or donation-based? Look to large wikis and public resources like everymac.com for inspiration maybe. reply dv35z 10 hours agoprev(1) I love the idea.

I'm digging into React / Python / Django / Postgres & SQLite / Docker / Fly.io / CRUD web stack lately, in case those tools overlap with your tech vision. reply stainlu 15 hours agoprevThis idea is interesting. But I think you are on the wrong mindset: literally merging product and features together won't get the work done. Instead, think about customers.Think about how current use case. - Why are they using open-source projects? - How are they using them? - Why don't they use other products? The core here is that we use open-source projects NOT because they are open-source, but they are available and cater to my need. So this is actually IMDb for all softwares. The second question is, you are making something real big if you want to build another website. Will a browser plugin for github work? If yes, go for it.

List your fav features of IMDB that you want to emulate in your project. Then, scope your project to something you can do in 3 months and do it and show off to users and get feedback. Then, after that figure out what to do next. > What do you think about this idea? There are common fallacies and pitfalls when someone says they want to do \"like X for Y\".

Learn about them and make sure your idea isn't suffering from those same issues. reply tomashertus 16 hours agoprevI use Github's Trends (https://github.com/trending) for discovery, and for all other searches, I use their search and tags. It never failed me to find what I was looking for. The star system already provides you with ratings for open-source projects, and Github's search has powerful filtering. I don't anticipate a general need for such a project. If you are junior developer interested in learning development or a specific technology, it would be great project to build and open source though. reply interactivecode 14 hours agoprevI like the idea, but I think looking at imdb from a movie viewer perspective is not really doing it justice. imdb is first and foremost an industry directory. This creates the value for everyone to fill their profiles and use it as the source of truth. “Finding cool movies to watch” in that sense is secondary. The idea of a imdb for open source is really cool, cracking the code to get industry buy in will in my opinion be the way to ensure a long tail of value for anyone using it. reply muratsu 15 hours agoprevSince it’s not a paid product the best way to test your hypothesis is to ship an MVP and track usage :) You can chat with GPT to help you plan things. It’s really good for this type of stuff. reply instagraham 15 hours agoprevI think semantic search will be important, open source project documentation can be a bit obscure so it can be hard to find what you're looking for with a cursory Google search. I want to build x that does y using z, where you your database has x y and z - but maybe x y and z's own github pages don't explain what their code is capable off as well as you do. I think that would add value to what already exists. reply ivanjermakov 15 hours agoprevStart with a user diagram. What user is suppose to have in mind?

There is potentially a lot of blind spots you have (e.g. What types of mechanisms are you going to have for license filtering?).

I am not a heavy IMDB user but I just go there to get actor names by movie title or lookup rating by movie title. reply bruce511 14 hours agoprevLet me make a semi-cynical reply, and at the same time challenge you to prove me wrong. Let me also say that you learn more from failure than success, so even if this goes as I predict, you'll learn a lot about this kind of idea, and that alone may be worth it. I predict the project will fail. Here's my thinking; Firstly, projects should always start with a revenue model. You didn't mention one so either you chose not to mention it, or you don't have one. This project will cost money every month, in hosting fees if nothing else. If it becomes popular it'll fail because you can't afford it. Secondly it'll fail because the data needs to be curated. If it isn't, and it becomes popular it'll be buried in low-quality submissions. There are thousands and thousands of everything released as open source. 99% of it is rubbish (just like commercial stuff.) Curating costs time or money. Once you get a day job, or another OSS idea, this one will lose your attention, and with it any sense of quality. Lastly there's a network effect problem. To be valuable you need the directory to be populated. To get populated it needs to be valuable. As a bonus, someone else proposes such a directory every other week. Some have been successful for a while. But they don't stick around. Why do you suppose that is? Why doesn't a quality directory already exist? The idea is not novel, sooo ..... ?

With media productions, the ratings are up against a company wall. With open source projects it's against people volunteering their time. Seeing how people behave on ratings sites, it's pretty obvious that this can open up developers to abuse and harassment, if it gains popularity and traction. reply rurban 15 hours agoprevEasy. You just need the scrape the various hubs, like gh, gitlab, sf.net, bitbucket, savannah, codeberg, sourcehut, ... reply asciimov 17 hours agoprevThis is an app store, not IMDB. I don't like the idea of some \"authority\" picking the winners and losers in the open-source space. What makes IMDB work and this not, is that Movies are static things. You aren't going to one day find the 1957 romantic comedy Desk Set[1], suddenly turn into a slasher film. Where as open source software changes, sometimes drastically. [1]- You should watch Desk Set, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

How will it be better than Github stars? Open source developers use Github already. Closed source developers use it too and Github is big enough to moderate the rating system (at least somewhat). How will your search function be better than Google? (and how and who will classify projects?) 2. If it is important to you, build a ShowHN. Don't plan, just build and be ready to pivot. Don't expect people to help you. What most people want is not a list of tools. They want an expert opinion.

The \"awesome-\" Github repos might be a good place to start sourcing information. A few things I think would be nice: * You should be able to easily tell how the project is hosted. I prefer containerized applications, but there's people who don't. Sometimes they make you install their own hosting platform - yuck. * If a paid version is available, how much is it? Are the features provided by that paid version big important ones or it is mostly just for support? * If there are screenshots, an easy screenshot browser would be nice. Many projects either do not provide them, or they're in the Github repo which doesn't have an easy left/right browse functionality. I want to know if the UI sucks before spending the time to deploy. * What's the most comparable commercial project? How does it excel and how does it fall short? Perhaps a (moderated) comments or reviews section would be worth it here. * What about interoperability with other popular tools? It's difficult tell sometimes if a project supports something as simple as LDAP. This would depend somewhat on the product which features are shown. * Ffs please provide a semi meaningful graph of forks. The way Github does it with Insights is nearly useless. I suppose it would benefit to ask people with a reasonable amount of experience for a given field what they want/need too. That's not necessarily something you'd see on the site, but it'd be done in the background. For instance, I want 3MF support for 3D printer slicers, but that's not relevant for a kanban board. As far as interfaces, I enjoy the filtering provided by sites like Texas Instruments or Analog Devices for electronic components. They really managed to figure that out. Good luck with your project!
