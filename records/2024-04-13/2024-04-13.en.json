    "originBody": "Why I Lost Faith in Kagi I've posted many times before about paid search engine Kagi but I really wanted, like I have with other sites in the past, to make a post that just outlines why I don't have any faith in it. Because the majority of my reasons come from being in their Discord, which tons of average users will never really look at, and I suspect a lot of Kagi supporters do not know a lot of this backstory. This isn't a heavily researched deep dive or anything, I feel like I always need these kind of disclaimers when I'm just posting my thoughts about something backed up with my reasons for thinking it...it's just a quick rundown of why I personally went from a Kagi subscriber to a Kagi Naysayer, so that I can have my reasons in one place that I can link others to. And I have seen a lot of people recommend Kagi that I personally know would be a lot less interested in doing so if they knew this information, but they don't because it's not readily apparent just from using the site. For those unfamiliar to start with, Kagi is a paid search engine that purportedly focuses on privacy. It's meant to be a no-nonsense platform focused on being the best search it can be. Frankly, I think at this point it's a very nonsense-focused platform that has an extremely disinterested view of privacy, and I think it's not a particularly sustainable project either. First of all, as a project, Kagi stretches itself way too thin. \"Kagi\" isn't just Kagi Search, it's also a whole slew of AI tools, a Mac-only web browser called Orion, and right now they are planning on launching an email service as well. None of these projects are particularly profitable, so it's not a case of one subsidizing the other, and when they announced Kagi Email even their most dedicated userbase (aka the types who hang around in a discord for a search engine) seemed largely disinterested. For products this niche, I don't think you can afford to be running multiple niche products at once. Your developers are going to be running far too ragged to keep them all going. Last I could find Kagi employs about 16 employees, half full time. Presumably not every single one of those 8 or so full timers are web devs. That's not a lot of people to throw at this many things. Oh and they own a t-shirt factory. You see, when Kagi had a funding round and raised about $670k. This funding came from an investment round including \"42 accredited investors, most of whom are actual Kagi users\". Unfortunately unlike Cohost I can't give any kind of huge financial breakdown here, because Kagi's finances are even less transparent. If there are Kagi financial reports, I haven't seen them, just the occasional Discord comment from Kagi employees. A while back they raised their prices, which lost them a lot of subscribers, because they were losing money per search at the old prices. They were actually still losing money per search on the new prices. They eventually lowered the prices back down a bit (and maybe raised them again? I've completely lost the plot on their pricing at this point) and have claimed that at 25,000 users they would be breaking even. I am unsure what happened in all of this for this math to be true, but my point is that they did in fact reach at least 20,000 users, and to celebrate they set up a business entity in Germany (they are currently US based), in order to start a tiny little t-shirt printing company. And their goal was to print 20,000 t-shirts to give out, FOR FREE, to their first 20,000 users (with users paying only shipping costs). But I cannot stress enough, they did not just spend money on 20,000 tshirts to give out, they set up a whole new business entity in Germany to run their own t-shirt printing operation, with its own building and warehouse and employee(s? I get the sense it's one guy but I don't know). And this cost them 1/3 of their $670k funding round. One, fucking, third. For t-shirts. Did I mention that the t-shirts don't even have the Kagi name on them? Just the Kagi dog mascot, who is at this point the only thing I like about Kagi, to the point where if I wasn't worried people would try to talk to me about Kagi I'd opt for one of the shirts myself. Great artist, whoever did this. Terrible financial choice to start a whole t-shirt business to make 20,000 free t-shirts that do not even get your name out there. T-shirt companies aside, there's one other thing about Kagi's finances that was revealed recently in an update stream they did that caught my attention--Kagi was not paying sales tax for two years and they finally have to pay up. They just...didn't do it. Didn't think it was important? I have no idea why. Their reactions made it sound like they owed previous taxes, not that they just now had to pay them. They genuinely made it sound like they only just now realized they needed to figure out sales tax. It's a baffling thing to me and it meant a change in prices for users that some people were not thrilled with. But let's say that you can live with their financial issues. They'll either survive or they won't and you'll just enjoy the ride. Yet, there's a lot of reasons that I can't just enjoy the ride either. I think the ride is going to get worse and worse in ways the casual users haven't really noticed yet because of how much of it is in beta or just Ideas That Vlad (the founder of Kagi) Had. And most of them are surrounding AI. I have to assume a lot of people don't understand how deep the AI rabbithole for Kagi goes, because I have seen people recommend Kagi to people frustrated with Google's own AI bullshit. If AI is the thing you are trying to get away from, moving to Kagi is a lateral move at best. As it turns out, Kagi was founded originally as an AI company, who later pivoted to search. And going by their comments in their Discord, AI tools seem to be what they spend most of their time on these days. They're launching AI features left and right, and they have fully bought into AI being the future of search. They believe that by embracing AI, that will be the thing that sets their product apart (kinda late now) and get them the kind of userbase that can keep them afloat financially. They have \"FastGPT\", where their focus is having a ChatGPT style service that is focused on being fast, not accurate. And boy, it sure isn't, I messed around with this for a while and it very confidently gave me a lot of extremely inaccurate information about old sitcoms. But of course, it's all stuff where if you didn't already know the answer to the question you asked you wouldn't know it was wrong--like when I asked it about the All in the Family episode Cousin Liz, it kept identifying the woman Edith and Archie are talking to in the episode as Cousin Liz, but Cousin Liz is instead Edith's deceased cousin who they were attending a funeral for. Following a theme I asked it more broadly about homosexuality in All in the Family and it spit out a bunch of text repeatedly saying that Lionel Jefferson was gay. But I guess it did spit all of this wrong information at me faster than some of the alternatives! I wrote more about this experience on fedi, even though the content warning says ChatGPT this was done with Kagi's FastGPT, I was just trying to keep the thread simple at the time. Like most search now Kagi has chosen to include Instant Answers that are AI generated, which means they're often wrong, as well as a \"Universal Summarizer\" tool, that again is more of the same old AI bullshit. There's also a beta tool called Kagi Assitant, which I...don't know what's really different about it than the other AI stuff they're doing, I think it has a chatbot mode? I believe you have to be a subscriber to see this. It's getting increasingly hard to tell some of these services apart. There's also another beta feature called Sidekick that puts Kagi AI stuff as a sidebar on your own website. There was some demo where you could put someone's Twitter handle in and it would give you a summary of who that person was (nightmare shit). But the developers of Kagi fully believe that this is what search engines should be, a bunch of AI tools so that you don't even need to read primary sources anymore. If AI is your problem with Google or Bing, Kagi is in no way a solution for you. Kagi loves AI bullshit and they are going to find more and more ways to use it. If you check out their Discord and listen to founder Vlad talk about AI tools, it's clear that he will not listen to anyone saying they might be bad in any way. To the point where he truly believes that AI should be used to remove bias from news articles, and show you which articles are \"constructive\" or \"good\" to view. This is something he legitimately wants to implement and he seems completely oblivious to the fact that this is not something AI can do, that AI spits out exactly as much bias as it is fed in its model. He's 100% a true believer in AI as unbiased. (Note in the below screenshots: freediver is Vlad's HackerNews account) It's honestly impossible to write this without discussing Vlad a little bit. Vlad is very \"my way or the highway\", but is the type that will try to appear very measured and calm while completely unwilling to budge. And he is very, very much the type that believes \"not everything is political\" and \"we don't get into politics\". I won't get into all of the Brave stuff because many people have written about this already, but the support thread about it should give you some ideas. His personal conception of bias is a guiding factor in a lot of Kagi's decisions but it's frankly ridiculous. For example, he has stated before that he thinks 3 star reviews on products are \"by definition\" unbiased, because they must include good and bad points. Nevermind that a lot of people's reviews of the recent Star Wars films were \"good space war stuff but too many minorities in it\". At one point someone suggested the idea that searching for suicide-related terms should bring up a helpline, and he rejected that idea because it would be \"biased\" (I guess towards not wanting people to kill themselves). But at the same time, Kagi partners with a service called Looria to provide \"unbiased reviews\" on products in Kagi's shopping page. Nevermind that unbiased reviews do not exist (there is just a difference between a sincere review and a paid advertisement), but isn't promoting certain products in search at least as biased as telling people to not commit suicide? You're letting a third party decide what reviews your users should see. And Vlad's attitude is also where Kagi's dedication to privacy falls apart for me. Generally, if someone brings up a security or privacy concern, Vlad's response is either \"trust me bro\" or \"that's not actually important\". He has repeatedly stated that he feels less than 100 people on earth need full anonymity in a search engine (he has never, that I could find, explained where he got this number or idea from). He believes that email addresses don't count as personally identifiable information, because you can simply use a burner account. If you say that you wouldn't want Kagi using information from your theoretical Kagi Email Address in your search results, and would rather have a Proton-style privacy focused email? He says that there's nothing to worry about, Kagi wouldn't do anything bad with your data. If you bring up \"what if Kagi gets sold to someone else?\" He says well, if they sold to someone who did something bad with your data, they'd lose all of their privacy focused customers, so clearly they'd never do that. Basically anything where you say \"I don't want someone to have this data about what I'm doing in a search engine\", his reply is \"well, we wouldn't do anything with this information.\" A lot of questions about what information Kagi collects on people is met with either saying nothing (which isn't true, they connect your account to an email address for payments, since it's a paid service), or saying he isn't sure, or saying it doesn't matter because they won't use it anyway. Asking what data Stripe collects on them through Kagi, and more importantly what data Stripe sends back TO Kagi, also gets you a vague \"I don't know\" answer. He doesn't entertain any discussions about GDPR because he thinks they have nothing that applies anyway. Questions about what would happen if the government tried to force him to collect information about users are just brushed away with \"well we'd simply close the company\", although he also notes that he has no problem with criminals being caught through their searches and doesn't want criminals using the platform. I want to note with the above, I'm not a GDPR expert either, I don't know what counts legally and what doesn't, but I strongly disagree with Vlad's handwaving of the issue and his insistence that email addresses aren't PII because you can use a fake one, because that's true for names and almost any other information as well, that logic doesn't hold up for this, and the logic is what I have the issue with. Between the absolute blase attitude towards privacy, the 100% dedication to AI being the future of search, and the completely misguided use of the company's limited funds, I honestly can't see Kagi as something I could ever recommend to people. Is the search good? I mean...it's not really much better than any other search, it heavily leverages Bing like DDG and the other indie search platforms do, the only real killer feature it has to me is the ability to block domains from your results, which I can currently only do in other search engines via a user script that doesn't help me on mobile. But what good is filtering out all of the AI generated spamblogs on a search platform that wants to spit more AI generated bullshit at me directly? Sure I can turn it off, but who's to say that they won't start using my data to fuel their own LLM? They already have an extremely skewed idea of what counts as PII or not. They could easily see using people's searches as being \"anonymized\" and decide they're fine to use, because their primary business isn't search, it's AI. They just don't want to admit to being an AI company anymore. Frankly, it's not something I want to pay them to keep developing. It's something I want less of out in the world. Do you need to quit using Kagi? That's up to you. I'm not really trying to debate anyone into leaving Kagi. My only interest is to explain why my opinion shifted on it, and to share information that may or may not shift your opinions. If they don't, it's not something I want to debate people into. But I think most of the info here is going to be news to a lot of people, and that's the thing. Most people aren't going to dig into the discord for a project and read what the developers have said about it over time, that's a bonkers thing to do that I did, just do what you will with my findings. Because I know for a fact, from talking to people, that a lot of Kagi users don't know any of this. => Return to Home",

    "commentBody": "I Lost Faith in Kagi (d-shoot.net)612 points by Tomte 22 hours agohidepastfavorite557 comments infecto 22 hours agoI still pay for Kagi for its search but this has kind of been the problem from the beginning with their org. - Search has been a breath of fresh air, I wish they dedicated more time to it. - Orion...is ok? I use it off and on and it is fine but would rather have better search. The premise of the browser is nice but it feels like this could probably be a whole separate company or a purely open source endeavor. It has always been kind of clunky and not something I want to pay for. - AI tools, I get the multiple pivots and I do believe that more recent advancements in ML/AI will make search a better experience but I do wish they had a little more focus. - The t-shirts are weird and made me lose a lot of faith in their org. The way I look at it is instead of making their products better, they flushed a bunch of money down the drain for t-shirts and its offensive to paying customers who are paying because they enjoy the product and want it to become better, they don't want a t-shirt. - I don't care about email, I don't care about other tools, make a great search experience first. Release all of the AI enhancements that you think will make sense, focus, focus, focus. Edit: As I was adding my comment this post flagged and marked dead. Sometimes HN is weird. reply freediver 19 hours agoparent> The t-shirts are weird and made me lose a lot of faith in their org. The way I look at it is instead of making their products better, they flushed a bunch of money down the drain for t-shirts and its offensive to paying customers who are paying because they enjoy the product and want it to become better, they don't want a t-shirt. Kagi founder here and I want to clarify the train of thoughts around Kagi printing and giving away 20,000 t-shirts for its users. - Kagi is not a typical VC funded startup. - It is company I bootstrapped by going all in (meaning I put millions of dollars of my money into it). - After all these years building it, we are lucky to have such incredibly passionate user community. - That community is 100% responsible for Kagi's growth as a business through word of mouth (Kagi does no paid advertising). - We are also famously taking a firm stance against ad-tech, so conventional advertising is not something I want to do. - To do something as crazy as to start a company that builds a paid search engine and browser you obviously need to be thinking out of the box. So combine all of this together and I thought that sending a t-shirt to all the people who supported us along the journey made a lot of sense. The only thing I did not count on is how difficult will be to pull this off as I did not want to settle with less than premium quality for these t-shirts. As a result they will be delayed (my best guess is July/August) and I apologize for that to our users. In hindsight, we probably should have opted out for something easier to pull off (someone mentioned a billboard on 101, that would certainly be much easier). This did not jeopardize Kagi's finances in any way at any point, nor I would do anything like that ever (as I said I am all in and have everything to lose, so I run a fiscally responsible business). In fact, Kagi has turned profitable recently. This has also not impacted our ability to hire (we went from 10 people twelve months ago to 25+ now) and it did not impact our ability to ship a great product (check Kagi and Orion changelogs). I would venture to say that most Kagi users agree that Kagi is getting better and better every week with great speed. So would I do it again? Well let's wait and see what we have in store for hitting 50,000 members mark :) reply recursivegirth 19 hours agorootparentI work in CX, you should listen to your customers. Your gut got you this far, but to be a profitable company you are going to need to consider the advice and concerns of your stakeholders. Based on your current description, you have two stakeholders (yourself + customers). If the venture fails, you will ask yourself if you listened enough. Be proactive, address concerns, do not put yourself in a defensive position. Embrace change, be agile, and most importantly listen to your feedback. Wish Kagi nothing but success, I would very much like a disruptor in this space. Best of luck to you and your team. reply swatcoder 16 hours agorootparentThis is a forum where people respond well to practical explanations from thoughtful founders. I don't know if the OP got what they needed from this reply, but I assume I'm not alone in being impressed by the humility and candor of the response and developed much greater affinity for Kagi from some of the specifics of what were said. I want more companies to have communicative, principled management that invites a sustainable base of like-minded customers/partners and fewer companies that pretend they can please 7B people by radically changing their product every 3 months. reply gspencley 15 hours agorootparentInteresting take. It is valid and don't take my alternative interpretation as suggesting otherwise. I owned a business for 18 years. For 15 of those years it was my primary source of income. I valued feedback, tried my hardest to solicit as much of it as possible, and always took it to heart (though I had to always try and glean statistics from the sum of all feedback so that I was never spending resources on minority opinions). What I read from the user was that the company created an optics problem. It wasn't whether the company was losing money or not, it was just that the user is choosing to support that company because they want a really good search engine, and the optics of divesting the company's resources into multiple projects makes it appear as if it could be the case that not enough focus is being spent on what really matters to that user. What I read from the founder was that the optics issue went completely over his head and a complete dismissal of the user's concerns and feedback, along with a doubling down of the decisions made. It's not a good look in my opinion. Even though the founder was polite and didn't say anything inappropriate, I would NEVER have responded to a customer of mine like that. reply theturtletalks 15 hours agorootparentI get OP's take, but freediver is essentially saying that Orion and their other ventures are a part of the vision. To OP and others, it may seem like a side-mission or a waste of resources, but I trust the guy bootstrapping the company with his own money. Hell, Orion is the first Webkit browser where FireFox and Chrome plug-ins work on iOS. If may seem like a misstep, but I see it as calculated. If Kagi search hopes to ever take on Google and Chrome, they need their own champion. reply _DeadFred_ 14 hours agorootparentIt's a stretch to justify paying for search, but I do it. To find out I actually pay for a bunch of stuff I don't care about when search is still a work in progress, naw bro, I'm good. I don't go to a restaurant that has a partial menu to fund a race team. Cool that was your reason for opening the place, you sunk a ton of money into something you think it super cool, but I'm actually here for the food and ignored you don't have fryers yet when I thought that me eating here was supporting them coming, not something else. You are both right. Freediver laid out the vision, and some users are saying the vision isn't what the paying users are paying for. As someone who ran a business like this, GS is telling Freediver this should probably be something to give extra attention to and consciously decide is it the company the vision or the search product people are paying for? reply prewett 12 hours agorootparentHow is this different from Hershey funding a school for orphans from its profit, or Microsoft funding Internet Explorer with some of the price you paid for Windows (theoretically), or any business that uses income from its stable products to fund new products? The only thing I can think is that you are not actually satisfied with the product (search results for a month) and so in your mind you are funding R&D of the product you would like (better search results for a month). In which case, getting upset is understandable, but assuming my analysis is correct, the mismatch is that you aren't buying for the product they are actually selling. reply rrr_oh_man 2 hours agorootparentI think GP's point was that Kagi's not a stable product, yet. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 10 hours agorootparentprevIf this if your reaction, you may not know how a bunch of companies work. reply monetus 14 hours agorootparentprev> pretend they can please 7B people I think the most positive aspect of freediver's response is the implied dismissal of the above. - that their stubborness is genuine, not a more robotic, seemingly hollow, response of concern. As a marketing approach, I'm wondering if maybe that would give you less reach and more impact in general. reply catapart 15 hours agorootparentprevYou sound like a very good businessman, and a reasonably astute interrogator of user feedback. I wish there were more businesses with people having those traits at the helm! reply sleepybrett 14 hours agorootparentprev.. and then the founder decided to harangue the author in email. Guy can't seem to stop stepping on his own dick. https://hackers.town/@lori/112255132348604770 reply balex 4 hours agorootparentThis was difficult to read. Not a hint of empathy on that thread. reply pcthrowaway 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah.. I can understand where the author's coming from not wanting to be on a call or get emailed by the founder, but this is such an immediate assumption of bad \"fatih\" on their part, and a tactless way of communicating that, that I don't consider it a great look for the author. I'm not even arguing people should assume good faith until proven otherwise (I don't think we should, generally). Just that being so steadfast in one's assumption of bad faith is unwarranted. reply dxdm 3 hours agorootparentprevIMO the author did himself no favors publishing this email thread. reply soraminazuki 12 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is, there are many customers. You should listen, but that doesn’t mean you have to agree with everything or submit to every demand. I for one find Orion useful and it would be a bummer if it was scrapped because of a single comment on HN. Also, “I lost faith in a company because it made T-shirts” sounds a bit hyperbolic to take seriously IMO. reply carlosjobim 15 hours agorootparentprev>I work in CX, you should listen to your customers. The only way a customer speaks is with money. If people like what you sell, you'll have more customers speaking with their wallet. If they don't then they tell you so by not purchasing what you sell. Internet commenters (such as myself) do not represent all customers or even a majority. People who are happy with a product usually see no reason to give feedback – especially when it's a small purchase. Likewise, people who hate your product wouldn't purchase it in the first place. reply jorvi 2 hours agorootparentTerrible take. A complaint is worth twice a compliment because complaints are actionable. And both are worth more than silence. That doesn’t mean a business needs to acquiesce to every little demand. But “just listen to the money” is a horrible path for product improvement. reply pessimizer 13 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds like a great argument for not listening to anyone, or improving your product or messaging at all. Make the obvious observation that the complainers are a minority (ignoring that vocal non-complainers are also a minority), that their public complaints don't represent the opinions of one or two orders of magnitude of people who won't ever complain (just silently drop), are not ever influential, and that the silent majority support every decision you've made. The cool part is that as people start leaving your product, complainers will become an even smaller minority, so you'll never have to second guess yourself. Maybe blame it on bullying? reply carlosjobim 12 hours agorootparentWhat people say they want is usually something completely different to their purchasing behaviour, and as a business you should listen little to what people say they want and listen much to how they spend their money. For just about any business, if they were to ask their customers or the public at large what they want, the answer is usually \"We want free stuff!\". Cool to do if you're a politician, but bad business practice. There's an old expression saying \"the customer is always right\", meaning that you can never blame the customers for how they spend or don't spend their money. If paying customers show a certain preference you better give it to them. People who don't complain but silently drop are speaking with their wallets and that has to be listened to, as I said in my previous post. A business has to listen to customer spending behaviour and not listen too much to complainers. Normal people will give hotels awful reviews if it was raining on their vacation and great reviews if the weather was good and they had fun with their friends. Complaining is a past time to release some stress for many, and a pathological problem for a few. But when it comes to actually spending money is where the truth comes out. Most people will not like your product and not buy your product, that's the large majority. That's why most normal businesses do not have the same reach as for example Apple or Toyota. > The cool part is that as people start leaving your product, complainers will become an even smaller minority, so you'll never have to second guess yourself. You can be sure that nobody second guesses themselves more than business leaders – especially if sales drop or stagnate. That doesn't mean that every complainer is right in their complaints. As for Kagi there seems to be very many commenters online and in their feedback forums who believe that the main selling point of the service is privacy or extensive customisation. But I believe that the main selling point is search results quality and that everything else comes second. At least if they want to widen their customer base beyond computer hackers. If you take a look at the Kagi feedback forums, there's almost every week somebody starting a thread where they demand that Kagi implements a very niche feature and then threatens to unsubscribe if they don't do it. Or demands a niche feature or they won't sign up. You can't listen too much to these people, you have to follow your own vision and if people agree with your decisions you'll see it in sales. If not, then you were wrong in your vision. reply Avshalom 10 hours agorootparent>and as a business you should listen little to what people say they want and listen much to how they spend their money. yeah well if I never pay money for kagi and never speak about anything how the hell is kagi supposed to know what they could do to get me to pay for them? reply carlosjobim 10 hours agorootparentCasting a wide net and see what they catch, like most businesses who are not making bespoke solutions for their clients. Probably there is nothing they could do that would make you specifically pay for them. reply kerkeslager 16 hours agorootparentprev> I work in CX, you should listen to your customers. ...and to be clear, Hacker News is not a representative sample of their customers. reply silviot 15 hours agorootparent> ...and to be clear, Hacker News is not a representative sample of their customers.

Delivering high-quality search over the entire Internet, higher quality than Google, is something so complex that even if you were literally the worlds smartest person and all the other Kagi employees were number 2 to number 26, there would still likely be stumbles at least once a year on something. Because there’s like a million gotchas hidden along the path to just reliably matching Google search quality circa 2010 in the 2024 environment. Let alone delivering a high-quality browser, AI tools, etc., on top. reply swatcoder 15 hours agorootparentServing optimally performing ads to billions of global users is a radically different problem than serving optimal search results and accessory features to a self-selected 50,000 or 500,000 customers. reply MichaelZuo 14 hours agorootparentHence why I specifically said search quality without mentioning a large userbase... Did you not see the last part on your end? Plus, if anything a small userbase makes it more difficult for quality search because the long tail is still effectively infinitely large, relative to the competencies of a single decision maker, but now there is only have one user searching for any random super niche topic maybe once a month, in total. So they can't even a/b test or rely on customers reporting in on the real situation because it is too sparse. reply swatcoder 14 hours agorootparentThe point is that search quality is subjective, not objective, and the two companies are each structured to approach it very differently. In pursuing billions of global users across all demographics and trying to maximally monetize them through ads, Google is pursuing an entirely different measure of \"search quality\" than Kagi. Google delivers their version of search quality when a rice farmer in Thailand and financier in the Bay Area both reach for Google when they want to find something online and then get distracted by an ad. Meanwhile, Kagi gets their version right when they have a profitable base of happy customers. They can make different and more aggressive assumptions about the needs of their users, solicit and digest direct feedback about those assumptions, and optimize a product that delivers superb search quality for their niche. They're completely different technical problems that only occasionally intersect. Their engineering teams aren't competing with each other. reply MichaelZuo 8 hours agorootparentEven if the entire customer base was limited to only HN users with karma exceeding X amount there will still be thousands of searches per day in obscure niches, just each one in a different niche. So I don't see how Kagi can avoid having to deliver quality search results in millions of niches. Just at a very low frequency compared to Google. Or are you suggesting to not bother with search quality past a certain lower threshold? reply kerkeslager 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm not convinced it's actually that complicated. Google search has been bad for a long time. It's clear they serve their customers (advertisers) quite well, but as a user of their search, they're not particularly impressive. The biggest problem is a problem of scale: being the biggest search provider means Google are targeted by SEO, so it's harder for Google to sift out the AI-generated garbage--Kagi just isn't involved in the arms race that Google is. But as a user that's not my problem; I'm not going to tolerate bad search results out of some sense of \"fairness\" to a corporation. And Kagi is delivering real user-centered features which are, frankly, obvious, i.e. Google should be embarrassed that they don't let you filter/prioritize domains or search within lenses like Kagi does. reply MichaelZuo 8 hours agorootparentI could see Kagi being able to sidestep maybe 95% of the 'arms race'. But even the remainder will trip them up every now and then. If these periods last only a few minutes it probably won't matter but if it lasts a few days or more then it's very likely to impact customer retention. reply Aeolun 7 hours agorootparentprev> Because there’s like a million gotchas hidden along the path to just reliably matching Google search quality I don’t know about you, but the reason I’m paying for Kagi is because their search results are reliably better than Google.

Your customers are complaining because they want you to succeed. If they didn't care about you, they'd just cancel the subscription and move on. And your response to it is \"nah, what we did was right\" and not \"yeah, maybe we shouldn't have spent all that resources on a stupid t-shirt that nobody wanted\"? I just don't get it.

I was considering using Kagi, but this is a massive turn off. They'll likely discover that GDPR is not that optional as soon as a customer (or a competitor with a grudge!) reports them to their relevant national privacy/personal data protection authority, after which they'll get to have a very uncomfortable conversation where they will not be able to use those arguments reply Aeolun 7 hours agorootparentIt’s very simple to just not have all that much PII or customer data.

But for a slightly nerdy, not mass-market, product like mine (or Kagi) this niche is a great place to grow.

The number of times I've heard people extol the virtues of targeted ads on this site is absurd. I've even heard folks here say that Google ads are more helpful than the search results as if that's a good thing.

That's the nature of a large distributed community. But I also think the fact that there are people who would say that is a good thing. I despise ads, ad-tracking/privacy invasion, etc with a passion. I won't use anything that has ads. I won't even install most apps, even paid/premium, if they collect personal information. So you know my biases. Their argument is a whole lot more nuanced (and better) than you are presenting it. The main point is that they find (or consider) ads to be useful for helping people find new products they might be interested in. And that does quite obviously happen sometimes (how often is very much up for debate though(. For them, the privacy tradeoff is worth it. I would guess that a portion of people who agree with that would fall into the \"what do I have to hide if I'm not doing anythign wrong\" camp. I think they're nuts, but it is an interesting viewpoint to consider that is a lot more nuanced and contextual then just \"I enjoy targeted ads.\" reply RhysU 18 hours agorootparentprev> Kagi does no paid advertising Because of adverse selection?

Note: I subscribe to Kagi Ultimate, so I use some AI features that are not available in the base plans. reply dustincoates 19 hours agorootparentI love Kagi, I'm an early paying subscriber, but I think the quality of their results is overstated. Anytime you get past result #5 or so, the results just get _weird_.

Over time my manually configured block/lower/raise/pin list has continuously grown, quickly leading to higher and higher quality search results. I also have integrated custom lenses and bangs into my workflow more and more over time. I often end up searching seemingly very generic things and getting exactly what I'm looking for in the first or second result.

They should be plowing that money into more R&D, or, absent the current ability to do that, saving it for a rainy day. As a paying customer, I want Kagi to succeed. I want Kagi's search offering to keep improving. Spending a couple hundred thousand of the company's money on t-shirts (one that I would receive, as I was a fairly early customer) sounds foolish to me, regardless of how much the founder is personally invested in the company, and regardless of whether or not he'll invest more of his own money to keep the company growing in the future, if needed. I'm still bullish on Kagi's future, but things like this (and things mentioned in the linked article as a whole) make me a little worried. > Would you be upset if they had just donated that excess to charity? Probably! When I was at Twilio, we participated in GitHub's charity dodgeball tournament a few times (early last decade, I think). The cost of admission was $3000 per team, and would go to charity. After a couple years doing it, finance started getting uncomfortable with it. We were a private, unprofitable company (now Twilio is, of course, a public, unprofitable company), giving away money that our VCs had invested in us. Initially I rolled my eyes, \"just the bean-counters doing what they do best: whining about every bit of spend\". But later, looking back, I realized they had a point. While $3000 wasn't a lot of money in the grand scheme of the company, what benefit was spending it actually providing the company? Ok, so 12 or so employees got to go and have a fun day at a rec center, boosting morale for them. We got our logo on the website for the tournament, which was maybe a little visibility/marketing. But was that really worth $3000 of our VC money? Maybe it was, but I don't think it's an obvious \"yes\". reply keyle 20 hours agoparentprevOrion is my daily driver and I hope they don't crush that.

Things I love and can't live without: - When I search for something, I don't have to deal with weeks of whatever I searched for coming up in ads on every web page I visit. - I don't feel like \"the man\" is snooping on me in some sort of weird dark social credit score thing. (I literally got a call from Google once offering me a job based on what I'd been searching for. Flattering, but totally freaked me out) - The quality is good for non-local things - I'm the customer, not the product - That makes things like blocking or enhancing sites possible What I'd like to see improve: - I don't want AI. I don't want summaries, I don't want hallucinations, I don't want assistants. I don't want it. - Local results and map integration. When I click on a local result, actually having the map go to the result I clicked on. Currently this doesn't work well. - Hours for local businesses. I find myself still going to google for these things, and while it doesn't seem like a lot, aside from work stuff those kinds of searches are probably 80% of what I need. Where can we go for dinner tonight that's near by and still open? Who has all-you-can-eat deals near by? Where can I find some floating shelves to put in my office near by? Those are all examples of things that Google does really well, and I don't have much luck with on Kagi.

I don't know what I'll do if they go under. 2) Investing in integrating AI into their search is absolutely vital and I like a lot of what they're doing there 3) Everything else, including the insanity of the t-shirts thing, is a complete waste of time and money. I don't understand what their strategy is if it isn't to set money on fire. reply datadrivenangel 21 hours agorootparentInvesting in better search is absolutely vital, and AI may be the right tool there, but I don't care about the AI. I pay Kagi to be a better search and informational retrieval tool, not to do AI. reply Sakos 20 hours agorootparentIt's not like they've gone all-in on AI though. Going through their changelog https://kagi.com/changelog it looks like they regularly make improvements to their core product and there've been a lot of significant QoL improvements in recent months. Just the Wolfram change alone has cut my need for Google significantly. The one thing I really hope they put more work into is searching for local news. That's one of the areas where I still have to turn to Google. reply troyvit 19 hours agorootparentprevI can't speak to the t-shirts. I was on duckduckgo before Kagi and also can't imagine returning there. I don't know what they're doing there but it's not improving. And yeah I am so with you on 2). It seems like (again, t-shirts aside) Kagi is throwing a bunch of stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I hope they're having fun because I sure am. reply jonpurdy 21 hours agorootparentprevI considered investing a small amount in them when they were raising a round from customers since I loved the search product so much. I too can't imagine going back to anything else, especially now that I have prioritized and blocked domains set up perfectly and added lenses, and this stuff works across desktop and mobile! I've been mildly regretting not investing up until 5 minute ago when I read about spending 1/3 of that on the t-shirt factory. reply sithadmin 20 hours agorootparentThe claim that's made in this blog - that Kagi 'owns a t-shirt factory' seems disingenuous, or lazy at best. Kagi's own blog says that instead of going with a major branded merch manufacturer/distributor, they chose to work with a small print shop instead. Nothing about blowing funds on an actual factory/print shop. \"Owning a merch operation end to end\" just means they're not paying some manufacturer to do production, warehousing, order fulfillment/drop shipping, etc. reply baobabKoodaa 20 hours agorootparentI do not understand this distinction. Either they \"own\" the merch operation \"end to end\", or they don't. You can't have it both ways. reply EasyMark 17 hours agorootparentYou can contract facilities or output percentage.

Search engines already rely heavily on heuristics, and I really doubt that LLMs or vector databases are going to improve results in any combination. At best, they will overfit results to the lowest common denominator. What I want is a search engine that supports full-text queries with exact matches. This quite literally no longer exists anywhere, and maybe that's because it just doesn't scale. Nevertheless, I would find a lot more value in a search engine that returns exact matches. Someone will probably reply saying that Kagi, DDG, or The Google do exact matches with quotes, but this is not true. When it works, you've just gotten lucky. At best, it will filter out inexact matches, but that doesn't mean it will actually return every exact match in the index. reply chipsrafferty 8 hours agorootparentAgreed, I want that + the page ranking that Kagi has, and literally don't care about any other features. reply EasyMark 17 hours agorootparentprevI agree pretty much verbatim. I don't see how anyone could criticize them for getting into the AI game as well or at least using a 3rd party AI software for some results. That would just be silly these days. I like Orion browser but to be honest firefox does what I need. reply infecto 21 hours agorootparentprevTotally agree on all points. I don't believe I have the technical capability for it but both the fear of losing great search and the lack of direction has made me think about what it would take to replicate the search experience. reply iamacyborg 21 hours agorootparentprev> Everything else, including the insanity of the t-shirts thing, is a complete waste of time and money.

That's the primary thing I want from them and so far they're delivering it at a cost I consider fair. Their other projects are not interesting or useful to me, but so far I can simply ignore them. Yes, on some level I wish they'd focus and quit wasting money and energy on things I don't care about, but that's really not my affair. The one growing reservation I have is with regard to Vlad's/Kagi's actual, boots-on-the-ground approach to privacy. Kagi necessarily has the ability to know more about me than almost any other company. I want to see them demonstrate strong and unwavering commitment to respecting and protecting my privacy - through policy, technology, and careful and continuous vetting of partners. Expressed disinterest in collecting or capitalizing on my data is not enough, and seeing Vlad's communications in which he casually shrugs or responsibility-shifts to a third-party heightens my concern. For now, I remain a customer - but a wary one. I've stopped actively recommending Kagi personally and professionally because as a privacy advocate, it increasingly feels irresponsible to do so. reply garciansmith 15 hours agoparentI've been curious about Kagi but the idea of running all my searches through one company while logged in worries me. Yes, I realize most people do that with Google and could care less, but I do. For me to try Kagi I'd need a much firmer commitment to user privacy, not the wishy-washy hand-waving portrayed here. reply flakeoil 15 hours agorootparentFor google it probably does not matter if you are logged in or not. They know who you are anyway when you do your searches. reply Zuiii 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is my primary concern with Kagi. The founder posted comments on hn assuring that they take privacy seriously, and I believe him, but most commercial companies (including the big ones like Microsoft) also claimed to take privacy seriously. Look at what they are doing right now: Blatant violations and even more blatant lies. Search is a deeply personal activity. It can reveal far more information about the user than financial statements, health records, privileged attorney information, or library reading lists. Kagi therefore must _at least_ meet the same sanctity, privilege, and protection standards afforded to those parts of life. At present, Kagi does not meet these standards through technical means, and governing laws certainly fall short of compelling Kagi to meet either. So while I appreciate what Kagi is trying to do and wish them success, I cannot see myself using it in its current form. Local (private) LLMs and fact checking through search engines that aren't tied to my PII simply provide a superior experience. At present, it's simply impossible for people like me who want better search and are willing to pay for it to become customers of Kagi. I find that to be a real shame :( reply threatofrain 13 hours agoparentprevYup, I also find it an awkward point that Kagi is a pro-privacy company but they're sitting on top of an information gold mine. Google has to infer who you are whereas Kagi just knows. Your credit card too. And to continue down the road of AI proficiency, Kagi will need to retain a lot of data. reply sph 20 hours agoprevAs a paying user since day 1, I do not give a rat's arse about AI. In fact, I have moved away from Google because they have focused so much on AI their search got worse to the point of being useless. I paid for a good search engine that respects my queries and does not try to outsmart me. The more Kagi focuses on AI, and making an \"\"\"intelligent\"\"\" search engine, basically replicating Google's missteps, is the day I stop giving them money. I've already been noticing some of my keywords are being ignored or reinterpreted. Please stop that. I don't care about email either. I am paying Fastmail for it, and I certainly know better than to attach my search history to my email account, especially when it's from an AI company. Is the goal here to copy Google? To all startup owners: there is more to software quality and user experience than trying to fit the AI buzzword in anything you do. Stop following the hype and focus on building a damn good product. reply mostlysimilar 17 hours agoparent100% agreed. I was disappointed when Kagi launched their AI thing but I had hoped it was just a small side project or something. If it's truly a major focus for them I'll be ditching my subscription. Also not jazzed about their browser and email etc. reply emushack 19 hours agoprevI really don't understand why people are so upset about the T-shirts. Like in the grand scheme of things, who cares? If I invested money (I didn't) in Kagi, I would expect some of that money to be spent on marketing. Marketers often do experiments, some of which go well, and others that don't. Only time tells. This take feels more like being upset about one individual's (Vlad) personal opinions about privacy and politics. But in my opinion, it fails to realize that assigning one person's views to an entire organization is a fallacy. Even if they are the leader. As a service, I like Kagi. Both in principle, and in practice. I find the \"summarize this page\" feature to be very useful. I also like the idea of paying for value, rather than being forced to feed the advertising beast. So I pay for value. If it stops being valuable, I will stop paying. I care about privacy, but I also realize that we live in a world where there are serious limits on the amount of privacy that can be expected. So I have to just do the best I can with what is available. Kagi is at least an improvement on the standard \"eyeballs are the product\" business model. reply andrewmutz 15 hours agoparent> This take feels more like being upset about one individual's (Vlad) personal opinions about privacy and politics.

Arguments against this are just sophist nonsense, and I'm not convinced they are made in good faith. reply __loam 12 hours agorootparentprevAll news is political. reply danpalmer 19 hours agoparentprevSending t-shirts to existing users is unlikely to be an effective marketing strategy to grow/maintain the business. The way they did it was also inefficient and high-risk. It may reduce churn, but with 20k users there's a very low cap on how good a churn reduction can be vs bringing in new users. reply lolinder 18 hours agorootparentAs a counterpoint, nearly all of Kagi's growth so far can be directly attributed to word-of-mouth marketing from those 20k early adopters. I can see a rational case to be made that making those vocal early adopters feel appreciated will pay off in the long run as they continue to advocate for Kagi in places like HN. reply danpalmer 18 hours agorootparentThat's fair, but many of them may also prefer to see the money spent on the service (or other marketing). If I was paying $20 a month for a service on the basis of creating a sustainable paid search business, I think being sent a \"free\" t-shirt would call into question the sustainability and make it harder to justify the cost – can I pay $15 for a service that doesn't send t-shirts? More generally though, word of mouth is a good place to start but it maxes out quickly, especially for niche products. There will need to be some support from other channels. Even just putting the name of the company on the t-shirt would have supported it a bit. reply vel0city 15 hours agorootparentprevI first heard about Stripe in it's early days because a friend of mine wore a stripe shirt to a LAN party.

They need to be really focused on maintaining trust when privacy is their brand. I won't condemn the company based on some out of context quotes from the founder, but those screenshots weren't reassuring either. Not paying taxes and focusing on adding AI to your search doesn't make me more confident that they're protecting my data. It makes me more likely to think \"someday they will need a little cash infusion to keep the lights on; at that point they'll begin to consider collecting my data and selling it\". reply eloisius 18 hours agorootparentI don’t think privacy was ever Kagi’s value prop. That’s Brave. Kagi’s value prop is that it’s search that actually works. reply karaterobot 17 hours agorootparentIt's both. Their marketing copy states it as \"search which is aligned with what's best for you\", which they say includes both personalized search, no advertisements, and being \"100% privacy-respecting\". Privacy is definitely spoken of every time they talk about the product. reply Teever 14 hours agoparentprevSimply put it's bikeshedding. t-shirts are something that people think they can understand, so they speak most at length about it compared to the other things Kagi is doing. reply infecto 12 hours agorootparentI do not believe this is a good example of bikeshedding. They made what I would consider a pretty long post and announcement about shirts but there is a fairly sizeable paying user base that worry its a distraction. I agree that some of the specific nitpicks are probably unfair but we love the products but see tshirts as a repeated problem of maybe doing too much. We are all armchairing the problem though and its up to Vlad to do his own thing. reply lolinder 21 hours agoprevThe T-shirt thing is dumb and a waste of funds, but TFA describing it as \"owning\" a T-shirt factory is an exaggeration that makes me question most of the framing of the rest of the article. They partnered with an existing entity in Serbia, what they did set up was the means to distribute them. Still not a great look and definitely still a waste of funds, but if every criticism takes this same form—take a legitimate criticism and blow it out of proportion with exaggerated language—then it's important to take the article with plenty of salt. My own experience has been that what I get month to month is worth what I pay. If the project is sustainable, then I'll get to enjoy it into the future. If not, I'll get to enjoy it while I can. A search engine isn't like an email provider or even a web browser, there's basically no lock in that makes transitioning later difficult if something changes for the worse. reply mfiro 20 hours agoparent> If not, I'll get to enjoy it while I can. Sure, but what happens with your information after that is also very important. What's for me very concerning after reading the article is not a T-Shirt factory or burning budget, but the their attitude towards privacy. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentFor my part, I trust that they aren't logging my searches and I don't put any sensitive information into the fields that are persistent. If someone eventually buys Kagi then they'll be able to learn that I block Pinterest and boost MDN, which is way less information than Google collects and stores about me, and it's information I'm happy to divulge to get the service I want. reply kelnos 14 hours agorootparent> I trust that they aren't logging my searches I did trust that, before reading this article.

The email Lori sends explicitly asking him to stop emailing is then followed up with some last-wordism \"for the record\" nonsense. Only on the extremely online internet do people consider someone the aggrieved party after they write a screed against a product or business, then close the conversation with representatives of that business with essentially a don't @ me and some last-wordism.

The exchanges all read like Vlad derives a lot of self-esteem from being right, which isn't as good as deriving it from ability to learn when wrong. reply alemanek 19 hours agorootparentWouldn’t the same apply to Lori in that exchange. They just put the company on blast and aren’t willing to even hear the other side of things. That email exchange made me lose a ton of respect for them. But, Vlad definitely should have stopped when Lori responded that they didn’t want to have a conversation at all.

(I mean, jesus, \"email address isn't PII because you can use a burner\"? What, no, that's not how it works). Instead of actually educating himself, he just argues that he's not wrong. I could easily see Lori being sick of the frustration of having to deal with that and just say \"ok, nope, this conversation is done\". > They just put the company on blast and aren’t willing to even hear the other side of things. I don't think that's what actually happened? reply ImPostingOnHN 18 hours agorootparentprevThe one who \"needs to hear the other side of things\" is rarely the customer, and this is a good case study in why: no matter how much this customer \"hears\", they are right and Vlad is wrong with regards to the GDPR. By insisting that the customer needed to \"hear the other (wrong) side of things\" he looked worse than if he had just listened to the customer. The customer isn't always right, but often is, like in this case. If you're a CEO, best to just pipe down, be humble, and listen to customers. Being open to being wrong is a nice plus, but either way, people will like you more if you appear to listen instead of argue. Even when you're right! tl;dr: this isn't an internet argument between two otherwise-equal random strangers, this is a CEO talking down to a customer while being objectively wrong, which is 2x bad. reply pxtail 4 hours agorootparentprev> Being aggressively wrong is no way to go through life.

For example I was part of the Orion beta and I left feedback in the discord that it took ~30 seconds on the then top of the line iPhone (13 Pro Max?) to load the interface which made it hard to use and I thought it was unreasonably slow and he said something like \"that's not slow it's totally reasonable\" and since then I decided it wasn't worth leaving any more feedback and have since left the community. reply catapart 20 hours agoparentFWIW, my assumption here is that people who publish like this page are expecting users to use a \"reader view\" and they're trying not to introduce any styles at all, so as not to conflict with the styles that the reader view will apply. Otherwise, ' \"reasonable default\" for lots of text ' is something that browsers provide, using the \"system\" fonts. Applying a font-family to the entire html or body tags will do the job, because system fonts don't need to download or load into the browser. And since you can even specify the specific system font you want to use, you have a few options like serif or sans-serif. All of that aside, if I applied a system font and your screen reader applies a different one, what was the point of the extra css? So that's my guess as to why people do this because, like you, I find it very hard to read. If you're curious, though, Firefox has a built-in reader mode and I think Safari does, too. Last I checked, Chrome's was behind a flag. And then, of course, there are extensions (but extensions to read plain HTML docs seems exactly backwards, so...) reply archon810 3 hours agorootparentFWIW Chrome on Android didn't offer me any reader view on this page, and I couldn't find a way to trigger it manually. reply shadowgovt 16 hours agorootparentprevBut the default is objectively awful, at least in Chrome.

The authors replies seem pretty rude (or at least somewhat aggressive / dismissive). Kagi is Vlads baby and I could imagine he would care and try to explain when he thinks someone has the wrong idea. However to the author - it’s just another service he doesn’t use anymore. reply nebulous1 21 hours agorootparentYou can make that argument for initial approach, but it falls flat on its face after the author told Vlad that they didn't want to communicate with them and Vlad responded with a lecture. Vlad comes off as fairly unhinged here. reply fireflash38 20 hours agorootparentOne thing I absolutely love about online discourse: shit all over someone, then block them. It is something that you don't see with in-person communications - because you really can't just \"close off\" the discussion to one way. Anyway, I just think that people do things in online discussions that they wouldn't do to someone's face. And that tends to be a bad thing for reasonable discourse. reply PaulDavisThe1st 14 hours agorootparentYou missed out a step.

In the thread linked above, I think his reasoning for posting the email is reasonable. I find this similar to what the Apollo dev did when discussing with Reddit people. If he didn't record the conversation or make it public, his words could have been twisted. reply t8sr 20 hours agorootparentprevThe author's response is perfectly calibrated to drive someone up the wall. Sling some mud and then hide behind \"help, I'm being cornered.\" Imagine doing this in the offline world. How well would this kind of behavior go over with people at the grocery store, do you think? Why is it acceptable online to behave like this? reply thorum 16 hours agorootparentAs alternative perspective in terms of power dynamics: The Kagi CEO is a somewhat powerful figure as the CEO of a well-known tech company. The blog author is a random person from outside the tech startup culture. The internet levels the playing field so the random person has the power to post criticism of the more powerful person and be heard. It doesn’t make sense to compare with the offline world because this wouldn’t be able to happen outside the internet. In response the CEO is attempting to force them into a different context where he once again has power. The author recognizes this and therefore refuses. reply t8sr 16 hours agorootparentBut you’re not talking about Tim Cook, this is a guy running a company of ~10 people. Someone on the internet, with a following and an audience, has written an essay about how Vlad is a bad person, and now is implying the latter is abusive for trying to have a conversation. This is psychotic behavior. There’s a huge spectrum between NY Times writing a sourced article about a powerful business magnate and someone disparaging an SMB owner on their blog. If I took the posts and emails of someone I knew in my life and posted them online, I would probably get a call from the police. reply dotnet00 15 hours agorootparentprevThis feels very similar to the trope on X, where someone makes an inflammatory or stupid comment, people angrily respond calling them stupid, and the original person then claims they're being harassed/were just joking, and ultimately neither side actually communicates. The people who like the original poster continue on believing that they were being harassed, and people who thought they were being stupid continue on believing they're being stupid. I feel that Vlad is justified, even if I personally would've just considered it to be a lost cause and just kept receipts in case it became necessary to publicly respond, similar to how the Apollo dev released receipts when Reddit tried to make him out to be in the wrong. reply fckgw 15 hours agorootparentVlad is justified to reach out and try to start a conversation but when the author says no, you drop it. That didn't happen here and it's a bad look. reply Semaphor 21 hours agorootparentprevSo does the author. But then I also don’t care about the author and don’t pay them for my search engine :/ reply magistr4te 21 hours agorootparentprevTldr: you can't just spread a very negative opinion about someones hard work and then plug your ears shut for any kind of non-symathetic interaction. In my eyes this rationale would make sense if there was no backstory to this. If there was no preceeding blogpost, I'd consider Vlads messages pure spam. But the context here is different: The author wrote a very critical, and clearly opinionated blogpost. There was clear intention in engaging with this subject. Now the author seems to want to avoid responsibility, while Vlads attempt to react to a public hit piece with a respectful conversation was honestly the best way to handle this. reply mbStavola 20 hours agorootparentYou are right... up until maybe the second reply. Vlad saw something critical of his hard work and wanted to put in the effort to clarify his stances and mend a relationship. I can absolutely understand that, your work is a reflection of yourself and nobody wants to be judged on misunderstanding. He might've even felt like he let someone who cared about Kagi down and wanted to make it right. Again, all understandable! However, twice, the blog post author said they did not want to engage. At this point, regardless of how you feel about what was said, you should probably move on; they said their piece, you tried to engage, they rebuffed, oh well, do something else! To continue on is both incredibly annoying and a bit unhinged. If Vlad absolutely felt like he needed to respond to this, he should've digested the main points of the original blogpost, reflected on them, and written his own blog post to a more general audience. Not necessarily in _response_ to the author, but understanding that more people probably feel this way as well and want to hear clear answers. Perfect examples of this would be an \"Our stance on privacy\" or \"How we're ensuring Kagi's future,\" again factoring in the criticism from the author. I write all of this as someone who pays for and likes Kagi. I think it's a good product, if a bit scattered at times. But the blog post does hit on some concerns that I have (privacy being the biggest) and seeing the follow up leaves a bad taste in my mouth. reply rsynnott 21 hours agorootparentprevYou can criticise something without obligating yourself to have a conversation with the subject. In fact, that is generally how most critical writing has worked, for centuries. If you're unhappy with the review of your restaurant in the paper, you _might_ be able to convince them to publish a short owner response, once, but they're certainly not going to engage in a dialogue about it. reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agorootparent> You can criticise something without obligating yourself to have a conversation with the subject. That's the fundamental premise of telling people that they are sealioning. Not everyone agrees with it (I suspect age plays more a role than anything else). Your historical example doesn't really map very well to today, because control over the ability to put some text somewhere that others can read it is very, very different than it was historically. None of this excuses the Kagi CEO's failure to back off when asked/told to. They should just have used their own blog or equivalent to respond. Still, generalizing to a broad claim about raising an issue in public creating no future obligations seems somewhat wrong to me. You don't have to speak in public about anything at all. For me, your choice to do so creates some limited obligations towards future engagement (though I'm not sure quite where the limits lie). reply catapart 20 hours agorootparentprev>There was clear intention in engaging with this subject. Yes, and then that engagement - which very much took place - did not give the author any confidence that FURTHER ENGAGEMENT (via email) would change the situation. If I talk to you back and forth about an issue I have and feel like I'm talking to a brick wall, so I then write a critical review based on those issues, why should I be forced to not be a brick wall, in return? If Vlad wants someone to listen to him, he should probably take some time to engage with (not just 'listen to') what is being said on it's fundamental merits (not whatever surface level bit he wants to latch on to). Recontextualizing an issue is not addressing it. Explaining an issue is not addressing it. Describing a paradigm that contextualizes an issue is not addressing it. reply mekoka 20 hours agorootparentprevThere's probably some backstory between Vlad and Lori there. But beyond that, there's some irony in that exchange. If Vlad had simply stopped engaging when Lori asked, it would indeed make Lori seem like more of an asshole for rejecting an appeal to have a simple conversation. But then Vlad transgressed that wish, making Lori's case about not wanting to engage. reply ACow_Adonis 20 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps we live in different worlds, but there's a world of distanced between unhinged and roughly 3 emails to someone who wrote a peice targeted specifically at your business.

I'm all for generally leaving people alone, and being civil, but context please.

I feel that Vlad fell for the bait more than anything. reply indil 8 hours agorootparentprevUm, no. In general, if you tell someone to stop messaging you, they get to send one more message to react to that and tie up the conversation. \"OK. You still haven't addressed points A, B, and C, so I still disagree. Let's wrap it up here then.\" That's perfectly reasonable and polite. reply danpalmer 21 hours agorootparentprevThis post suggests the author has tried this already, has had these discussions and has reached the natural end of that process. I've also had a similar discussion with Vlad on comments here, he definitely doesn't try to view things from other people's perspectives. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 21 hours agorootparentprevI don't care if it's someone's baby. I'm the paying customer paying in both money and sensitive information I expected to be well protected. reply ImPostingOnHN 20 hours agorootparentprevVlad's message to \"discuss\" reads more like a sealion-ey 'let me explain to you why you are wrong, you just don't understand why you are wrong, I am very smart and not wrong' than an honest admission that Vlad was wrong and is interested in being humble and learning from someone else. reply WA 21 hours agorootparentprevVlad is not discussing, he is lecturing. The author of the blog post seems right. Vlad defends his position \"lol email is not PII\" repeatedly, despite being obviously and completely wrong. He has no understanding that it doesn't matter that a user could enter fake information. His business collects email addresses, which is a process. Under GDPR, this process must be documented, users must be given their data on request (even if it just contains an email address, but usually it also contains the signup date for example as a proof for their data processing consent) and users must be informed about their rights to correct or delete such data. He comes off totally as the \"trust me bro\" guy with zero respect for a different perspective and doesn't seem to be interested in changing his (objectively wrong) opinion. It is almost laughable, because \"is email PII\" has been discussed a million times since the introduction of the GDPR that you must've lived under a rock to dismiss it like Vlad did. reply eviks 21 hours agorootparenthe explicitly said in his email that \"Personal emails are PII.\", so how is that a defence of his previous position? reply nicce 8 hours agorootparentIt does not matter in this context, because it is still incorrect. > Personal emails are PII. But you can register to Kagi with a random email, and that is not PII. Company has no means to identify what is the difference between personal or random email. Everything can be and must be treated equally from privacy perspective. reply WA 21 hours agorootparentprevI re-read again. You are right, he says \"personal emails are PII\" in this email. In the original post however he dismisses the whole GDPR data request process as \"we don't need this, because you can provide fake data\". Point is: if the business requests an email address, many people will provide their real email adress and your business needs to document this process under GDPR. I just checked. The signup form doesn't say \"please give a FAKE email address\", it just says \"email address\". If a user provides a real email address, Kagi must respond to GDPR Art. 15 requests by providing...that same email adress. Might sound silly, but usually, there is other data associated with this. Usually, at least the timestamp of the signup. If a business is really GDPR compliant, it will offer a download option for stuff like user settings and so on. Or, if the user signed up and later deleted the account, his email should explicitly NOT show up when asking for personal data. See, it is about documenting the process, whether the outcome is \"here is your email address you just asked for\" or \"we don't have any data on you\". And Vlad says that this process is ir",

No not really the concept, but there are far too fucking models. I started collecting screws to put together for my \"workshop\" were I repair whatever family, friends, enemies want me to look at. I am not great at it, not even good, but I am who they bring things to, and over time I have learned a bit of skills. (Also I fail, sometimes I break stuff and sometimes I hide in my bag and take to a pro without telling anyone.) Back to screws. I often need one. but there are entirely too many different sizes and shapes. I have spent decent time sourcing various standardized sizes from far and near. Stil I have project where I need two screws and I dont have the right one. I also keep any screw that I come across. If something is broken I harvest the once that are easikly available. That ends up in a cubbord with lots of different tiny shelves. BUT looking through them so see if one of them is right is again time consuming. What does this have to do with anything? Well the design went from 1 type of screws to multiple sizes. (All of well knownm standarized types thank you) I think it wise to design projects around as few different ones as possible. The previous model managed with one. Clearly somehow V2 could have as well. Is there I pray an app I have not seen, where I can take a photo of a screw and the app will tell me the exact specifications of it, its name, and where to order them? reply ibash 9 hours agoparentThere’s an ancient craftsman trick.

Huge selection including obscure styles and finishes. Nuts, bolts, screws, hardware, etc. One of the best things about them is that they sell small lots including single screws if that is all you need. Another great thing is that they ship quickly and if your order is relatively small it arrives in your mailbox instead of needing to be delivered by UPS or another shipper. They ship orders in packages appropriate to the order, unlike Amazon. They also add products to their inventory if customers need something they don't normally carry. Prices are also reasonable. I found them years ago and now they are one of my main suppliers. McMaster Carr is another. [0] https://belmetric.com/ reply winrid 9 hours agoparentprevScrews have different thread and pitch sizes. An app won't read that correctly. You can get a tool to measure the size/thread/pitch.

That's a burn (probably correct, though). reply serf 15 hours agoprevI think that the inside should match the motif that the outsides set. what I mean by that : the outside sets a tone of professional heavy-duty post-apocalyptic computing, yet the insides are filled with fragile wire connects, fragile routes, multiple boards and new (read: unproven) non-redundant technologies. I would expect something that exudes that aesthetic to be wired like a NASA project [0], use radiation hardened components, redundancy, SOMETHING that speaks to the durability. [0]: https://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sectio... reply haswell 14 hours agoparentThe reason NASA invests so much in hardened components and redundancy is that their hardware has to continue functioning in an environment where humans cannot intervene. The availability of commodity hardware is one of the reasons projects like the Recovery Kit can exist. Redundancy and durability can be measured in multiple ways, and I suspect it's cheaper to keep on hand a stack of backup components that can easily be swapped out than to invest the time, energy and money on a more bespoke hardened solution that can't easily be replicated and would put this project out of reach for many people trying to replicate it. The goal of \"Ruggedized Raspberry Pi\" seems to have been met quite well, IMO. reply tomatohs 11 hours agorootparentI made a mini Arduino-powered smart home that was used for demos at tradeshows [1]. It had to be shipped first to San Fran, then it went to Vegas for CES and a few more places. I had the same thought at first, \"I should really solder these wires.\" But then I realized that wires coming loose was inevitable given the hell this project was going to endure being handled by airlines, rolled across different terrain, and poked and proded by trade show attendees. So I opted to use color coded jumper cables and include extra. In the manual, I included a simple wiring diagram to show how to hook everything up. No solder needed. In the hands of a consumer, yes, everything should be soldered because there's a higher force needed to break the connection, but repair is also harder. Consumers typically do not repair, so the trade off leans toward solder. I suspect this is the perspective that inspires this comment. In the hands of a hacker looking for durability, it's actually better for things to be replaceable. Because the hacker can repair, the advantage gained by soldering isn't worth the the friction added repair. 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWcm1S_wAz0 reply HeyLaughingBoy 8 hours agorootparentJust a friendly note: soldering wires causes them to become brittle and more likely to break at the end of the solder joint. If you're going to solder wire, and the item is subject to movement or vibration, be sure that the section protruding from the joint is held rigid with zip ties, tape or even hot glue. reply andrewaylett 14 hours agoparentprevMaybe, but on the other hand this is what the author made and they seem quite happy with it. You're more than welcome to make something else if you don't like what they've done! reply ctxc 14 hours agorootparentThey start with \"I think...\" and it isn't very negative, just an opinion. Why the defensive tone? :) reply jraph 11 hours agorootparentYep, I interpreted their message as friendly feedback, not a request or negative criticism. The author is free to take this feedback and act upon it the way they see fit (which can be doing nothing). It's somewhat how a Show HN post works, you should expect such feedback and might even be coming for it. Especially when it's not your first one, you know a bit better what to expect. reply outworlder 13 hours agoparentprevWhile that would be neat, the drawback is a much higher barrier of entry for anyone building this (and a higher price). reply rcarmo 14 hours agoprevI like it, but the trouble with ortho keyboards is that they are quite expensive and hard to come by. I've resigned myself to \"mainstream\" QMK keyboards like the K7 Max (https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/04/06/1830), but keep wondering if there's something more compact. reply rig666 16 hours agoprevI like the cyber deck in theory but a project I've always wanted to take on that I felt would yield more value is to restore and upgrade an old ruggedized laptop. I planned a project to restore an old getec v110 gen3 from eBay. They are often sold there with no hard drive or extra batteries but best part is most of the hardware is backwards compatible. Seemed like a ~$500 project. I then found a new gen6 model on eBay for $1400 so I just got that instead. (Some pawn shop massively undervalued it) reply matthew-wegner 16 hours agoprev> The big downer is that we can't charge and use this battery at the same time- so that \"hotwiring\" of a USB-C port really helps here. This is the battery bank I carry on trips. It can power downstream devices while it's charging, but only at >50% battery capacity. reply criddell 14 hours agoparentA 25,600 mAh is a pretty big battery. It’s more than 5 iPhone Max batteries.

I've bought a few old Chromebooks off of eBay recently (for around $20 USD each), and re-flashed the BIOS so that I could install Debian on them. The student-oriented Chromebooks are reasonably sturdy, and at that price point, I just don't care if something bad happens to it. reply sneak 16 hours agoparentprevYeah. This would be great if it could emulate usb storage, do transparent bridging via switch vlans, support serial consoles, etc, but it is just a case, battery, disk, and bad keyboard. reply fragmede 16 hours agorootparentraspberry pi's support USB gadget mode, and can thus emulate USB storage with the right connector. TTL-level serial port pins exist as well. reply pests 12 hours agorootparentThis is how the PiKVM works. It pretends to be a hub with an attached mouse/keyboard (and optionally a flash drive/storage) Then optionally you can connect your motherboards power/reset pins so you can reboot or turn off remotely. Video is a third party HDMI capture card that plugs into the Pis camera port. reply andrewaylett 14 hours agorootparentprevThere's nothing particularly stopping you implementing at least most of that in software if you want. Stick a suitably-programmable switch in and you could do the rest too. reply sneak 13 hours agorootparentExactly my point - this project seems of limited usefulness because it could have done a lot more but didn’t add much utility that a pi+screen+keyboard doesn’t already have. reply Uptrenda 4 hours agoprevCongrats, you've reinvented the laptop. reply KennyBlanken 13 hours agoprevI love how he has a link to \"what is it for?\" but never answers the question. As far as I can tell this is the technoblogger equivalent of end-of-society prepping? In the event of something so catastrophic happening that the internet stops functioning for an extended period of time, you're not going to be hauling this enormous brick around with you. It's absurd. In an end-of-society situation you're likely on foot, maybe on bicycle (until the bike breaks down in a way you can't fix, or gets flats and you can't find tubes), and your available weight and space is going to be prioritized towards basics like food, shelter, clothing, basic health/tool items, and self defense. How you get 90% of the way there: a USB solar panel, a bluetooth keyboard, and a smartphone with an external storage memory device. Maybe a USB to ethernet adapter and a USB hub. Many modern phones are even water/dust proof to a pretty reasonable degree, more so if you put them in a ruggedized case. I dare him to carry that thing 10 miles... reply brk 7 hours agoparentAgreed, I think the doomsday prepper angle makes it seem absurd. But take a step back and this is an INCREDIBLE display of technical capabilities of a single person. It crosses a handful of domains in terms of designing, building, assembling, configuring a Thing. Plus the background detail on component selection. And the writing is tight too. I build things that roughly resemble this (low volume, custom, solving use cases that are too niche for an industrial offering to be created), for money. I'd hire this guy in a minute to outsource things to or collaborate with, so I see the project as a kind of personal resume. IMO he should find a specific scenario where something along these lines would be valuable. One I am personally involved in is marine electronics diagnosis. Primarily NMEA2000 networks and the devices on them, and the same devices on Ethernet. It's too much detail to go into, plus I'm on a flight after spending a week in Vegas for a trade show, but with just a little bit of reconfiguration work this could be a Thing that higher end marine electronics techs would really dig. Then I think you could also delve deeper into the considerations put into the design and component selection details. reply pugworthy 12 hours agoparentprevI get the feeling it's for fun. It's a maker's project, not a preppers project. reply ansible 12 hours agoparentprev> ... bluetooth keyboard, and a smartphone with an external storage memory device. ...

It's absurd. Yeah, I've always thought these kinds of things were more of a LARP gizmo than any kind of actual \"prepping.\" The priorities are all wrong. IMHO, if society collapses, the things you need will drastically change from your needs now. You don't need an offline Wikipedia or Youtube, even if you use them all the time today, you need something a lot more compact and practical.

I would say though I think you should up your price to at least $9.99. A $3 game makes me think it's low quality, which it's not. So you ought to price your game appropriately. reply AnonHP 5 hours agoparentStrongly disagree. A price of $9.99 may seem “quality “ to you, but may be out of reach for many people (including, but not limited to, those who are not in developed countries). I’d rather have a lower priced item that allows people to pay a lot more at the time of purchase or perhaps a reminder (not annoying, and only once) to donate/pay more on reaching a certain level. A price of $3 may be an impulse buy for some people, while a price of $9.99 may be a pause to evaluate that against other purchases. Customers with higher disposable incomes can be targeted with additional content (DLC) or digital merchandise. reply sspiff 4 hours agorootparentSteam allows for adjusted pricing based on country. It is common for games to cost more in US/EU versus other regions. Additionally, and perhaps perversely, much of a games sale volume tends to be generated during seasonal promotions (Steam Summer/Winter Sale, etc). Pricing a game at $3 doesn't give you anywhere to go in terms of a discount. reply dotinvoke 4 hours agorootparentprev>I’d rather have a lower priced item That’s what every customer wants. But game companies that sell at $3.99 don’t tend to release many high-quality sequels. reply tysam_and 11 hours agoparentprevOr even $7.99, that or $8.99 is sort of a nice line between signaling \"very cheap game\" and \"potentially short but enjoyable experience for the evening worth the gamble to find out if so\". I can't speak to it in general, that's just my 2c on the matter/issue without really knowing too terribly much about the game (or game development in generally, really, I'm just a consumer here! XD). <3 :')))) reply t-3 3 hours agoparentprevGames under $5 are easy impulse buys and never regretted or refunded unless they don't actually run on my system. $10 would make me question \"do I really want to buy this game?\", which more often than not is a \"no\" or \"not now\", and so it just becomes another slot on the wishlist to be scrolled past and added when it's on sale. reply szundi 2 hours agorootparentAt the same time 2.5 times less buyer is the revenues reply thih9 2 hours agorootparentprevAt the same time if you want to validate a new idea, you want to know how many people say yes to “do i really want it” and not how many people impulse buy. reply janosdebugs 4 hours agoparentprevWe were debating this exact thing back and forth and decided for the current price based on expected playtime. By now, I have 10+ hours in the game, but you can beat the game to level 80 in roughly 4 hours, which equates to 1$/hour or the regional equivalent in price. We made the style and source code DLCs for people who were willing to pay more or support us, but wanted kids with low allowances to be able to buy the game as well. reply nfriedly 8 hours agoparentprevI don't know... at $10, I almost certainly would have just passed. At $3 I decided to buy it, and then when I saw the source for a couple of bucks more I bought that too. reply fendy3002 6 hours agorootparentThat's why you price it at $7 and down to $3 during sale reply riidom 10 hours agoparentprevWasn't Vampire Survivors originally 2.99? I just checked, it's 4.99 now but I think it was cheaper in the beginnings. The point is, 2.99 is a \"no think\" price tag, while 9.99 is a \"wishlist and consider when discounted\" price tag.

If you agree, buy it and leave a review. reply janosdebugs 4 hours agorootparentYou just made our day, we were laughing do hard. :D reply LZ_Khan 10 hours agoparentprevPricing is a funny thing. You'd think lower prices would lead to more demand. reply xanderlewis 9 hours agorootparentIt is indeed. It turns out that the classical ‘supply and demand’ relationship only makes sense in fairly restricted settings. When it comes to consumer products like entertainment, it’s far more about psychology than rational value estimation and calculation. If your product isn’t selling, (paradoxical though it may sound) raising the price can be a much better idea than lowering it and potentially both tarnishing your brand and making less profit at the same time. And this is without even considering the notion of Veblen goods, which is an even more extreme example. reply bschmidt1 6 hours agorootparentA lot of people who have never sold a digital product say stuff like this, but there's definitely a very obvious and gigantic market for low prices. As somebody who has released several games and apps where some did well and others were crickets it seems like a combination of randomness/timing, visibility (related to the previous), and simply - is it good or not? If your game is amazing people will jump through hoops to try to play it. You can sell a great game for $40 or $60, and a very great game for $60 then $15/month to keep playing. But you can't raise the price on a low-quality product and expect a great sales response. A lot of investor types say this out of hopes, or because they want that racehorse to run faster, but IME it's: Is it good? Charge market. Otherwise, free or freemium, you might even have to give away the code to get developer interest to help. reply pkulak 7 hours agorootparentprevI think if raising the price of your game increases demand, that’s a textbook Veblen good. reply VS1999 10 hours agorootparentprevIt is strange. Games have well defined pricing tiers that players and developers have worked out over time. $3 is generally considered somewhere between \"trash you buy as a joke\" and \"a very short game without much in it\". Does anyone know if there's any other markets that work like this? I can't think of any. Games going on sale at launch also makes me assume its just because no one is buying it, but apparently more people buy games at launch if it says they're on sale. I don't get it. reply janosdebugs 20 minutes agorootparentLaunch sales seem to be pretty standard on Steam, you can only set it up before the release and you can't change it afterwards AFAIK. reply jamilton 5 hours agorootparentprevWhen I was looking for a mattress recently, I wanted something affordable, but I shied away from really cheap options, because I was afraid they'd be very low quality. Similar reasoning could apply to many things. reply selfie 9 hours agorootparentprevErr... most things. Furniture for example. reply loteck 6 hours agoparentprevDo commenters like this ever stop to consider people who cannot afford to pay higher prices, before encouraging creators to arbitrarily raise prices higher than the creators have already calculated? Do these commenters ever stop to analyze their world view that leads them to believe the litmus test for quality products is whether the product is priced like an Apple product? reply tjungblut 36 minutes agoprevTwo gaming Hatters from Austria? Of course it had to be Sanja and János. I will check your game later on deck, but congratulations on launching :) reply janosdebugs 34 minutes agoparentLOL small world. reply speps 11 hours agoprevCongratulations, it must have been a difficult decision! Shipping a game is an amazing achievement and I like the creative way of releasing the source code! Make sure you've properly licensed the code, people have no conscience sometimes and will release your game again without crediting you... reply janosdebugs 4 hours agoparentThank you! Apart from the Godot engine and the Rubik font (which are correctly attributed with detailed licenses in the game in the \"Credits\" section), we made everything in the game ourselves (code, graphics, sounds, music). The source code includes 3 MIT-licensed libraries we made, too. These are available in the source code DLC. As far as people re-releasing our game is concerned, the source code DLC is licensed under the Steam Subscriber Agreement with a few added grants for mods and making videos, so legally nobody is allowed to re-release our game as a whole or even reuse the non-MIT parts without asking first. If anyone wants to re-use parts of the game in their own game, they are encouraged to contact us. (We definitely won't make a fuss about minor parts of the code when asked, but re-releasing the entire game is out of the question.) reply _flux 1 hour agoprevWouldn't it make sense to release it on Android as well, given it should probably be quite easy with Godot, or is that market just too saturated and attract cloners? Though you'd need to think about how to do the controls on touch screen. reply janosdebugs 23 minutes agoparentWe tried, the source code DLC has a full touch interface, but we ran into a Godot issue when doing the testing in the Google Play Console where we'd have to switch back to the GL renderer which, unfortunately, makes the game unplayable. It works on our devices, but we don't want to ship something that is likely to break on a number of devices. reply mysterydip 11 hours agoprevAs someone transitioning from traditional programming to Godot and running into a myriad of \"I know what I need to do, just not how to do it\", I appreciate adding the source as an option. reply teaearlgraycold 11 hours agoparentThat’s something GPT4 is usually good at helping with reply lkschubert8 11 hours agorootparentIt’s a little rough around the edges for godot 4. It’s still only trained on godot 3 docs and examples as far as I can tell. reply wg0 3 hours agoprevThis could be a unique company idea and business practice that sells source code as DLC under a restrictive license. Imagine Rockstar selling GTA-5 source code as DLC priced at 99.99. reply janosdebugs 3 hours agoparentIf it was buildable from source, I would buy a source code DLC for a great many games. However, I imagine that would not be possible for a lot of games because their engine is proprietary and their legal department would have something to say about that, too. reply SingAlong 4 hours agoprevCongrats on releasing the game ~! A year is a very short time to release what looks like a polished game from the screenshots. Just got the game to read the source code. Looks like Steam requires that I install the game in order to view the source, and that isn't possible because I am on a Mac. Hopefully some day :) reply janosdebugs 3 hours agoparentOh wow, that's not good. We'll get in touch with Steam support and see if we can do anything about that. Would you mind dropping us an e-mail to make@something.pink so we can contact you when we sort this out? reply janosdebugs 39 minutes agorootparent@SingAlong thanks for the email, we responded, please check your mail. reply digging 11 hours agoprevHow did y'all find working in Godot? Any DX or workflow recommendations? I've bounced off it a couple times after getting impatient with slowness and other minor frictions, but I really want to like it. reply janosdebugs 4 hours agoparentCan't speak to Godot 3, but v4 has some infuriating bugs, unfinished features and idiosincracies. The interaction between scenes and code caused us to lose data more times than we can count and the dev team seems to be completely overwhelmed with the number of issues. That being said, it is an engine that works and is used by enough people that you'll find bugs reported on the things that bother you, so you'll at least know if something is broken. We found that doing as much as possible in GDScript and as little as possible in the editor is the way to go. The only time we had performance problems was when adding nodes (for some reason adding nodes is insanely slow). The multithreading is also still in need of work, but thread groups will, hopefully, solve the problem in the future. We are currently looking into Bevy and Fyrox for BlockBawks since it needs a custom simulation engine, but we are still unsure. (It currently has a semi-working version in Godot, but spawning several 100k nodes is creating problems and will need optimizations.) reply nkrisc 39 minutes agorootparentFor 100k of anything in Godot you will likely want to skip the node abstraction layer altogether and just use the various servers (PhysicsServer, RenderingServer, etc.) directly. reply xyst 4 hours agoparentprevswitched to bevy reply Hexigonz 11 hours agoprevMy story is similar to yours except I'm a little younger. My game comes out this summer. I'll definitely grab your demo, and I just want to say you should be really proud of this accomplishment. reply janosdebugs 4 hours agoparentGood luck! We learned a lot simply from the process of releasing the game. Wish we had done it earlier since now we feel ready for slightly larger projects and know we can push it over the finish line. reply rdl 10 hours agoprevJust ordered, although the low price buckets it into \"probably not worth it\". I'd price it ~$10 and do a discount instead. reply janosdebugs 3 hours agoparentThanks for the feedback, we were debating this a lot. reply asp_hornet 3 hours agoprevI love everything about this. The shareware, the price, the source code. It reminds me of how software was in the 90s. reply rileytg 11 hours agoprevOut of curiosity, why not release for mac if its made with godot? reply janosdebugs 4 hours agoparentWe don't have a Mac and couldn't justify the cost of getting one for now. It's not just Godot, we also have to compile the C++ gdextension and we also want to only release on platforms we have actually tested the game on. (That's why there is DualSense support, but not DualShock. In theory it should work, but we couldn't verify it.) With the source code DLC it should be possible to compile everything for a Mac regardless, even if it's a bit of work. If we make enough money from the game, we might reinvest it into a Mac. :) reply 1123581321 11 hours agoprevJust bought it. Looks like a nice little game. Wishing you many more successful releases. I am curious what roadblocks you ran into if you'd like to share more about your Godot experience. reply janosdebugs 3 hours agoparentGodot was fine, for the most part, it's a good engine for small games. The main issue was around working together and resolving conflicts with git (Godot isn't really working and constantly kept changing IDs in resource files), and it kept losing data in scenes when the code changed so we had to rebuild things several times. On previous test games we also ran into huge performance issues in the editor when we wanted to do too much work in scenes, so we had to switch to doing most of the work in code. The worst part was when I had to rip out a bunch of testing code that used @tool for release as it seemed to cause issues when doing a release build. The engine is generally not great when you want to follow clean software engineering (e.g. dependency injection is not possible, I opened a proposal to that end here[1]).

Spreadsheets are amazing generic calculating frameworks and you can do a ton in them, so a lot of banks ended up building a huge ediface of excel spreadsheets that ran a wide variety of risk, pricing and operational functions. With a few plugins and extensions you can really do amazing things with this type of setup. The problem is that your spreadsheets basically become an unmaintainable and impenetrable nightmare and all your business logic is held hostage in various people's personal sheets. Making wide changes becomes hard/impossible and doing something that in a traditional software framework would be easy (\"Let's change the frobnicator to twizzle first and then twozzle afterwards, instead of the other way round as it does it now\") become very difficult requiring many many changes in many many sheets with a lot of risk, and a lot of dilligence to be sure you have actually made a particular critical fix everywhere. reply smodo 1 hour agoparentTotally agree. I’m working for a company right now that put off ‘refactoring’ their tangle of spreadsheets and database query export ‘pipelines’ for over a decade. We are hemorrhaging money right now because it does not scale. And you won’t notice that until it all breaks down. Now you have effectively created bottlenecks for all critical processes because simultaneously working on spreadsheets is about the most dangerous thing you can do. Data integration becomes a perilous and time consuming affair; there’s no easy way to guarantee conformity between spreadsheets. You paper over these problems with more code than you ever would have had if you switched to the proper tools earlier. reply DeathArrow 58 minutes agoparentprevBut it would be ok maybe to use sheets just for storage. I wonder what size limitation do they have. reply Maxion 3 hours agoparentprevSadly many companies WANT to be in the excel trap... reply vhiremath4 14 hours agoprevFunny story. Before pivoting my startup to Loom, we were a user testing company named Opentest. Instead of spinning up a DB and creating a dashboard for my co-founders to look at who requested certain user tests, I just dumped everything into a Google Sheet. It was so good. No downtime. Open access. Only 3 people looking/editing, so no conflict. Didn't have to deal with database upgrades or maintenance. I often think about this decision and feel like I've learned a bunch of \"good engineering practices\" that pale in comparison to how being truly scrappy can be a genius unlock at any level. reply jakjak123 14 minutes agoparentIf you can do this one-way data dump, it sounds like a good idea. The issue starts when you have seven different sheets that is supposed to authoritatively control some other processes. The people writing in the spreadsheet can basically do any kind of mutation to the spreadsheet, so it will break extremely easily. reply ydant 13 hours agoparentprevAgreed. Google Sheets is a great scrappy option for a startup / small company. I've used it for a lot of system data that needs to be modified by a few people at most. With a little bit of careful code and caching (I like validating and syncing to S3) you can easily use it as a crud frontend for important system data. It also can make great adhoc dashboards - plug into APIs (even private ones if you add in custom Google Scripts code) or push data updates to the sheets. I've had rather large reports auto updated on a schedule with multiple views of the data (pivot tables, queries, lookups, etc). Fully focused customized views into the data needed to solve specific internal problems with really quick delivery times. Sure, a custom developed option should be substantially better than Google Sheets, but you won't develop it quicker. By the time you actually need something bigger/better, you should be at a place where your needs are better defined and you can afford the resources to develop something better. reply xcrunner529 5 hours agorootparentYeah my client uses Google forms for some simple use cases and it goes straight to google sheets and I just pull from that for verifying submissions and such in code.

Edit: I've thought about creating a company around Sheets before, and the problem is that once you get to the \"willing to pay\" stage, you also kind of outgrow Sheets.

Also be sure to use one single spreadsheet with many tabs, and coreference cells by their sheet/line/column. That’s such a superb mental model of what your data represents. Of course denormalize your data without caring. Tabular model is not good at managing cardinalities, but [truth to be told] neither is our brain. Also use AppScript for formulas and business logic. Your future dev will love reverse engineer it. Then when things become hairy, hire an IT consultant and pay him well. Be sure to complain that his added value is limited wrt this Gsheet chef d’œuvre. reply sfink 12 hours agoprevMy next user script project idea would require something like this. It's for my own use, but I have to fill out grade sheets using an incredibly painful web UI. The data would be far more easily entered into a spreadsheet. (That's exactly what they used to use, but in order to make things \"easier\" the school implemented a horrific parody of an ultra basic CRUD web app...) So I want to make a user script that reads from a spreadsheet to populate the painful-to-use web form. I haven't started yet because (1) I still haven't finished writing up my last user script experience blog post, and (2) I'm terrified of the auth nightmare. It might be easier or harder in the user script context—I am in the context of a web page, so maybe that means I can do a normal oauth flow from there or something? reply amf12 11 hours agoparentHave you checked out Apps Script? reply aardvarkr 10 hours agoparentprevIf you’re using Google sheets then yeah you’ll have to do a normal oauth flow. Alternatively you could use excel and write a simple macro to automate the flow. The easiest thing IMO would be to skip the complicated part of the script (auth) and just copy and paste the values from the clipboard and process the data accordingly. reply uptown 13 hours agoprevI used to use a Google Sheet to drive a restaurant website's menu page.

Google Sheets was our source of truth, with a nightly sync into MariaDB. We even wrote some callable scripts that could detect ambiguities and other common issues. Saved us a ton of tooling effort, and stakeholders found it cool that we could update content so quickly. - Working on a new product, my boss found a Figma plugin that lets you wire up prototypes to a Google sheet. It’s report-heavy and we’re still building the real app, so to dogfood it internally I’m running a wizard-of-oz collecting data with a different tool we already built and dumping results into sheets and then sorting/filtering/calculating for all the needed views.

Easy, no-nonsense dashboard. Add in some dropdown menus and inputs and you got yourself a good enuff frontend reply _adamb 8 hours agoparentMe too! I've normalized it in our organizations. We use a combination of app scripts and what we call \"Single Button Apps\" that are web pages that have a text box (paste the URL of the Gsheet) and a \"go\" button. The input and output are all in the sheet, but putting the button in a web app makes it easy to iterate on feature set as/if the application grows. https://blog.adambuilds.com/sba-not-spa-the-most-minimal-ui reply ipince 7 hours agorootparentI read your comment and your blog post and I still don't understand what happens when I put a link to a sheet in the text box and click Go.. what happens? You say your inputs and outputs are all in the sheet.. ok.. what does the button do? Are you just calling some API and giving it the sheet as the input, and then writing the output of the call back to the sheet? So then these Single Button Apps are just API endpoints that you're calling with sheets instead of json or, say Postman (if you want a nicer UI)? I think I'm failing to see the point here :-/ reply afro88 3 hours agorootparentSame here. If the idea was to make it so non-technical people can use the google sheets + API app, just put a script in the sheet that calls the API? It will appear in a menu inside google sheets itself reply guhcampos 14 hours agoprevThere are loads of good use cases for this. At one point in my career I had to somehow re-tag thousands of resources in multiple clouds, some were terraformed, many were manually created over the years. The solution? Export them all to a Google Sheet with one tag per column. Edit and apply-on-save. Filter, sort, summarize, pivot all the much you want. It's incredible. reply jevogel 6 hours agoprevHow does this differ from AppSheet? https://about.appsheet.com/how-to-create-an-app/ reply kellpossible2 10 hours agoprevI did something very similar with https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-report/ we started with Google Sheets because it allowed us to quickly iterate with data entry workflow. When paired with a server this also allowed us to generate custom charts/diagrams via the IMAGE function with a crafted URL query. Reads are cached in a local sqlite database. We're in the process of migrating away from Google Sheets now as it's a little painful to set up and it's impossible to completely prevent users from editing the wrong fields in our use case. But it has served very well so far and would highly recommend this approach to start with for anyone! reply davebroio 2 hours agoprevWebsite design is very nice fair play. Is there a cost to using the product? I dont see that mentioned on the site and theres no pricing page listed. That would naturally cause me to freeze a little, rather than authenticating with my google account reply hannofcart 7 hours agoprevNice product. Couple of suggestions/questions from using Google sheets to put enter some data that changed manually via back office admin which we then showed in a website that was accessed by thousands. 1. Will I hit rate limits if I access this API often via say GET requests from a public facing site? (What we did was used Redis as an intermediate cache) 2. Let's say the data on the sheet is changed, is there a webhook to notify the change? (What we did incorrectly initially was to rely on polling for change detection. Which was a bad idea especially as we grew increasingly reliant on this. Instead, the better way to do this is to put an 'Update' button in the sheet which then triggers an API call to an intermediate server to bust the cache I mentioned in the previous point. This also initiated a new fetch of the sheet data. A more user-friendly/better UX way to do this would be to use the Appscript Sheet APIs sheet change event handlers which can be leveraged for this if you don't want to enforce an update button on users though I haven't used this myself. [1]) In your case, I guess the way to do 2 would be to ask users to clone a sheet that has this Appscript code embedded in it when they create a new sheet that must be served with your API. No sure if the UX of that is acceptable though. Wish your product success.

We would get an occasional error (maybe a 429) even though we were polling the sheet once a minute (we had a few other sheets that polled once every few minutes). This manifested as an issue when doing a deploy but being unable to get critical data.

I'm convinced most of the people in this thread haven't tried working much with Google Sheets API at scale. Most of the time it's fine, then it will have days where 30-40% of the calls (as measured by Google Cloud console API monitoring) will throw an internal error which Google advises the option for is to \"try again later\". Also API calls that take up to 4 minutes (?!) to return (again as measured by their own API monitoring tools in Cloud console). It's too bad because I otherwise really like this approach. reply elondaits 10 hours agoparentprevYes. I used Google sheets as a database to build a website and ran into this issue. The worse part is, if you come across the limit there’s not much you can do but wait or rate limit. Another problem I had is an API change one year in. I would not use Google Sheets again. Maybe I’d try Airtable, Notion, or some other similar platform where the API access is more of a priority to the company. reply yawnxyz 5 hours agorootparentFor reading sheets, it's better to use the \"share as CSV\" option since that gets cached pretty well w/o limits reply gofreddygo 5 hours agorootparentprevI've resisted this temptation to integrate with google apis for these 2 specific reasons rate limits and api changes. reply joaovcoliveira 14 hours agoparentprevFor now I`m setting no restrictions.

    "originBody": "Incidents XZ backdoor story – Initial analysis Incidents 12 Apr 2024 12 minute read Table of Contents The timeline of events Backdoored source distributions Initial infection analysis Stage 1 – The modified build-to-host script Stage 2 – The injected shell script Stage 3 – Backdoor extraction Binary backdoor analysis A stealth loading scenario Backdoor code analysis Core behavior Execution environment check The trie structure Symbol resolver The Symbind hook Conclusion Indicators of compromise Yara rules Known backdoored libraries Authors GReAT On March 29, 2024, a single message on the Openwall OSS-security mailing list marked an important discovery for the information security, open source and Linux communities: the discovery of a malicious backdoor in XZ. XZ is a compression utility integrated into many popular distributions of Linux. The particular danger of the backdoored library lies in its use by the OpenSSH server process sshd. On several systemd-based distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian and RedHat/Fedora Linux, OpenSSH is patched to use systemd features, and as a result has a dependency on this library (note that Arch Linux and Gentoo are unaffected). The ultimate goal of the attackers was most likely to introduce a remote code execution capability to sshd that no one else could use. Unlike other supply chain attacks we have seen in Node.js, PyPI, FDroid, and the Linux Kernel that mostly consisted of atomic malicious patches, fake packages and typosquatted package names, this incident was a multi-stage operation that almost succeeded in compromising SSH servers on a global scale. The backdoor in the liblzma library was introduced at two levels. The source code of the build infrastructure that generated the final packages was slightly modified (by introducing an additional file build-to-host.m4) to extract the next stage script that was hidden in a test case file (bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz). These scripts in turn extracted a malicious binary component from another test case file (good-large_compressed.lzma) that was linked with the legitimate library during the compilation process to be shipped to Linux repositories. Major vendors in turn shipped the malicious component in beta and experimental builds. The compromise of XZ Utils is assigned CVE-2024–3094 with the maximum severity score of 10. The timeline of events 2024.01.19 XZ website moved to GitHub pages by a new maintainer (jiaT75) 2024.02.15 “build-to-host.m4” is added to .gitignore 2024.02.23 two “test files” that contained the stages of the malicious script are introduced 2024.02.24 XZ 5.6.0 is released 2024.02.26 commit in CMakeLists.txt that sabotages the Landlock security feature 2024.03.04 the backdoor leads to issues with Valgrind 2024.03.09 two “test files” are updated, CRC functions are modified, Valgrind issue is “fixed” 2024.03.09 XZ 5.6.1 is released 2024.03.28 bug is discovered, Debian and RedHat notified 2024.03.28 Debian rolls back XZ 5.6.1 to 5.4.5-0.2 version 2024.03.29 an email is published on the OSS-security mailing list 2024.03.29 RedHat confirms backdoored XZ was shipped in Fedora Rawhide and Fedora Linux 40 beta 2024.03.30 Debian shuts down builds and starts process to rebuild it 2024.04.02 XZ main developer recognizes the backdoor incident Backdoored source distributions xz-5.6.0 MD5 c518d573a716b2b2bc2413e6c9b5dbde SHA1 e7bbec6f99b6b06c46420d4b6e5b6daa86948d3b SHA256 0f5c81f14171b74fcc9777d302304d964e63ffc2d7b634ef023a7249d9b5d875 xz-5.6.1 MD5 5aeddab53ee2cbd694f901a080f84bf1 SHA1 675fd58f48dba5eceaf8bfc259d0ea1aab7ad0a7 SHA256 2398f4a8e53345325f44bdd9f0cc7401bd9025d736c6d43b372f4dea77bf75b8 Initial infection analysis The XZ git repository contains a set of test files that are used when testing the compressor/decompressor code to verify that it’s working properly. The account named Jia Tan or “jiaT75“, committed two test files that initially appeared harmless, but served as the bootstrap to implant backdoor. The associated files were: bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz (86fc2c94f8fa3938e3261d0b9eb4836be289f8ae) good-large_compressed.lzma (50941ad9fd99db6fca5debc3c89b3e899a9527d7) These files were intended to contain shell scripts and the backdoor binary object itself. However, they were hidden within the malformed data, and the attacker knew how to properly extract them when needed. Stage 1 – The modified build-to-host script When the XZ release is ready, the official Github repository distributes the project’s source files. Initially, these releases on the repository, aside from containing the malicious test files, were harmless because they don’t get the chance to execute. However, the attacker appears to have only added the malicious code that bootstrap the infection when the releases were sourced from https://xz[.]tukaani.org, which was under the control of Jia Tan. This URL is used by most distributions, and, when downloaded, it comes with a file named build-to-host.m4 that contains malicious code. build-to-host.m4 (c86c8f8a69c07fbec8dd650c6604bf0c9876261f) is executed during the build process and executes a line of code that fixes and decompresses the first file added to the tests folder: Deobfuscated line of code in build-to-host.m4 This line of code replaces the “broken” data from bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz using the tr command, and pipes the output to the xz -d command, which decompresses the data. The decompressed data contains a shell script that will be executed later using /bin/bash, triggered by this .m4 file. Stage 2 – The injected shell script The malicious script injected by the malicious .m4 file verifies that it’s running on a Linux machine and also that it’s running inside the intended build process. Injected script contents To execute the next stage, it uses good-large_compressed.lzma, which is indeed compressed correctly with XZ, but contains junk data inside the decompressed data. The junk data removal procedure is as follows: the eval function executes the head pipeline, with each head command either ignoring the next 1024 bytes or extracting the next 2048 or 724 bytes. In total, these commands extracted 33,492 bytes (2048*16 + 724 bytes). The tail command then retains the final 31,265 bytes of the file and ignores the rest. Then, the tr command applies a basic substitution to the output to deobfuscate it. The second XZ command decompresses the transformed bytes as a raw lzma stream, after which the result is piped into shell. Stage 3 – Backdoor extraction The last stage shell script performs many checks to ensure that it is running in the expected environment, such as whether the project is configured to use IFUNC (which will be discussed in the next sections). Many of the other checks performed by this stage include determining whether GCC is used for compilation or if the project contains specific files that will be used by the script later on. In this stage, it extracts the backdoor binary code itself, an object file that is currently hidden in the same good-large_compressed.lzma file, but at a different offset. The following code handles this: Partial command used by the last script stage The extraction process operates through a sequence of commands, with the result of each command serving as the input for the next one. The formatted one-liner code is shown below: Formatted backdoor extraction one-liner Initially, the file good-large_compressed.lzma is extracted using the XZ tool itself. The subsequent steps involve calling a chain of head calls with the “eval $i” function (same as the stage 3 extraction). Then a custom RC4-like algorithm is used to decrypt the binary data, which contains another compressed file. This compressed file is also extracted using the XZ utility. The script then removes some bytes from the beginning of the decompressed data using predefined values and saves the result to disk as liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o, which is the backdoor file used in the linking process. Finally, the script modifies the function is_arch_extension_supported from the crc_x86_clmul.h file in liblzma, to replace the call to the __get_cpuid function with _get_cpuid, removing one underscore character. This modification allows it to be linked into the library (we’ll discuss this in more detail in the next section). The whole build infection chain can be summarized in the following scheme: Binary backdoor analysis A stealth loading scenario In the original XZ code, there are two special functions used to calculate the CRC of the given data: lzma_crc32 and lzma_crc64. Both of these functions are stored in the ELF symbol table with type IFUNC, a feature provided by the GNU C Library (GLIBC). IFUNC allows developers to dynamically select the correct function to use. This selection takes place when the dynamic linker loads the shared library. The reason XZ uses this is that it allows for determining whether an optimized version of the lzma_crcX function should be used or not. The optimized version requires special features from modern processors (CLMUL, SSSE3, SSE4.1). These special features need to be verified by issuing the cpuid instruction, which is called using the __get_cpuid wrapper/intrinsic provided by GLIBC, and it’s at this point the backdoor takes advantage to load itself. The backdoor is stored as an object file, and its primary goal is to be linked to the main executable during compilation. The object file contains the _get_cpuid symbol, as the injected shell scripts remove one underscore symbol from the original source code, which means that when the code calls _get_cpuid, it actually calls the backdoor’s version of it. Backdoor code entry point Backdoor code analysis The initial backdoor code is invoked twice, as both lzma_crc32 and lzma_crc64 use the same modified function (_get_cpuid). To ensure control over this, a simple counter is created to verify that the code has already been executed. The actual malicious activity starts when the lzma_crc64 IFUNC invokes _get_cpuid, sees the counter value 1 indicating that that the function has already been accessed, and initiates one final step to redirect to the true entry point of this malware. Backdoor initialization To initialize the malicious code, the backdoor first initializes a couple of structures that hold core information about the current running process. Primarily, it locates the Global Offset Table (GOT) address using hardcoded offsets, and uses this information to find the cpuid pointer inside it. GOT modification code The GOT contains the offsets of symbols, including the cpuid wrapper. The backdoor then swaps the pointers to the main malware function, and calls it as if it were calling cpuid. Core behavior The main goal of the backdoor is to successfully hook specific functions that will allow it to monitor every connection to the infected machine. The targeted functions include: Targeted function Description RSA_public_decrypt Used by libcrypto to decrypt a ciphertext signed by a private key EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA Used by libcrypto to set the RSA key of a given context RSA_get0_key Used by libcrypto to retrieve an RSA key However, hooking all these functions is not a simple and straightforward task for the backdoor. It involves accessing many internal structures and manipulating process-specific structures until it achieves its goal, and it also needs to be as stealthy as possible, which means that the malicious code contains multiple checks to avoid being analyzed. Execution environment check It first parses ld-linux (dynamic linker), which is primarily responsible for dynamically resolving symbol addresses in memory. It also extracts various information about the environment and verifies that the current process the backdoor is running in matches its execution criteria, which are: The current process is /usr/bin/sshd Check if the kill switch is present It extracts the name of the current process from argv[0] and also parses all the process environment variables to see if any of them are present in its internal string table. If a match is found, or the process is not sshd, the malware halts its execution. Process environment check The only variable inside its own table is yolAbejyiejuvnup=Evjtgvsh5okmkAvj, which in this context serves as a kill switch. The trie structure One of the distinctive features of the backdoor is the use of a single trie structure for string operations. Instead of directly comparing strings or using string hashes to match a particular constant (for example, the name of a library function), the code performs a trie lookup, and checks if the result is equal to a certain constant number. For example, the magic value for the ELF header results in the trie returning 0x300, and the name of the system function is matched with a return value of 0x9F8. Trie is not just used for comparisons: certain functions that use pointers to strings (for example, ssh-2.0) search for these strings in the host binary using the trie, so there will be no suspicious data in the backdoor’s body. The implementation of the trie uses 16-byte bitmasks, each half corresponding to the byte input ranges 0x00-0x3F and 0x40-0x7F, and 2-byte trie leaf nodes, 3 bits of which are flags (direction, termination) and the rest is reserved for the value (or the location of the next node). Part of the trie lookup function that performs the bitmap match Symbol resolver There are at least three symbol resolver-related routines used by the backdoor to locate the ELF Symbol structure, which holds information such as the symbol name and its offset. All symbol resolver functions receive a key to be searched in the trie. Symbol resolver example One of the backdoor resolver functions iterates through all symbols and verifies which one has the desired key. If it is found, it returns the Elf64_Sym structure, which will later be used to populate an internal structure of the backdoor that holds all the necessary function pointers. This process is similar to that commonly seen in Windows threats with API hashing routines. The backdoor searches many functions from the libcrypto (OpenSSL) library, as these will be used in later encryption routines. It also keeps track of how many functions it was able to find and resolve; this determines whether it is executing properly or should stop. Another interesting symbol resolver abuses the lzma_alloc function, which is part of the liblzma library itself. This function serves as a helper for developers to allocate memory efficiently using the default allocator (malloc) or a custom one. In the case of the XZ backdoor, this function is abused to make use of a fake allocator. In reality, it functions as another symbol resolver. The parameter intended for “allocation size” is, in fact, the symbol key inside the trie. This trick is meant to complicate backdoor analysis. Symbol resolver using a fake allocator structure The backdoor dynamically resolves its symbols while executing; it doesn’t necessarily do so all at once or only when it needs to use them. The resolved symbols/functions range from legitimate OpenSSL functions to functions such as system, which is used to execute commands on the machine. The Symbind hook As mentioned earlier, the primary objective of the backdoor initialization is to successfully hook functions. To do so, the backdoor makes use of rtdl-audit, a feature of the dynamic linker that enables the creation of custom shared libraries to be notified when certain events occur within the linker, such as symbol resolution. In a typical scenario, a developer would create a shared library following the rtdl-audit manual. However, the XZ backdoor opts to perform a runtime patch on the already registered (default) interfaces loaded in memory, thereby hijacking the symbol-resolving routine. dl-audit runtime patch The maliciously crafted structure audit_iface, stored in the dl_audit global variable within the dynamic linker’s memory area, contains the symbind64 callback address, which is invoked by the dynamic linker. It sends all the symbol information to the backdoor control, which is then used to obtain a malicious address for the target functions, thus achieving hooking. Hooking placement inside the Symbind modified callback The addresses for dl_audit and dl_naudit, which holds the number of audit interfaces available, are obtained by disassembling both the dl_main and dl_audit_symbind_alt functions. The backdoor contains an internal minimalistic disassembler used for instruction decoding. It makes extensive use of it, especially when hunting for specific values like the *audit addresses. dl_naudit hunting code The dl_naudit address is found by one of the mov instructions within the dl_main function code that accesses it. With that information, the backdoor hunts for access to a memory address and saves it. It also verifies if the memory address acquired is the same address as the one accessed by the dl_audit_symbind_alt function on a given offset. This allows it to safely assume that it has indeed found the correct address. After it finds the dl_naudit address, it can easily calculate where dl_audit is, since the two are stored next to each other in memory. Conclusion In this article, we covered the entire process of backdooring liblzma (XZ), and delved into a detailed analysis of the binary backdoor code, up to achieving its principal goal: hooking. It’s evident that this backdoor is highly complex and employs sophisticated methods to evade detection. These include the multi-stage implantation in the XZ repository, as well as the complex code contained within the binary itself. There is still much more to explore about the backdoor’s internals, which is why we have decided to present this as Part I of the XZ backdoor series. Kaspersky products detect malicious objects related to the attack as HEUR:Trojan.Script.XZ and Trojan.Shell.XZ. In addition, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux detects malicious code in SSHD process memory as MEM:Trojan.Linux.XZ (as part of the Critical Areas Scan task).

Aside, this is one of my grumpy-old-dude opinions when it comes to regular non-malicious code: Source \"greppability\" is a virtue, one that must be balanced against \"don't repeat yourself\" and \"compile time checking\", etc. Some examples off the top of my head: 1. One import/alias per line, no wildcards. 2. If you have to concatenate a literal string across multiple lines, try to ensure the break isn't inside an interesting substring someone would search for. 3. If you write a compile-time constant like foo=4*6*9, the comments around it should also contain the result. Sure, someone might screw up and forget to keep the comment in-sync, but it can also be invaluable when someone else is tearing their hair out trying to find out why the production logs are saying nothing but \"Illegal frump: 216\". Don't get me wrong, I love a good IDE, and many will offer \"Find Usages\" or \"Find Literal\"... but it doesn't always work all the time, for all languages in the project at once, for everyone on a team who might use other tools, or during a PR review through a web-browser, etc. reply lenerdenator 5 hours agorootparentprevI think it goes beyond just this particular attempt.

I'd argue the technical knowledge here isn't the hard part here. You can find more than enough folks who would know how to do everything you listed outside of any state-sponsored context. The hard part is the methodical execution, including the opsec, backup plans, plausible deniability, false identities, knowing how to play the long game, being able to precisely target what you want, understanding human psychological tendencies, identifying unforeseen security vulnerabilities, etc... these are the things that I imagine are likely to distinguish talented individuals from state-sponsored actors, not something like \"knows tries and x86 assembly\".

You got any evidence for any of this? reply glitchcrab 51 minutes agorootparentConversely, do you have evidence against any of it? reply vlovich123 8 hours agoprevSo if I'm understanding correctly, a useful hardening step would be to ensure that each dynamically linked library had it's own GOT & that the tables are marked as read-only once dynamic linking completes (i.e. you can't reach across dynamic boundaries to patch someone else's ifunc entries). That would improve the supply chain security of code getting linked in somewhere but never executed. EDIT: Or even better, perhaps ifunc should be implemented in a declarative fashion so that you can't just cause arbitrary code execution from each library you link against. That might be harder to implement at this point considering back compat, but probably is something that could be layered in over a longer time period (i.e. if you build any library with \"declaratively linked ifunc\" feature bit set, then the dynamic linker will force all linked libraries to have that feature flag or fail to launch). reply jerjerjer 7 hours agoparentFrom another angle: build systems. Currently building most libraries usually involves executing a series of highly complex byzantine scripts, requiring turing-complete environment. This gives attacker an endless attack surface, and when the build process is hijacked - well, the opportunities are there. Moving to a declarative build process with only a limited state machine as an executor would help. Requiring all source blobs being reproducible might also be something to think about. reply kimixa 5 hours agorootparentHaving a \"simple\" declarative build definition won't help if the thing that interprets and executes that definition is shipped with the package, as said interpreter is likely orders of magnitude more complex and harder to personally review. As is what happened with the xz example - the \"attack\" was hidden in code that is autogenerated by autotools, not the build or configuration definitions. People put trust in distros and packagers to having something of a review chain - there's 0% chance you personally be an expert in everything executing on your workstation right now (outside of maybe toy systems). I'm not an expert in m4 or bash, but I hope enough experts are in the chain to get to my distro's package library are that such things are less likely. But that is all bypassed here. I think this particular approach is a one-off, as I know of no other build environment where it's expected to have the generated executable of the build system \"helpfully\" packaged in the tarball as a packaging step. If it is in some I'm not aware of, I hope that decision is being re-examined now. reply AtlasBarfed 2 hours agorootparentIt needs money and people.

This would prevent simple use of ifuncs in this way, but it's important to understand that the author of this could inject arbitrary code into the library that ends up in the address space of a sensitive process. At that point, all bets are off: it could remap the GOT as writable if it so chose, or (this is mostly here for the EDR people will certainly bring it up after reading this) if trying to do that is flagged as \"suspicious\" or the OS gains the ability to block such a transition, the injected code can subvert control flow in hundreds of other ways. It has arbitrary read/write, code execution, everything: there is no security mitigation that can stop it. If it so wishes it can leak private keys and send them to the attacker directly. It can spawn a shell. Trying to design protections at this stage of compromise is a fool's errand. reply tux3 1 hour agorootparent>it's important to understand that the author of this could inject arbitrary code into the library that ends up in the address space of a sensitive process.

I think it's important to push back on a very specific point here. It's true in general that if the attacker has added a backdoor in your library, and you're going to call that library's code, you've pretty much lost. Game over. Go home. But this was a very different attack, in that the attackers couldn't directly target sshd. They couldn't manage to target any library that sshd calls directly either. The library with the backdoor is code that was never actually called at runtime. This is important because it means it *doesn't* have a hundred ways to reach code execution. It only had a few select ways, mainly constructors and indirect function resolvers. The amount of weirdness in glibc's runtime loader is not unbounded. There aren't actually a hundred places where it allows random libs to run code before main. And we should take a good look at those couple place that are clearly juicy high-value gadgets to attacker. When glibc's runtime loader first loads a binary, first reaches a relocation for a STT_GNU_IFUNC, everything is still in a pristine state and no arbitrary code can run without being explicitly called. Attackers don't have magical powers that allow them to run code before you hand them the control flow. At this point in the runtime loader, an ifunc resolver cannot do anything without being caught. It cannot \"just open /proc/self/mem\" or \"just call mprotect\". It cannot \"just disassemble the caller\" or \"just overwrite the GOT\". I really want to hammer home how different that is from letting the attacker run code after main. There's nothing you can do if you directly call a backdoored library. But we shouldn't let attackers get away with spending 400ms parsing and disassembling ELFs in memory in an ifunc resolver of all things. Overwriting the GOT like nobody's watching. The backdoor isn't magic. For all the beautiful sophistication that went into it, it made many mistakes along the way that could have led to a detection. From valgrind errors to unacceptable amount of noise (400ms!) before main. reply ajross 7 hours agoparentprev> the tables are marked as read-only once dynamic linking completes Alas this won't work. Dynamic linking is lazy, there's no moment when it's \"complete\".

Most distros compile everything with -g and then separate out the debug symbols into a different package, because you almost always want to be able to attach gdb to any process when something goes wrong (and no, recompiling at that point is a much worse idea, because it means installing compilers on your production system as well as not being able to debug what was actually running). It doesn't matter anyway, because once you're running inside a process you can do most anything you like. This was a convenient mechanism, but there are scores of ways to scan over the symbols and modify code inside the same process. reply Animats 2 hours agorootparent\"You almost always want to be able to attach gdb to any process when something goes wrong\".

Public networks have too many eyes potentially (not just the admins responsible for specific systems). Traffic to ssh server that corresponds to suspicious activity but is also absent from logs would raise the alarms quite soon. Hooking the build process also means that the main targets are places that are important enough to have their own siloed software repositories. Getting into two LTS systems was a bonus. I suppose that simpler exploits are available for popular systems (if they run regular complex applications instead of being a minimal empty box that securely does nothing).

    "originBody": "Google/ Tech Google threatens to cut off news after California proposes paying media outlets Google threatens to cut off news after California proposes paying media outlets / It’s testing removing links to California-based news publishers and pausing investment in the state’s news ecosystem. By Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Apr 12, 2024, 4:00 PM UTC Share this story Google is piloting removing links to California news websites for a small percentage of users. Illustration: The Verge Google says it will start removing links to California news websites in a “short term test for a small percentage of California users.” The move is in response to the pending California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which would require Google to pay a fee for linking Californians to news articles. “If passed, CJPA may result in significant changes to the services we can offer Californians and the traffic we can provide to California publishers,” Jaffer Zaidi, Google VP of global news partnerships, wrote in a blog post announcing the decision. “The testing process involves removing links to California news websites, potentially covered by CJPA, to measure the impact of the legislation on our product experience.” Zaidi adds that Google will also pause “further investments in the California news ecosystem,” referring to initiatives like Google News Showcase, product and licensing programs for news organizations, and the Google News Initiative. Related Why Google caved to Australia, and Facebook didn’t The conflict centers on Google’s impact on journalism. As it stands, Google (as well as Meta) receives a much larger cut of online advertising than publishers. An Electronic Frontier Foundation report notes that half of every ad dollar gets eaten up by fees, while subscriptions are subject to app store taxes. Supporters argue the California bill gives publishers leverage to make profit sharing more equitable. Google alleges that it already drives traffic to publishers and that this sort of legislation favors media conglomerates at the risk of further hollowing out local papers. Complicating matters, it’s difficult to put a number on how much money Google makes from news. Technically, it doesn’t host ads on Google News, but media companies argue that linking out to news content benefits the platform more broadly. A 2023 study estimates that Google would owe US publishers around $10 to 12 billion annually should the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act — a national bill — come into effect. This is not the first time that Google has opposed attempts from legislators to force it to pay media outlets for news. In 2014, it pulled out of Spain after a similar measure was passed but eventually returned after an eight-year absence in 2022. The company also threatened to pull out of Australia entirely back in 2020 when the country introduced the News Media Bargaining Code. Ultimately, Google caved and cut a deal with several Australian publishers — and Australia’s success led other countries like the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand to pursue similar legislation.

At some level, it is almost a free speech issue. If I can't refer to what you are saying, without owing you something, you have power over not just my speech, but a power to limit how your work is subjected to criticism and debate. It's effectively an extension of copyright law to expand copyright holder's rights. Obviously all this is hyperbolic based the actual text of the law. The law doesn't directly apply any sort of link tax, and it is shamelessly targeted only at Google and Facebook (to the point that they wrote Facebook in there by name, which is kind of stupid if you ask me). But if you drill into the reasoning it hits at the foundational level on this basic logic, and it's pretty concerning if we assume then that this will be significantly extrapolated and expanded - as has been the history with all other aspects of copyright in the past. Honestly I would rather that governments come clean and just admit that the problem they are trying to solve is actually a \"social good\" outcome, and therefore directly tax the platforms and then redistribute the revenue to a fund created by government for news journalism themselves. Trying to artificially construct that through introduction of significant new precedents in copyright law engenders huge risks of unintended consequences and potential future extrapolation and abuse of this principle. reply notatoad 12 hours agoparent>I have sympathy for news publishers i have very little sympathy for news publishers. I have sympathy for the journalists actually doing journalism, but news publishers have spent the last couple decades making their websites absolutely unusable, so that unless somebody links to an article externally there's almost no point in going to their site directly. And even after you've followed that link it's almost impossible to read an article around the ads, login prompts, and chumboxes. News websites are terrible, and it's their own fault. Giving them more money to do the thing they've spent so long failing at isn't going to solve this problem. >directly tax the platforms and then redistribute the revenue to a fund created by government for news journalism themselves yes. and specifically, make sure the fund is actually funding journalism. a link tax that gets paid out to news sites only incentivizes them to do the bare minimum amount of journalism to still qualify as a news site, and then fill up the rest of the site with SEO clickbait to maximize their clicks for the link tax. reply cush 9 hours agorootparent> news publishers have spent the last couple decades making their websites absolutely unusable To appease Google… Conversely, NYTs site is stellar.

How a fund can manage this relationship correctly based on view counts is beyond me. Let alone.. do we want \"clicks\" to substitute for editorial process? The deeply sad part about all of this is News and Broadcast have traditionally had very strong commission based internal sales operations. They have the people to go out, get advertisers, take their money, and then just /inline/ all the advertisements.

But the big selling point of Google, and one of the drivers that got them to where they are today, is they looked at that money and said \"no, it isn't worth it, this will compromise the user experience\". Then they went with text ads on Google search. Over the years I assume they've changed that decision along with the general cultural rot that comes to large companies, but there is a clear precedent. Publishers didn't have to take money to make their own product worse. They could have made their product good and tried to make money that way. Although realistically these media companies are probably going to go out of business with the current model whatever they try. The internet has made a mockery of their credibility; the future seems to be podcasters with dedicated audiences going it alone or blogs - the costs are lower and the quality is generally higher. reply chgs 9 hours agorootparentprevRemember when google first launched and it was so great as it was just some text adverts rather than things like punch the monkey. reply jquery 5 hours agorootparentI remember when google first launched and didn't have ads because the founders wrote a whitepaper about how ads would inevitably ruin google reply akira2501 11 hours agorootparentprevSure they did. They created page and site metrics that then tied to search engine placement. All the \"garbage\" is an effort to improve their \"performance\" within these specific metric categories. It's the same story with \"AMP.\" Publishers had zero incentive to create AMP versions of their site, but they did anyways, because they saw that they lost placement if they didn't comply. I'm not \"blaming\" Google, nor should you be \"defending\" them. What I'm attempting to do here is show that they definitely, perhaps indirectly, played a significant part in the shape of the modern web. While simultaneously decrying the laziness of publishers that led them to this late stage outcome.

Alternatives to increasing advertisements have been tried and found to work. However, these approaches may not be feasible for all publications—especially local news outlets that may not have as many resources. These approaches are to: i) Start selling other services besides news. The New York Times—one of the most currently financially successful newspapers—has found a lot of success in its Games section. This was famously seen in their acquisition of Wordle, though this has already been popular with their Crosswords section. The company has also found success with its Recipes section. (This is not the only reason behind their financial success, but it's a significant part of their strategy.) ii) Focus on financial news, which lets the publication frame their reports as having a financial value that arguably exceeds the subscription price. The Financial Times is also a highly profitable newspaper today, with one of the highest-priced subscription prices that can be about $500 USD a year for a standard subscription (depending on one's region). The Wall Street Journal similarly charges a high subscription price. Both are seen as important resources for well-funded companies to buy group subscriptions for. (Once more, this isn't the only reason for their success, but it's a major factor.) iii) Focus on a specialized, niche area of reporting that other publications can't or won't cover—ideally appealing to institutions or large audiences willing to spend money. For example, several publications in Canada focus on providing detailed reports on federal politics (such as The Hill Times and iPolitics), which is useful information for their readership that fills a gap by less-frequent reports from the country's main newspapers—this lets them charge high subscription prices. The Athletic also used to be financially successful by standing out with its sports-only reporting, which led to its acquisition by The New York Times. These specialized publications can charge more, because certain audiences find these reports financially valuable. --- However, a major drawback to thinking about news through the lens of financial value is that many important news stories don't have financial value. While an outlet can attempt to use one of these approaches to subsidize the rest of their stories, it's also costly. It's usually not feasible for many local newspapers to fund the software development of a Games section (especially as this would need to compete with all the other online alternatives for one's attention). It's also pricey to offer competitive enough salaries to create a newsroom to compete with The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg. However, it's not impossible—there have been a few alternative publications that have found success by focusing on a niche, such as business news in a country outside of the US, or focusing on a sector such as biotech for the publication STAT. It's a tough problem to try and fund local news. There is civic value for one's community to have a platform for providing a check against corruption by various institutions—yet in practice, oftentimes not enough for most local residents purchase subscriptions. Alternatives to support local news can include funding (such as through taxes), but that makes the outlet reliant on government funding, which is subject to change (and the perception, real or not, that the outlet is less independent from the government). Increasing advertisements seems like a short-term solution for local news outlets trying to stay afloat, but it's hard for me to see this as a long-term solution for sufficient funding. reply massysett 7 hours agorootparent> It's a tough problem to try and fund local news.

I suppose you could argue that it indirectly supports the \"war machine\" in Ukraine, but I don't really consider it unethical to fund wars of self-defense, especially given the national security implications at home. reply wrsh07 7 hours agorootparentprevThe BBC...? reply roenxi 5 hours agorootparentThe standout institution of British propaganda and intelligence gathering?

Google is scraping metadata and articles, and summarizing them so that most people never even need to click the link. Google is getting most of the value from the articles written while not doing the actual work to make them. The whole thing could have been avoided if Google and social media stopped embedding previews and summaries everywhere. It's worse in places like Facebook where they actively don't want you to actually follow the link. Facebook wants you to leave a like or a comment right there under the preview, then keep scrolling. reply zmmmmm 11 hours agorootparentI don't think the law (from what I read of it) actually does target that though. Might as well cite it rather than refer to it in the abstract: > The total number of the covered platform’s internet web pages displayed or presented to California residents during the month that link to, display, or present the eligible digital journalism provider’s news articles, works of journalism, or other content, or portions thereof. Google can remove all the summaries and the law will apply just as much. In fact, from my reading of it, in other parts they are actually referring to \"impressions\" as the driver; that is it's explicitly the click through that they are asserting provides the value to Google, not the prevention of click through. I get that emotionally, it's the prevention of click through that feels injurious, but it doesn't read as the spirit of this to me. I think possibly they know that if they didn't fully scope in links here Google would immediately just reduce it to raw links and this would reduce click through and it would hurt the intended beneficiaries of this more than it helps them. reply makeitdouble 10 hours agorootparentFrom the article, the overall point seems to be on Google making significantly more money from news than the news providers, and the providers trying to find a better balance one way or another. I think you're right on raw links also part of the target, but it's also in the context of Google providing an overview of the news and profiting from it, whether the links are clicked or not (Google's clearly covering all the spectrum of where money can be made on the pipeline, until it hits the target site) reply bawolff 11 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair - that's what news sites do - they summarize information happening elsewhere. Its hard to claim google is in the wrong for doing to news sites what news sites have been doing to other people since forever. reply ninkendo 11 hours agorootparentAt some point someone is actually doing journalism though (in the best case at least.) News outlets that summarize things from e.g. Reuters or AP tend to have agreements which pay money for the information. You could reasonably argue that google should be doing the same, right? reply dmazzoni 10 hours agorootparentI think the reality is that journalism was a ridiculously inefficient business. A big national event happens. News organizations collectively send 30 different reporters to the scene. Those 30 reporters each write up a firsthand story. Now hundreds of smaller news organizations (local papers, local TV news stations, etc.) rewrite it in their own words and put it in their version. In the end, for any major story you end up with hundreds of articles being written, but out of those there are only a handful of genuinely different narratives, each retold in slightly different words hundreds of times. It's rare that a local news organization adds any significant value. In my opinion, NPR is the only organization that gets it right: there's a single national organization that does the news at the top of every hour, and local stations then come on to give local news following that. A single national organization does morning and evening long-form news shows with the national shows, and each local station does its own long-form shows with local news. Very little redundancy. reply izacus 11 hours agorootparentprevWhoever is doing journalism, it's not those sites that now want a governmental tax handout to continue being bad. reply bbarnett 11 hours agorootparentprevIf Google was doing what news sites did, it would have journalists writing articles, researching data, investigating, etc. Yet they do none of that.

Why aren't people willing to pay for it? reply philipkglass 12 hours agorootparentFacts are not copyrightable, so the meat of a story spreads quickly and with very little money changing hands. One subscriber to the Los Angeles Times can legally and immediately share the factual essence of an article via social media, personal web site, email, or anything else. From there it can be reshared indefinitely. Only people who really want to read the original reporting in full will pay to subscribe to the LA Times. There used to be regional/temporal barriers in place before the Web was popular; newspapers had geographically limited distribution and it took time to print a new edition. One newspaper \"scooping\" another by one day was all it took to get people to buy the one-day-earlier publication. Also, 20th century newspapers collected significant revenue from classified advertising, people buying the paper just to get a weather forecast, and other kinds of information distribution that really didn't have anything to do with investigative news. The Web unbundled all that (weather.gov, Craigslist, etc.) and the only remaining strength of newspapers was producing original reporting. Which, unfortunately, was never all that profitable on its own even before you get to the \"facts are not copyrightable\" issue that I mentioned in my first paragraph. reply nickpsecurity 9 hours agorootparent“Facts are not copyrightable” Does anyone have any good pages on that which go into how to extract facts without copyright infringement?

The basic news is commoditized and freely available online, and that's what a lot of traditional newspapers are competing with. However, paid industry journalism like The Information is something people are willing to pay for - or get their companies to pay for at least. Also, I think traditional newspapers should position themselves so they're not competing with the lowest common denominator of basic info, however due to cutbacks, most newspapers are in essence not doing very much in depth journalism anymore, which means they are unfortunately positioning themselves as competing with any other source of news. reply bawolff 12 hours agorootparentprevThe value proposition in the internet age is too low to demand the price neccessary to support it. This created a race to the bottom in order to keep the lights on. This further degraded the value of the product. This caused people to value it less, and so on. The end result is reputable news sites became clickbait and eventually people stopped caring. There is still a market for in depth journalism, and we see a rise in that sort of things. There are plenty of youtube channels doing documentary-like videos on current events. That is journalism. The journalism that is dying is the stuff concentrating on breaking news. If its shallow its outcompeted by twitter. If its higher quality but still racing to the headline, its outcompeted by wikipedia. The fact is the competitors to breaking news journalism are cheaper and higher quality. reply CM30 11 hours agorootparentprevIn simple terms; lots of competition and much of it is free. If you want basic breaking news, it's all over social media (often from the news sites themselves). If you want sports, tech, gaming, music, entertainment, art or other hobby style news, it's literally on two million websites and forums and YouTube channels specifically made for that one topic, and usually done better than in a newspaper. So while you could say a decent chunk of the replacement content is worse than what traditional news outlets could offer, it's at least free and exists by the bucket load, meaning the incentive for paying for it is nonexistent for most of the population. Meanwhile the more niche stuff is both free and done better elsewhere, so RIP anyone making money off that anymore. To make things tougher, getting advertisers to pay for it is becoming a lost cause too, since again, they can advertise in places where metrics and tracking options are better. They'll get way more bang for their buck on social media than they will trying to market on a news site or in a classifieds section or what not. reply reissbaker 12 hours agorootparentprevJournalism quality has tanked, and social media acts as some degree of (free+fast) competition, furthering the death spiral. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentTo expand, journalists used to actually investigate which took time which means it took money so that the story released had lots of corroborating sources, scrutinized by editors, and then released as a complete story. That might have meant things like actually interviewing people, requesting documents from places, or visiting the places in question. Today, it is just a bunch of people collecting tweets of random people on the interwebs. Race to publish before competition means there's no time for editorial review of simple things like grammar and coherent thoughts let alone accuracy, so lots of FUD can be spread very quickly as \"news\". Those well thought out articles are also considered too long and boring and get reposted on socials as TL;DR as if it were their own thoughts.

And the funny thing about this payment arrangement that publishers want is that they are not paying any of those tweeters who may be breaking the news or themselves curating the info. reply dylan604 11 hours agorootparentWhy would you pay someone for a tweet? They posted it for free. Collecting tweets isn't journalism. Asking the user for more than 140 chars about what they are witnessing along with multiple others would then be closer to journalism.

I mean, seriously, that's the reason. Back when newspapers were healthy, basically there was all this stuff that was bundled with the actual news that was of more immediate utility to people: classifieds, movie reviews, comics, coupons. And there was less competition for people's leisure time. News is now in a very competitive leisure time landscape and is debundled from stuff that's of high value, and most people just don't care that much about news. They'll read it when it's around but they won't pay for it. The ones who are willing to pay for it mostly just subscribe to the New York Times because in a nationalized news environment why not go for the biggest producer. reply teeray 5 hours agorootparent> most people just don't care that much about news I stopped caring about what was happening on the world stage in 2022, and it has been sublime. I hear about the big things from friends and random folks, and it gives some instant conversation starters (“oh no, I hadn’t heard about that”). The only news I actually care about is local news, and I skim the newsletter my (small) city publishes on Fridays. Given that, there is zero value provided to me by traditional media publishers. I say this as someone who gets NYT, WSJ, WaPo, and FT for free through work. I don’t use them, because I’d rather spend my time doing something else. No judgement here though—if reading the paper is your thing and you like staying informed, that’s great and I fully support it. Just offering my perspective. reply bawolff 11 hours agorootparentprevI think that is a part of it, but its not just that. News provied two services in the old days: access and filtering. Back in the day you couldn't easily get things straight from the horses mouth, now you can just go to their website. If you did have direct access in the old days, it was all way too much. There was no way to filter to 10-minutes worth of top goings on. Now a days you can just look at what is upvoted and stop once you have read enough. reply devjab 2 hours agorootparentprevI’m not sure I agree that news is more competitive now within its own business? (I’m not sure what the Danish branche is in English), but rather that there are just so many things competing for people’s attention in general. With SoMe being actively designed to be addictive through various algorithms I think it’s only natural that people spend more of their time on Instagram, TikTok, Reddit or even HackerNews. I think that is time that a lot of people would’ve otherwise spend on news. Add to this the introduction of terrible news media. The spam and click bait media, where you get the articles for free but the articles you get are basically worse than what you’d find anywhere else because they are most there to generate revenue from advertising. Stuff that gives “traditional” news media a very bad image. Further add the media platforms which are now straight up political propaganda, which some always where, but now they are owned by very few people and push very divisive agendas which is a little different from the past where they were more inline with each other and the “general” aristocracy rather than a few billionaires/oligarchs and you gain the general media perception even more. Both are rightfully so. In a sense you get what you pay for though. If you’re not paying you’re not getting quality news. You can see this in Danish news very clearly, where only a handful of news papers still do actual critical journalism and the rest mainly do opinions or click-bait articles on current events that you might as well read on Facebook. Not because Facebook does anything particularly in that department but because the contractors who sell stories and pictures to the “free” news media typically also post their content elsewhere for increased revenue on their part. As far as going to the “biggest” most “cultural” news media I totally agree with you. In my country people read Weekend Avisen, and then add one of the more politically inclined subscription papers based on their views. But basically it boils down to thee papers, one that is slightly more conservative (which in Scandinavian/American optics would make it almost socialist), one that is left-leaning (again, very socialist in American optics) and one that is based on Christianity (but extremely moderate, as in pro abortion and gay marriage). Aside from that there are two “localised” papers which either focus heavily on Copenhagen or the part of our country which is called Jylland. Almost none of these papers would be alive without government subsidies. Because the only two papers which actually makes money are Weekendavisen (our NYT) and the Christian paper which doesn’t actually make money but is subsidised by various Christian groups. reply internetter 12 hours agorootparentprevCompletely agree with all this, though my take away is that there's a big vicious cycle of adblockers and paywalls where they keep getting worse.

Yes, we all know that option is available. But, as I've self-righteously offered for consideration, Google is one of a few sites that essentially monopolizes traffic generation, so they've positioned themselves to make it untenable for sites to block Google's crawling (and free monetization) of their content. Cory Doctorow has (another) recent Twitter thread on how tech monopolies have grown virtually unchecked and now abuse the ecosystems in which they operate, increasingly clawing back more value for themselves at the expense of others. IMO this fits the pattern. Look it up. You might find it interesting. Or not. >and most likely kill their business. And, there you've just stated exactly the problem I'm referencing, with apparently zero awareness of how someone could find it problematic. I mean, you just said \"they could solve the problem by blocking Google via robots.txt, but that would kill their business\". So, not exactly a solution then, right?

Sure, but these things are directly related. It's the scraping that generates the links in question and ultimately earns Google ad revenue.

So, it seems if you agree they should pay for the scraping (but they are not), then you wouldn't be opposed to them paying on the other end.

There isn't a single physical product that's not beholden to the Walmarts of the world to stock, market and highlight those products. There isn't a single farmer in this world that isn't dependant on stores buying off their produce and putting it into shelves. Heck, even in paper era, there wasn't a single paper not beholden to kiosks and other stores to put their papers into racks and into premium places where customers are most likely to pick them up. Do you hink NYTimes demanded that street vendors pay them for the privilege of putting their paper onto a rack?! Having fully vertically integrated bussiness (like you're mentioning) is a very modern development of monopolies. reply abdullahkhalids 12 hours agorootparentNewspapers obviously sold their paper to the paper kiosks, who then sold it to customers. Hence a business relationship between the two types of entities. In the Google News case, no news sites sells their news to Google News. There is no business relation between Google News or any de jure contact whatsoever between the two. It's different. I am not saying its good or bad, or that this gives the right to the news sites for news sites to demand payments from Google. But I think its a weird scenario that doesn't occur in other markets.

Artificially making their platform look better economically. Was individual cases, yet now alleged to be a global pool of stolen Publisher money. 3) Gaining access to Publisher's ad-spend behavior with Dynamic Allocation, and then using the info to make sure rival platforms seemed less competitive by manipulating and inflating other bids. Make sure they always seem to lose by $0.01 on every bid. 4) Forcing Publishers to accept Dynamic Allocation by punishing them with the maximum allowed revenue drop for Bernake (40%) while inflating competitors.

It’s not that they haven’t monetized effectively, but rather that there are gatekeepers in the way with no real competition, who can steal your margin by showing part of your news story. All of this is really a classic problem of anti-trust, and what a monopoly is today is different from the past but we haven’t acknowledged this properly in my view. reply freedomben 14 hours agorootparentIf that's true (and I agree that it is), then charging for links is going to make it even worse and effectively cement that reality for all time. How is a startup who can't afford to pay employees, let alone publishers, supposed to come by and provide some alternative? Possibly perhaps, the big publishers (with deep pockets and lobbyists) really like this approach because despite entrenching big tech, it erects formidable barriers to entry for new upstart competitors to them? Regulatory capture is a tried and true tactic for industries that reach a certain size. IMHO society is a lot better off trying to prevent summarization efforts (that eliminate the need for the user to visit the page) than they are trying to charge for links. The latter is something that benefits everyone regardless of size. I'm not necessarily in favor of doing that either (would need to think it through a lot more, because it would essentially legislate a worse user experience, which is not something to be done without serious deliberation), but it seems like a much more relevant fight to have and one that isn't so self-serving. reply kemayo 13 hours agorootparentThe proposed California law is written so that it basically only applies to Google and other social media giants.

Google does not support all news organizations equally, and this seems designed to gain some leverage over organizations that do get a lot from Google. Their Google News Initiative is on its surface just a training platform for publishers to learn how to use Google’s tools but they’ve done quite a bit more for some publishers. This feels like an attempt to gain the vocal support of publishers who have been blessed by Google’s beneficence, many of which are earnest non-profit organizations who might take the bait about big bad hedge funds. I don’t know how they select who to help and who to ignore and our attempts to engage with them on behalf of publishers have had mixed results. But publishers’ collective frustration with Google is quite high. Given the implications that “it would be a shame if something happened to your nice journalism website” coupled with the appeal against the big bad hedge funds and ghost papers, it’s sort of a clever position but I’m not sure it will work. reply paxys 15 hours agoprevI wonder if these media conglomerates think the same laws should apply to them.

If so, I think a link tax is justified. At that point, Google is creating value for itself by removing value from others so it seems fair to me. And we don’t need the law to be perfect - let’s just make it applicable to companies with market capitalization above 100 billion. But more than this, the big tech companies are just too powerful and their mere existence is anti competitive. I think that issue needs to be addressed independent of media outlets specifically. For example with AI, big tech companies are in a position to put themselves first in front of customers and prevent any smaller players from competing for users and market share. Now Apple and Microsoft are forcing their AI agents onto phones and computers, and potentially violating privacy of users and using all their data for training or other purposes. We’ve seen such a long history of anti competitive practices from these companies, and rather than dealing with performative court cases that drag out for years, we need to deal with the fact that they’re too big. They need to be split up. Or maybe just get taxed more compared to everyone else. reply kemayo 15 hours agoparentCan't speak for what Google plans to do in the future, but currently news results in search can either be a \"top stories\" block at the top of the results, or regular search results. In \"top stories\" you get just the headline and maybe an associated picture. In regular search results you get the headline, and a fragment of the first sentence of the article. If seeing the headline and maybe a tiny fragment of the first words is enough to remove commercial viability, there's a lot of things that do that. Physical newspapers/magazines are generally displayed in a way that provides that information, for instance. I'm sure there are people who search, see the headline, and don't click through. But the counterargument is that other people do click through, and without the search results then the news website wouldn't have received any of that traffic. Perhaps-ironically, it looks like a full AI-synthesis approach would be a way to get around paying the news orgs under this law.

I'd even argue, that if you are going to charge for linking to an article, then I'd expect no ads on that site. But, anything beyond a link starts to open up questions for me. Who even uses Google's AI summarize feature for articles? For me, most of the time it's been because the pop-up for it jumped in the way for me and it was an accidental click. When I have intentionally used it, it's been a pretty poor summary and misses key nuances that make the article unique compared to other publishers. Taking a step back further, I don't know who is asking for this feature. What's the target market here? Also, perhaps I'm wrong here but I don't think anyone would want an AI summarized version of other types of media like songs or movies. reply Terr_ 11 hours agoparentprev> If so, I think a link tax is justified. I disagree, a \"link tax\" is the wrong choice of response, and incredibly dangerous to a free/distributed internet: Once it exists in principle its scope will not remain limited to affecting only big unsympathetic search-engine companies, it'll start affecting other sites (like, say, HN) and get abused to deter critics from pointing to the things they want to criticize.

Guess what? reply jaredwiener 16 hours agoprevThis requires some nuance, since I think it goes beyond a \"tax on linking,\" as I have seen it described. News is a strange product, and one that I think a lot of people in tech get wrong. The atomic unit of journalism is not an article....it's the reporting. Even deciding to write an article is an act based on the analysis of the reporting. Further, a good headline often tells the story itself -- and that is implicitly included when we talk about links. How often have you read a headline, and then not clicked on the link? Probably a bunch. But you still know OJ died, or the bridge in Baltimore collapsed, etc, etc. That level of reporting, the confirmation that it happened, all that stuff -- all was expensive, all required labor and other resources. So -- from the consumer perspective, what happens? You get clickbait. The publishers have to recoup the expenses somehow, and they need you to click through to show you ads, or a paywall. \"This item in your cabinet could kill you!\" Or, they cover the site with ads, hoping to get as much out of the few clicks they get. I am not saying this in support of the CJPA, nor in support of Google. Just saying this is an existential crisis that came from the simple act of aggregation.

    "originLink": "https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/11/hospital_website_data_sharing/",
    "originBody": "Research 9 96% of US hospital websites share visitor info with Meta, Google, data brokers 9 Could have been worse – last time researchers checked it was 98.6% Jessica Lyons Thu 11 Apr 2024 // 15:00 UTC Hospitals – despite being places where people implicitly expect to have their personal details kept private – frequently use tracking technologies on their websites to share user information with Google, Meta, data brokers, and other third parties, according to research published today. Academics at the University of Pennsylvania analyzed a nationally representative sample of 100 non-federal acute care hospitals – essentially traditional hospitals with emergency departments – and their findings were that 96 percent of their websites transmitted user data to third parties. Additionally, not all of these websites even had a privacy policy. And of the 71 percent that did, 56 percent disclosed specific third-party companies that could receive user information. \"It's shocking, and really kind of incomprehensible,\" said Dr Ari Friedman, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who – along with Matthew McCoy, Angela Wu, Sam Burdyl, Yungjee Kim, Noell Kristen Smith, and Rachel Gonzales – authored the paper. \"People have cared about health privacy for a really, really, really long time,\" Friedman noted in an interview with The Register. \"It's very fundamental to human nature. Even if it's information that you would have shared with people, there's still a loss, just an intrinsic loss, when you don't even have control over who you share that information with.\" There's an intrinsic loss when you don't even have control over who you share that information with The researchers' latest work builds on a study they published a year ago of 3,747 US non-federal hospital websites. That found 98.6 percent tracked and transferred visitors' data to large tech and social media companies, advertising firms, and data brokers. To find the trackers on websites, the team checked out each hospitals' homepage on January 26 using webXray, an open source tool that detects third-party HTTP requests and matches them to the organizations receiving the data. They also recorded the number of third-party cookies per page. Who is viewing your data? One name in particular stood out, in terms of who was receiving website visitors' information. \"In every study we've done, in any part of the health system, Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, is on nearly every page, including hospitals,\" Friedman observed. \"From there, it declines,\" he continued. \"Meta was on a little over half of hospital webpages, and the Meta Pixel is notable because it seems to be one of the grabbier entities out there in terms of tracking.\" Both Meta and Google's tracking technologies have been the subject of criminal complaints and lawsuits over the years – as have some healthcare companies that shared data with these and other advertisers. In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of the hospitals share data with Adobe, Friedman noted. \"Everybody knows Adobe for PDFs. My understanding is they also have a tracking division within their ad division.\" Others include telecom and digital marketing companies like The Trade Desk and Verizon, plus tech giants Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon, according to Friedman. Then there's also analytics firms including Hotjar and data brokers such as Acxiom. \"And two thirds of hospital websites had some kind of data transfer to a third-party domain that we couldn't even identify,\" he added. Of the 71 hospital website privacy policies that the team found, 69 addressed the types of user information that was collected. The most common were IP addresses (80 percent), web browser name and version (75 percent), pages visited on the website (73 percent), and the website from which the user arrived (73 percent). Only 56 percent of these policies identified the third-party companies receiving user information. While this puts hospital website visitors at risk of having their data collected and shared with others that they may not want, it also poses a risk to the hospitals themselves, the researchers noted. Hospitals aren't legally required to publish website privacy policies that detail how they collect visitors' data and with whom they share it. But if they do have a privacy policy, they better make sure their processes on deleting personal information upon request, for example, follow the government polices – or they could face the wrath of regulators like the Federal Trade Commission.

US to probe Change Healthcare's data protection standards as lawsuits mount Ignore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your peril \"Websites that collect specific categories of information from certain users may also be subject to other federal and state-specific requirements in terms of data collection and notice,\" the paper warns. \"While the suit against Mass General Brigham and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute was brought under Massachusetts law, plaintiffs have brought similar class action lawsuits in multiple states.\" Mass General Brigham ended up paying an $18.4 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit that alleged the institutions shared personally identifiable information about patients to Facebook, Google, and other companies. A fundamental rethink Of course, the data privacy threat extends beyond hospital websites, as Friedman is quick to point out. \"Why do hospitals have tracking on their webpages?\" he wondered. \"It's not that they're taking kickbacks from Google and Acxiom, data brokers and advertisers and social media companies that sell their patients' data in exchange for money. \"They're doing it because this stuff is ubiquitous across the whole web. They're doing it because there's an entire tens of billions of dollars ad economy.\" While it presents a major challenge for healthcare providers in general and hospitals specifically, it's also an opportunity. \"Many hospitals are academic hospitals and have computer science departments that they could collaborate with, and design new tools and startups, which is something universities are good at doing,\" Friedman noted. \"Build a new web that doesn't involve as much tracking. But in the meantime, and in lieu of any federal data privacy law in the US, protecting personal information falls to the individual. And for that, Friedman recommends browser-based tools Ghostery and Privacy Badger, which identify and block transfers to third-party domains. \"It impacts your browsing experience almost none,\" he explained. \"It's free. And you will be shocked at how much tracking is actually happening, and how much data is actually flowing to third parties.\" ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey Share More about Privacy Research More like these × More about Privacy Research Narrower topics cookies Privacy Sandbox More about Share 9 COMMENTS More about Privacy Research More like these × More about Privacy Research Narrower topics cookies Privacy Sandbox TIP US OFF Send us news",

I use their online site and get my meds mailed to me. It may have been 2 years ago or so, but the process stopped working and wouldn't accept my confirmation after giving my credit card info. I've got a handful of privacy tools on my browser. I finally gave in and temporarily white listed the pharmacy and still cleared out any trackers. Sent the web admin a basic, \"WTF, folks?\" and got a BS non answer. Fast forward to maybe November or December last year. Refill time, and the trackers were even worse. I kind of need my meds though. So I created a new account on my computer, and ordered my meds. Then I filed a complaint of a possible HIPAA violation, starting at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/filing-a-complaint/index.html and was polite, factual, and provided some non hysterical examples of how a prescription could indicate a specific health issue with resulting advertising or PII release to parties not needing it. I received an email at the end of February. I was probably not the only person that sent a complaint, but the end result is that KP is being investigated. Yay. reply m463 7 hours agoparentI went through a similar gauntlet with kaiser as well. This was years ago, but I complained that kaiser had trackers throughout its website for doubleclick and googletagmanager. (nowadays they don't use those domains and go directly to google.com, I assume because people don't block that) I complained. To be clear, the tracking links traverse the entire website - communication with your doctor, test results, prescriptions, even the complaint form I filed out. I got the same sort of non-answers. I pushed and pushed and finally, I did get an answer - \"the website is a convenience\". I blocked the trackers, and pretty soon to continue to use the website, I had to agree to the privacy policy. I didn't agree. I stopped using the website. But they wouldn't let me delete my account. (I think california law allows you to ask.) I called multiple times. I still have an account and get emails from them. reply aAaaArrRgH 2 hours agoparentprevGood, thank you for fighting the good fight.

It very much implies that hospitals are giving data about visitors to the hospital, which would be incredibly egregious. Tracking website visitors is bad, but is something I 100% expect. If others aren't expecting this, that's a serious problem. People should absolutely be warned when it happens (or, better, laws should exist to prevent it from happening). But web visitor tracking is not nearly as sensitive as tracking visitors to the hospitals (or any other health care provider premises) themselves. I avoid the data leakage for sensitive things like health care by never using websites related to those things. I know that people often forget this, but at least in the US, using a website to interact with health care providers is not actually mandatory. reply WaitWaitWha 18 hours agorootparent> I avoid the data leakage for sensitive things like health care by never using websites related to those things. I know that people often forget this, but at least in the US, using a website to interact with health care providers is not actually mandatory. It is not mandatory but is made extremely onerous. I can get on the web site, authenticate while tracked, enter my request, or I can call an automated maze, get repeatedly dropped, talked to a ChatGPT knock-off, get dropped again, and maybe I get a human to answer my request. Then, I get an email asking if I am satisified with the service. reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparentInteresting. I have to admit, I've never had a problem talking to doctor's offices or the hospitals in my area by phone. No onerous phone trees (just a simple initial menu), no voice robots, and usually only a short wait to talk to a human. I need to stop complaining about my hospital. Apparently, this is one area where they're above the grade. But even if my phone experience was like yours, I'd still use the phone instead of the web site due to privacy concerns. In the end, as with all privacy/security issues, there's an inherent tradeoff between convenience and security. Everyone has a different place on that spectrum where they're most comfortable. But at least we can choose how much of a tradeoff we're willing to engage in. reply malisper 19 hours agoparentprevWebsite visitor information is still really sensitive.

My point was you are very cavalier about how easy it is for people avoid what is structurally difficult to avoid.

The major problem is when people start accepting this as acceptable behavior.

However, in some cases, tracking technologies on unauthenticated webpages may have access to PHI, in which case the HIPAA Rules apply to the regulated entities’ use of tracking technologies and disclosures to the tracking technology vendors. Regulated entities are required to “[e]nsure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all electronic PHI the [regulated entity] creates, receives, maintains, or transmits.” Thus, regulated entities that are considering the use of online tracking technologies should consider whether any PHI will be transmitted to a tracking technology vendor, and take appropriate steps consistent with the HIPAA Rules. reply xxs 20 hours agoparentprevof course not - only visited pages, time spent on them, stuff like that. reply ldayley 20 hours agorootparentLike when you visit “cancer patient support resources” and read for a while… reply TheNewsIsHere 20 hours agorootparentprevThat greatly depends on implementation.

BY ANTHONY WOOD UPDATED: APR 12, 2024 11:50 AM POSTED: APR 12, 2024 11:42 AM Police in Japan have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of selling illegally modified Pokémon save data to customers online — a practice which is banned under the country’s 2019 Unfair Competition Prevention Act. As reported by the Japanese website NHK News, and translated by Automaton, the suspect was apprehended by police on April 9 after a ‘police cyber patrol’ discovered evidence that the individual had used special tools to illegally modify save data for Pokémon Violet in order to change Pokémon move sets.A 36-year-old man was arrest for selling illegally modified Pokemon save data. The 36-year-old allegedly took custom orders for rare Pokémon, and sold the resulting tampered data between December 2022 to March 2023, for up to 13,000 yen ($84) a time on a website that served as a marketplace for video game assets and items. He also offered deals in which six Pokémon would be created for the equivalent of roughly $30 in yen. Pokemon Face-Off: Which Pocket Monster Is the Very Best? Pick a winner New duel 1ST 2ND 3RD SEE YOUR RESULTS Finish playing for your personal results or see the community’s! The 36-year-old has reportedly admitted to committing the crimes at the heart of the ongoing investigation, while providing the justification that he did it to earn a living. According to Automaton, the suspect could face up to five years imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to 5 million yen (over $32,600). This isn’t the first time that criminals have sought to make money off of Game Freak’s wildly popular franchise. For example, In 2021 an ill-fated Pokemon card heist saw one desperate man attempt to descend from a six-story building in order to steal a treasure trove of trading cards and cash from a Tokyo store. 2022 saw the trend continue, with criminals in Tokyo committing a series of high-value Pokemon burglaries, including one instance in which theives made off with a haul of cards worth over $60,000. Its worth noting that the raw last for Pokemon — and the trouble it can land you in — is felt well beyond the criminal fraternity. As a case in point January 2022 saw two Los Angeles police officers fired after they ignored a call to attend a burglary in order to chase down a Snorlax in Pokemon Go.

It still implies that the modification itself was illegal. reply zamadatix 8 hours agorootparentThe law may seem silly/not worthwhile but at least it gives perspective there is a law saying selling modified things in a way that might make competition unfair is explicitly illegal instead of someone just deciding save edits are bad and something worth arresting for in a vacuum. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparentBut the law is about business competition. So how is that competition becoming unfair? Just naming this law without a lot more explanation does pretty much nothing for perspective. reply anigbrowl 7 hours agorootparentFair competition: you sell a game or other diversion that's better than mine and people like it so much I'm forced to go back to the drawing board Unfair competition: you make money out of sabotaging the perfectly good game I wrote, reducing the enjoyment for players who don't cheat reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparentUnless I do both of those at the same time, I don't see how the latter involves \"competition\". reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentThe competition is mostly from the \"make money by\" part. That's money from what used to be a sole company's asset now going to 2 places rather than 1. E.g. before I could leverage the rarity aspect of the gameplay & IP however I desired (including keeping it as part of making a time investment into the product if I thought that was more valuable in the long run) but now you're selling an alternative version of the experience to people and I have to compete with getting any pokemon and stats instantly from someone else for $x when it comes to extracting the value from the IP asset with the protected saves. I'm not saying this is a great stance, just showing how it is seen as competition in the second scenario alone. reply jojobas 2 hours agorootparentThat sounds like bullshit. You still have to buy the original product (game) to use this other thing (modified save). I guess unless the original vendor also sells something to that effect, like pay to win. I hope modifying the save file for yourself is not illegal still.

It makes me angry and bums me out. For me, grinding 98% of the time is not enjoyable. Game are definitely better than what they once were, but let me cheat on single player games. I get it game developers, the play time will be shorter I'm fine with that. And game devs if you don't want to add cheats then add a bunch of accessibility controls because those things are just as good as cheats. Also just let me temporarily turn off encounters.

Looking at you Yakuza franchise. reply zamadatix 7 hours agorootparentprevThe perspective is seeing the law explicitly says said activity is unfair and illegal independent of whether one's ideology agrees said law is reasonable or should exist. E.g. if there was a 2022 law calling for arrest of those holding ice cream cones upside down because of risk to the sidewalk cleanliness then knowing that gives perspective to why someone was arrested for holding an ice cream cone upside down beyond just a random arrest decision for something one thinks everyone would consider harmless. That doesn't mean it convinces you personally that the law is reasonable and, just that it was indeed an explicitly illegal activity. reply jjmarr 4 hours agorootparentThis is a conclusory argument since it doesn't explain why this particular alleged act of selling video game saves is illegal. https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85973/how-to-address... I'd like to know whether this Japanese law explicitly says \"selling video game save data is illegal\" (seems less likely) or if there is an interpretation of the Unfair Competition Act that the alleged facts constitute counterfeiting or something. https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/2803/e... I'm not a lawyer so I'm not an expert on the Japanese legal system but merely asserting that the law bans a specific act isn't helpful because it doesn't explain how. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparentprev> The perspective is seeing the law explicitly says said activity is unfair and illegal independent of whether one's ideology agrees said law is reasonable or should exist. It still needs an explanation because at a surface level the crime and the name of the law have nothing to do with each other. Until that explanation exists of how the law says it's illegal, I don't have the perspective of seeing the law explicitly say that! I am not even in the realm of talking about whether the law makes sense. reply zamadatix 7 hours agorootparentThe name of the law is neither here nor there in the end (most laws have useless names really) and you don't have to possess an explanation of why it's covered under that law to be given the perspective that it is. On that front though, and following the link to the body of the law, a shortened version might be: The saves are encrypted and proprietary. As a result modifying them to get rare items runs afoul into the \"trade secrets\" verbiage. Selling work based on such trade secrets then falls under the unfair competition definition and is what results in said penalties. My stab at the likely background reasoning for having these rules (i.e. not explicitly written into the law but rather why the law might have been made) is something along the lines that the guy made money off of devaluing the rarity of IP the company was supposed to have control of distributing through their proprietary means. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentIt's still pretty important to me to understand some of the mechanism. What it takes to not break the law. Some potential reasonings are much more sensible than others, and the overall consequences differ. reply SllX 5 hours agorootparentI kind of wanted an explanation too so I looked up the law, but to be honest it’s dense and beyond me. [1] It reads like an anti-circumvention law to me, but I’m not clear on what specifically in there would make it applicable to modified video game save data unless you can argue that modifying save data is a wrongful way to acquire to a particular game state. [1] https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629 reply VS1999 8 hours agorootparentprevThe selling part is more important than the modification part because the law he broke specifically references selling or renting. reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentprevYes. It changes it entirely. Obviously? Selling or otherwise distributing was illegal, or using hacked data with an on-line service, not merely hacking your own property. reply anigbrowl 8 hours agorootparentprevIt does not. Selling your cheat mod is fundamentally different from playing around with it on your own workbench. reply bottled_poe 8 hours agorootparentprevSeems like fraud would be a more likely charge. reply qwerty456127 8 hours agorootparentprevWould it be perfectly legal anywhere else? To me this just sounds like the Japanese police has ran out of real crimes to solve and feels more serious about enforcing the EULAs which almost always banned tampering with proprietary programs data. Perhaps it's time to honor (because they apparently have done a great job of eliminating crime) them and then defund them for sake of avoiding the dystopia coming, fund something more relevant to the Japanese society problems instead, e.g. affordable housing projects, more paid leave/sickdays or whatever. reply justinclift 6 hours agorootparent> affordable housing projects Of all the examples to pick ;) that one's super wrong for Japan. Unlike many other countries, Japanese houses aren't treated as an investment. So they don't have widely unaffordable housing, unlike what's happening elsewhere.

Nevertheless, let me mention a relevant fun fact: I even remember there was a research paper (or maybe a non-academic experiment somewhere on Reddit or so, I fail to recall for sure) which says postulating something wrong publicly is way more efficient than asking a question - much more people rush to emerge passionately addressing all the flaws of your opinion in details and with references than when you ask. reply Izkata 2 hours agorootparentCunningham's Law: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law reply qwerty456127 2 hours agorootparentThanks. reply qwerty456127 5 hours agorootparentprevI didn't mean to, this is just the way I gratefully accept interesting critique :-) reply Anon1096 8 hours agorootparentprevWow I don't think I've ever seen such an America-centric comment in all my time reading here.

Because that's sort of a figurative expression. Housing problem is just a random pick relatively relevant to the most of the developed countries. Pick any other problem which could use some additional resources allocated instead if it's not the case for Japan. It probably still has some, hasn't it? reply ajmurmann 7 hours agorootparentJapan has avoided much of the housing issues we have in much in the western world, and in the English-speaking world in particular. Some factors in this is that construction is much more by-right, has sensible zoning, excludes a gnarly community process and is planned centrally instead locally which in combination avoids all issues with NIMBYs and results in a good housing supply. A great article on zoning to get started on this: https://devonzuegel.com/north-american-vs-japanese-zoning reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentJapan is a very different country than most think it is. Most seem to remember the Japan of the past when they were a technological and economic giant, set to imminently become the largest global economy. Japan today has been through 30 years of recession/stagflation. Their economy was larger 30 years ago than it is today. [1] On top of a dysfunctional economy, they also are going through severe demographic collapse. The population of Japan has decreased by more than 5 million people since 2010 [2], and that decline is accelerating. Even the population of places like Tokyo are decreasing. As a result of these factors, Japan now has an economy closer to a developing nation than the economic superpower many of us remember. Their GDP/capita is $33,000, and average monthly wages (for workers only) is now $1900 [3], for an average annual salary of $22,800. And all of of this combines to create a direct path to really affordable housing, at least so long as you aren't living off of Japanese wages.

Isn't the term \"affordable housing\" meant as \"affordable by local residents\"? Otherwise most of the world has affordable housing, at least so long as you are living off SF wages. reply qwerty456127 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy is there a demographic collapse if housing is easily affordable? Most of my friends here in the EU allocate the biggest chunk of their salary to paying rent for single-bedroom apartments, I don't dare to imagine what a horror would it be to live in one as a family with children, having no individual room for yourself and no individual rooms for them. I am fortunate to have an extra room but having kids still means giving up my home office room turning it into children bedroom. Isn't this a major factor in making decisions about whether or not to reproduce? reply somenameforme 2 hours agorootparentThere's a lot of hypotheses, but most seem to fail across one domain or another. The only I've seen consistently explains collapsing fertility across all contexts is consumerism. The modern world has introduced a completely ridiculous level of advertising everywhere. And this has really driven a boom in consumerism everywhere. What room is there for family in a world where making and consuming Product is gradually becoming the entire point in life? Children greatly constrain your time meaning less time for making Product, and also are a substantial cost themselves (above and beyond the reduction in time) meaning less ability to consume Product. So for instance this cleanly explains the Western income to fertility curve. In particular people who are poor have far more children than those who are middle to upper income, but then once you reach the ultra wealthy then we're back to having lots of children again. Both the top in bottom are unable to participate in the Product chasing game for different reasons. The bottom are unable to afford to do so, while the top have so much money than no carrot is ever out of their reach, so they must look elsewhere for meaning and purpose. It also explains the religion to fertility correlation. Religion not only provides a meaning and purpose in lieu of the almighty Product, but of course itself also tends to focus heavily on fertility and family. It also explains why nearly all modern correlations with regards to fertility simply completely fail when you look at the past where people of all income levels, education, and religious values were having lots of children. It's because consumerism, and its driving force of never-ending advertisement, had yet to really take much of any grip on the world. reply kmeisthax 4 hours agorootparentprevSexism. Japanese women have to pick between their career and having a family, so they pick the former. There's a lot of old men running Japan that won't hire married women or expect women who get married to leave the workforce. Korea, which has even worse demographic problems than Japan, also has significantly worse sexism in ways I'd have to link you to a three-part Moon Channel YouTube video essay to even scratch the surface of. Immigration is also a factor: getting permanent residency in Japan is a pain in the ass. America doesn't even notice its declining birth rate because everyone wants to move here and we let them in. reply somenameforme 2 hours agorootparentAmerica doesn't notice its declining birth rate because it's relatively recent. Japan's birth rate collapsed about 40 years ago. [1] By contrast the US' decline is only trending towards dangerous levels quite recently. The graph in the link includes both the US and Japan and is quite enlightening! Fertility is an extremely lagging indicator, which is why places like Japan (and soon South Korea) are essentially mirrors into the future that awaits the West at large as well, if things don't change. Immigration isn't a solution. Japan is losing about 0.5% of their population per year - including immigration, and that rate is accelerating. It's unclear where their equilibrium point will be, other than substantially worse than that. In the US at even \"just\" a 1% annual decline, you'd need 3.3 million migrants per year, forever, to maintain population levels. And you don't want random uneducated individuals who don't even speak the language, or you risk destroying the very thing that motivates people to want to migrate. You want skilled, educated, English speaking individuals who are capable of and motivated to work. For some contrast in 2022 we admitted a total of about a million people, and only 270,284 of them were for employment. [2] [1] - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?contextu...

Japanese women have to pick between their career and having a family, so they pick the former. The same is often said about western countries but by contrary attributed to non-sexism.

This breaks anothse stereotype in me.

Thank you for sharing this knowledge. reply Barrin92 5 hours agorootparentprev> if housing is so affordable in Japan, why are there still people who don't own homes? You literally have it the wrong way around. There's less incentive to own homes in countries where housing prices fall. Owning a home actually costs you money, it isn't a good investment in the absence of artificial scarcity. In Japan a house is a consumer good like a car, in fact on average the value of most houses drops to about zero in 30-40 years. Some of the richest countries in the world have the lowest rates of personal home ownership, Switzerland, Germany, Japan among them because it isn't an investment vehicle and rent protections are good. This narrative of being desperate to own a home just doesn't make any sense. reply qwerty456127 5 hours agorootparentI consider the value of owning a house is being free from having to pay rent rather than to gain on the investment. The fact a house is considered an investment (in full meaning of the term so once you own it you worry when its price falls) means it's not really affordable. reply leereeves 6 hours agorootparentprevIf housing isn't a problem in Japan, why do they still have pod/capsule hotels and apartments? reply solidsnack9000 6 hours agorootparentI think you are reading the situation backwards. Capsule hotels and tiny apartments are not a reflection of low housing supply, they are a reflection of not having much space -- and there is not much space because so many people want to be in a certain area, basically the very dense urban centers. There is really nothing the market can do, to make more big houses and big hotel rooms available in downtown Tokyo, but the market in Japan is actually getting a huge number of people fairly cheap stays in very dense areas and doing so much more successfully than in the USA. I don't think there are any capsule apartments, with multiple people living together in tubes in the wall, but there are very small apartments. reply ajmurmann 6 hours agorootparentprevBecause those things are not a problem for everyone and a reasonable tradeoff.

In many countries it is illegal to sell these unless you have a pharmacist's license. It's not illegal to buy them, because you can buy them from a legal seller. This case is very similar in the asymmetry between buying and selling. You get the save game by buying the game and playing the game. That's not illegal. It's also not illegal to tamper with your own save game (if I understand other comments on this article correctly). What is illegal is to sell a save that you have tampered with.[1] From a legal perspective it's perfectly possible to ban the sale of something without banning the purchase, just like certain things are illegal to sell or buy but not illegal to have.[2] [1] You may well say it's crazy that this is the case, but I could sort of see both sides of this. I do think cheating in competitive multiplayer games really ruins things for other players so I could see the argument for banning anything that does that. In singleplayer games my view is \"do whatever you think is fun for you\" but that's just a personal perspective. My understanding is people play Pokemon against each other so you could say that cheating with a modified save harms others. I'm not sure that's important enough to justify a law but it's really not my business to say. [2] Famous example - if you go to the Moma there is an artwork by Robert Rauschenberg that was the centre of a famous tax lawsuit for this exact reason. The artwork itself is basically a painting, but one of the things that Rauschenberg did was sort of alter paintings by sticking sculptural elements on to them and this particular one includes a dead and stuffed bald eagle. Now this was not illegal at the time, but when the bald eagle became endangered, the sale of anything that included any part of a bald eagle became illegal. So this artwork can never be sold. When Rauschenberg died, the IRS went after his estate for tax on this painting which they valued at $29million. However his family said the value of the painting was zero because it can never be legally sold (even though it's not illegal for them to own it). https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/arts/design/a-catch-22-of... reply kube-system 7 hours agorootparentprevThere are practical differences between the two.

There was a company that tried selling modified (I.e. censored) versions of Hollywood films. They lost. Copyright infringement. There was also a second attempt where people would mail in their disks, and receive an edited version back. Again, lost. So, whether we like it or not, nope. That’s not how things work, because any editing creates a “derivative work” in the eyes of the law, and only the copyright owner is allowed to make such derivative works.

CleanFlix was sued because they were editing and distributing movies without studio permission, but a competing product called ClearPlay, which was a specialized DVD player that you would plug a flash drive into, and censorship was then overlayed.

Not a good argument against. It would be interesting if they had 1) distributed a program that automatically edits the user's copy, or 2) edited VHS tapes that customers sent in by physically splicing them. I'm pretty sure the first should be legal, but I'm curious what they'd make of the second. reply tombert 8 hours agorootparentThat’s not completely different than how Clearplay worked.

All these verbs relate to some sort of commercial transaction, rather than the modification per se.

Everyone wants to be Hollywood or the NFL, and esports are their route to that kind of international renowned, or so they think. Thus, they have a bunch of laws to make sure nothing crops up that could impact that. Pokemon isn't an esport, but if you're 80, you don't know that. reply anigbrowl 7 hours agorootparentThat's an absurd caricature; just checking in on TV news would have informed you that Japan's legislature has a fairly broad age distribution. Video games have been huge in Japan since the 1970s, and mechanical gambling games like pachinko well before that. I suspect most legislators have had household exposure to videogames, and any under 60 probably played growing up. Likewise Japan went wild for digital cellphones well before smartphones; there's a whole genre of literature called 'text message novels' that started in the early 2000s. As for this case, the prohibition on selling mod tools/services is certainly to protect the game manufacturers; if there's a perception that it's easy and safe to cheat in the game then players' incentive to spend (whether via microtransactions or future releases) goes way down, and so does the publisher's revenue, and so do tax receipts.

By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Apr 12, 2024, 6:39 PM UTC Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Microsoft says it’s starting to test ads inside the Start menu on Windows 11. The software maker will use the Recommended section of the Start menu, which usually shows file recommendations, to suggest apps from the Microsoft Store. “This will appear only for Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel in the US and will not apply to commercial devices (devices managed by organizations),” says Microsoft in a blog post. The app promotions can be disabled in the Settings section of Windows 11, but it appears that Microsoft will enable these by default. Microsoft is seeking feedback on the changes, so it’s possible the company could decide to ditch these ads in development builds of Windows 11 if there’s enough feedback that suggests they’re not going to be a popular addition. The ad is the one Microsoft highlighted with a red box. Image: Microsoft Microsoft started testing ads inside the File Explorer of Windows 11 last year before disabling the experiment in beta versions of Windows 11. Microsoft has been experimenting with ads inside Windows for more than 10 years. There are already promotional spots on the Windows 10 lock screen and in the Start menu, so it’s not exactly surprising to see them appear in Windows 11, too. Now, it’s up to Windows testers to file feedback on these changes to see whether Microsoft might be forced to not include these ads on shipping versions of Windows 11.

But this framing is pretty negative. These apps broke and started crashing because they were updating the start menu. Probably related to the addition of ads. Then they blocked these versions because they were crashing. It doesn't seem like they are making any effort to block versions that don't cause crashes. (Other than maybe making it a bit harder to keep updating to new internal APIs) It really doesn't seem like they are purposely breaking these tools so that more people see the ads. It is probably such a tiny market that they don't care at this point. They'll definitely ship the ads to 99.9% of users first before they worry about this unaddressed market. reply jsheard 8 hours agorootparent> It doesn't seem like they are making any effort to block versions that don't cause crashes. See the Tweet I linked, Windows does have a mechanism to only block a specific range of version numbers that are known to cause issues, and they have used that on StartIsBack/StartAllBack before, but the most recent Windows build simply blocks StartAllBack*.exe without any bounds on the version. The developer can get around the block by changing the filenames of course but that's not really the point, if Microsoft is being actively hostile towards this kind of customisation now then they're just going to keep breaking it on purpose. reply TehCorwiz 5 hours agorootparentI dislike this change as much as most people here. However, I do see a situation where it could be warranted. They might simply block all versions because there aren't any version that are actually compatible yet, and once there are it'll get updated. That of course presumes they'll continue treating StartAllBack as they have been so far. reply aequitas 3 hours agorootparentInnocent until proven guilty. Why block future versions where the developer has fixed issues. Not a user has to wait for the developer to fix the issue and for Microsoft to update their blocklist. It’s hostile behavior that doesn’t make sense unless you want to push users away from these apps. They probably consider any start menu that doesn’t carry their ads as “broken”. reply woranl 9 hours agoprev\"The problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste.

Just Say No. Windows leadership recently changed for the better. Hopefully these misguided ads are a vestige of the outgoing leader, who previously lead consumer advertising, but has now been pushed out. Microsoft has a once-in-a-generation opportunity with Arm laptops based on Qualcomm/Nuvia (ex-Apple), this is not the time to squander that opportunity with distractions like advertising. https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114362/microsoft-window... After Windows and Surface chief Panos Panay departed Microsoft last year, the software giant quickly split his two divisions into two different teams. It was a move designed to push Windows engineers to focus on more web and AI features under Mikhail Parakhin, who was previously responsible for Bing and ads. It didn’t work out. Six months after that shake-up, Windows and Surface are back together under a new leader, following frustrations from the very top of Microsoft.. Parakhin was responsible for Microsoft’s reborn advertising business and all of the company’s ad-based consumer businesses.. the web experiences team that Parakhin led had a different culture from the rest of Microsoft that often resulted in micromanaging and “insane deadlines” for projects.. The Windows and Web Experiences (WWE) team that Parakhin briefly oversaw also developed the malware-like Bing pop-ups we’ve seen appear in Windows recently.. The new Windows and Surface chief, Davuluri, is experienced when it comes to the combination of hardware and software that Microsoft needs to get right in this new era of AI. Davuluri has worked at Microsoft for more than 23 years and has been at the heart of Surface engineering. He was deeply involved in the company’s work with Qualcomm and AMD to create custom Surface processors. reply kevincox 8 hours agoparentLOL \"Yes we love the ads\" said no user ever. If they had any intention of listening to user feedback they never would have started this project because the feedback is obviously going to be negative.

MS has been pushing ads on Windows over at least 10 years. And in fact this is a pretty natural move for the product in the saturated market. You're not going to \"grow\" anymore by traditional user acquisition and failed to enter the mobile market, then you need to build a new segment. This environment gives a strong incentive toward ads-based business model for the Windows division. There likely is an army of PM desperately looking for new growth opportunities and decided to put ads everywhere since this is a so obvious strategy with low risk, high ROI.

I looked into it, and what a maintenance nightmare. One guy on youtube had a battery fail under warranty and they sent him a whole new one, and told him to just recycle the old one; apparently even Microsoft doesn't want to repair them. They keyboard/trackpad panel is alcantara, and is glued to the bottom cover (or was until the batteries swelled). I had to cut and pry this later off. But even then, the connector for the battery requires you to remove basically all the components (speakers, heatsinks, fans, wifi card, a bunch of RF shielding that is micro-spot welded in place, the display, the motherboard. The battery connector is a pad that the back of the motherboard has contacts that mate to it. I told my in-laws that there was a better than even chance that I'd destroy it while doing the repair, and I'd give it a shot, but they should be prepared to buy a new one. They were ready to go buy one instead of me doing the repair, but I told them I was happy to do it and went ahead and was able to get'r'done. I guess some of that is the price of it being so thin and light. My MIL got it because she's kind of frail and wanted something super light. Which it definitely is. It's a marvel of engineering.

But there’s precedent and everyone seems fine with this UX on iOS. reply mikl 6 hours agoparentAd? Unless you’re seeing something other than what I’m seeing, that’s just a search result from the app store. Apple is not charging the app owner for that. And if you don’t want the search (aka Spotlight) to suggest apps from the App Store, you can disable that in Settings -> Siri & Search -> Content from Apple. reply TiredOfLife 1 hour agoparentprevNext you will tell that settings on iOS devices are full of ads for subscription services like music or apple news. reply stefandesu 7 hours agoparentprevI don't get these.

A quick search right now didn't bring up anything I could endorse to a normie. reply kweingar 8 hours agoparentIt depends on the use case. Linux often works well on desktop computers without too many fancy peripherals, but I generally do not recommend Linux as a laptop OS for “normies.” I have installed various flavors of Linux on various laptops over the years, and 100% of the time there were tough-to-diagnose issues with hardware components. With one laptop, the brightness level could not be changed. With another, installing Linux caused the battery to drain three times as fast and hibernation didn’t work properly. With another, I accidentally played music so loud that the speakers broke. These are all things that I was able to figure out using my Google skills and general knowledge of Linux, but it is not an experience I’d recommend for a “regular person.” reply tombert 8 hours agorootparentI dunno, I had pretty good luck with Ubuntu on my previous laptop. I do not remember the model number but it was an Asus ROG Strix, with an AMD processor and graphics card.

Vertical integration! reply LoganDark 5 hours agorootparentprev> It's amazing windows can do what it does on virtually -any- hardware. Not disagreeing, but I think one of the major defining factors behind this is that most OEMs specifically design their hardware and drivers to work with Windows first. If they did the same for Linux instead, suddenly Linux would start to work with everything. Because having each individual piece of hardware support Linux has a much higher success rate than hoping an incomplete sweep over the available hardware by Linux will have covered everything that makes up a particular machine reply 65 8 hours agoparentprevLinux Mint https://linuxmint.com/ reply comeonbro 8 hours agorootparentYeah, I was surprised by that for the top recommendation on every \"beginners linux\" search.

It's really quite snappy. I did it mainly out of curiosity. It was easy to install and bring up for the first time, and it's not loaded with crapware. For a lot of home users, a \"the browser is the new OS.\" If they're doing everything with cloud apps, then they really don't need to interact with a conventional desktop very much. Assuming they don't run Windows software such as games. Battery life is no different than it was with Windows. Linux mode was easy to set up, and hard for me to damage. ;-) And it doesn't seem to do anything to the Chrome OS machine, so you can wipe it and start over without re-installing the entire machine. Jupyter Notebook runs just fine, so I'm pretty much all set. Jupyter is practically my OS these days. reply genewitch 8 hours agoparentprevSiblings may not understand the question; or, more likely, there isn't an answer. I have \"fixed\" people's old computers all my life, and for the past 15 years or so i've been doing it by installing linux or giving them an RPi. RPi isn't doable anymore, for $100 or whatever they cost now you can get a used elitedesk or something that's 3 times better in nearly every metric. I also prefer the maintenance load of a debian derived OS when i'm the person they call with issues. But to answer, my go to is either xubuntu or lubuntu for windows users, and kubuntu or mint for everyone else. Xubuntu first and lubuntu if for some reason Xubuntu wants to play stupid games (such as on elitedesks). There is some personal preference as to what makes a good \"landing page\", i think xubuntu's is a little better but they're both good (x and l ubuntus). Compare that to windows.com landing page, to contrast. But your average windows user isn't googling \"which linux should i get\" because generally they've never heard of or do not understand what \"linux\" is. they're googling \"how do i fix windows\" - and getting back \"how to fix drafty windows\" from a search engine powered by linux. It takes evangelizing, and sometimes straight chaotic good \"i'll fix your PC\" and installing linux on it. There goes 99.5% of all \"normal\" user problems! I've been using the *nix and linux since the mid 90s, and i still don't recommend anyone try it unless they're willing to sit on their PC and learn things. Sorry, not sorry. For the facebook/gmail/cnn/twitter browsers of the world, the three i listed above are just fine. edited to add: it's a pity that WUBI is no more (last i knew, at least) - that would be how i would evangelize it for people that had mostly empty windows machines just for browsing the web and maybe some cute games (samegame for instance). reply paxys 8 hours agoprevThe article calls them ads but in the linked blog post Microsoft only calls them \"recommended apps\".

Its declarative nature is so much easier to work with, and doing the tmpfs as root trick makes it more fun to experiment with the knowledge that you won’t break anything that can’t be fixed with a reboot.

It confuses me because how is that different or better than pacman -S or apt install or emerge -va? Especially portage?! reply tombert 7 hours agorootparentThat particular command isn’t really different than pacman or apt. Most of the time, though, with Nix, you don’t install stuff that way. In Nixos, there’s a configuration.nix file, and you add the package you want to to that file (along with all the other system configs). Then you effectively “rebuild” the OS based on that configuration, and a snapshot is created. Since this configuration is just text, it can be version controlled and backed up to GitHub or something. If your hard drive crashes or something, you can reinstall Nixos from the config in like fifteen minutes. If you just need the program temporarily, you can do “nix-shell -p neovim”, which will create a temporary shell where neon can be executed. Once you exit the shell, the binary is unlinked and will be eventually garbage collected. There’s more, but the tl;dr is that can make stuff a lot more declarative while also allowing for stuff to be more ephemeral. reply underseacables 9 hours agoprevLinux Mint Cinnamon is a fine alternative to Windows, and it's free, combining a slick interface with familiarity for any windows user. reply Loughla 9 hours agoparentMint is the easiest to transition to.

    "originBody": "Written by Jamie Tanna on April 12, 2024 CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 Apache-2.0 10 mins Why I recommend Renovate over any other dependency update tools Table of Contents If you've read my blog before, or interacted with me at work or in the Open Source world, you're likely to know that I'm a huge fan of Renovate. For those that aren't aware, Renovate is one of the big players in dependency updating tooling, commonly seen in comparisons with Dependabot or Snyk. I've been using Renovate for the last ~5 years, alongside a mix of Dependabot and Snyk to keep me grounded. I absolutely love Renovate, and make a point of making it so I can run Renovate where possible. I've also had the experience operating Renovate in self-hosted mode as well as used the hosted Renovate app by Mend and the Mend Enterprise SAAS, and plan to blog about the lessons learned self-hosting Renovate. Renovate has some really key features that set it apart from the competition, and I'm sure in the time it's taken me to write this, they've shipped some new ones 😻 (Aside: I'm largely writing this blog post now, as I've recently been shouting the benefits of Renovate, and instead of writing another internal-only document at work (as I did at Deliveroo), I wanted to write it as a form of blogumentation). Prior art A few years back, I wrote about some tips for using Renovate to make keeping your software up-to-date easier, which I still stand by. Since then, I've worked across a number of different ecosystems, repository sizes, and levels of comfort merging dependency updates, and have learned a few more things about effectively using Renovate - but through it, I'm still very sure of Renovate being the best tool in the ecosystem. Configurability Renovate is extremely configurable, with dozens of configuration options to tune your experience. But Renovate doesn't end up being \"too\" configurable, where you end up spending more time tweaking config than doing the changes, but configurable enough that it's very likely you can do what you need to with it. Centralised, shareable presets This is something that really hit me when we were rolling out Dependabot at Deliveroo, where my team owned ~30 repositories, and so for each of these repos, we needed to hand-craft a dependabot.yml, as Dependabot needs to be told which directories contain which dependencies, and how often to update them. After we'd had about a week of usage, we started needing to tweak the configuration in a few of them to reduce the noise, which then required us to raise PRs across all the repos and get them updated. Because Dependabot requires a bit of a snowflake configuration per repository, this wasn't easily automatable, even with great tools available to automate some of the bulk updates, which made this a rather onerous and frustrating process. Compare this to Renovate, where there's an excellent first-class support for shareable config presets, in which you can \"extend\" multiple configuration(s). This allows a team that wants to have consistency (i.e. in how often they receive updates to the AWS and Google Cloud SDKs, or which labels they want on PRs) to create a shared preset for their team that defines this. Then, each of their repositories can \"extend\" this configuration, as well as defining their own configuration on top of it at a repo-specific level. This also makes it possible to provide good guardrails for your organisation, providing a good set of defaults, such as a base.json: { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"postUpdateOptions\": [ \"gomodTidy\", \"gomodUpdateImportPaths\" ], \"regexManagers\": [ { \"fileMatch\": [ \"^Makefile$\" ], \"matchStrings\": [ \"curl .*https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.shsh -s -- .* (?.*?)\\\" ], \"depNameTemplate\": \"github.com/golangci/golangci-lint\", \"datasourceTemplate\": \"go\" } ] } This then allows defining a somewhat opinionated good starting point for teams with a default.json: { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"extends\": [ \"local>your-org-here/renovate-config:base\", \"config:best-practices\" ] } Then, teams only need to set the following in their repos' renovate.json, and they'll have the benefits of onboarding with a lot of the hard work done with starting: { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"extends\": [ \"local>your-org-here/renovate-config\" ] } And that's it 👏 Good defaults Linking back to the comment about having to hand-craft dependabot.ymls, the great thing about Renovate is that there's some great defaults, and that it can autodetect the ecosystems your repo uses, and appropriately raises PRs. This ease of onboarding is truly excellent, and you can even have an onboarding PR raised to your repos to make it even simpler. For instance, at Deliveroo, we made it so there was a default set of configuration for all repos to give us an easy means to update Docker images, but then if teams wanted to manage everything, they could add a renovate.json, and it'd be more fully featured. Additionally, Renovate comes with some great inbuilt configuration in the form of presets, including a \"best practices\" guide and associated preset, which makes it easier to keep on top of community best practices, without needing to bikeshed about what you think is best. If you find that config:best-practices is a little too much, there's config:recommended as a starting point, and you can always downgrade or exclude rules you'd prefer not to follow. Or if you really want to control things config:base is the minimum you should pull in. Grouping As suggested above, it's possible to tune how different packages get updated, where you can group multiple updates into a single PR. For instance, let's say that you use 9 different AWS services in your application, and instead of receiving 9 PRs every time there are updates across the SDKs, you want a single one. In this case, you could craft the following Renovate configuration: { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"packageRules\": [ { \"groupName\": \"aws-sdk-go\", \"matchPackagePatterns\": [\"^github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2\" ] } ] } What's great about this is that you can also bundle things like all patch updates into a single PR: { \"packageRules\": [ { \"matchPackagePatterns\": [ \"*\" ], \"matchUpdateTypes\": [ \"patch\" ], \"groupName\": \"all patch dependencies\", \"groupSlug\": \"all-patch\" } ] } This is something that's recently been added to Dependabot, which is great, cause Renovate's had it for years 😝 Use for one-off bumps Because Renovate is an Open Source tool you can run on the command-line, it means you can also get the ability to use Renovate for one-off executions, for instance to get everyone in your organisation to a minimum version of a given dependency, or just to do an infrequently performed set of updates. Supports more than other tools Something I always refer back to is the fact that Renovate has a tonne of supported package managers, package ecosystems and versioning tools. Renovate's bot comparison guide docs has a good example which links out to the differences between: What platforms Renovate supports What platforms Dependabot supports As Dependabot is more focussed on being used on GitHub's platforms (citation needed?) support for things like CircleCI, GitLab CI or other competitors' tooling doesn't seem to be available. Adding support for additional ecosystems One of the things you'll be used to having from your dependency update tool of choice is your standard package manager support, where it'll update a go.mod or a pom.xml in your repositories. But one thing that's quite important to understand is that there are many more dependencies in your project than those installed in your package manager. Something I find great about Renovate is that, as well as managing Dockerfiles, build.gradles, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc, it will also manage things your .ruby-version or configuration for the ASDF version manager. But what about some of the non-standard, or organisation-specific means for tracking versions? For instance, installing the golangci-lint linting tool recommends using curlsh: $(GOBIN)/golangci-lint:curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.shsh -s -- -b $(GOBIN) v1.57.2 And it's common for Dockerfiles to have a definition of the version of dependencies: ARG MONGODB_VERSION=6.0.4 Or what if you have a custom deployment configuration like: # this is an (imaginary) company specific deployment configuration file application: lb: image: uk-tooling/load-balancer@v3.0.0 It's very unlikely that you have these supported by other tools out-of-the-box, and Renovate is the same. But Renovate does give you the ability to manage these versions yourself. Using Renovate's custom managers we can craft a configuration file such as: { \"$schema\": \"https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json\", \"regexManagers\": [ { \"fileMatch\": [ \"^Makefile$\" ], \"matchStrings\": [ \"curl .*https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.shsh -s -- .* (?.*?)\\\" ], \"depNameTemplate\": \"github.com/golangci/golangci-lint\", \"datasourceTemplate\": \"go\" } ] } And this will allow us to manage the golangci-lint installation. Ideally, this sort of configuration may make it upstream so Renovate can do it out-of-the-box, but as we can see from the above example, there may be things that are organisation- or repo-specific, and so having it upstream'd doesn't make sense. Because you can do more with it And you can do even more with it - I've mentioned you can use it for one-off updates on the command-line, but for instance I've also written a tool renovate-graph which takes the detected dependency data from Renovate and gives you a JSON blob you can consume. This underpins a large swathe of the power behind dependency-management-data and can be used for other means, such as converting Renovate data exports to a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). Dependency Dashboard One thing I love about Renovate is that you can enable the Dependency Dashboard, which gives you an overview of the detected dependencies, open PRs, as well s anything that may be waiting, or has failed to update. This is a hugely useful insight into the at-a-glance how far behind are we on updates, giving a view of whether you maybe want to spend a bit more time focussing on updates, or looking at ways to cut through the noise. When you merge a PR into your default branch, Renovate will rebase open PRs, so they're easier to review, and are guaranteed to run against the latest changes. However, if you're not getting to your updates as often as changes are going in, you may have a tonne of PRs constantly building, which is a waste of energy and CI minutes. Instead, you can use the Dependency Dashboard for its ability to i.e. require major bumps be gated behind a manual approval, as it's likely you'll need some human interaction for that PR, and can then only raise it when you're actually ready to deal with it. Open Source A very important factor to me is that Renovate is Open Source, and open to community contributions. Although it's probably best to be split into another article, I love the AGPL3, and it's a great way of making sure that anyone hosting Renovate as a platform makes sure that their users get the access to the source code. Alternatively, Snyk is proprietary, and Dependabot is source available (or at a stretch \"open source\" not \"Open Source\") with a license that doesn't even appear on the SPDX license list. Renovate is also brilliantly set up as a community project, where they're shipping hundreds of PRs a month, alongside managing the community really well. I've seen a few things change in the last few years I've been more actively contributing, and it's a really well run project and an indication of something I'd love to be able to replicate at some point! It also helps that Mend, the company behind Renovate, invests a fair bit of time and money into development of the project, as well as their commercial offerings on top of it, which continue to make the project sustainable and remain Free and Open. Great documentation Following on from the excellent community and maintainer contributions alike, there's also some really excellent work on a technical writing and documentation point of view, which makes a lot of tasks straightforward to solve. If there's something a little more complex or custom than the docs can offer, it's usually something that can be answered by the community in a GitHub Discussion, and likely could turn into a docs improvement, if necessary. There's even a great comparison table between Renovate and other dependency update bots, as well as tips on how best to update your projects. I've recently discovered a few pages and features that I wasn't aware, just by going through the docs. Overall In summary, there's just so much that makes Renovate a greater choice than any of the alternatives, and I'm sure I could talk about more things that make it great. Whether you self-host it for maximum control (such as being able to access internal artifact registries), or run the hosted app for ease of operations, or just run it from the command-line once in a while, it can be hugely useful to your experience as an engineer.

Everyone need something like this, and Github is positioned to offer the best sca tool there is. And yet... stuff like grouping has only been recently added. Anyhow, this is useful to rollout dependabot.yaml config at scale: https://github.com/github/evergreen reply 8organicbits 18 hours agoparentI've been dumbfounded that GH hasn't invested in the space. There's tons of obvious surface area still available for automation. A one-off project of mine tries to improve supply-chain license management for projects [1]. I got bit once by an MIT licensed project that accidentally took a GPL dependency a couple versions later. That was a pain to notice without analyzing transitive dependencies. Never again.

There’s no secret here. reply playingalong 17 hours agoparentprevWhy? Just like with AWS SaaS offerings: All they need to do is have something basic, satisfying 80% customers, requiring little maintenance on their end. reply Tainnor 11 hours agoparentprevLast time I tried (which is >2y ago, so things might have improved), dependabot seemed like an afterthought for GitHub. For example, at some point GitHub introduced a change that prevented CI builds triggered by forks from accessing secrets in CI variables. This made sense from a security perspective (although I would have a preferred a hard failure instead of variables silently being set to empty), but it also applied to all Dependabot PRs, which I have to assume wasn't intended behaviour. It really seemed like different teams at GitHub weren't talking to each other. An issue was opened about this and got quite heated, but wasn't really resolved (except for some ugly workarounds) before it was locked for becoming too uncivil. I wonder if they fixed it since. reply asciimike 10 hours agorootparentOh yes, https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/3253. I wouldn't go so far as saying it was locked because it was too uncivil, mostly just because \"additional commentary wasn't adding value\" ;) Your read on the situation is spot on, and no, it doesn't look like it's been \"fixed\" (mostly because \"fixing it would re-introduce the same potential vulnerability). reply chuckadams 12 hours agoparentprevI just want to be able to browse the dependencies of my repo with a web UI. Show me a tree of dependencies in my repo, filter for ones that are outdated, expand them to show what would be in a dependabot PR (the keen description it generates that contains all the release info and links to changelogs and whatnot). Then let me open a PR (or tell dependabot to do so) with the click of a button, or ignore it with another. The current workflow where dependabot just spams an endless stream of PRs is not optimal. I don't need any new features from dependabot, I just want a better UI. reply vlovich123 20 hours agoprevCloudflare adopted Renovate when I worked there. Not sure if it was the config wasn’t good (we did try to wrangle with it a bit by customizing), but I found it to be a lot more pain that it was worth. PRs that wouldn’t build would be opened, trivial dependency updates that weren’t worth the PR time would be proposed, etc. There’s also the security aspect of supply chain attacks of “button press” updates. I think having reports sent to repo owners that they can review with the team on a periodic basis instead of click-through maintenance might be a better model but I also understand the desire for mindless automation of what seems like a chore. reply viraptor 59 minutes agoparent> PRs that wouldn’t build would be opened Isn't that exactly what you want from the dependency update system? If some dependency bump breaks the build, why wouldn't you want to know about it? And if not, how would this system know that the PR will fail before opening it? I'm not sure I get what behaviour you expect. reply k8sToGo 19 hours agoparentprevI automated renovate PR into its own branch. Then twice a month I automatically create a PR through GitHub actions for me to review all changes at once. I also added a cooldown period that Renovate should only add updates that are out for at least 14 days. reply h1fra 14 hours agorootparentWe also had a similar setup at Algolia, renovate push to one branch (`baseBranch` properties) and you only review once a week or month. Created a GitHub actions to create the base branch with a cron: https://github.com/bodinsamuel/renovate-automatic-branch So you have nothing to do except a big review once in a while. reply ozarker 19 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds awesome can you share any details on how you got this to work? reply k8sToGo 17 hours agorootparentI have a branch lock on dev and main so that you can only merge through PR. So I created a branch from dev called \"renovate_updates\". In the renovate config I set the baseBranch config parameter to this branch. I also enabled automerge and minimumReleaseAge. On GitHub I created two actions: 1. It gets triggered on the 14th and the 1st of a month and creates a PR from renovate_updates to dev and assigns it to me. I use an action to identify as a github app that I have given the rights to in the repo. Within the github action you can use gh cli. 2. Everytime there is a merge to the dev branch the action gets trigerred and does a rebase of dev of that \"renovate_updates\" branch. The nice thing about this is that Renovate creates an Issue in your repo and you can still force versions if you need them earlier. reply riquito 17 hours agorootparentWhat strategy do you use for conflicts during the rebase of renovate_updates? (which most of the time would occur because you eagerly updated something on dev)? reply k8sToGo 16 hours agorootparentThat’s a good point. My repo doesn’t change that often. But for me the source of truth is always dev. reply __s 20 hours agoprevSo, I picked up a pretty easy process I've used for the last 10 years (at decade old small company with plenty of legacy code, Microsoft, & now a startup using go/rust/js) Every Monday I update dependencies. Review breaking changes, get to know what CVEs are out there, glance over changelogs It takes less than an hour a week. It keeps me up to date on our dependencies reply oweiler 1 hour agoparentWith Dependabot this takes me less than 10 min a week across 20 repos. Because we have lots of integration tests, we automerge patch updates automatically. reply pavel_lishin 20 hours agoparentprevAcross how many repos? My team owns a dozen. reply __s 19 hours agorootparentMonorepos definitely make it easier. There's a use for dependency bots, especially when collected into one PR so that it can be treated like a newsletter. Was wanting to point out that good habits can go far, but if you're hitting limits then automation is a boon Ideally if there's multiple repos maintenance can be divided amongst those repo's owners, & once you've divided work between multiple people it becomes more valuable to have a tool help maintain process. These tools need buy in, I've found sometimes they'll go ignored & then the list of PRs becomes mixed up with random dependency PRs reply occz 14 hours agorootparentRenovate creates an issue which lists the status of all dependencies in the repository, which it keeps updated. It then creates PRs for each dependency update, which can then have CI run individually to give an indication of any issues with the update. It's downright excellent. reply vlovich123 20 hours agorootparentprevSounds like you might be understaffed. reply pavel_lishin 18 hours agorootparentIt's microservice land! Most of those services are no longer in active development, and nearly all of them support a single actual product. In my opinion, we split them to aggressively at the start - expecting some of them to be used by other people in the company, as a service type of situation - but that never happened. I argued for combining several of them - they don't share any paths for API calls, so it could literally be as simple as recursively copying various folders, and adding more route definitions to whichever service becomes the host. But it was never particularly urgent. reply devjab 10 hours agorootparentWhy wouldn’t you just bundle your shared dependencies in libraries so you would only have to update them in one location anyway? We put all our shared utilities into service libraries which are injected into our microservices when they are build. Since the APIs they consume are build to be non-breaking on changes, any external packages that get updated will only need to have their breaking changes solved in one location. 95% of our changes are done by renovate. We rarely have to deal with breaking changes on anything backend related, though the frontend is a different story. But our frontends aren’t exactly “microservices” anyway, and they are always very much in active development. I build a couple of services which collects a gazillion tonnes of solar inverter data from various plants over the world, and then does some fancy ML magic to figure out which solar cells need cleaning, and it has run for years with automated dependency updates with nothing breaking because of how it was build from the start. I get that if your microservices are really just a bunch of tiny monoliths then it’s hell, but then you should probably prioritise your suggestion of merging it together somehow. reply vlovich123 18 hours agorootparentprevYup. Those “no longer actively developed” services should probably be rethought. Your carrying too much dead weight for the team size if updating the dependencies is “too much”. You’re just papering over the issue if you’re relying on automated tools to do basic book keeping for you. reply zer00eyz 17 hours agorootparentprev>> they don't share any paths for API calls, so it could literally be as simple as recursively copying various folders, and adding more route definitions to whichever service becomes the host. Make that step 4 or 5. Mono repo them first! Yes you will have to build some tooling to do this but it gives you a way to test the concept. The moment that you have to change 2 of them with any degree of coordination you will get a 10x pay back. reply abathur 18 hours agoprevThread a few months ago ~about a risk associated with getting habituated to automatic dependency-update PRs and looking at them less critically: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37680443 reply Terretta 15 hours agoparentThere's a risk to wearing your seatbelt and driving off a bridge into water as well. Something to be aware of, but not a reason to ditch the belt. reply aswihart 16 hours agoprevFiguring out whether the upgrade is safe is a hard problem. I've found renovate most successful in frontend JS projects where you have a ton of dependencies all with new versions coming out all the time, most of which are non-breaking, and where the danger of a bad upgrade is not that large. For backend work or once you've gotten the easy stuff out of the way you really need to review the changelog, assess the risk, and do the upgrade safely (disclosure: my startup Infield is in this space). reply jml78 16 hours agoparentAt my company, I feel just the opposite. Our frontend JS projects are lacking in enough unit, integration, and e2e that most of those devs are scared to touch any dependencies. Where on our backends, we have such high code coverage, quality integration tests, the backend devs are never nervous about updating dependencies. EDIT: I will also say, we are purely microservices so that does help in this regard. reply esafak 10 hours agoparentprevYou need to write tests against your libraries, not just your own code! reply misnome 10 hours agoprevUgh, no. Stopped using Renovate when I discovered that it will happily propose a PR update for completely incompatible and conflicting dependencies. It literally looks at the latest version of each dependency alone, without considering if this will make a conflict. Author insists this is a problem with all package managers, that it's impossible to write a tool that doesn't behave like this, and that manually grouping dependencies or completely ignoring version updates until the next one is the only sensible approach. This doesn't save me time. reply esafak 10 hours agoparentThis is significant. Where did you read this? I found: https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/26917 reply nikolay 16 hours agoprevDependabot is the biggest source of PR spam for me as it's config is so simplistic, you can't easily make it group upgrades. So, when I see suddenly almost a hundred PRs created, I do the upgrade myself, push it, and then Dependabot closes the PR, but I love the hundreds of emails around this process, too. reply jamietanna 14 hours agoparentYou can now group PRs with Dependabot (https://github.blog/2023-08-24-a-faster-way-to-manage-versio...) although it's not quite as powerful as Renovate's functionality reply nikolay 13 hours agorootparentAs I said, it's not easy, and not everything is possible either. Monorepos are the biggest victim. I wrote a script that generates the Dependabot config and a GitHub action that updates it when my monorepo changes. reply keybored 19 hours agoprevWhy does it seem to these tools have converged on the bot-makes-PR implementation?

Their purpose is to reduce the effort involved to an absolute minimum so there are no excuses to fall behind on updates. Some of these tools, like Renovate, even have the ability to automatically merge the PR if the tests pass, meaning there’s zero human involvement. If you had to submit the PR yourself, then these tools would be no different than an automated Jira ticket that’s created once per sprint.

Yes it bypasses YOUR workflow, but a PR works for everyone who uses GitHub. If you want something else that works for everyone who uses GitHub it's an issue, or an email with a patch file. Why a patch file. DO you want to own the change the bot suggested? There are a lot of orgs where the ownership matters more than the linting.

Issues seemed to be caused by the fact that it parses the lockfile format, which is in Elixir, with Javascript. Dependabot doesn't have issues that (can) stem from that because it parses with Elixir code (so it doesn't have to reinvent reading Elixir maps). reply tflinton 20 hours agoprevI use it at work and it’s fantastic. reply sebazzz 15 hours agoparentIt is, but at some point several dependencies might not be updated successfully for whatever reason, and I would like Renovate to retry to PRs or just close them in favour of running other dependency updates and then trying again. reply tflinton 14 hours agorootparentHm, we have it setup to do all dependency updates on the same branch/MR. We’ve had broken builds but it’s typically because of a breaking api change in a dep.

    "originLink": "http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/5591",
    "originBody": "I Continue To No Longer Attend Vintage Computer Festivals — April 12, 2024 As should be expected, a number of individuals have come forward with responses to the initial blog post. While I do not expect everyone to take even a passing interest in the rabbit-hole of the situation or the context, I figured it was worth writing a few quick addendums. Naturally, as is the case when you post anything anywhere in public, I am called a liar. I’ll simply say that everything I describe in the blog entry happened. I contacted a VCF administrator and was told it was all disposed of, and that they kept the bins. I am fine with people claiming that disposal was not what happened, but this is what I was told, directly, in human words. The fact that I am seeing contradictory and confusing descriptions of what happened is not a checkmark destined for the Win column. A few people have rushed to indicate that I need to be more careful describing “which” VCF entity is at fault. I am sad to report to them all that the Byzantine VCF structure of name licensing, geographic branding, and internal corporate entity is meaningless to anyone six inches away. You all know each other and you all interchangeably use nomenclature. If you are part of an organization that calls itself some form of “VCF” and need an opportunity to write a statement about how your organization in a solitary/separate entity and should be considered more worthy or ethical than others, feel absolutely free. A small sliver of people were concerned I was saying that I was never going to go to any computer history conference or event again. I am a free person with the freedom to attend whatever is open to the public. As it stood, however, VCF East was the easiest event for me to attend, so it was where I saw people the most. A minor point is that I considered attendance a form of endorsement, but that is my own personal choice. The chances of me attending other events is, like death by cow, low but never zero. The rest of the discussions I have seen from the blog entry, raging in the usual stages of social media and posting forums, have failed to require any further response or thought from me personally. Finally, this is all relatively minor in terms of the work I do and projects I focus on, an event that brought me some fury but which has mostly played the part of filed under “life lessons”. I just got tired of having quiet inward emotion when I was reminded of the event, specifically when VCF announcements would pass by my screen, followed by nice folks asking if they would be seeing me at the event. Now I have made a statement, and rather than the beginning of a saga, I consider it the end of one. My conversations with people and organizations I shift materials to are much longer, much more involved, and with much more contingencies as a result of this event, and things are better for it.

People not into it might get confused... reply AlbertCory 8 hours agoprevI was in Google Patent Litigation, and we actively collected old stuff, for possible use as prior art. I even went to Beryl Nelson's house before she died to collect her old Bell System Technical Journals. A lot of old stuff has no value to anyone. That can be hard to accept, but it's true. Even old wood furniture -- no one wants it. Old PC or Byte Magazines? Forget it; they're all over. reply accrual 6 hours agoparent> Even old wood furniture -- no one wants it. Old PC or Byte Magazines? Forget it; they're all over. I think the former is pretty true, but old PC magazines are still important to keep around. For one, they can be digitized to take up virtually no physical space (unlike furniture). Secondly, once digitized and OCR'd to make searchable, they're a valuable resource for finding out when certain products or technologies became available, for what cost, and sometimes include contemporary reviews. In the more distant future I think there will be some value placed on historical tech in much the same way people still spend time researching medieval times and earlier. Having access to these documents will be important for future researchers and whatever their goals may be at that time. Furniture - less so. :) reply MaanuAir 32 minutes agorootparentSome French people spent the time to digitize an impressive amount of French magazines: https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/ I don’t know for other countries though. reply TylerE 3 hours agorootparentprevRather the reverse. Any publication is easily available in PDF. Real solid furniture is nearly impossibly to find new. Everthing is particleboard and vaneers, or if higher end, mdf and veneers. reply pbhjpbhj 1 hour agorootparentEasily? Can be made easily available, but it's not like everything published has been well preserved or is publicly available. reply Semaphor 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat? I bought a bed last year. It’s solid wood, only the bottom of the under-bed-drawers being some kind of glued material. And it wasn’t even some super high-end thing, including the drawers, I paid just below 1000 € for it. When searching for a bed to buy (as I wanted solid wood), I even found many stores specializing in solid wood furniture. reply saulpw 2 hours agorootparentBut notably, it's not old. No one wants the old stuff anymore, no matter how good. reply iainmerrick 2 hours agorootparentThere's a big difference between \"no-one\" and \"not enough people to make it worthwhile storing and transporting large and heavy furniture so it can be sold at a reasonable price\". Friction is a thing. reply TylerE 2 hours agorootparentand not of us live in cities with furniture showrooms. The nearest stores with halfway decent stuff are like 3 hours from here - and that's just to look, never mind the hassles of arranging I'm actually in the middle of getting a custom computer/music desk shipped cross country right now. Not solid wood either, and the thing still cost almost $2k with shipping. reply Semaphor 2 hours agorootparentprevCheck the comment I replied to, it's talking about new furniture reply TylerE 2 hours agorootparentprevNow try finding a solid wood table that doesn't cost $3,000+. reply Semaphor 2 hours agorootparentLiterally the first result on the site I checked [0], solid wood table on sale for 339 €.

Screwing a board to a metal U is easy. Nicely joining 4 wooden legs to the board is not... I have also done the former multiple times, with custom-made lower parts and it is very painful to see highpriced cr* like the one in the link popping up everywhere, where it could easily be made custom (even in relatively High-CoL locations) for nearly the same price. The thing above is 30€ for steel, 2h of manual work (where the non welding prep of sawing metal pieces can be done by anyone... I did this for a trapezoidal shape of my own design...), next to nothing for painting (powdercoat would be nice, but likely not done...) and then a plank of some random wood from Ukraine (30€, 200€ if you construct it custommade from planks). I gather the main problem lies with the availability of designs and likely this could be solved by providing those (for example by an IT platform selling plans and matching suppliers with customers). reply wmf 6 hours agorootparentprevI think the point is that it's already been digitized. All of it. The stuff in your attic isn't a valuable historic artifact; it's deep in the trough of no value. reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentA fraction has been digitized, and most of it still quite poorly scanned. Try reading some, try actually using any of the schematics and other technucal drawings, a lot looks ok at a glance, then turns out to be merely better tgan nothing when you actually try to use it the same way you would have used the original. Every few years the definition of practical scanner quality and file size increases by 2x or more. A fax quality scan is infinitely better than nothing, so it's great that such scans were made as soon as that became possible, but a few years later scanners became 10x better and it became practical to work with 10x larger file sizes. So all of those documents really need to be scanned again. And the same process needs to hapoen yey again at least one more time. Even very good scans from only a few years ago are still only good compared to old scans. They are still practically garbage compared to the original print. And much of what is currently digitized is precarious, one lawsuit or lapse in funding or ceo decision away from the service being shut down. I've already lost tons of stuff I actually paid for to services that no longer exist, let alone free services. Right now a lot of eggs are in archive.org and they are a charity that paints a huge \"kill me\" target on their own back every day. It makes no sense to operate on the assumption they will never become the library of alexandria. Digitizing existing printed material is not remotely a done job. Not even barely scratched the surface if you step back and look at how we are still in the first few seconds of eternity. reply germinator 6 hours agorootparentprevYou'd be surprised how little of the niche pre-internet stuff is digitized. There are some exceptions (national-circulation newspapers, some English-language books), but it's a minority of what's been published. reply telmnstr 5 hours agorootparentAlso a question of how long stuff will really stay around on the internet. reply varjag 2 hours agorootparentprevA good third of HP Application Notes is still not digitized. Same with many other publications that aren't Dr. Dobbs' or BYTE. reply AlbertCory 4 hours agorootparentprevExactly that. The major magazines have been done already. If you have something obscure, there's a good chance it hasn't. reply Sakos 4 hours agorootparentIn which languages? And who has access to the digital copies? And how complete? This isn't as clear cut or solved as you make it out to be. reply lmpdev 4 hours agorootparentThis is why I data hoard I have friends who are Serbian living elsewhere and are about to start a family They have no Serbian children’s media afaik (and it’s not exactly easy to find) I found ~200GB of Serbian dubbed children’s media someone painstakingly digitised on /t/ I’m keeping it for when they eventually have those kids Unless shown otherwise, assume nothing is archived correctly, completely or at all reply ironmagma 3 hours agorootparentprevHow many backups are there of it? Recall that kernel.org was once completely lost and much of the source code apparently had no mirrors. reply theodric 3 hours agorootparentprevI may have the only omnibus of PET Benelux Exchange magazines out there, which seem to be entirely unavailable online. There are exceptions. reply tptacek 6 hours agoparentprevSeems reasonable enough! But if that's your take, I recommend not accepting 15 crates of material Jason Scott drives 70 miles from his house to hand off to you, unless you're looking to get Internet Famous. reply somnic 7 hours agoparentprevIt would've been courteous to offer it back to the donor, if they weren't equipped or willing to archive or distribute it. I'm guessing that's probably not standard practice, but surely it's common for people donate things to be archived because they're in some way important to the donor. reply Brian_K_White 57 minutes agorootparentThis. It's what any minimally civilized adult does in any context, to respect someone else's efforts or valuables regardless if a thing is valuable to yourself. At least enough to try to give it back. At least enough to warn \"hey, I'm just going throw this away\". It sounds like what happened here is individual turnover, where the entity that accepted the material is not the same entity that discarded the material. It's still a vcf failure though, not a blameless accident. As an organization they accepted a task and then did not do it. An individual leaving should not cause that. We invented writing and institutional knowledge thousands of years ago. And the organization certainly retains the benefits of the ongoing organizational continuity. If anyone would say that turnover excuses anything, then I say that can only be valid if the organizations name and other assets also all evaporate at the same time as their obligations and agreements evaporate. You don't get to shed one and keep the other! So it's fair to just judge the organization for committing this act the same as you would a person. Never trust them again with anything you care about. And as in Jason's case where he particularly cares about specifically preserving documents, and so is particularly burned by someone dropping that specific ball they agreed to take from him specifically, in his case it's totally fair for him to not want to even associate at all with them ever again, even if we all don't have to go that far. They burned him especially badly, retroactively made him fail at a job he has set himself, by giving him a thumbs up we got this but then pissing on the work. That makes Jason into a bad steward since he trusted them. He's not really a bad steward of course but it doesn't change the fact that what he set out to accomplish, and a responsibility he himself accepted from yet others before him, has failed. Not everyone has to care so much about some old magazines, but he does, and VCF knew he does, and we all benefit from the fact that there are people like him out there. So I say it's totally reasonable that he writes them off as dead to him. That is a correct and rational and even constructive reaction for him. As he says in the article, he now has much more robust conversations on this. That's constructive. I think it is constructive to tell everyone too. Nothing wrong with VCF having to work hard and earn back a good name. And nothing wrong with everyone watching and being aware if they fail to. reply toast0 5 hours agorootparentprevI agree, but that also requires cataloging the donation somehow so that the donor's contact information is associated. If it all lived in the boxes until it was removed (however it was) then it would be easy to have said 'hey, we can't use this, and we can't store it, we're planning to rid ourselves of it, can you help us find it a new home?' Especially if the donor had placed contact info inside or on the boxes. But there's lots of ways that information may not filter to the big pile of old magazines disintegrating in the salt air. reply chefandy 3 hours agoparentprevFew places is that truer than in libraries. I worked in that world for quite some time. Many people are astonished to find out how many books libraries pulp. Periodicals? Forget it. Space, preservation budgets, cataloging resources, and any number of other things required to maintain collections of objects is finite, so you need to focus on things people want to read/watch/listen to/use. The important stuff gets saved. We put a 40k book collection into a salt mine after digitizing it, because it was of international historical significance and the only known complete collection of its type. Most of the stuff though wasn't even interesting enough to make it onto the free book cart for staff. reply rdtsc 5 hours agoparentprev> A lot of old stuff has no value to anyone. That can be hard to accept, but it's true. Even old wood furniture -- no one wants it. Old PC or Byte Magazines? Forget it; they're all over. In a marketplace we might say that something has the value someone else is will pay for it. In case of donations like these it's somewhat tricky, it has the value someone is willing to take good care of it and preserve it. That's why it hurts in a way, they threw it away so it signals: that it had no value that's not even worth calling the person to pick it back up. I've seen this happen with my own family. Some older family member thinks their collectables they have been saving are super valuable, only to find out that nobody in the family wants them. That's painful for them to accept that, understandably, so it has to be handled with care. Another thing to think about is if it matters if it's Jason Scott. Should they have marked the boxes specially and treated the contents with a lot more care just because of who he is? That would have probably been smart from a PR standpoint. Maybe there is a chance some volunteer didn't know who Jason Scott is? But it would seem equally silly to now come out and say, sorry we didn't know it was you, Jason, we would have called back or kept them otherwise. reply bruce511 4 hours agorootparent>> seen this happen with my own family. Some older family member thinks their collectables they have been saving are super valuable, only to find out that nobody in the family wants them I've said this before, but it bears repeating. The joy of collections comes in the collecting, not the final collection. Nobody wants to inherit \"someone else's collection\" - they want to collect themselves. Secondly, 95% of your collection has little to zero value. 4% has some value. Perhaps 1% has significant value. There's a power law in play here. I -urge- you to turn the valuable parts into cash yourself before you pass. The coat of -identifying- the valuable parts dwarfs their value. Therefore when you pass, your survivors will either give it away for nothing, or sell to a dealer for the price of transport. More likely it'll go to the dump. If this pains you then -dispose it yourself-. If you have prized parts, those 5 items in a sea of thousands, make sure they are stored separately, clearly labeled and done one knows about them. They will then at least get donated. If you think they have value that can be realised -then you must dispose it yourself-. reply knighthack 6 hours agoparentprevThere's an Art of Manliness podcast that talks about this: https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/declu... It really opened my eyes to the fact that most of what you value or hold dear will have no value to others, especially if it can't be resold. As a practical minimalist (rather than a strict one) it's informed my personal practices a fair bit. reply pavel_lishin 6 hours agorootparentI like going to estate sales. Sometimes you find interesting things. But mostly, it's just piles of, frankly, crap. And in a weird way, it's sort of helping me deal with some of my tendencies to collect crap. Once I'm dead, 75% of it will be thrown away by someone hired to deal with the estate, maybe 50% of the rest will be sold, and the rest will once again go in the garbage. That screwdriver I'm keeping even though it doesn't work well? It's going in the landfill anyway. Might as well go tomorrow, as in 50 years. reply nox101 6 hours agorootparentWhat are some examples? I've gotten rid of almost everything I own twice by moving 7000 miles twice. I regret it. Books, toys, trinkets, etc. I saw these, thought \"I haven't opened these or touched them since I bought them\". Turns out, there were memories associated with each one. Just seeing them would remind me of a time and a place. What I was doing, who my friends were, where I was, then I bought that thing. They all sat on bookshelves and I threw them away. I suppose I can go look at a picture of the shelves but it's not the same as glancing at them and having them trigger memories. Tools, and supplies. I recently moved to a smaller apartment. I had a few boxes of things like left over parts from assembling furniture from 2 apartments previous. The day after I threw them out I needed them. All this stuff I have, 3 kinds of hole punchers, 4 kinds of tape (electrical, duct, masking, cellophane), a rarely need any of them except for maybe the cellophane. If I went by when \"have I used it in the last 3 years I'd have thrown the first 3 away. But, that one day when I need it I'll be glad to have it. Same goes for various kinds of bandages, cooking utensils, boardgames, stationary supplies, gift wrapping supplies, .... Another good example might be clothing. Yes, I do throw things away. But, there are various items I haven't used in years, long jeans for snow, high top hiking boots, thick socks, rash guards, etc.. that if I go by \"have I used it recently\" then I'd throw them out. I'm not saying keep everything and no, no one will want this stuff. But, seeing both grandfathers basically have a maker-space full of stuff, and use it, makes me jealous that I didn't stick in one place and slowly build up my dragon horde of stuff too :P reply cancerhacker 6 hours agorootparentprevWhen my hoarder FIL died, we had to have a cleanup company deal with his apartment - we asked them to set aside anything of value and got back one bankers box of old utility bills, canceled checks, a laptop. In reality, since those things held the clues to tracking down the bits of his estate, they probably were worth more than any revered artifact. reply rightbyte 1 hour agorootparentprev> That screwdriver I'm keeping even though it doesn't work well? It's going in the landfill anyway. Might as well go tomorrow, as in 50 years. Hold your horses. You need that one for abusive usecases. My favourite flathead is both bent and chipped. reply fencepost 6 hours agorootparentprevI was surprised at how low some things were at my parents' estate sale, though they're still alive and kept some things downsizing to assisted living. I also did keep some things of value (or that I could see immediate use for, like replacing my dishes with my mom's massive amount of Corelle including discontinued items). Also if you know people starting out suggest that they visit an estate sale or two for dishes, pans, silverware, etc. And anyone who wants fine china should just go buy people's complete sets on the last day for $15 or less. reply imgabe 6 hours agoparentprevNobody wanting old wood furniture is a boon for people looking to get nice furniture on the cheap. Check Facebook marketplace, craigslist, wherever people sell used things near you. Furniture doesn't really wear out, so other than a few scuffs and dings it will probably be just like new (except for things like couches or recliners). I managed to get a Henredon dresser that retails for something like $4000 new for $400. All you need is a truck or van and a friend to help you move it. reply AlbertCory 4 hours agorootparentI know people who've found this out the hard way, and I have, too: If you offer it for free, someone will take it. But asking ANY money is agreeing to wait a long, long time. reply imgabe 4 hours agorootparentI’ve had the opposite experience. Offer stuff for free and you will have to deal with the flakiest, most unreliable people in the world. They’ll say they’re going to come pick it up, leave you waiting all afternoon, and then just ghost you. Ask at least a token amount and you will get someone who seriously wants it. reply rightbyte 1 hour agorootparentMy experience is the opposite. Buyers are flaky. The closer the market value the flakier they get. reply zimpenfish 3 hours agorootparentprevAdding an anecdatum to the pile, my one and only experience with offering a (nice but unloved by the other occupant) chair for free got a response in the first 5 minutes who then arranged a courier to pick it up the following week. Painless. reply varjag 1 hour agorootparentWell I was giving away our coffee table. A very interested lady who was going to pick it up have held us home for better part of the day with half-hour postponements and then said it's too much trouble. Relisted it for $20 and the next week it went painlessly. reply BeetleB 3 hours agorootparentprevActually, for some things, in some communities, I've found the opposite. If it's free, people assume it's not worth much (perhaps defective, etc). If you ask a token amount, more people respond. reply pbhjpbhj 1 hour agoparentprevWas that the origin of Google Books, lol. Presumably, you imaged and OCR-ed the material; did you classify it using USPC/CPC/ECLA? Was there a search service? Was it made available only in Patent Litigation, across the whole org, or to the public? Any of those documents of 'old stuff' been used for observations to patent offices, or as citations in court - ie did it pay off? I worked at UK Patent Office 20 odd years ago they had many small troves of journals, books, clippings that individual examiners had collected and classified (UKC, and ECLA). All gone I expect, replaced for patent search by 100s of millions more patent documents, journal articles, and everything on the web. reply lostemptations5 1 hour agoparentprevThis is a TikTok generation answer (even if you are 70 years old) -- the thinking is: discard anything that is more than x years old. It's not useful. But all these things are precious historical documents of the development of technology and of course ourselves. They are vitally important to keep. Of course they aren't \"useful\" in the classic sense such as their original purpose -- but they are useful to remind us how things were and how far we've come and what kind of problems were solved in what way by our predecessors. reply ajsnigrutin 1 hour agorootparent> But all these things are precious historical documents of the development of technology and of course ourselves. They are vitally important to keep. Sure, but we can digitize them, offer them online, for free, for everyone, with OCR even with search features... There's no need to keep moldy originals anymore, unless they're \"special\" to someone (=someone wants to keep them). Eg. there's a really nice collection of old yugoslav magazines and books online, that is fun to skm through while on the toilet or in bed (instead of reddit or youtube), but keping, preserving, dusting etc. all that paper would be a pain. reply ip26 6 hours agoparentprevIt’s a new phenomenon that culture is still absorbing, a result of abundance and progress. Old furniture used to be handed down and treasured for generations. Suddenly, not anymore. reply postmodest 6 hours agorootparentIn my life, it's that the only people with room to have large wooden furniture were the Boomers and their parents who could afford to live in 2.5k+sq foot houses. My whole apartment couldn't hold the furniture from my parents living room. reply bruce511 3 hours agorootparentAs I wrote this I am on holiday, having bought an old Singer Sewing table, complete with foot-power mechanism. It's a lovely bit of furniture. That said, where to put it (or more accurately, what it will replace) was very much part of the buying decision. (Fortunately it comes apart, so can fit in the car. ) But the author is right. Old furniture in homes is rare. Partly because there are a LOT more homes now (so less old furniture to go round) and partly because it takes time, and money, to furnish in a consistent \"old furniture style\". It can also be -really- expensive. So becomes something of a \"later in life\" activity when funds allow. Typically a bunch arrives on the market at once, so typically it goes to a dealer, and between transport, storage, sales etc, the estate won't get much. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentprevWhen my grandmother passed, she left a house full of all this furniture, china, antiques and various knickknacks that she wanted her family to split up amongst themselves. Only her children (my Boomer parents and aunts) wanted any of it. The cousins in my generation and younger didn’t want any of it. We have nowhere to store all this… stuff. Our generation can barely afford space to live let alone rooms dedicated to antiques and dishwear. I hope my parents don’t burden us with a storage unit full of junk. Just because they treasure it doesn’t mean we can or even want to become the next stewards of it. It’s all going to the landfill. reply squarefoot 3 hours agoparentprev> A lot of old stuff has no value to anyone. And sometimes you are among the ones to whom it will have value, but realize that only too late. Before my first relocation in the late 90s to a much smaller house, I tossed a huge load of old electronics magazines dating from the 70s on, and deeply regretted that years later. As partial consolation, I later discovered most of those issues have been already scanned and sent for preservation to a local repository (0) of vintage technical magazines. (0) http://www.introni.it/riviste.html Mostly in Italian, a few in English, French and Spanish language. reply kazinator 5 hours agoparentprev> A lot of old stuff has no value to anyone. That can be hard to accept, but it's true. Sure, but this is some kind of \"vintage computer fest\", who are supposed to understand that old stuff has value, and who are entrusted with it, and not just given it to dispose of. The very word \"vintage\" in their name should mean something. If you can't find it a home, as the donor intended, call that person to take it back.

Seriously though, the boxes had utility and apparently the magazines did not. Had the boxes been wrapped in paper nobody would've complained, but in this case the wrapping paper was on the inside and so it's on the front page. If he wanted to do something with the magazines then he should have done it himself or paid to have it done. But giving the magazines away means whatever happens is up to the new owner.

As surprising as it may be, the past can tell a lot about the future, as the past was present at a point, and the future is now. Take an example about AI. This past couple of years isn't the first time that AI had been a hot topic. Look back to the late 80's -- there was a lot of research into it and lots of predictions about how the world would change -- but that didn't happen. It definitely didn't affect the general public as has today. So why is that? Looking at the different circumstances between the past and today (i.e., increase in computing power, availability of networks and broadband, general availability of computing devices, etc. etc.) could then be used to predict the future. Looking back at the past can give hints about what the future may hold. reply AlbertCory 4 hours agorootparent> a thread about prior art since I wrote that: it's actually pretty rare that a defendant can actually use a piece of prior art in a case, but there's always a hope that ONE time, you will.

Disregarding the past is simply ignorance. reply pushedx 7 hours agorootparentprevIn the original post he mentions that he purchased the containers specifically for the purpose of the donation, so it's likely that the containers sat full for years after being donated and were only incidentally re-used. He also mentions that the person who originally accepted the donation was pushed out of the VCF organization, and did not have a say in the material being disposed of. There is a possibility here that the containers sat for years after they were accepted, no one was left who knew why they contained a bunch of papers, and so they thought it wouldn't be a big problem if they disposed of the papers. Being a supposedly archival organization, however, if this was the case it would have been very poor judgememt. I'm the kind of person who keeps random marketing materials from obscure gadgets from 40 years ago, so I can feel the pain of these documents having been lost. That being said, once a donation is made, in general, is there an obligation to uphold any wishes of the donator? I guess there is, in many circumstances. reply pinusc 6 hours agorootparentThat's an interesting ethical question. I am tempted to agree that there generally is. You can argue that the giving of a gift is a final act, that the gifted item belongs to the recipient now, and that since you're morally free to do whatever you want with what belongs to you, you are free to do with the gift as you please, including tossing it out. But gifting is imbued with meaning beyond the mere transfer of ownership. This is obviously true in the case of gifts between people: tossing out a sweater hand-knit for you by your grandma is at the very least an asshole move, and I would argue that it's just wrong because it would cause her pain to know that. The sweater has meaning beyond being a mere sweater; particularly so because of the care with which it was made. A collection like the one we're discussing was likely accumulated with care, it held meaning beyond the economical value of the magazines or journals that constituted it. Some donations (especially monetary?) are made with not so much care that it matters; but an extensive collection of magazines, by a person invested in the community, to an organization that is supposed to archive (and continue a legacy of looking after old stuff), to me fits in the same ethical landscape of the sweater gift - even if the receiving party is an organization rather than an individual, even if it's a \"donation\" rather than a \"gift\". I think we usually displace ethical agency away from organizations, especially for-profit companies, but they should be held accountable for their actions towards the community they supposedly serve (or service). A duty to not be assholes was violated. reply skissane 6 hours agorootparent> You can argue that the giving of a gift is a final act, that the gifted item belongs to the recipient now, and that since you're morally free to do whatever you want with what belongs to you, you are free to do with the gift as you please, including tossing it out. Gifts/donations can be conditional, subject to conditions. If someone donates $1 million to a university to fund scholarships for disadvantaged students, and the university instead decides to spend it all on first class air travel for university executives, that would in many jurisdictions be illegal (a breach of trust). If someone donates an item to a museum, I would say the museum has at least a moral obligation to contact the donor and ask them if they want to take it back before throwing it out. reply telmnstr 6 hours agorootparentprevI believe the person quit the organization, wasn't pushed out.

The text field that you used to write that comment has a rendering layer that was only universally present across devices and operating systems about 8 years ago. We are now operating in an environment where the average programmer is writing using frameworks on top of frameworks, on top of libraries, on top of SDKs, on top of containers, on top of VMs, on top of OSs, on top of hypervisors, on top of kernels, on top of microcode, and that's collapsing a bunch of the layers. To have any hope of explaining to the next generation how many of the truly beautiful and fun aspects of computing systems operate, you need to strip away many of these layers. A great way to do that is with old systems where the layers didn't exist. reply indymike 6 hours agorootparentprev> No this group wastes so much time trying to relive the 70's and 80's they're missing an even greater paradigm shift \"if you only knew.\" - Guy who did his capstone project on neural networks and computer vision in the 80s. reply philipswood 4 hours agorootparentprevTo understand fully where the encoding of the text your comment is written in comes from requires you to go all the way back to the telegraph line...

Unrelated but I can remember when a friend of mine came back from a long, glamorous trip and suddenly stopped sharing in our usual moments of nostalgia. They acted like they were embarrassed. It sucked because it made me believe that they were ashamed of who they used to be, and I felt sorry for them. This person has since made great efforts to adopt a newer, more glamorous persona.

To answer your question, yes, people are still writing malware for old systems. They don't even have to be network connected: computer viruses can spread perfectly fine from other media as well. People still send each other floppies in the mail. It's not as prevalent as on modern mainstream systems of course, but for example, a new Amiga virus started spreading a couple of years ago. The Jackal bootblock virus overwrites the bootblock on floppy disks, possibly rendering them unusable. https://www.vht-dk.dk/amiga/desc/txt/jackal.htm reply weinzierl 38 minutes agorootparent\"Seems a bit harsh to judge an entire event by the conduct of a single speaker [..]\" The answer was extremely rude.

At least these things happen. A former landlady of mine had donated a rare and precious motorcycle she inherited from her father to a local museum. When she coincidentally learned about 10 years later that the museum was about to sell it, she bought it back for a lot of money. Donations can sometimes turn out not the way we want.

It does and doesn't - much like old cars, record players, fighter jets, trains, radios and phones. A handful can be kept around for posterity, as museum pieces. There's a point in not forgetting how they work, since most modern stuff is to a large extent refinements and complexity layered on top of previous knowledge. But mostly, it's just a fringe hobby.

But they've also not said their side of this (nor would I expect them to when they'd have been setting up for their yearly event yesterday). I have friends who are close to the situation and the most I think I'm able to repeat (as it's public info) is that there were management changes between then and now. Based on that alone, and it's a volunteer organisation? Fair to say someone might have forgotten to write down \"Don't dispose of these\" or the label fell off. At the end of the day though, it's a bunch of magazines which were already scanned at pretty high resolution. Even most libraries back in the day transferred periodicals onto Microfiche, because there just wasn't room to store the paper copies. I really don't get why there's so much hoo-hah over this. reply Aeolun 8 hours agoprevWhy would you take all this stuff only to toss it all out? Though to he fair, it seems the person that took it was pushed out and replaced? In which case, why, if you do not take this stuff, would you work for a VCF? reply whartung 5 hours agoparentPerhaps the policy changed. Storing stuff takes space and effort. Cataloging even more so. Making it available to others is a jump in magnitude. Eventually, it can become untenable. Organizations like this tend to not lack donors. What they lack is the capacity to cope with donations. Time, labor, space, money are all finite, regardless of their mission. Even the Salvation Army will refuse things like furniture. It’s not carte blanche. That said, I’ll donate even ratty clothing to the SA because I know they’re at the tail end of consumer product life, they inspect and sort all the incoming clothing, and their discards end up bundled for recycle or other purposes. I donate to let them have first crack at it with their expertise rather than condemn it to a landfill directly. Give that old ‘92 Comdex t-shirt one last chance. I don’t know anything in detail about VCF. I don’t know if the IEEE has archives of everything already. I know there’s an effort to scan several hundred Computer Shopper magazines. I know there’s someone out there who has spent a great deal of time setting up a system to scan a very large stack of DEC VAX microfiche. I guess its a shame these magazines didn’t fall into the hands of someone with the zeal these other folks have for their projects. I have also learned to not question the motives and projects of folks in the vintage computer scene. Not my time, not my project, who am I to judge. It was with a bit of a heavy heart when my large collection of Dr. Dobbs magazines went into the recycling bin. When I cleaned out my grandfather’s house, I came back with (among other things) several dozen Popular Mechanics magazines from the 40s. They were all 200+ pages. Talk about a snapshot of a different world. But after 10+ years sitting in a box in the garage, and a house move later, I kept three and the rest went into the blue bin. Which brings me to my final point. If you have a collection, if you have any care about its disposition, you should do that yourself to other enthusiasts that may share your interests. Because your heirs, or the people task with cleaning up after your gone, will likely just put it in a large dumpster to be carted away. But then, even if you do get it to others, it may well end up in landfill anyway. reply tdeck 6 hours agoparentprevGetting rid of books is part of running a library, I wouldn't be surprised if this kind of thing is part of running a museum or similar organization.

It's easy for me to say that because I don't have to actually do it. reply skissane 4 hours agorootparent> Getting rid of books is part of running a library It depends on what kind of library we are talking about. Local public libraries, K-12 school libraries – they throw out books all the time. They have quite limited space, so they can't keep books which are no longer relevant to their target audience. National libraries, research libraries of leading universities – many of them rarely or never throw books out. I remember, when I was a university student, finding IBM 1400 manuals sitting on the shelves in the stacks. They are probably still sitting there. I believe they turned their last 1400 off in the 1970s. I remember borrowing a book, and according to the due date stamp inside its cover, the last person to borrow it before me, had done so 40 years prior. You could tell the books that hadn't been borrowed in a long time, because they still had punch cards in them, from back when the library had used punch cards to track book borrowing. If you actually borrowed such a book, they'd remove the punched card and discard it as part of the borrowing process. I bet if I went back today (20+ years later), there would still be books with punched cards in them. reply rnewme 6 hours agorootparentprevThere's difference between archive and a library.

In any large collection of scanned documents, you are going to get scanning errors/etc – you can catch a lot of these with quality control, but some will always slip through the cracks. (And, volunteer efforts to scan old computer documentation often don't have the time and resources for the best quality control.) If the original paper copy is still in existence, someone can always go back and rescan it again later. If all the paper copies are gone, that is impossible. reply philpem 1 hour agorootparentThe maximum useful resolution you can really get out of offset-printed magazines is around 200dpi. Scanners have been able to do 400dpi for many years, and have been stuck at the 1200dpi plateau for about as long. Sometimes you just don't need a better scan, because you're just doubling up on data you already have. reply skissane 1 hour agorootparentThere are lots of other issues that can occur with scans beyond just the raw resolution: misaligned pages (part of the text accidentally cut off from the scan), accidentally skipped pages, colour illustrations scanned in black and white, etc. With a sufficiently robust QA process, you may be able to catch most of these issues. However, you can never reduce the probability to zero, and people scanning old computer manuals don't always have the necessary resources to implement the most robust QA process. reply telmnstr 6 hours agorootparentprevFor many people there is a cost associated to storing items, be it old furniture or paperwork. reply cortesoft 6 hours agorootparentprevWhere are you going to store the paper?

I’m not saying that computers manuals will for sure stand the test of time for a the thousand years to come, but as long as they are protected from fire, they are probably a more reliable storage than a digital scan which will need humans to backup them regularly if they want to survive their physical media.

Comparing a periodical to a mint shrink-wrapped MTG card isn't really a fair comparison. Even back in the day, most libraries didn't keep periodicals, they were \"scanned\" (photographed) onto microfiche at the end of every year or two to save space.

    "originBody": "LEADERSHIP ·RETURN TO OFFICE Defeated CEOs are now conceding hybrid working is here to stay—a year after 62% said they expected a full-time return to office by 2026 BYORIANNA ROSA ROYLE It’s official: Leaders who believe that office workers will be back at their desks five days a week in the near future are now in the small minority. DANIEL DE LA HOZ—GETTY IMAGES Good news for those hoping to cling on to working from home: After a year of cracking down with rigid return-to-office mandates—and instilling fear in those who upheaved their life during the pandemic—defeated CEOs are now finally accepting that hybrid working is here to stay. KPMG surveyed U.S. CEOs of companies turning over at least $500 million and found that just one-third expect a full return to the office in the next three years. So it’s official: Leaders who believe that office workers will be back at their desks five days a week in the near future are now in the small minority. It’s a complete 360 on their stance last year, when 62% of CEOs surveyed predicted that working from home would end by 2026. At the time, 90% of CEOs even admitted that they were so steadfast on summoning staff back to their vertical towers that they were sweetening the pot with salary raises, promotions, and favorable assignments to those who showed face more. But now, bosses are backtracking: Nearly half of CEOs have concluded that the future of work is hybrid—up from 34% last year. What’s more, a sizable chunk of CEOs aren’t just embracing working from home on Fridays, they’re going one step further and ditching the workday altogether. KPMG found that a third of CEOs are exploring the feasibility of a four-day week at their firm. Why the change of heart? Many CEOs have dedicated the last year to shaking off pandemic-era habits of working from home and calling staff back to the office, but their mandates have been met with resistance. Deutsche Bank’s decision to outright ban staff from working at home on a Friday and the following Monday has not been taken lightly by staff—a large number of its 90,000-strong workforce have reportedly started posting critical remarks on the company’s internal messaging board to make their distaste for the new set-up known. Amazon is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get: Around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand. Research has echoed that nearly half of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated, and 29% of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment. It perhaps explains why, as KPMG’s data shows, CEOs are now waking up to the fact that the future of work is probably the happy medium of hybrid. “CEOs have realized that forcing people back into the office can only go on for so long,” Amrit Sandhar, CEO of &Evolve an employee engagement consultancy tells Fortune. “With Gen Z over the next few years making up, in some cases the majority of the workforce, how long can CEOs insist people come into the office, when people are choosing to work remotely? “We are at the threshold of a new dawn and trying to hold on to past mindsets will have a direct impact on the caliber of people you attract going forward.” Lewis Maleh, CEO of the global executive recruitment agency Bentley Lewis, has already witnessed a U-turn to more flexible job ads. “I’ve noticed a definite rise in job postings advertising remote or hybrid work,” Maleh tells Fortune. “We haven’t worked on any searches that require the candidate to be in the office five days per week in the past six months globally.” “The shift demonstrates the cementing of hybrid work models, as CEOs increasingly recognize flexibility as a key factor in attracting and retaining top talent.” Subscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive navigate the changing needs of the workplace.

Can't move out of a HCOL and now you have to co-ordinate with your co-workers to reap any \"benefits\" of being in-office. What would be really cool is reconceptualizing hybrid work as quarterly retreats, where the company provides housing and other amenities for 1 to 2 weeks every quarter. This gives everyone time to bond and work on harder problems. I get this wouldn't work as well for those with families because being away for that long is tough, but this would be great for say juniors and seniors with greater flexibility. It also solves some of the other issues, ie I could move to an MCOL and just fly in once a quarter to work together with everyone. The \"retreat\" aspect of it would also incentivize more people to be there. On the company side of things, instead of leasing out a building for a long time, they can just rent short term and use the money they are saving to make the retreat more fun and productive. reply unshavedyak 9 hours agoparentI agree about the issue with not being able to move, but i'd hardly call some of the many benefits \"worst of both worlds\". Avoiding the traffic, avoiding crowded offices, avoiding distractions, gaining life time back (no commute), etc - if you like it and have a proper space for it i'd still say it's a net benefit to hybrid WFM. I'm fully remote atm, but i've also done hybrid. WFM was always a benefit to me personally. I don't advocate that it's for everyone, ofc. Just saying many of the benefits hold true even if you have to work hybrid. reply al_borland 9 hours agorootparentIf someone has to relocate to a HCOL area for a hybrid job, the WFH days are seen by the company as a benefit, but the move to the HCOL area is generally going to be a net loss. It’s not enough of a benefit to make up for the significantly higher housing costs. reply grugagag 8 hours agorootparentI agree and never thought about it this way as im already in a HCOL area (NY). Also In not allowed hybrid where I work, the office is cramped, noisy and hostile to deep work. reply alsetmusic 8 hours agorootparentI’m HCOL both because of the market (SF Bay Area) and because I love the area. I’d still be here even if I switched professions. In this scenario, getting any wfh days is a win. My previous employer went fully remote and my current one is hybrid. I’ve never relocated for a job, so this aspect simply never occurred to me. reply parpfish 8 hours agorootparentprevAdd on that you need to get housing in that HCOL area that has enough space for an office/workstation reply joeax 7 hours agoparentprevThank you for saying the quiet part out loud. I read articles stating that \"the majority want hybrid\", but what people truly want is freedom to work wherever it suits them best. I've been remote for 15 years, and I've seen people that want the connection an office provides, and others (like me) prefer to never set foot in an office again. Just look around at the other comments and you read differing preferences. And that's cool. Just leave me and others alone and let us work how we prefer. As far as your quarterly meetings comment is concerned, even that is a variation of hybrid. I worked at a company once that had the quarterly meetups. It worked, but sometimes it was a disruption to a normal routine, especially for some co-workers who flew cross-country. Another company (100% remote company) had the annual weekly retreat which I liked better. You got your face time/watercooler collaboration bullshit/whatever out of the way, then 358 days of peace til the next one. reply charlie0 7 hours agorootparentTrue, but the quarterly thing doesn't have to be a requirement and the beauty of of is that 3 months is a decent amount of time to plan for who's going and who is no going. I'd leave it to people to decide if they want to attend every quarter, or every 6 months or every year. reply akurtzhs 9 hours agoparentprevYMMV. I prefer hybrid with two days a week in the office. You can dedicate those days to meetings and conversations and keep the remote days for more heads down work. And if you can’t make it to the office due to snow or travel, you’re prepared for remote work. reply al_borland 9 hours agorootparentDoesn’t this only work if everyone you need to have meetings with also has the same plan for 2 meeting days per week? reply nicoburns 8 hours agorootparentSome hybrid workplaces specify which days you need to attend reply ultrasaurus 6 hours agorootparentWhich means you need office space for 100% of the people, but that's only used 40% of the time. You can get a little clever with GTM coming in on different days than Eng but it's tradeoffs all the way down. (In a value-neutral way) reply nicoburns 5 hours agorootparentWell yes, hybrid working isn't generally a way to save office space. It's a way to help workers be more productive and also to give them time to deal with their non-work responsibilities. reply llm_trw 9 hours agorootparentprevI think one and a half days is the best. One of those days is the Friday so you get the half day automatically while being sociable. reply irjustin 9 hours agorootparentAnd I think that's a good thing because you want your team to have sociable relationships it helps with the overall synergy and longevity of the team. reply chiefalchemist 9 hours agorootparentprev2 of 5 days? Or 2 of 4? If your company went to the 4 day week, would you still prefer 2 days? reply TexanFeller 10 hours agoparentprevIt makes it bearable to live more cheaply in the suburbs and make the long drive to downtown only a couple times a week. Live in MCOL suburb and work a couple days in HCOL city seems like a fair compromise to me. reply charlie0 9 hours agorootparentReally depends on the area though. In LA for example, you'd have to move 1-2 hours away to get into MCOL or LOCOL. What would be really cool is reconceptualizing hybrid work as quarterly retreats, where the company provides housing and other amenities for 1 to 2 weeks every quarter. This gives everyone time to bond and work on harder problems. I get this wouldn't work as well for those with families because being away for that long is tough, but this would be great for say juniors and seniors with greater flexibility. It also solves some of the other issues, ie I could move to an MCOL and just fly in once a quarter to work together with everyone. The \"retreat\" aspect of it would also incentivize more people to be there. reply ghaff 9 hours agorootparentThat's not an unreasonable commute 1-2 days per week though. I've done it in the past. The Bay Area is probably particularly difficult to get far enough out for housing to be reasonable but many areas are not. reply thfuran 9 hours agorootparentA two hour one way commute is entirely unreasonable at any frequency unless it's on the clock. reply ghaff 8 hours agorootparentI'm close to that if I come into the city for a customer visit at the briefing center. I'm salaried so I'm not sure what \"on the clock\" means in that context. But I don't do it frequently so it's not my favorite thing but it's manageable. reply grugagag 8 hours agorootparentprevI have 2 hours round trip every day, 5 days a week. Id take 2 four hour round trips in an instant just because being in the office 5 days a week is absolutely draining all my resources. reply alsetmusic 7 hours agorootparentI did what you’re doing for three and a half years. I was so depressed I had thoughts of suicide and cried in a fast food parking lot on my lunch break. I’ll never accept a long commute again. It broke me. reply futureshock 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd that would be perfect if you only have to go in once a week. Many of my coworkers are in that situation and had been commuting 4 hours round trip for years before the pandemic. reply al_borland 9 hours agorootparentprevI’m all for periodic retreats. I volunteered to do something like this when I was moving about 6 hours from the office. Then the pandemic happened, and about 6 re-orgs, so it no longer makes sense for me to go there. reply straydusk 8 hours agoparentprev> I get this wouldn't work as well for those with families Your whole post is a series of contradictions where you hand wave gigantic problems and exaggerate small ones reply charlie0 7 hours agorootparentSuch as? reply Staple_Diet 7 hours agoparentprevI work for a large org with several offices across the country. You can work in a local team (i.e., immediate supervisor is in the office next to you) or in a remote team (i.e., your boss might be in another state, and team distributed amongst three locations). I've done both and am currently in the latter. We run weekly online meetings for the team, plus weekly project specific meetings. Then about every 2 months my boss and his boss fly over for an informal fireside with anyone in the team at my location. This approach seems to work well if not better than the local team approach. In both cases we are hybrid but in my case I have no reason, and thus no pressure, to attend the office more than once a week. reply deanrtaylor 7 hours agoparentprevI prefer a hybrid work model, currently I spend two days per week in the office but it only has to be a half day as long as I'm available for meetings and sharing sessions. This schedule allows me to avoid peak traffic, enhance team relationships, and still enjoy ample time at home with my wife. Prolonged remote work tends to feel isolating and somewhat depressing. Despite the higher cost of living in these areas, businesses often thrive in such locations due to the close proximity to industry resources and collaborative opportunities. It's expensive but beneficial. reply jltsiren 8 hours agoparentprevI find quarterly retreats worse than hybrid. You lose control of your life, if you have to travel for a week or two every quarter, with the dates set by the employer. I don't mind business travel as such, but I expect to be the one who decides if the trip is worth doing. reply alsetmusic 8 hours agorootparentMy previous employer brought everyone to town for a week with only two days counting g toward the retreat. I really loved the social aspect of it, getting to know people from other states whose role meant I’d never really interacted with them. I found out a guy who I’d thought of as a liability was actually a really great guy. Food and drinks as a team ftw. (We were a ~25 person team; our small size was a major contributing factor.) reply charlie0 7 hours agorootparentExactly, this can definitely work under the right conditions and unlike the weekly hybrid model, you don't actually have to live 1-2 hours from where you work. reply orwin 8 hours agoparentprevMy hybrid work is 2 days a month (one day every two weeks rather) and this allow me to live ~ 480km away from my office (300 miles), on the coast. Basically 3h10 by train+metro, which make the day quite tiring. reply aantix 8 hours agorootparentMan, two days a month? If you lived near a major airport with a direct flight, you could live almost anywhere. reply charlie0 7 hours agorootparentI had the reverse of this where I worked in-office all week, but spent the weekend in an entirely different city with my girlfriend. It was never meant to be a long term arrangement as I was staying with my family during the work-week, but it can work. It was a new job and I timed it well as 6 months after I started , COVID hit and everyone went remote. Flights were in state and I was buying them ahead of time, so I got them for cheaper than an Amtrak ticket. reply TexanFeller 10 hours agoprevI have ADHD and am autistic so loud open floor plan offices are a challenge. I'm in the category of people most likely to benefit from remote. Honestly it's been a much bigger challenge trying to collaborate and connect with coworkers in the new world than trying to cope with an office. People often don't perceive you as an actual human if you've only ever been a video square to them. And quick collaboration just doesn't happen anymore, or happens in a much slower and more frustrating way on Slack. Juniors especially struggle and I watch them take many times longer to ramp up than pre-pandemic. I honestly desperately wish my team worked in a room together 2-3 days a week. reply BobaFloutist 9 hours agoparentThere's a compelling argument that new hires should be work from office for their first couple of weeks, and that their team should probably spend more time in the office during the new hire's first few weeks too. That's no reason to throw out hybrid work wholesale, though, and if that's the only thing keeping a workplace from going full remote the full costs and benefits need to be weighed appropriately. reply parpfish 8 hours agorootparentI love WFH, but I admit that it would’ve been really tough as a junior employee learning the ropes. It’s easy to lean over and ask someone a quick question in person and/or learn passively by just seeing how they work. No equivalent that I can see wfh. reply benatkin 7 hours agorootparentprev> their team should probably spend more time in the office during the new hire's first few weeks too Would this be mandatory? If so, a team member might be inclined to sabotage a new hire. reply BobaFloutist 4 hours agorootparentIf someone's intentionally keeping their own team understaffed just to avoid a couple of weeks of coming into the office 3 days a week instead of 2 days a week, I think you have bigger problems than the specific situation. reply alsetmusic 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is the most balanced take I’ve seen so far. Great and obvious call. reply NegativeLatency 10 hours agoparentprevI do miss the old \"whiteboard brainstorming session\" sometimes reply from-nibly 5 hours agorootparentLets figure out how to make that work from home. reply namibj 1 hour agorootparentLarge screen plus Wacom. reply lolinder 10 hours agoparentprevI hate to be the guy who says \"you're holding it wrong\", but complaints like this usually indicate that a company is trying to manage their remote work the same way they did in the office, with no adjustments. Some specifics: > People often don't perceive you as an actual human if you've only ever been a video square to them. My remote company does regular on-sites and off-sites, which for me strikes a perfect balance between not having to deal with the headaches of an office (mostly commute and open floor plan) while still having time to meet my coworkers face-to-face. > quick collaboration just doesn't happen anymore, or happens in a much slower and more frustrating way on Slack Slack's huddle feature is great for the times where you need to quickly drop into collaboration mode with someone. Doing that occasionally and then structuring your work to be more parallel works very well in my experience. > Juniors especially struggle and I watch them take many times longer to ramp up than pre-pandemic. This is one that I actually have seen, even in my current org. I think the root of it is that going remote revealed just how much time senior engineers spend mentoring juniors by requiring that that time be scheduled. The most successful junior onboarding I've seen is when people make a conscious effort to schedule in lots of time for mentoring and training and to ensure that there's a space where juniors can get feedback quickly on Slack. It's not that you need more time than you'd otherwise need, it's that you have to be intentional about creating the learning spaces, which doesn't come naturally to many organizations. reply starky 3 hours agorootparent>I think the root of it is that going remote revealed just how much time senior engineers spend mentoring juniors by requiring that that time be scheduled. This is the big thing I've noticed in general with WFH, I miss those interactions where the junior members of the team ask me a quick question because I happen to be in their area. Those questions never get asked now beacuse they have to make the effort to send a message over chat and there is an extra mental barrier about asking something potentially stupid over text. So many people are more comfortable interrupting me when sitting on a call than they are sending the chat message. I've also seen it with a new team that the company recently spun up that does work related to my team. The manager wanted to leave the new hires to somewhat figure it out on their own and just be available to provide guidance if they ask for it. Their onboarding and getting up to speed has been super slow because of it. reply g051051 9 hours agoparentprev> People often don't perceive you as an actual human if you've only ever been a video square to them. I don't have a camera, so I'm just a picture of Uncle Fester. No one I work with (across 3 jobs) has seen me in nearly 5 years. reply thfuran 9 hours agorootparentAnd? reply teaearlgraycold 10 hours agoparentprevWe do 3 days in person, 2 days from home. Seems like a good split. reply kyleyeats 9 hours agorootparentThe ideal I think is 2 days in person, 2 days from home. reply cookie_monsta 9 hours agoprevMy boss (middle management) is very staunchly opposed to more than 1 day per week of WFH. She spends about 90% of her time on video calls, so I was always confused by that until she was telling me that when she does WFH she's always distracted by other things which doesn't happen in the office. Maybe a lot of the WFH opposition is really just managers projecting their own work ethic onto others? reply Terr_ 9 hours agoparent> projecting their own work ethic Alternately, they're projecting their own home environment, which won't always be the same level of distractions/benefits across different employees life-styles/situations. \"My house is filled with screaming two-year-olds and my commute is five minutes away, so obviously office-work is superior.\" reply kcrwfrd_ 9 hours agoparentprevWhen I work in the office I’m distracted by other things which don’t happen at home reply nomel 9 hours agorootparentThis is why I like to work in the office at work from home days. It's usually just me and one other person in the entire building. reply Bjartr 9 hours agoparentprevIn general people struggle to consider how others' experiences might differ from their own. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 9 hours agorootparentWhich is why it’s just as absurd to say “remote work is superior”. Just don’t try saying that to anyone here. reply devin 9 hours agorootparentI support people in working how they want to work. reply whoknowsidont 4 hours agoparentprev> She spends about 90% of her time on video calls Doing what? And I ask this not as someone who is a junior, or even mid-level, far above it. But this legitimately seems like \"make-work.\" UBI would go a long way to resolving a large class of these problems. The absurdity of driving into an office, to get on video calls is not a new absurdity or problem, but we already proved its pointless. And yet people stick to it. Maybe they shouldn't be in charge of people, let alone working. reply cookie_monsta 1 hour agorootparentRemember how excited we were at the start of the pandemic? \"Now we get to find out which of those meetings could have been an email\" the joke went. But now it turns out that almost every email exchange degrades into \"let's get everybody together and have a quick video chat about this\" Ha ha. I don't think UBI would help the situation as much as people being bold enough to make decisions on their own without a bunch of useless \"consultation\" reply jimkleiber 9 hours agoparentprevI'm curious to know what types of interactions happen on that 90% of her time on video calls. If it's one-on-one meetings all day over video call, I can imagine why they might want to have them in the same room with someone as video calls can really drain some people (including me). reply threetonesun 9 hours agorootparentA lot of larger companies already have distributed teams though, so even if you are in an office you often can't get everyone into the same room, and you have to do a video call no matter what. reply cookie_monsta 7 hours agorootparentYes, we're distributed with 5 locations across town. I had to go to a one hour meeting across town once which chewed up 3 hours of my day after driving and parking and whatnot was factored in. Videoconferencing makes 100% sense for our organisation. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, but we’re talking about one person here. She’s not speaking for all people or organisations.

Before WFH these people were traveling to any meeting or conference they could find. reply gryn 9 hours agorootparentI remember a coworker that would go to a closed office 5/5 days in middle the covid discouragement + ban (managed to find a way to get access from some manager) just to get away from his wife, his children are grown up (18+). I was so full of questions those 2 years we worked in the same office but couldn't really ask without it being touchy. reply hinkley 9 hours agorootparentprevWorking 90 minutes from home, each way… reply mvkel 8 hours agoparentprevWell you don't need to be on video calls if you're in person. reply chiefalchemist 9 hours agoparentprev> Maybe a lot of the WFH opposition is really just managers projecting their own work ethic onto others? That might be. But it more likely they are traditional managers or leaders and don't want to learn how to navigate WFH team members (i.e., work in the 21st Century). It's not as simple as just-add Zoom or just-add Slack. Thinking WFH is going away is like saying \"The Internet... It's just a fad.\" We've been to this rodeo before. Managers and leaders who are in denial - and unwilling to learn new teicks - aren't worthy of their current role. reply theandrewbailey 10 hours agoprevA lot of business executives fall into the demographic that heavily invests into commercial real estate, which is facing some substantial depreciation. Telling everyone they need to get back to the office would help to keep those prices up. To everyone else, they have no incentive to keep fighting traffic every day (and paying for it) to go to an uncomfortable place full of maybe awful people. reply searchableguy 10 hours agoparentThe simplest reason is lack of effective communication, team bonding, and morale. People behave differently behind a screen even if incentivised by money. This becomes a problem at the scale of big companies. Eg - without body language, tone and context - everyone needs to be extra charitable to avoid miscommunication or distrust. This might cause people to be overly defensive in their approach to communicate. reply jonahhorowitz 10 hours agorootparentI've said this in other places, but as a _manager_ it's much nicer to work in the office, in person. That gets more true the higher up the management chain you go. Managers spend most of their time in meetings. Meetings suck over video chat. This is the entire reason CEOs (and pretty much everyone between them and line employees) would rather everyone come back to work. It makes their workday more pleasant. reply al_borland 9 hours agorootparentThe idea of in-person meetings only works if there is one office where everyone is at. I was forced to move to another state (pre-pandemic). The people on my team were in offices, but 5 different offices. So I moved to another state to be in an office, so I could sit on the phone all day, every day. There is no sense to that. It’s no exaggeration that the forced move cost me tens of thousands of dollars… and for what? I recently had a FAANG recruiter reach out to me and when I brought up this concern when I was told I’d need to relocate to an office location, I was told the recruiter was in a similar portion on her team, spending all day on the phone because her team is spread across multiple offices. In person meetings are great, but if the reality of the office strategy isn’t going to make them possible, then there is no point. I think the occasional in-person meetup can do a lot to build rapport with members of the team without being in an office all the time, or on a weekly hybrid schedule. I’d go a step further to say that a meeting where 3 people are in a conference room and others are remote, is worse than everyone joining remote or from their desk. Meetings should either be 100% in-person, or 0% in person. Anything in between is a bad experience. I think it’s a safe bet that any company making news about return to office strategies has multiple offices with teams spread across multiple cities, states, and even countries. This makes meetings a poor justification for workers being in the office. reply starky 3 hours agorootparent>Meetings should either be 100% in-person, or 0% in person. Anything in between is a bad experience. Agreed, even one person joining remotely completely changes the meeting. The remote person is slightly out of sync with everyone, can't participate in any whiteboarding sessions, and you lose the connection because they are a face (or icon) on the screen and they are looking at a wide angle feed of the entire room. reply FridgeSeal 10 hours agorootparentprevManagers and execs ought to already know that not everyone else is an exec, and don’t have the same face-to-face requirements, and do actually need time to do the “productivity” that nets execs their fat pay checks. reply theandrewbailey 10 hours agorootparentprevMeetings tend to be some the least productive activities, especially when everything \"discussed\" could have been sent out as an email (which can be read remotely). reply ryandrake 9 hours agorootparentMeetings can only be replaced with E-mail if people actually read (and respond to) their E-mail, and I've found fellow employees' E-mail hygiene to be pretty spotty. reply LoganDark 9 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the type of meeting. Where I work, we have a short 15-minute meeting every morning that's done over video call, just to see who's working that day and make sure everyone is on the same page. The CEO constantly does screen-share meetings with clients so they can show him what they're trying to do with the product, and he can watch the recording later and break it into tasks to give to us. I'd say it works pretty well. Without this the product would lose out on a lot of valuable feedback. reply tester756 10 hours agorootparentprevHow those cross-geo projects manage to do it then? or OSS like Linux? reply ghaff 9 hours agorootparentLots of email, chat, and video calls.

I have no idea what brain damage causes this but if you can't work efficiently in the space you give to your workers to work in how do you expect them to work? A more or less verbatim conversation between the CEO and myself as CTO shortly before I quite: >The new office is so stuffy. I'm going to work from home. >>We need to get a new office. >No we paid too much to break the lease. >>But you can't work there. >I can work from home most of the time. I'll only come in for the big company meetings. reply makeitdouble 9 hours agorootparentIn my experience CEOs had a modicum of a private office, but it didn't really matter. They were in hybrid mode from the start, came to the office only for meetings and signing papers and went away the rest of the time, including working from home. Two decades ago we had an hilarious all hands meeting where we scrambled to get to the office at 9AM while the big big boss would appear on screen from the corner of his kitchen table. They just didn't want everyone to do the same. reply maerF0x0 9 hours agorootparentThe only way that many people can justify their exceptional success is to assume they themselves are exceptional.

It's such a awful place to work. Companies say they do it to foster collaboration but the truth is its very cheap, and easy to deal with a lot of turnover, which every company I every barn company I ever saw had a lot of.

Student loans are long term, with all the details fixed for the life of the loan. Commercial loans are more fluid, and generally have short terms, adjustable rates, and other fun things. Two possible approaches to leverage quickly come to mind: - The carrot: \"You've got a loan with us for $xM at y%. If you show you are committed to this office by maximizing occupancy, that lowers our risk and we can give you a 0.1% discount.\" - The stick: \"Your loan term is expiring soon. I know it'd hurt to need to make that big balloon payment. Let's discuss our conditions for rolling you over into a new loan.\" reply Lammy 10 hours agoparentprevThe drive to get people back into the office isn't due to any sunk cost on commercial real estate — it's a strategy to prevent workers from working multiple jobs simultaneously. reply lolinder 10 hours agorootparentIs there any evidence that this is actually happening and going undetected in large enough numbers for it to be rational to allow the possibility to dictate the official remote/not-remote policy of large companies?

We have crossed the rubicon on remote work. The shift has been well and truly paradigmed. To choose to restrict your candidate pool to a small geographical location, pay relocation, pay higher salaries, have a lower employee NPS, have higher company carbon emissions, whilst your competitors have a much larger non-geographically constrained talent pool, with more attractive, flexible, family-friendly working conditions and pay less for those employees, making their companies more competitive. It’s a no-brainer. The status quo has completely shifted. Any CEO that doesn’t yet realize that should consider quitting. reply joeax 7 hours agoparentWhat is happening is people who are being forced into RTO are demanding a higher salary.

If a company is no longer limited to just hiring people physically nearby, then you're competing for jobs against a whole lot of people who'd accept much lower salaries. reply LtWorf 1 hour agorootparentCompanies already do that anyway. But they still need to hire people in the same timezone more or less. reply Aloisius 58 minutes agorootparentSome companies do, but most don't as they have trouble managing remote workers.

Timezones are a barrier, but 650 million people live within three timezones of the SF Bay Area. reply atleastoptimal 10 hours agoprevI agree that there is a real difference between being at work vs working from home. You build a connection to the workplace. Your brain shifts into \"work mode\" by default. People talk to each other, culture develops, etc. These are obviously all good things. The problem is, most jobs people do have an element of mindlessness and aren't cutting edge, innovating spaces. Most white-collar jobs people work in are satellite offices of large companies where the day-in day-out is simply maintaining and attending to larger systems, applying general verbal reasoning, keeping up appearances, etc. A lot of it is bullshit work, as has been articulated before. This work, stripped to its productive essence, can be done faster, more efficiently and in a fraction of the 9-5 work day at home, but part of the charade is for employers and managers to not admit this truth. reply al_borland 9 hours agoparentI found a lot of people treat being in the office as the job. They can walk around, socialize, and not really do anything useful, but they are “at work”, so it’s ok. Meanwhile, people at home feel like they need to prove their worth and make sure their impact is being felt, so they work harder. reply MisterBastahrd 8 hours agorootparentMy co-workers now do remote standup, travel to the office to get in around 10:30, and leave at 3 to make it home for 4 and log out at 5.

Better yet, replacing employees with AI solutions is much easier and more convenient without worrying about a physical element.

Give me a break. reply BobaFloutist 9 hours agoparentMy wife has one day a week team office day that they try to keep free from meetings so they can touch base, spend time with the team, and, often, plan a happy-hour event afterwards. It's not quite as flexible as full on remote working, since, yes, we have to be in the same region, but it saves a lot of commute time, gives more flexibility for things like doctors/dentists appointments, would theoretically let her do laundry/dishes relatively easily (I mostly do them), and we could reasonably live a fair amount further away since the commute is only one day a week.

    "originBody": "\"Strong focus on aesthetics\" contributed to collapse of Norway timber bridge Share: Nat Barker11 April 2024 Leave a comment An official report into the collapse of a 10-year-old mass-timber bridge in Norway in August 2022 has criticised the structure's design and construction. Two drivers had to be rescued after the Tretten Bridge, over the Gudbrandsdalslågen river in the Øyer area of southern Norway, gave way as a heavy goods vehicle was crossing. Completed in only 2012, the glulam-and-steel truss bridge was designed by Norwegian architecture studio Plan Arkitekter and engineering firm Norconsult for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA). A recent report by the Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority (NSIA) was critical of parties involved in the bridge's construction and management. Tretten Bridge collapsed in August 2022 as a lorry was crossing \"The investigation has shown that inadequate caution was exercised in the planning, design, inspection and approval of Tretten Bridge, with respect to the risk factors linked to its unconventional design,\" the report said. \"A short construction period, span lengths and reuse of existing foundation were framework conditions for the planning of the bridge,\" it continued. \"These framework conditions, combined with the choice of material and a strong focus on aesthetics, contributed to the structure not being robust.\" Failings over 2016 bridge collapse An earlier report concluded that the bridge most likely collapsed as a result of block shear failure – a type of fracture – in one of its timber diagonal members that had become weak over time. Tretten Bridge was designed while building regulations in Norway were in transition from a national system to European codes. Provisions for this transitional period enabled the project to follow the older national standards, which unlike the Eurocodes did not account for block shear failure. \"In retrospect, all the involved parties can be criticised for selecting and accepting regulations that proved to have a serious shortcoming (block shear failure),\" the NSIA said. Made from glued laminated timber and steel, the bridge had a main span of 70 metres The report also dealt with investigations of Tretten Bridge carried out after the collapse of the similarly constructed Perkolo Bridge in 2016. It found that despite \"serious faults\" being identified at Tretten Bridge around that time, little action was taken by the Norwegian roads authority. Read: The Dezeen guide to bridge design and architecture \"This represents a system failure in the NPRA, reflecting a lack of knowledge about block shear failure, as well as shortcomings in the bridge management system and risk management,\" the report said. \"The NSIA believes that Tretten Bridge should either immediately have been closed or traffic restrictions imposed in 2016 when finding over-utilisation in relation to block shear in several of the bridge's connections,\" it added. Six safety recommendations have been issued based on the investigation, which the NSIA said provide lessons for relevant organisations in Norway and abroad. These include reviewing the process for regulating and approving road-related structures and their materials in Norway and clarification of building regulations. An official investigation has criticised the design and management of the bridge Tretten Bridge was 148 metres long and 10.5 metres wide, with a main span of 70 metres. A report produced by Plan Arkitekter and Norconsult in 2013 gave the bridge a life expectancy of 100 years. \"As far as the Accident Investigation Board is aware, there are no wooden and steel truss bridges in the world that are comparable to Tretten Bridge,\" said the NSIA report (translated from Norwegian). \"The bridge was special both in terms of span length and asymmetry, trusses in the same direction and the combination of wood and steel.\" Aesthetics \"not a governing topic\" The NPRA is currently undertaking steps to improve bridge safety. Four similar bridges to Tretten Bridge will reportedly be rebuilt following inspections carried out after its collapse. Nine of 14 timber bridges that were closed following the incident remained shut or still had restrictions in place as of last month. Plan Arkitetker has designed many of Norway's wooden bridges. \"If you read the conclusion from NSIA you will see that the collapse of the Tretten Bridge was caused by deficient regulations (national code) for building timber structures at the time of planning/construction,\" the studio's Yngve Aartun told Dezeen in a statement. Tretten Bridge stood for just 10 years before it collapsed. Photo by Jan-Tore Egge \"When new regulations (Eurocode) in 2016 revealed a few critical weak joints nothing was done to improve these joints,\" he continued. \"The bridge had a normal time schedule for engineering and construction. The aesthetics was decided by structural and constructional considerations and not a governing topic to decide the structure in the planning process.\" NPRA director general Ingrid Dahl Hovland said the authority is \"well underway\" with measures to address bridge safety. \"We are in the process of signing off on the first measures,\" she said. \"We want to ensure that any nuances between the safety recommendations from NSIA and the package of measures are captured. This work has top priority.\" Norconsult did not respond to a request for comment. The photography is courtesy of the NSIA unless otherwise stated.

Corrosion weakens the steel. It's literally the metal flaking away. All steel corrodes. Even stainless. Once corrosion sets in and the outside of the metal starts to pit, the corrosion speeds up drastically. (The old area vs volume thing, same thing that makes lump coal difficult to ignite while aerosolized coal dust is practically an explosive). Here's a modern US bridge - all steel - that collapsed in Pittsburgh two years ago.

Unfortunately, 178 million trips are taken across these structurally deficient bridges every day. In recent years, though, as the average age of America’s bridges increases to 44 years, the number of structurally deficient bridges has continued to decline; however, the rate of improvements has slowed. A recent estimate for the nation’s backlog of bridge repair needs is $125 billion. We need to increase spending on bridge rehabilitation from $14.4 billion annually to $22.7 billion annually, or by 58%, if we are to improve the condition.

They're either railway bridges (and thus were built strong in the first place) or have been relegated to historic preservation/pedestrian use only.

I don't see how that follows? Lots of steel bridges have failed over the past 130 years. The overwhelming majority of new-built bridges or any material don't fail. People really, really want this to be about \"aesthetics\" because it confirms their priors about being smarter than the rest of the world or whatever. I'm just saying that's 100% bunk and that there's zero evidence for that hypothesis. Architecture has had a \"strong focus on aesthetics\" since the very first stones were piled up to make a temple.

Provisions for this transitional period enabled the project to follow the older national standards, which unlike the Eurocodes did not account for block shear failure. reply 3D30497420 13 hours agoparentKind of. I should have thought the engineers involved would have been good enough to design a bridge that would have lasted more than a decade, even if the regulations weren't as rigorous. reply blackbear_ 13 hours agorootparentSomehow I feel like it's not the engineers who needed the regulations... reply Quekid5 13 hours agorootparentprevOne would hope... but corporate structures can apply a LOT of pressure which can end up impairing judgment or resistance to decisions by higher-level executives.

(It's similar to the more readily/well understood \"peer pressure\", but even more insidious.) reply anigbrowl 8 hours agoparentprevYeah, I'm not sure why the editorial focus on 'aesthetics'. reply btbuildem 12 hours agoprevThat's so strange! Looking through the photos on the page, there's one showing the bridge still intact. It's almost as if someone accidentally flipped the materials -- the members that work in compression are were made of metal, the members under tension, out of lumber. That's the opposite of what each material is naturally strong at. reply ars 11 hours agoparentActually wood is stronger in tensile: \"tensile strength of soft- woods parallel to grain at 12% moisture content generally ranges between 70 to 140MPa. The compression strength is lower and is usually in the range 30 to 60 MPa.\" Steel is similar in strength both ways, although it varies a lot depending on how it was annealed. (The harder the metal the better compression is vs tensile.) reply mitthrowaway2 9 hours agorootparentThis is true but the main concern with compression loads is buckling, which generally happens well before the material yields to normal stress. This means that compression members need to be much stiffer in bending, and so generally bulky and geometrically large, with a big moment of inertia. Whereas tension members can basically just be wire rope. Wood can easily be built up into a much larger cross-section than steel for the same cost and less weight, so it makes sense to use it for compression loads. reply bunabhucan 14 hours agoprevThe actual report with animated video and english subtitles: https://www.nsia.no/Road/Published-reports/2024-03 I translated some of the norweigan paragraps that include \"estetik\" but I can't figure out if they mean \"they should have used steel\" or they mean \"the diagonal members should change direction to keep them in compression\" or both. reply SiempreViernes 14 hours agoparentI think this is the quote that is most relevant > En kombinert stålbjelkebru med betongdekke var mulig, men ble utelukket på grunn av estetikken og begrensningene i veigeometrien under og på brua. which states that aesthetics and road geometry together ruled out a combined steel and concrete bridge. there's also: > Artikkelen beskriver avslutningsvis at det i pre-designfasen var flere retningslinjer knyttet til utformingen av brua. Videre står det at teamet som prosjekterte brua ble påvirket av andre prosjekter på den aktuelle tiden, og at Oppland fylke var et skogsbruksfylke der tre har vært et viktig byggemateriale. Dette, kombinert med fordelene av det lette dekket, medførte at en trebru var det beste alternativet. Kombinasjonen av tre og stål gjorde det også mulig å utforme brua som ønsket, uten ekstra avstivning ved aksene. But in the end the above just amounts to \"they could have built a conventional bridge but wanted something prettier\": basically aesthetics contributed to the collapse because it was the primary reason they built something novel. Had there instead been some site specific geometry that forced a novel solution, one wonders if they had blamed that... reply everybodyknows 12 hours agoparentprevWell, either would work: Steel can be easily fitted to take tension loads; Or the wood could be oriented to be in compression, with the ends butted against other structure thus relieving the bolts of most of the load. Here's one that combines both techniques: https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F... What was done instead concentrated the tension stress onto a small central core section of the member, with rest transferred to wood grain-aligned, therefore weak, sheer faces within the timber. Thanks for the video: To anyone who's spent some time working with wooden garden gates, that's enough to tell the story. reply deanresin 14 hours agoprevThe idea that a \"strong focus on aesthetics\" contributed to the failure of a bridge doesn't make any logical sense. Employing a strong focus on aesthetics doesn't preclude also having the necessary focus on stability and safety. Bridges fail because they were not designed or engineered properly. reply digging 13 hours agoparentI don't agree; to me it states they were so focused on aesthetics that they weren't able to see structural flaws. Like tunnel vision. Seems like the best way to state this phenomenon IMO. reply c048 36 minutes agorootparentIt can also easily mean they were willing on taking risks, like using unproven techniques, skirt close to minimum safety requirements or even ignore certain rules, just so it would look prettier. reply akira2501 13 hours agoparentprev> Employing a strong focus on aesthetics doesn't preclude also having the necessary focus on stability and safety No, you just have to pay a lot more for it, and civil projects don't typically allow for endlessly ballooning budgets. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentAre you familiar with Scandinavian civil projects? They tend to be quite attractive, IMO. reply akira2501 33 minutes agorootparentBuilding pretty things on land is significantly easier than building them over water. Engineering is the art of tradeoffs. You want to pick your \"aesthetics\" battles somewhat carefully. Which also means you're going to want some _solid_ justifications for incorporating them into a retrofit. reply soneca 11 hours agoparentprevHow do you focus in two different things? You can strongly value two (or more) things, but when you decide to focus on something, as I understand the term, you necessarily preclude focusing on another thing. reply deanresin 9 hours agorootparentThey said \"strong focus\" which implies there is a spectrum of focus and that everything falls on that spectrum of focus. I disagree that any amount of focus precludes any focus on something else, especially in this context. On second thought, a camera can only focus on one field. So it would make sense if our language only allowed one focus. But what if we had multiple cameras? Or multiple teams or engineers designing a bridge? Have we gone too far? lol reply kevinpet 9 hours agoparentprevIf you look at the picture while it's standing, the design has the diagonal braces all running the same way. Any homeowner who has knocked together a wooden gate could recognize that as abnormal. If the bridge were standing, I might think \"huh, I guess the did the math and it works fine like this\". But since it's scattered across the riverbed, I guess they didn't. reply blt 13 hours agoprevNever seen a truss where the diagonal members are all one direction like that.

Between the insanely shallow truss depth at the right end of it, and the \"can't tell compression from tension\" decision to slant all the diagonal members in the same direction - that bridge is a poster child for \"I Flunked Engineering 201\". reply trgn 13 hours agorootparentI almost feel like intuition tells you that.

They had to grade separate pedestrians from cars over a freeway and a gigantic parking lot. Universities should be pedestrian focused. The bridge could have been designed correctly. But the fundamental issue was the bridge didn't need to exist. reply jacobgkau 11 hours agorootparentI think that's more of an auxiliary issue than the \"fundamental\" one. Space is limited, and a nice (and non-collapsing) bridge could be more convenient for pedestrians than however things would be laid out on the ground even if there wasn't a road there. Safe bridges should be able to exist, whether one would have been needed in this exact spot in an alternate reality or not. It's also very telling for you to condense \"a freeway and a gigantic parking lot\" down to \"one single driver ever.\" Five motorists wouldn't have been killed by the collapse alone if \"one single driver\" was the only one who ever used it. reply valianteffort 14 hours agoparentprevnext [5 more] [flagged] doctorhandshake 14 hours agorootparenthttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-all-female-responsible... https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/PolitiFact-No-it-was-... reply beans12345 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat on earth are you talking about?
