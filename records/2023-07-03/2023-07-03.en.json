    "content": "World's 1st 'tooth regrowth' medicine moves toward clinical trials in JapanJune 12, 2023 (Mainichi Japan)Japanese version(Getty)Katsu Takahashi, head of the dentistry and oral surgery department at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital, is seen in the city of Osaka's Kita Ward on May 16, 2023. (Mainichi/Mirai Nagira)OSAKA -- A Japanese research team is making progress on the development of a groundbreaking medication that may allow people to grow new teeth, with clinical trials set to begin in July 2024.The tooth regrowth medicine is intended for people who lack a full set of adult teeth due to congenital factors. The team is aiming to have it ready for general use in 2030.In prior animal experiments, the medicine prompted the growth of \"third-generation\" teeth following baby teeth and then permanent adult teeth.\"The idea of growing new teeth is every dentist's dream. I've been working on this since I was a graduate student. I was confident I'd be able to make it happen,\" said Katsu Takahashi, lead researcher and head of the dentistry and oral surgery department at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in the city of Osaka.A new tooth is seen growing in a mouse treated with the tooth regrowth medicine. (Photo provided by Katsu Takahashi, head of the dentistry and oral surgery department at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital)Anodontia is a congenital condition that causes the growth of fewer than a full set of teeth, present in around 1% of the population. Genetic factors are thought to be the major cause for the one-tenth of anodontia patients who lack six or more teeth, a condition categorized as oligodontia. These conditions are also known as tooth agenesis. People who grow up with tooth agenesis struggle with basic abilities like chewing, swallowing and speaking from a young age, which can negatively impact their development.After completing a dentistry degree, Takahashi went on to graduate studies in molecular biology at Kyoto University in 1991. Afterwards, he studied in the U.S.Around that time, research around the world had begun to pinpoint genes that, when deleted, would cause genetically modified mice to grow fewer teeth. \"The number of teeth varied through the mutation of just one gene. If we make that the target of our research, there should be a way to change the number of teeth (people have),\" Takahashi said of his thoughts at the time.Global attentionThe front teeth of a ferret treated with tooth regrowth medicine are seen in a photo provided by Katsu Takahashi, head of the dentistry and oral surgery department at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital. The medicine induced the growth of an additional seventh tooth (center).It was around 2005, when he delved further into the subject at Kyoto University after returning to Japan, that he began to see a bright path for his continued research. The researchers found that mice lacking a certain gene had an increased number of teeth. A protein called USAG-1, synthesized by the gene, was found to limit the growth of teeth. In other words, blocking the action of that protein could allow more teeth to grow.Takahashi's research team narrowed their focus onto USAG-1, and developed a neutralizing antibody medicine able to block the protein's function. In experiments in 2018, mice with a congenitally low number of teeth were given medicine that resulted in new teeth coming through. The research results were published in a U.S. scientific paper in 2021, and gained much attention as the beginnings of the world's first tooth regeneration medicine.Work is now underway to get the drug ready for human use. Once confirmed to have no ill effects on the human body, it will be aimed at treating children aged 2 to 6 who exhibit anodontia. \"We hope to pave the way for the medicine's clinical use,\" Takahashi said.Medicine could be game-changerIf successful, a drug to regenerate teeth may be a game-changer for the entire field of dentistry.Animals including sharks and some reptile species can continuously regrow teeth. It's been assumed that humans only grow two sets of teeth in their lifetime, but in fact, there is evidence that we also have the \"buds\" for a third set.Around 1% of the population exhibits the converse of anodontia: hyperdontia, a congenital condition causing a higher-than-normal number of teeth. According to research by Takahashi's team, one in three such cases manifests as the growth of a third set of teeth. Takahashi believes that in most cases, humans' ability to grow a third set was lost over time.When the researchers applied the drug to ferrets, they grew an additional seventh front tooth. As the new teeth grew in between the existing front teeth and were of the same shape, the medicine is thought to have induced the generation of third-set teeth in the animals.When treatment of teeth is no longer possible due to severe cavities or erosion of the dental sockets, known as pyorrhea, people lose them and need to rely on dental appliances such as dentures. The ability to grow third-generation teeth could change that. \"In any case, we're hoping to see a time when tooth-regrowth medicine is a third choice alongside dentures and implants,\" Takahashi said.For further information or inquiries about Takahashi's research, please visit https://www.kitano-hp.or.jp/toothreg/ (in Japanese).(Japanese original by Mirai Nagira, Science & Environment News Department)Font SizePrintTimeline0Go to The Mainichi Home PageRelated ArticlesTaking a bite out of COVID: Japan study shows good dental care decreases infection rateNagasaki hospital suspends oral surgery after dentists pull wrong teeth 3 years in rowJapan dental fees to jump as palladium prices surge on Ukraine warOsaka Univ. crowdfunds to make big dental models for schools for visually impaired people",

    "content": "JavaScript Gom JabbarYou have been using JavaScript for 10 years. It\u2019s time for your test. You are sitting in front of a computer. The test is simple: you have to open a package.json file and read it. The package.json is full of pain. You have to read it all.You look at version, you haven\u2019t reached 1.0 yet. Semver causes unpleasant memories, but you\u2019ve learned to ignore them for so long that you don\u2019t even notice the tickling sensation in your skull.You wish you used a different name for your package, but some random internet person has squatted that name 7 years ago and never updated their package since. It\u2019s only mildly discomforting. Maybe the test isn\u2019t so bad after all?Both main and browser fields are present, you sense traces of Isomorphic JavaScript. In a flash, you remember requiring fs module from your browser bundle. These memories are very unpleasant. The hacks you had to do to make it work were even more unpleasant.The type is set to module. This has something to do with the migration from requires to imports. Why do we have to care about this, again? The extensive pain you\u2019ve experienced trying to importing ES5 modules from ESM modules and vice versa overwhelms you again.You make your way to scripts. What a hot, painful mess it is. You can\u2019t look at them without your heart rate going to 150. lint, lintall, lintfast, lintdiff. Parallel runs, obscure arguments, double-escaping JSON-formatted arguments. Subcommands calling npm even through you switched to yarn and then pnpm. Thousands of variations, premutations and details make you shiver. Why do these things have to be here? Why do they need to be so complicated?Some scripts still use watchman. Gotta remember to not use symlinks because it doesn\u2019t support them (and the issue has been open since 2015). There\u2019s also this gulp-based script that nobody has the guts to replace with anything else that\u2019s considered more modern. You think that there\u2019s actually no modern version of gulp but it feels outdated and you definitely want to get rid of it. The pains spreads from your head into your neck and shoulders.The pain is barely tolerable when you reach dependencies. So, so many of them. There\u2019s left-pad, the legendary tiny package that broke all internet, collectively causing the amount of pain and drama comparable to the destruction of Alderaan.Every time you modify dependency list, some of the dependencies print out screens-worth of messages to your console, asking for donations, warning about breaking changes. You gave up trying to understand these. You only hope none of them are malicious enough to steal your secrets or ruin your computer. The threat of potential pain of that magnitute is frighting.There\u2019s also moment.js. You love that library, it has a really pleasent API. But the internet decided it\u2019s too \u201cmutable\u201d, too fat, it doesn\u2019t support treeshaking and now you have to migrate to date-fns. You haven\u2019t started yet, but you already feel the painful refactoring in your bones.Looking at every package in that list causes some amount of trauma recall. But what\u2019s even more concerning is that the version of these packages are way behind what\u2019s considered \u201ccurrent\u201d. You know that you should upgrade them. But you also have tried that before and you know how much suffering it brings. Things will break in so many ways, big and loud ways, small and subtle ways.The next thing in this damn file is resolutions. Yes, you remember this one. It\u2019s a suffering you choose to avoid dealing with package upgrades.You scroll down to devDependencies. You can\u2019t remember the time when you only needed non-dev dependencies. Why do we have this split? Yes, right, to cause more pain.eslint. Its configuration got so strict that you can\u2019t even write code anymore. Any small misstep and you get an angry red underline. Your CI is configured to treat any lint problem as the end of the world. It gives a false sense of security to your junior engineers on the team. You survived serveral holy wars on which rules to enable. The pain is proportional to the amount of eslint-ignores you have all over your codebase. There\u2019s a lot.You also notice postcss hiding there. This package is a mystery to you. You don\u2019t use it directly, it\u2019s a requirement of a dependency of a dependency. But it\u2019s the package that\u2019s constantly causing you pain by throwing obscure C++ compilation errors on any new platform you try to npm install on. If CSS itself wasn\u2019t painful enough.Oh, dear jest. It started as a fast test runner. But now it\u2019s big and fat, it depends on some babel packages while the rest of your app is transpiled by a mix of esbuild and swc. Properly configuring it with ESM and TypeScript was a PhD science project.You stop to count how many tools and parsers work on your codebase: TypeScript, esbuild, swc, babel, eslint, prettier, jest, webpack, rollup, terser. You are not sure if you missed any. You are not sure if you want to know. The level of pain is so high you forget about anything else.engines prominently lists node. And while you hate it with the depth of your soul, you are not going to Bun or Deno because you know this will not stop the pain. This will only make the pain worse.It\u2019s the end of the file now. Final closing curly brace. You close the tab and take a breath. Look around. You are still alive, your hands and your brain intact. You survived. For now.Jun 29, 2023Hello!

Courses (stanford.edu)429 points by ecks4ndr0s 18 hours ago | hide | past | favorite | 63 commentsitissid 17 hours ago | next [\u2013]I think the way courses are taught can give you some needed grounding, like you should always take a good linear regression class. But I think that is as far as it gets you, a theoretical base.Honestly the issue is that most ML programs are taught as being some kind of additive skill set: the more courses you take the better or selection of the right kind of courses gets you some where.In reality:1. most real world problems are also about subtraction knowing what not to try and why it might not work. Like when I ask people about Recommendtaion engines for recommending colocated things, people pile on embeddings, in reality its about finding good false negatives to train datasets, calibration of classifier output and those are really hard problem. Embeddings may be necessary but are the least of your worries.2. Most companies will not teach you about the fundamentals of stats; you will be lucky if you can get a mentor in a company that has both the theoretical rigour and the practical implementation skill to solve problems.3. Most ML problems require engineering to work as well, for example you can't use Bayesian MCMC to do most things at scale. Its why Topic models that used statistical models like simulating posterior were crazy expensive on large datasets.replyitissid 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]4. Models are taught like an end, but courses don't teach you to mix them for debugging. They are usually a means to an end for example say you are using decision trees and your models are acting up, you could still try some debugging techniques from linear regression like residual analysis or plotting variable slopes of each variable vs Y to debug before jumping for shapley values.The reason is not that using shapley values is bad, they are great, but you can get a lot of insight by having some base models that are simpler to debug.replygodelski 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think this is because of a misalignment that is even common in plenty of other subjects as well. You know how once you've gained expertise in something that it is difficult to explain because it is so obvious? Kinda what is happening in education. Let me explain.The reason a lot of the theoretical basis is taught is because you need to get the skills to learn why things work, when to use them, when they fail, when not to use them, and __most importantly__ their limitations. The problem is, most of this isn't explained explicitly. Maybe just this process happening for a few decades and momentum. Or that teaching isn't a priority and so no one tries to fix it. (there are exceptions to this. You've all probably met professors that are outstanding and make boring things seem fascinating)But what you're talking about is part of this \"when to use, what to use\" part. It is also why those classes are so boring, because they aren't properly motivated. But it is also why we're running into so many problems: because evaluation is fucking hard. You see models perform really well on research papers but not in the real world but you'll also see researchers evaluating papers purely on singular benchmarks. \"In reality\" you're forced to come to terms with the limitations of the limitations of datasets, as datasets are just proxies and what you are about is the actual generalization. But if we're not discussing and evaluating on actual generalization in research then we get this dichotomy.There's definitely more efficient (tractable) posterior estimators that work at large scale but just a lot of stuff isn't really known unless you're in that niche yourself. Statistics is often taught from the reference of \"here's a bunch of tools and when to use them\" rather than \"here's the problems, our assumptions, and the main tool we use to solve them. It looks different in different settings, but they are actually the same thing.\" So it is kinda problematic, but then again, to get there requires a lot more work and most people aren't going to bother with things like metric theory. So a middle ground approach is taken and it gets jumbled.replymhh__ 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The people with experience also aren't necessarily the ones that end up teaching - which isn't to say the same information can't be conveyed necessarily (e.g. good academics keep up to date with the field in industry) but there is powerful focus that practical experimentation brings.replylolinder 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> most real world problems are also about subtraction knowing what not to try and why it might not workThis is true in most fields. I view school as giving you a broad overview of everything that you might need in your field, but for any given problem it will be on you to narrow it down to the solutions you actually need and then to learn that specific set of solutions well enough to apply it.People fresh out of college will usually try to apply everything all at once until they learn\u2014either from a mentor or their own hard experience\u2014to filter it down. It might be that ML has it worse than other fields right now not because it's taught wrong but because it's new enough that there aren't enough mentors with decades of war stories.replyaaarrm 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]So in your opinion, what is the best way to learn ML in order to try and avoid these issuesreplywodenokoto 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> like you should always take a good linear regression class.Any recommendations for a _good_ linear regression class / course?replyrmbyrro 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-modelhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-in...reply90d 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Large problem with social media ad targeting recommendations.

How are we defining deep? Like you want to understand how they work? The Karpathy videos are good for that. But I wouldn't call this \"deep\".If you want to get down into the weeds and into the mud, you need a hell of a lot more than 13hrs of education. You're also going to have a hard time doing this because most people are going from an engineering perspective of \"enough to work with it\" rather than \"I fundamentally want to understand all inner workings\". If you are the former, then the fastai course and others are great for you. If you want to really get deep though, you're going to need a lot more than programming. You're going to need some pretty advanced maths too: high dimensional statistics, metric theory, and optimization theory are some. (Most researchers aren't doing this btw) But if you do go down this path you'll also be able to understand the full spectrum of generative models and have a clearer picture. But I should also say that there is still a black box element to these models as they are so large that they are near impossible to analyze. But it is definitely achievable to learn a 2 layer transformer autoregressive network and fully understand its inner workings. But programming skills alone won't get you there.replyblueyoda 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks for the helpful advice. What would you recommend to someone who is interested in learning about diffusion models? I have a CS degree but I have 0 knowledge about AI. Things like Stable Diffusion have blown my mind and I\u2019m really interested in learning about this field. Lots of courses out there but I lack the expertise to discern which one is good.replygodelski 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah no problem, this is even closer to my area of focus! What do you know about physics and thermodynamics?I'd say a good intro for low background is from Tomczak[0]. He has a book, but the blog posts are nearly identical. He did a post doc with Max Welling (someone you should learn about if you want to get deep, like I was suggesting before). So I'd switch things up slightly. I'd go Intro -> Autoregressive -> Flow -> VAE -> Hierarchical VAE -> Energy Based Models -> Diffusion. It is worth learning about GANs btw, but this progression should be natural and build up.Continuing from there, you're going to want to learn about things Langevin Dynamics, Score Matching, and so on. Start with Yang Song's blogs[1]. Your goal should be to understand this paper[2]. Once you get there, you should be able to understand the famous DDPM paper[3]. But why we went through Tomczak wasn't just to get a good understanding of diffusion at a deeper level, but because you need these tools to understand Stable Diffusion which really is just Latent Diffusion[4]. This should connect back with Tomczak's 2 Improving VAE papers and you should also be able to understand NVAE.This is probably the quickest way to get you to a good understanding but if you want to dig deeper, which I highly encourage (because there are major issues that people aren't discussing) then you'll need more time. But you'll probably have to tools to do so if you go through this route. Other people I suggest looking into: Diederik Kingma, Ruiqi Gao, Stefano Ermon, Jonathan Ho, Ricky T. Q.

Was one of the first members of the #ai slack channel inviting some people I had in person conversations about AI with.2. I posted _a lot_ in there. Stuff about regulatory updates, people using co-pilot, cool github repos, little demo projects I was working on.3. Now this was pure luck and probably the best thing to push me over the boundary, there was a hackathon. I thought \"Hmm if I make a kick ass demo showcasing generative AI here, a lot of high up people will see it\" - that 100% happened, CTO reached out to me saying demo was great and that people will be in touch.4. I started really digging in to how I could provide value to our existing data team - be that code, deploying things, bringing some of my engineering know how to that team. This point the #ai channel really started to grow and the head of data and engineering started talking to me and directing people my way based on what they saw at the hackathon.5. Did a demo of my hack in the company all hands which the CEO was MC'ing.6. Started having fortnightly 1 to 1s with head of data at this point7. Floated idea of team taking a little subset of good and motivated people from other teams for a short time to investigate and implement LLMs in some small way into our apps. That team has now grown to effectively investigate any and all use cases (internal and external) for generative AI.8. I started reading more theory and also following a bit of a road map for things I should learn to have a better picture of how to actually bring LLMs in some form to production (fine-tuning, vector dbs, functions, guard rails).9. Now I am just building some quick feature in the mobile app to show case the value of the team to exec as quick as I can, which should give us few months cover to work on the thing I am really interested in - multi-arm bandit LLM that uses our existing models.This was pretty much it. Seems trivial, but in between each points was lots of reading, tinkering, working on weekends, but its totally possible.

Yes, for the available resources, if you pick the exact same problem, the exact same NN architecture and exact same hyperparameters, it all works out. But surely they didn't get that on the first try.

It is a bunch of tricks. Fundamentally:If you're saying FizzBuzz doesn't work, presumably you mean that encoding the n directly doesn't work. Neither does encoding n from 0 to 1 or between -1 and 1 (and don't forget: obviously don't use relu with -1 to 1). It doesn't.Neural networks can do a LOT of things, but they cannot deal with numbers. And they certainly cannot deal with natural or real numbers. BUT they can deal with certain encodings.Instead of using the number directly, give one input to the neural network per bit of the number. That will work. Just pass in the last 10 bits of the number.Or cheat and use transformers. Pass in the last 5 generations and have it construct the next FizzBuzz line. That will work. Because it's possible.To make the number-based neural network for FizzBuzz \"perfect\" think about it. The neural network needs to be able to divide by 3 and 5. They can't. You can't fix that. You must make it possible for the neural network to learn the algorithm for dividing by 3 and 5 ... 2, 3 and 5 are relative primes (and actual primes). So \"cheat\" and pass in numbers in base 15 (by one-hot encoding the number mod 15 for example).PM me if you'd like to debug whatever network you have together over zoom or Google meets or whatever.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hotThis may be catastrophically wrong.

Something implicit that's known but not obvious if you look at the first few lectures of the first few courses (or blogs or announcements, etc).You mention bag of tricks and that's indeed one issue but its worse than that because it includes knowing what \"silent problems\" needs a trick applied to it in the first place!Indeed, despite using vectors everywhere, NN are bad with numerical input encoded as themselves! Its almost like the only kind of variables you can have are fixed size enums. That you then encode into vectors that are as far apart as possible, and unit vectors (\"one hot vectors\") do this. But that's not quite it and sometimes you can still some meaningful metric on the input that's preserved in the encoding (example: word embeddings). And so its again unclear what you can give it and what you can't.In this toy example, I have an idea of what the shape of the solution is. But generally I do not and would not know to use a base 15 encoding or to send it the last 5 (or 15) outputs as inputs. I know you already sort of addressed this point in your last few paragraphs.I'm still trying out toy problems at the time so it might be a \"waste\" of your time to troubleshoot these but I'm happy to take you up on the offer. HN doesn't have PMs though.Do you remember when you first learned about the things you are using in your reply here? Was it in a course or just asking someone else who worked on NN for longer?

That\u2019s where I paused currentlyreplymellavora 11 hours ago | parent [\u2013]Shooting from the hip:entropy of a single signal, say a sequence of letters, \"ababababab\" is the scaled \"average\" surprise per letter. So if they are uniformly distributed, each letter is equally likely/unlikely to come next in the sequence, where if instead one letter only 1/1000th of the time (aaa....aaa...aa..a.z.aaaa), then when the rare beast shows up, it is a big surprise, so the total amount of surprise available in the sequence is high.That's entropy.The same thing would be true for a sequence of numbers.But what if there is some relationship? if aaabaa occurs frequently with 111211, if you line up the sequences by timestamp?In this simple case, if you know the letters and you can spot the relationship, then there is zero surprise in the number sequence. The cross entropy \"letters plus numbers\" has the same entropy as \"letters\" or \"numbers\" in isolation.And as you move away from the 1:1 correspondence, you'll see the cross entropy increase until it reaches its max at \"entropy(letters) + entropy(numbers)\" -- no information shared between the two systems.To bring it home, I think of cross entropy as the amount of information shared between two signals.Others might think of it slightly differently.replytczMUFlmoNk 5 hours ago | root | parent [\u2013]Mostly yes, but to your second paragraph:> if instead one letter only 1/1000th of the time (aaa....aaa...aa..a.z.aaaa), then when the rare beast shows up, it is a big surprise, so the total amount of surprise available in the sequence is high\u2026when a Bernoulli distribution is skewed, the maximum surprise is high, yes, but the average surprise (= entropy) is low.

Structure System2. Transport Belt System3. Train System4. Logistic SystemProblems and OptimizationThe Fun PartHow to use FUE5The FutureContributingToday we\u2019ve got a very fun project to talk about: The FUE5 project, explained in this article by Hurricane. It\u2019s Factorio, but 3D! Dreams do come true sometimes. It\u2019s not quite a game, but more of a stunning re-imagining of its visuals. There\u2019s lots of technical details on how this was achieved, so let\u2019s jump in.What is FUE5?FUE5 (short for Factorio in Unreal Engine 5) is an experimental project with a simple goal: to visualize the 2D world of Factorio in 3D space. It was created by 3D artist Hurricane and Factorio modder Nuke during a five month period, starting on January 10th 2023. While many creative people in the Factorio modding community create awesome large-scale mods like Space Exploration, Bob\u2019s mods or Angel\u2019s, we decided to take a slightly different approach. To put it simply, this project is a 3D visualization environment which can import bases from the Factorio game and visually replicate their behavior. It contains no gameplay, however you can fly around and visit your base in 3D.Example of a large-scale factory in the trailer. Don\u2019t mind the missing power poles.How was it done?To even start thinking about a project such as this, it was necessary to model and animate each Factorio asset, be it assembling machine or inserter, from scratch based on the sprites from the game. We\u2019ve used Cinema4D for 3D modelling and Adobe Photoshop for creating the textures. Once the model and textures are done, the entire structure is exported from Cinema4D to FBX format, which is then imported into Unreal Engine 5, where proper shaders are applied - such shaders are usually materials like glass, metal, or even smoke from a chimney.The remodelling process was a lot of fun, but next time we should really ask for the original Factorio models to preserve what\u2019s left of our sanity.It was also necessary to replicate several key systems like belts, trains, and the logistic system. These were created via the native UE5 blueprint node system. We decided to create all the logic for these system after the 3D modelling was mostly finished, since it was necessary to have the correctly sized 3D models placed in 3D space for proper alignment of moving elements such as trains and items on belts. One major step which helped push the project forward was the ingenious idea to export Factorio bases from the game directly, and to then import them into the Unreal Engine environment. This solution saved a lot of time on base building, which would be tedious and wouldn\u2019t look correct if done in Unreal Engine alone.When you don\u2019t know how to code, you just put these nodes together, and if it doesn\u2019t work you just keep adding more and more and become increasingly confused. Suspiciously similar to this factory game I\u2019ve been playing recently.1. Structure SystemThe first major component of FUE5 is the ability to spawn structures in an identical manner to how you\u2019d find them in Factorio. By reading in-game data, we can get building types, their orientation and cable connections. This information is exported as a JSON file via a FUE5 exporter mod directly from inside the game. This file is then read by the FUE5 project, which is enough to visually replicate all structural and vehicular behavior of the actual base.2. Transport Belt SystemApart from spawning the actual 3D models of individual transport belts, we had to figure out the item movement mechanic. This was achieved by representing transport belts as splines. When exporting a Factorio base via the FUE5 exporter, each continuous transport belt segment (a segment of transport belts which are connected and end in a tunnel, end on their own, or are looped) is treated as its own individual system. Once FUE5 reads this data, it constructs a spline for each of these individual systems. These splines then guide the items through the same path they follow in the actual game.3. Train SystemThe train system is quite different to the transport belt system, since replicating train scheduling, signals and locomotive pathing would be very hard to do. Instead, we opted to use the native Factorio system for finding routes the trains should take. For a train to spawn and drive in FUE5, one has to set its destination and give it the green light prior to exporting the base. At this point we can read the train\u2019s pre-calculated path and use it to construct a spline which then dictates the train\u2019s movement in FUE5.4. Logistic SystemRight off the bat we skipped construction robots, since we\u2019re currently spawning buildings via the native UE5 Construction Script system, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gonna stay for a while. What we focused on instead was getting logistic robots to work properly, since they\u2019re the lifeline of any semi-advanced Factorio base and they add a lot of visual interest to the whole picture. Each roboport has a chance to randomly spawn a cluster of logistic robots, where each robot has its own simple brain to search for logistic chests in the vicinity and fly between them to visually replicate resource transportation. After this task of resource transportation is done, the robot will determine the location of the closest roboport and head to it to despawn.Problems and OptimizationThe first major issues became apparent once bigger bases were imported into FUE5 in the early days of the project. The FPS would drop significantly and blueprint events started to produce unreliable results, which is why a lot of optimization work was necessary to even run the project at 30 to 60 FPS.Key optimization decisions revolved around poly count, texture resolution, particles, and the amount of on-tick updates. These had to be drastically reduced by optimizing the transport belt system, which caused a lot of stuttering in the early days of the project. We\u2019ve also gained a lot of FPS by tweaking and optimizing the level of detail (LOD) of the animated parts of structures - such parts include things like the spinning cylinders on centrifuges, or all the gears and pistons on the roof of the assembling machines.You can never have enough iron plates.There was also the need for approval from the Factorio developer Wube Software. When asked about the legality of this whole endeavour, they showed great understanding and allowed the project to be released, provided it won\u2019t be used for commercial purposes.The Fun PartOnce the general idea and most of the prototyping was figured out during the first two months of production, it became quite easy to replicate various Factorio assets and systems. That\u2019s when the time came to really focus on the beauty of the whole thing and creation of the main release trailer, which showcases large-scale bases built using the FUE5 exporter, and a lot of other cool stuff one can do within the FUE5 environment.It was necessary to build a lot of custom stuff for the large-scale factories showcased in the trailer. Just the ability to export Factorio in-game bases doesn\u2019t result in very clean and cinematic results, so there were a lot of tweaks done by hand to make it nice for the camera! It also turned out that spaghetti bases are much more fun visually than the long strips of single buildings optimized for high science per minute (SPM).Is this the Skyblock I\u2019ve been hearing so much about?How to use FUE5This project is not a game, doesn\u2019t have any user interface, and requires basic knowledge of UE5 to use. That being said, you can find a full description of the process on our GitHub page. Apart from installing UE5 and running the downloaded project, the process really comes down to simply selecting the chunk of your base you wish to export, and exporting it to FUE5 as described in the detailed how-to guide. Once you go through the process once, it becomes really easy to repeat.The FutureWe wanted to share this project as open source via GitHub, because the Factorio community is an extremely dedicated group of very creative people, and having access to such a project might allow some of them to experience the world they love in a new dimension. Plus, it might give the more creative ones the ability to create things which were not possible before.Myself and Nuke are currently working on polishing the existing systems so they\u2019re easy to use and perform well even with larger bases. We also started toying around with the idea of adding modded content in the future.The factory must grow!No joke here.

Space exploration takes that and continues. You end up developing a base across multiple worlds in the solar system. After developing the solar system from the different unique resources on each planet you expand to interstellar space and then other solar systems. The game has a 'quarter of the way through' victory screen but there's another victory screen as you explore a mystery that spans the known universe and takes a reasonable amount of math knowledge figure out.It's 100s of hours of gameplay and really well done. They modified the game so that you can fly spaceships between planets with a star and solar system maps and it all works really well.Just make sure to turn the biters way down. The mod requires a level of patience and the intensity of combat runs counter to that (in fact the mod itself has a popup telling you to turn biters down on start).replyCthulhu_ 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah, but I'd only pick up Space Exploration if you've played through the base game a few times and just want more. What I've found is that it rebalances the game so the 'base' takes less parts (i.e. for modules), but it goes harder on complexity. Like, the number of factories / production lines you have to build for the next stage just goes up and up.I think I got to a point - probably nearly 100 hours in - where I finally had two lines of products coming from other planets to do the next tier of science.Another tip that I'd add is that you should increase the science cost, I found it easy to run out of things to research while it still took hours to expand things for the next tier, which in practice meant your factory just stops doing anything because it doesn't need to do anything.replyDylan16807 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Another tip that I'd add is that you should increase the science cost, I found it easy to run out of things to research while it still took hours to expand things for the next tier, which in practice meant your factory just stops doing anything because it doesn't need to do anything.That's not a wrong way to play, but the intent of the default balancing is that you make those expansions smaller and faster. If a new resources has 5 steps to make, you can slap down 2-5 buildings per step with absolutely minimal planning/routing and feed it into a launcher. There's no need to spend hours on an expansion until your science production needs that much. And an orbital base can go very far with one assembler per recipe.replyfphhotchips 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think a lot of people in the community recommend Base game -> Krastorio -> Krastorio+SE.I've done the first two, and I'm quite early into SE.

They\u2019ll still be there on other planets, but the anxiety on the home world is gonereplyAnotherGoodName 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Agreed. The difficulty creep that was demanded by vocal experienced players has made Factorio much harder for newcomers to get into.Factorio is a brilliant Zen garden and an absolutely terrible real time strategy game. Since the beta there's been more and more biter types and a gradual ramp up in how frantic you have to be to keep up. It's tremendously off-putting and completely opposite to what makes Factorio what it is.Hopefully the developers realize this at some point and knock it off. Make a 'frantic mode' toggle for the experienced players but don't make it the default. I can handle needed a turret or two at key points but I can't handle needing to race the tech tree to keep up. I don't get why they made the defaults so hostile to new players. I'm not even that new to Factorio but it's still waaaay too frantic with default settings.replypmoriarty 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I actually liked having the biters on my first couple of playthroughs of the game. It added a sense of urgency and a feeling that this was a dangerous alien world.After that I started playing mods that in and of themselves increased the difficulty of the game, and having the biters on top of that was just way too much.Also, in a vanilla game, once you're more or less invulnerable to the biters they become just an extra annoyance, and I'd rather just focus on building.On the other hand, without the sense of urgency that biters give the game can become kind of boring...replynovember84 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I second this. Played with a friend some 150hrs and eventually started a new game with more mods and crazier biter levels ultimately increasing complexity and build formulas.It was so nerve wracking I felt like progress was so much slower due to all the fighting. After maybe 50 hrs in we realized the krastorio mod want being called correctly, so when we fixed that we learned all the new complex recipes were obsolete and all our defense were useless due to the restructuring of ammo typesSo I guess my point is. Bitters have a time and place and I'm over them.replyTOMDM 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The other harsh lesson biters teach you as a new player is to restart with what you're learned so far.Your second or third base always goes so much smootherreplyz3c0 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I agree. It adds pacing, as you can't simply dive down one branch of the technology tree. You're forced to always be developing your offense and defense, pushing you down branches you would have ignored otherwise.replypram 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]IMO the bugs add some needed entropy. If you\u2019re not paying attention your bases will eventually be demolished. Makes me more thoughtful about my planning and design rather than just plopping some half assed shit down.replyleetcrew 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]they're also the entity that gives \"bite\" (pun intended) to the pollution mechanic, which complicates lots of tradeoffs in the game. with biters/pollution, trees are both an inconvenience and a helpful pollution buffer. it's not trivial to decide whether to build your starter base in the open desert or nested between forests. additionally, the tradeoffs between solar vs steam and the effect modules are shallower when you ignore pollution.I understand some people just aren't really into the tower defense side of factorio. that's okay, and it's a good thing that the settings can be adjusted to suit a wide range of playstyles. but if that's you, I'd recommend at least trying a low pollution / efficiency-focused playthrough. the game gives you a lot of tools to manage pollution, and the biter threat can be pretty minimal if you use them. imo this preserves the balance better than just turning off biters.replyevandale 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]My understanding is that the purpose of biters is to prevent you from building too big too fast and also as a resource sink to get rid of excess iron. There is a FFF they wrote about it and Katherine of Sky has a great video about why you should bet biters IIRC because she was against them when they got buffed as well but changed her tune. I can't seem to find either though.replyAardwolf 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Many of my fun memories of Factorio do involve biters though, both defending against them, and attacking them by building power lines and quickly building and then un-building laser towers near their bases (and later just by having super strong armor and a shotgun).But I guess a toned down offense on your base, while still allowing the same kind of attack, would work just as well.Also, the biters are somewhat boring at end of game, it's just the whole world map full of the exact same evolved bases everywhere.replyrcxdude 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I don't recall thinking the biters were at all frantic on default settings. They shape your play, but they don't really push things hard in my experience. I get why people play with them off (though I reckon a lot more it's because people wind up finding them boring after the first few runs), but I don't think it's obvious that it's something that should be the default for new players.replyDylan16807 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> needing to race the tech tree to keep upIs that actually how it ends up going? Unless your base is extremely small, then going slower means less pollution reaches the biters and they evolve slower.If you won't have 20 drills going after several hours, \"play the tutorial\" is probably the best advice.\"Don't start in the middle of a treeless wasteland\" is also important advice.replyxavdid 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I mostly play for the engineering side of it, so in all my bases over the years, I always always play on \"peaceful\" mode. It makes part of the tech tree useless (no need for better guns if there's nothing to shoot) but I find I enjoy the game much more that way.replyzargon 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I haven't played mods, but in vanilla Factorio I have never felt rushed at all by biters.replyikiris 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The vanilla biters are brain dead simple to deal with if you\u2019re at all competent.replyBlueTemplar 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm not sure I agree. I gave up on my first sandbox game of Factorio mid-way through, because I realized that biters were a pushover against my new tank... (not realizing that biter settings or mods existed)replylowbloodsugar 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]There are games where there needs to be some investment, something at stake, for the game to be fun. Playing such a game on easy makes it less fun and eliminates the satisfaction of overcoming challenges. I wondered if this might be the case with factorio, so in my second year of playing it, I launched a deathworld map. Nope, it was just tedious as I thought it would be. Launched the rocket and never played with biters again.The obvious missing piece is biter-clearance automation. The game is about increasing levels of automation. The next level after we get laser turrets and we get flying bots should be reaper drones with lasers that automatically patrol and eliminate biters within a large range. Also, I've put several thousand rockets into space (4K SPM baby), but I can't fire a nuclear weapon more than 54 meters?replyBlueTemplar 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's what the train artillery (and now spidertrons) are for.Of course there are also mods, like M.I.R.V., by one of the devs :https://youtu.be/k56fS2XygxMreplyhesdeadjim 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I've found the other planets to be the real PITA that got old quick.

I want to start with robots instead of remaking my base midway through.replysrgpqt 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Haven\u2019t tried it, but this seems like something you can customize ingame at any time with the builtin map editor.See the \u201csetting up research\u201d on the editor wiki page:https://wiki.factorio.com/Map_editor#Setting_up_researchEdit: you\u2019d probably have to give yourself the necessary modular armor, roboport and initial bots.replyOkayPhysicist 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The biggest issue with biters, IMO, is that their density continues to ramp beyond you capping out your ability to efficiently eliminate them.In my (normal level biter) space exploration run, my buddy and i didn't run into any problems clearing out a large swath of space to build by rushing artillery and flamethrower turrents. The problem became the tedium of expanding our territory to keep the pollution cloud contained by manually firing artillery.IMO, the problem should be solved by giving the player better tools for artillery automation. The auto-firing artillery is both too short range, and has a tendency to anger a bunch of nests at once. Instead, it should focus on eliminating one nest cluster at a time, and maybe allow for circuit-controlled timing of when to move into the next cluster.replyArubis 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If \u201cinterplanetary Factorio\u201d is your thing, also consider Dyson Sphere Program: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Prog...replydave_sullivan 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I actually prefer it over Factorio, spent a fair bit of time in both.reply130e13a 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]another modpack that should be mentioned here is pyanodons [0]. similar to space exploration it also extends the game significantly after the rocket launch, but it also adds additional content before (in fact, the rocket launch itself becomes rather unimportant and is an at first optional blue science tech)pyanodons adds very realistic ore processing chains, petrochemical processes (the main developer, pyanodon, is a chemical engineer by trade), energy generation mechanisms, electronics overhauls, and also farming components including both plants and animals.overall, a full py run will easily take 1500+ hours. it's probably not particularly enjoyable for most vanilla players, but if you liked mods such as space exploration or nullius, you might find some enjoyment in py[0]: https://mods.factorio.com/user/pyanodonreplyEMM_386 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> another modpack that should be mentioned here is pyanodonsFor the sake of anyone's sanity, I wouldn't mention that.replyautomatic6131 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]>1500+ hoursAhh, so if I start a game now, and play a reasonable (dedicated, honestly) 2 hours a night, every day, I'll have completed it in 2025.Wild.

I ended up stopping because the factory design started getting tedious. I had all the requisite ingredients coming in on neat belts (city blocks / LTS delivered) and the lines were modeled in Factory Planner, but just assembling them for each science pack was a larger and larger amount of tedium: not any new challenge, just tons of belt weaving and inserter adjusting.I'm willing to be told I'm just doing it wrong, but does vanilla + Space Exploration have a different sort of challenge curve, or would it end up being pretty similar to Seablock (which includes SpaceX, dunno if that's the same or different).replyAnotherGoodName 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It has tedium in the science imho but it's low enough bandwidth that I solved that with logistic chests without ever falling behind on science.The larger aspect is effectively restarting repeatedly on new worlds which have unique new resources until they too are shipping rockets of stuff into space. Each new world has different properties. Some have almost no solar, others no water, some have no bugs, but others have bugs dropping in from space anywhere on your base so it's not the same thing each time. I don't mind this aspect. It is a bit like playing Factorio on repeat but it has reasoning behind it. And each restart you get to bring a cargo rocket of stuff with you and the ability to build anything you've already researched.My outpost worlds are often messy and do the bare minimum to send up rockets of stuff to space. But it works. I'm finding it fun but I'm only a couple of hundred hours in.replyduskwuff 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> I'm willing to be told I'm just doing it wrong, but does vanilla + Space Exploration have a different sort of challenge curveCompletely different. The SpaceX mod used as an endgame in Seablock has no relation to Space Exploration.Space Exploration makes pervasive changes throughout the game, and adds the ability to launch yourself into space, build a space station, build colonies on other planets, and mine resources on other planets (and elsewhere) which aren't available on the starting planet. The research required for the first rocket launch is reduced, and there are multiple tracks of research unlocked once you get into space.replyrcxdude 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]yes, space exploration (which is a different mod entirely), aims to introduce new automation challenges instead of simply extending the same kind of challenges as in the base game (though it also does a little of that: it'll probably take you a bit longer to launch a rocket than in vanilla and that's more or less the start of SE, but it's nowhere near as slow as seablock). It basically requires use of the circuit network, for example (though the required use is relatively simple, it benefits from more advanced usage).replyBlueTemplar 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The old and the new SpaceX are completely different mods, by different people.replylouwrentius 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I\u2019m playing Space Exploration right now and it is epic.

    "content": "AMD CPU Use Among Linux Gamers Approaching 70% MarketshareWritten by Michael Larabel in AMD on 2 July 2023 at 01:10 PM EDT. 66 CommentsBesides being curious about the Steam Survey results for indicating the size of the Linux gaming marketshare as an overall percentage, one of the interesting metrics we are curious about each month is the AMD vs. Intel CPU marketshare for Linux gaming. AMD has been on quite an upward trajectory among Linux gamers/enthusiasts in recent years not only for their Radeon graphics cards with their popular open-source driver stack but their Ryzen CPUs have become extremely popular with Linux users. With the new Steam Survey results for June, AMD CPUs are found on nearly 70% of Linux gaming systems polled by Steam.The June results put the AMD CPU marketshare for Linux users at 67%, a remarkable 7% increase month-over-month. In part that's due to the Steam Deck being powered by an AMD SoC but it's been a trend building for some time of AMD's increasing Ryzen CPU popularity among Linux users to their open-source driver work and continuing to build more good will with the community.In comparison, last June the AMD CPU Linux gaming marketshare came in at 45% while Intel was at 54%. Or at the start of 2023, AMD CPUs were at a 55% marketshare among Linux gamers. Or if going back six years, AMD CPU use among Linux gamers was a mere 18% during the early Ryzen days.It's also the direct opposite on the Windows side. When looking at the Steam Survey results for June limited to Windows, there Intel has a 68% marketshare to AMD at 32%.Beyond the Steam Deck, it's looking like AMD's efforts around open-source drivers, AMD expanding their Linux client (Ryzen) development efforts over the past two years, promises around OpenSIL, and other efforts commonly covered on Phoronix are paying off for AMD in wooing over their Linux gaming customer base.66 Comments",
    "summary": "- The market share of AMD CPUs among Linux gamers is approaching 70% according to the latest Steam Survey results for June.\n- AMD's increasing popularity can be attributed to their Ryzen CPUs and open-source driver stack, which have gained favor among Linux users.\n- This trend marks a significant increase from just 18% six years ago, and it highlights AMD's success in winning over the Linux gaming community.",

To some extent you could say the entire cause of this is that governments allow multinational companies to exist at all).Value production for the internet was mostly done for free. Both where it comes to end users and the hosting they needed. And yes, sometimes by \"wasting investor dollars\" (of course investigating new things, wasting dollars, is exactly what investment is supposed to do, that it does that is why investment is allowed).And ironically this goes multiple steps up the value chain. Users and mods are complaining to reddit that they don't \"pay\" them enough. Reddit is complaining that Google/FB/even OpenAI at the moment don't \"pay\" them enough by trying to take in ads directly, and presumably training their own AIs soon on \"their\" data. Elon Musk is complaining that he's providing data for free (it's even costing him some money, even though not anywhere close to the amount he implies) and not getting the dollars AI companies are attracting with \"his (users)\" data.The real value in OpenAI is that Google's position is that they are the arbiter of where users go. Users decide where to put their attention 99% ... and Google 1% (and FB 0.1%, and reddit 0.01%). But OpenAI is a serious threat to Google's 1%, because it can give better answers and therefore will have the perfect, most expensive, place to put ads if things keep going the way they're going.For Google this is a lose-lose proposition. Either they win, get to keep their position because they get the best Chatbot. However, running this chatbot is much more expensive than Google search (and they will need to restart their revenue optimization with angry shareholders screaming at them. There is no adwordsLLM yet). So they'll need to run a much more expensive internet scrape on a regular basis, and figure out how to run ads on this new platform, just to maintain the position they currently still have. Shareholders don't care, they just want to see Google's dollar amounts go up 20% per year as they did for a decade. And if Google doesn't do this massive investment? Well, they may lose everything.Funny how apt the old Futurama joke has become \"the internet has always been about the free and open exchange of somebody else's ideas\".Futurama meant Napster. But Reddit has exactly this business model. Google has exactly this business model. Twitter ... etc. I bet the tech sector has actually made more money on this than even the most absurd claims of the RIAA say Napster has cost them.replymumblemumble 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> OpenAI is a serious threat to Google's 1%, because it can give better answersIt does seem to give better answers.But I don't think that's necessarily indicative of which kind of technology is capable of giving better search results. Google isn't what it was 20 years ago, so I don't think that what Google is now is terribly indicative of what their core technology is capable of being. They've largely allowed their search service to sink into a quagmire of content farms. They occasionally make a vague swipe at dealing with the absolute worst of it, but for the longest time they've had little incentive to put too much effort into it because these same content farms produce a sizable chunk of their ad revenue.And they won't go down without a fight. I can't imagine it will be that easy for their crown to be wrested away by a chatbot with stratospheric operating costs that's been jerry-rigged into an ersatz search engine that nobody can afford to \"reindex\" more often than once every couple years. I wouldn't be surprised if a few rounds of proximal policy optimization costs more than it would cost Google to apply some proper attention to their search result quality.replyjoeythedolphin 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Their service also got destroyed by SEO.

There are several options:- Increase wages, as you suggest. This is of course only one option.- Increase benefits. Healthcare, daycare, commute / housing / educational supports, etc.- Expand workforce. Hire additional employees.- Expand business. This might entail expanding or improving a location, opening additional location, going into multiple lines of business, or aquiring other organisations.- Expand endowment. This is particularly the case for many educational institutions, and those endowments may range into the billions of dollars.Generally you'll find these options discussed in a long term capital plan or similar strategy document.For specific forms of business organisation, such as a co-operative business (which may or may not be a not-for-profit organisation), there may also be dividend payouts to members. My understanding is that these are not equivalent to stock dividends, though I'm hazy on details.What you don't see for non-profits, however, is a mandated and frequently automatic form of return to shareholders, through either stock dividends or inflating the value of a joint stock issue. That cuts two ways: not-for-profits don't have the financial drag of spilling out money to investors, but they also typically have less access to financial capital markets.replybadtension 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I wonder what kind of business this is?

If an organization is arranged as, say, a limited-liability company, then it is a business no matter what its goals are.

Of course, most of the time it\u2019s profit.replygrepfru_it 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If it is an LLC, then each employee would have to be a member to exercise control and have the legal standing to request profits from the company. An LLC does NOT have a requirement to maximize shareholder profit because there are no shareholders, just members. An LLC has a max number of members and members are required to maintain their portion of tax liability (this means they will owe a % of tax due or receive a % of tax refunds). This overwhelmingly means employees are NOT part of the LLC, as all it would take is one employee not paying their taxes for the entire LLC to be at risk (also this is why investors will run like the wind from an LLC raising money). An LLC CAN have an employment contract where they offer paper shares, which can translate to profit sharing but they are called paper shares because they are unsecured debts and are literally worth nothing in the event of bankruptcy.They could be a C corp (could also be an S corp but that comes with a 100 share holder limit), but then they have a duty to maximize profit to the shareholders. In a private corporation, the shareholders may be less inclined to sue, but the option is still there and as such the CEO must work to ensure the company is profitable. If they decide to share all profits with the employees, and the employees are majority shareholders, then this likely falls within the sphere of maximize profits.There are things like a publicly-traded LLP which allows employees to own a portion of the company while offloading tax liabilities to the shareholder, but that is usually limited to companies which depend on depleting natural resources (think oil, gas, coal, lithium, etc)replylsaferite 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Any multi-party LLC I've been part of, and it's been more than a few, has provisions about tax liabilities and allowed the LLC to forcefully pay them.

Flattening uses an arena that only holds one type, so it\u2019s actually just a plain array, and you can use array indices where you would otherwise need pointers. We\u2019ll focus here on flattening abstract syntax trees (ASTs), but the idea applies to any pointer-laden data structure.To learn about flattening, we\u2019ll build a basic interpreter twice: first the normal way and then the flat way. Follow along with the code in this repository, where you can compare and contrast the two branches. The key thing to notice is that the changes are pretty small, but we\u2019ll see that they make a microbenchmark go 2.4\u00d7 faster. Besides performance, flattening also brings some ergonomics advantages that I\u2019ll outline.A Normal ASTLet\u2019s start with the textbook way to represent an AST. Imagine the world\u2019s simplest language of arithmetic expressions, where all you can do is apply the four basic binary arithmetic operators to literal integers. Some \u201cprograms\u201d you can write in this language include 42, 0 + 14 * 3, and (100 - 16) / 2.Maybe the clearest way to write the AST for this language would be as an ML type declaration:type binop = Add | Sub | Mul | Divtype expr = Binary of binop * expr * expr     | Literal of intBut for this post, we\u2019ll use Rust instead. Here are the equivalent types in Rust:enum BinOp { Add, Sub, Mul, Div }enum Expr {  Binary(BinOp, Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),  Literal(i64),}If you\u2019re not a committed Rustacean, Box<Expr> may look a little weird, but that\u2019s just Rust for \u201ca plain ol\u2019 pointer to an Expr.\u201d In C, we\u2019d write Expr* to mean morally the same thing; in Java or Python or OCaml, it would just be Expr because everything is a reference by default.1With the AST in hand, we can write all the textbook parts of a language implementation, like a parser, a pretty-printer, and an interpreter. All of them are thoroughly unremarkable. The whole interpreter is just one method on Expr:fn interp(&self) -> i64 {  match self {    Expr::Binary(op, lhs, rhs) => {      let lhs = lhs.interp();      let rhs = rhs.interp();      match op {        BinOp::Add => lhs.wrapping_add(rhs),        BinOp::Sub => lhs.wrapping_sub(rhs),        BinOp::Mul => lhs.wrapping_mul(rhs),        BinOp::Div => lhs.checked_div(rhs).unwrap_or(0),      }    }    Expr::Literal(num) => *num,  }}My language has keep-on-truckin\u2019 semantics; every expression eventually evaluates to an i64, even if it\u2019s not the number you wanted.2For extra credit, I also wrote a little random program generator. It\u2019s also not all that interesting to look at; it just uses a recursively-increasing probability of generating a literal so it eventually terminates. Using fixed PRNG seeds, the random generator enables some easy microbenchmarking. By generating and then immediately evaluating an expression, we can measure the performance of AST manipulation without the I/O costs of parsing and pretty-printing.You can check out the relevant repo and try it out:$ echo '(29 * 3) - 9 * 5' | cargo run$ cargo run gen_interp # Generate and immediately evaluate a random program.Flattening the ASTThe flattening idea has two pieces:Instead of allocating Expr objects willy-nilly on the heap, we\u2019ll pack them into a single, contiguous array.Instead of referring to children via pointers, Exprs will refer to their children using their indices in that array.Let\u2019s look back at the doodle from the top of the post. We want to use a single Expr array to hold all our AST nodes. These nodes still need to point to each other; they\u2019ll now do that by referring to \u201cearlier\u201d slots in that array. Plain old integers will take the place of pointers.If that plan sounds simple, it is\u2014it\u2019s probably even simpler than you\u2019re thinking. The main thing we need is an array of Exprs. I\u2019ll use Rust\u2019s newtype idiom to declare our arena type, ExprPool, as a shorthand for an Expr vector:struct ExprPool(Vec<Expr>);To keep things fancy, we\u2019ll also give a name to the plain old integers we\u2019ll use to index into an ExprPool:struct ExprRef(u32);The idea is that, everywhere we previously used a pointer to an Expr (i.e., Box<Expr> or sometimes &Expr), we\u2019ll use an ExprRef instead. ExprRefs are just 32-bit unsigned integers, but by giving them this special name, we\u2019ll avoid confusing them with other u32s. Most importantly, we need to change the definition of Expr itself: enum Expr {-  Binary(BinOp, Box<Expr>, Box<Expr>),+  Binary(BinOp, ExprRef, ExprRef),   Literal(i64), }Next, we need to add utilities to ExprPool to create Exprs (allocation) and look them up (dereferencing). In my implementation, these little functions are called add and get, and their implementations are extremely boring. To use them, we need to look over our code and find every place where we create new Exprs or follow a pointer to an Expr. For example, our parse function used to be a method on Expr, but we\u2019ll make it a method on ExprPool instead:-fn parse(tree: Pair<Rule>) -> Self {+fn parse(&mut self, tree: Pair<Rule>) -> ExprRef {And where we used to return a newly allocated Expr directly, we\u2019ll now wrap that in self.add() to return an ExprRef instead. Here\u2019s the match case for constructing a literal expression: Rule::number => {   let num = tree.as_str().parse().unwrap();-  Expr::Literal(num)+  self.add(Expr::Literal(num)) }Our interpreter gets the same treatment. It also becomes an ExprPool method, and we have to add self.get() to go from an ExprRef to an Expr we can pattern-match on:-fn interp(&self) -> i64 {+fn interp(&self, expr: ExprRef) -> i64 {-  match self {+  match self.get(expr) {That\u2019s about it. I think it\u2019s pretty cool how few changes are required\u2014see for yourself in the complete diff. You replace Box<Expr> with ExprRef, insert add and get calls in the obvious places, and you\u2019ve got a flattened version of your code. Neat!But Why?Flattened ASTs come with a bunch of benefits. The classic ones most people cite are all about performance:Locality. Allocating normal pointer-based Exprs runs the risk of fragmentation. Flattened Exprs are packed together in a contiguous region of memory, which is good for spatial locality. Your data caches will work better because Exprs are more likely to share a cache line, and even simple prefetchers will do a better job of predicting which Exprs to load before you need them. A sufficiently smart memory allocator might achieve the same thing, especially if you allocate the whole AST up front and never add to it, but using a dense array removes all uncertainty.Smaller references. Normal data structures use pointers for references; on modern architectures, those are always 64 bits. After flattening, you can use smaller integers\u2014if you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll never need more than 4,294,967,295 AST nodes, you can get by with 32-bit references, like we did in our example. That\u2019s a 50% space savings for all your references, which could amount to a substantial overall memory reduction in pointer-heavy data structures like ASTs. Smaller memory footprints mean less bandwidth pressure and even better spatial locality. And you might save even more if you can get away with 16- or even 8-bit references for especially small data structures.Cheap allocation. In flatland, there is no need for a call to malloc every time you create a new AST node. Instead, provided you pre-allocate enough memory to hold everything, allocation can entail just bumping the tail pointer to make room for one more Expr. Again, a really fast malloc might be hard to compete with\u2014but you basically can\u2019t beat bump allocation on sheer simplicity.Cheap deallocation. Our flattening setup assumes you never need to free individual Exprs. That\u2019s probably true for many, although not all, language implementations: you might build up new subtrees all the time, but you don\u2019t need to reclaim space from many old ones. ASTs tend to \u201cdie together,\u201d i.e., it suffices to deallocate the entire AST all at once. While freeing a normal AST entails traversing all the pointers to free each Expr individually, you can deallocate a flattened AST in one fell swoop by just freeing the whole ExprPool.I think it\u2019s interesting that many introductions to arena allocation tend to focus on cheap deallocation (#4) as the main reason to do it. The Wikipedia page, for example, doesn\u2019t (yet!) mention locality (#1 or #2) at all. You can make an argument that #4 might be the least important for a compiler setting\u2014since ASTs tend to persist all the way to the end of compilation, you might not need to free them at all.Beyond performance, there are also ergonomic advantages:Easier lifetimes. In the same way that it\u2019s easier for your computer to free a flattened AST all at once, it\u2019s also easier for humans to think about memory management at the granularity of an entire AST. An AST with n nodes has just one lifetime instead of n for the programmer to think about. This simplification is quadruply true in Rust, where lifetimes are not just in the programmer\u2019s head but in the code itself. Passing around a u32 is way less fiddly than carefully managing lifetimes for all your &Exprs: your code can rely instead on the much simpler lifetime of the ExprPool. I suspect this is why the technique is so popular in Rust projects. As a Rust partisan, however, I\u2019ll argue that the same simplicity advantage applies in C++ or any other language with manual memory management\u2014it\u2019s just latent instead of explicit.Convenient deduplication. A flat array of Exprs can make it fun and easy to implement hash consing or even simpler techniques to avoid duplicating identical expressions. For example, if we notice that we are using Literal expressions for the first 128 nonnegative integers a lot, we could reserve the first 128 slots in our ExprPool just for those. Then, when someone needs the integer literal expression 42, our ExprPool don\u2019t need to construct a new Expr at all\u2014we can just produce ExprRef(42) instead. This kind of game is possible with a normal pointer-based representation too, but it probably requires some kind of auxiliary data structure.Performance ResultsSince we have two implementations of the same language, let\u2019s measure those performance advantages. For a microbenchmark, I randomly generated a program with about 100 million AST nodes and fed it directly into the interpreter (the parser and pretty printer are not involved). This benchmark is not very realistic: all it does is generate and then immediately run one enormous program. Some caveats include:I reserved enough space in the Vec<Expr> to hold the whole program; in the real world, sizing your arena requires more guesswork.I expect this microbenchmark to over-emphasize the performance advantages of cheap allocation and deallocation, because it does very little other work.I expect it to under-emphasize the impact of locality, because the program is so big that only a tiny fraction of it will fit the CPU cache at a time.Still, maybe we can learn something.I used Hyperfine to compare the average running time over 10 executions on my laptop.3 Here\u2019s a graph of the running times (please ignore the \u201cextra-flat\u201d bar; we\u2019ll cover that next). The plot\u2019s error bars show the standard deviation over the 10 runs. In this experiment, the normal version took 3.1 seconds and the flattened version took 1.3 seconds\u2014a 2.4\u00d7 speedup. Not bad for such a straightforward code change!Of that 2.4\u00d7 performance advantage, I was curious to know how much comes from each of the four potential advantages I mentioned above. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know how to isolate most of these effects\u2014but #4, cheaper deallocation, is especially enticing to isolate. Since our interpreter is so simple, it seems silly that we\u2019re spending any time on freeing our Exprs after execution finishes\u2014the program is about to shut down anyway, so leaking that memory is completely harmless.So let\u2019s build versions of both of our interpreters that skip deallocation altogether4 and see how much time they save. Unsurprisingly, the \u201cno-free\u201d version of the flattened interpreter takes about the same amount of time as the standard version, suggesting that it doesn\u2019t spend much time on deallocation anyway. For the normal interpreter, however, skipping deallocation takes the running time from 3.1 to 1.9 seconds\u2014it was spending around 38% of its time just on freeing memory!Even comparing the \u201cno-free\u201d versions head-to-head, however, the flattened interpreter is still 1.5\u00d7 faster than the normal one. So even if you don\u2019t care about deallocation, the other performance ingredients, like locality and cheap allocation, still have measurable effects.Bonus: Exploiting the Flat RepresentationSo far, flattening has happened entirely \u201cunder the hood\u201d: arenas and integer offsets serve as drop-in replacements for normal allocation and pointers. What could we do if we broke this abstraction layer\u2014if we exploited stuff about the flattened representation that isn\u2019t true about normal AST style?The idea is to build a third kind of interpreter that exploits an extra fact about ExprPools that arises from the way we built it up. Because Exprs are immutable, we have to construct trees of them \u201cbottom-up\u201d: we have to create all child Exprs before we can construct their parent. If we build the expression a * b, a and b must appear earlier in their ExprPool than the * that refers to them. Let\u2019s bring that doodle back again: visually, you can imagine that reference arrows always go backward in the array, and data always flows forward.Let\u2019s write a new interpreter that exploits this invariant. Instead of starting at the root of the tree and recursively evaluating each child, we can start at the beginning of the ExprPool and scan from left to right. This iteration is guaranteed to visit parents after children, so we can be sure that the results for subexpressions will be ready when we need them. Here\u2019s the whole thing:fn flat_interp(self, root: ExprRef) -> i64 {  let mut state: Vec<i64> = vec![0; self.0.len()];  for (i, expr) in self.0.into_iter().enumerate() {    let res = match expr {      Expr::Binary(op, lhs, rhs) => {        let lhs = state[lhs.0 as usize];        let rhs = state[rhs.0 as usize];        match op {          BinOp::Add => lhs.wrapping_add(rhs),          BinOp::Sub => lhs.wrapping_sub(rhs),          BinOp::Mul => lhs.wrapping_mul(rhs),          BinOp::Div => lhs.checked_div(rhs).unwrap_or(0),        }      }      Expr::Literal(num) => num,    };    state[i] = res;  }  state[root.0 as usize]}We use a dense state table to hold one result value per Expr. The state[i] = res line fills this vector up whenever we finish an expression. Critically, there\u2019s no recursion\u2014binary expressions can get the value of their subexpressions by looking them up directly in state. At the end, when state is completely full of results, all we need to do is return the one corresponding to the requested expression, root.This \u201cextra-flat\u201d interpreter has two potential performance advantages over the recursive interpreter: there\u2019s no stack bookkeeping for the recursive calls, and the linear traversal of the ExprPool could be good for locality. On the other hand, it has to randomly access a really big state vector, which could be bad for locality.To see if it wins overall, let\u2019s return to our bar chart from earlier. The extra-flat interpreter takes 1.2 seconds, compared to 1.3 seconds for the recursive interpreter for the flat AST. That\u2019s marginal compared to how much better flattening does on its own than the pointer-based version, but an 8.2% performance improvement ain\u2019t nothing.My favorite observation about this technique, due to a Reddit comment by Bob Nystrom, is that it essentially reinvents the idea of a bytecode interpreter. The Expr structs are bytecode instructions, and they contain variable references encoded as u32s. You could make this interpreter even better by swapping out our simple state table for some kind of stack, and then it would really be no different from a bytecode interpreter you might design from first principles. I just think it\u2019s pretty nifty that \u201cmerely\u201d changing our AST data structure led us directly from the land of tree walking to the land of bytecode.Further ReadingI asked on Mastodon a while back for pointers to other writing about data structure flattening, and folks really came through (thanks, everybody!). Here are some other places it came up in a compilers context:Mike Pall attributes some of LuaJIT\u2019s performance to its \u201clinear, pointer-free IR.\u201d It\u2019s pointer-free because it\u2019s flattened.Concordantly, a blog post explaining the performance of the Sorbet type-checker for Ruby extols the virtues of using packed arrays and replacing 64-bit pointers with 32-bit indices.The Oil shell project has a big collection of links all about \u201ccompact AST representation,\u201d much of which boils down to flattening.Beyond just language implementation, similar concepts show up in other performance-oriented domains. I admit that I understand this stuff less, especially the things from the world of video games:A line of work from Purdue and Indiana is about compiling programs to operate directly on serialized data. Gibbon in particular is pretty much a translator from \u201cnormal\u201d-looking code to flattened implementations.Flattening-like ideas appear a lot in data-oriented design, a broadly defined concept that I only partially understand. For example, Andrew Kelley argues in a talk on the topic for using indices in place of pointers.Check out this overview of arena libraries in Rust and its discussion of the ergonomics of arena-related lifetimes.Here\u2019s a post comparing handles vs. pointers in game development that advocates for packing homogeneously typed objects into arrays and using indices to refer to them.Similar ideas show up in entity-component systems (ECS), a big idea from game development that I also don\u2019t completely understand. This post covers many of the same locality-related themes as we did above.After I published this post, many people pointed me toward a post from last year by Inanna Malick that shows the same technique applied to same kind of toy \u201ccalculator\u201d language implemented in Rust. That post also uses recursion schemes, an elegant idea from the Haskell world that helps abstract over different concrete representations. I highly recommend checking that post out.In Rust, using Expr there would mean that we want to include other Exprs inline inside the Expr struct, without any pointers, which isn\u2019t what we want. The Rust compiler doesn\u2019t even let us do that\u2014it would make Exprs infinitely large! \u21a9The totality-at-all-costs approach uses Rust\u2019s wrapping integer arithmetic functions and abuses checked division to boldly assert that dividing by zero yields zero. \u21a9A MacBook Pro with an M1 Max (10 cores, 3.2 GHz) and 32 GB of main memory running macOS 13.3.1 and Rust 1.69.0. \u21a9I added a feature flag that enables calls to Rust\u2019s std::mem::forget. \u21a9",

To make loading and saving files fast and lossless, it uses identical on-disk and in-memory representations. In other words, everything is in an arena, and saving and loading is just a memcpy of the entire arena.

One of my favorite uses of them is for inline markup in pulldown-cmark (see [1] for a brief description).Here's a sketch of the problem being solved. The raw input is broken into a sequence of nodes, and something like * is turned into a \"MaybeEmphasis\" node, as it has the potential to turn into emphasis, or remain text if no match for it is found.Another pass goes through those nodes in sequence, using a stack to find potential matches (the rules for whether a pair of such nodes actually match are quite fiddly and complicated). When a match is found, the MaybeEmphasis node is turned into the appropriate emphasis node, and the entire sequence of nodes between open and close is snipped out and made into a subtree of the new node. This is a somewhat unusual tree transformation, and a straightforward implementation could easily be O(n). But with the flattened AST representation, it can all be done O(1), no matter the number of nodes or stack depth.For those interested in details, the tree representation is in [2] - there's basically a \"child\" and \"next\" index along with the node body - and the tree surgery on emphasis match is in [3].The performance is excellent. I think pulldown-cmark may not be the single fastest CommonMark parser out there, but it's certainly competitive, and a lot faster than approaches that do, for example, an allocation per node.[1]: https://fullyfaithful.eu/pulldown-cmark/[2]: https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark/blob/b7e709c0bd6...[3]: https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark/blob/b7e709c0bd6...replyfrancasso 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]This reminds me of a GDC talk where rust was praised because it forces you to either go mad because of the borrow checker or structure code using an entity component system.

To look up a specific one, assign each one a unique ID and search by ID.The problem is that game developers get anxious about this kind of lackadaisical structure(for good reason, if there's any aim at serious performance) and want to put more things in their own index, and allocate things with a more compact representation and less fragmentation.And the alternatives are...god object with every possible behavior crammed into an oversized record type, and ECS bookkeeping, in its various flavors, some more compilation-heavy and others more reflective with more runtime editing functionality.But regardless of what approach you take, every time you introduce dynamism into your entities and enable more flexibility in asset assignment, you convert more of your bugs into data bugs. There are a huge number of bugs in games that are configuration problems with the entity and not a flow control or algorithms issue.replydist1ll 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Correct. Rust lifetimes become less powerful in certain niches of high-performance programming where you're avoiding the heap or don't have one in the first place.

The tools for fighting these problems in C don't work as well.In TXR Lisp, I have to have a number of strategies in place for debugging GC issues.One is Valgrind integration. If you want to use Valgrind, but have implemented your own bump allocation within packed heaps, Valgrind won't be as helpful.For example, what is a semantic use-after-free in your world (something accessing an object that has been garbage collected) looks fine to the C library; you're just dereferencing a pointer into a large object that you allocated just fine.With Valgrind integration, you can use the API mark free objects inaccessible. But: that only means Valgrind will detect the wrong use of a reclaimed object (quite swiftly, thank you very much). It will not tell you who allocated that object. The diagnostic will be something like \"invalid read, 15300 bytes into a 262164 object, allocated at <call stack>\". That is not very useful! It gives you the call stack when that entire heap was allocated, not when that misused object within that heap was allocated.I have some debug support which takes advantage of reproducible repro test cases where we can count on addresses of bad objects being the same. Once I know the address of the offending object, I can put it into a debug variable called break_obj. When the object is allocated or reclaimed, there is a VALGRIND_PRINTF which will dump a trace. I can also get a breakpoint in gdb (that's why it's the break_obj).There is also an option to run the GC in a kind of torture mode where garbage collection is invoked on every allocation. Newly allocated objects that are not properly retained by the caller (made visible to gc) will be scavenged immediately, revealing those kinds of bugs by bringing the allocation and misuse contexts close together. A substantial portion of the test suite runs in this GC torture mode. Not everything, because it's quite slow.replybregma 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Pointers are just indexes into memory space. Seems to me that if Rust is trying to solve a general programming problem the borrow checker needs to handle all indexes, not just those specialized for memory space.replydist1ll 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I feel that for this to be really viable, Rust would have to allow references that consume less memory (like 8-bit or 16-bit pointers).replyPartiallyTyped 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You could say that it forces you to define long living entities that own memory and lend it to short-lived objects.In the process you avoid use-after-free, double-free, and accessing unallocated memory because the borrowers always live shorter lives than the owners, and can only access borrowed and thus allocated memory that is deallocated once the owner dies, and there is nobody else who can use it or free it once more.replyjlokier 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> In the process you avoid use-after-free, double-free, and accessing unallocated memoryYou don't really avoid those things, though. In the process you end up with index-use-after-index-free, double-index-free, and accessing index-unallocated array entries.These are the exact same bugs the borrow checker prevents in main memory, just hidden from the borrow checker by adding a layer of abstraction.These are memory-unsafety bugs. You still get the same wrong answers caused by coding errors. Random junk values and behaviours, when dereferencing use-after-free invalid pointers that point to memory reused for a new object. It's just that pointers are now called indexes, and the borrow checker doesn't check these pointers.It's like turning the borrow checker off for this set of objects. Those long-lived entities you mentioned act as a mechanism to enable that. That's useful to do, but nobody should be under the impression use-after-free, pointers to the wrong objects and other memory-unsafety bugs don't happen in the array index model.replychlorion 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]With something like the slotmap, you store a generation counter, so you can't accidentally use something that has been freed and recreated.It also checks that the slot you are trying to get is occupied, and if it's not it won't let you access it. It actually is forced to check that the slot is occupied because the slot is an enum with vacant and occupied variants, and the vacant variant doesn't have a value to get in the first place. In rust you can't read a data out of an enum without checking the variant first.With these two restrictions, you can't use stale keys, you can't UAF, and you can't read junk data at all, it's enforced by the type system and the runtime checks.You can still have keys that are invalid, but the slotmap's \"get\" method returns an option type, and invalid keys cause it to return \"None\".So in practice, you will end up panicking if your keys become invalid (the index operator panics when the return value is \"None\"), or you will explicitly handle the \"None\" case and do whatever you want to do.All of this only applies to this specific data structure though, and the checks do have some performance cost.replyskybrian 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yes, this is true, but sometimes it\u2019s because pointer ownership is a poor fit for the problem. Sometimes dangling references are logically possible and what you want. (There should be a runtime check, though. Generation numbers can help.)A compiler can only prevent bad things from happening within a system, typically just one process. The world around it doesn\u2019t work that way. A system is often a cache, not an owner, and caches go out of date because the world changed without notice. You want to update on what notices you get that the world changed. You can\u2019t prevent inconsistency, only detect it and react by updating or removing outdated information.This probably isn\u2019t relevant within a batch compiler, but it would be for a language service in an IDE.Games often simulate worlds where references shouldn\u2019t own things. It would be a weird form of power to remotely prevent something from getting destroyed because you remember it. Even though both objects are within the same process, they\u2019re modeled as independent systems where pointer ownership doesn\u2019t happen.replyavgcorrection 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> These are memory-unsafety bugs.It seems that these are memory-unsafety bugs with the caveat that they have nothing to do with the memory allocator.

In other words, we lose the guarantee that an element is released for reuse.AFAICT, a language would need something like higher RAII [0] or linear types [1] for that.

You can not store a reference unless the borrow-checker can prove that the object that stores it has a shorter lifetime than the referenced object.That is also why you can't just pass that reference around willy-nilly, because the reference is consumed due to affine types.I may be misunderstanding something though so feel free to correct me.replyeyelidlessness 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It\u2019s almost as if immutability writ large is vindicated, but with a whole lot of complicated rules to let mutation infect everything everywhere even if you\u2019ll never use it.

If data can be presumed immutable, a whole lot of ownership rules could be relaxed to scope and cycle counts which could be verified at compile time with no runtime penalty. The whole premise that data needs to be borrowed is explicitly to guard against conflicting views of shared state. Such conflicts can only arise by mutability of shared state. Rust\u2019s solution to that is to limit mutability to only one part of a procedure at a given time. If nothing can mutate state at any point in a program\u2019s lifecycle, that tradeoff can be expanded to basically whatever facilities the hardware/compile target affords.replyc_crank 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Ada has better tools for the task if mutability is allowed.replytriska 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is also how Prolog terms are represented on the heap in the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). For instance, taking the example of the article, if we have an expression such as the Prolog term +(*(a,b), c), written using operator notation as:  expr(E) :-      E = a*b + c.Then we get a flattened representation on the global stack of the virtual machine. In Scryer Prolog, we can inspect the WAM instructions with:  ?- wam_instructions(expr/1, Is),    maplist(portray_clause, Is).yielding:  put_structure(*,2,x(3)).  set_constant(a).  set_constant(b).  put_structure(+,2,x(2)).  set_value(x(3)).  set_constant(c).  execute(=,2).Note how both compound terms are linearized, and appear on the heap as: functor, followed by arguments, each occupying exactly one memory cell of the WAM. The arguments can point to other memory cells. The heap is an array of such cells, all of the same concrete (as opposed to abstract, i.e., WAM-level) type. For example, Scryer Prolog uses 8 bytes for each cell, making cell access and modification very efficient on 64-bit architectures.replykazinator 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> Instead of allocating Expr objects willy-nilly on the heap, we\u2019ll pack them into a single, contiguous array. Instead of referring to children via pointers, Exprs will refer to their children using their indices in that array.This isn't flattening; it's just an alternative heap representation. The shape of the AST hasn't changed. It's been done in many languages before; such as Lisps (packing cons cells and other objects into arrays, using bump allocation, and indices for pointers and such).Objects being in an array makes them convenient for GC to traverse them in a sweep pass after the marking is done. Marking walks the graph to find the reachable objects; sweep goes trough the flat arrays to clear the GC bits, and indicate unreachable objects for recycling.I don't think you will easily find a semi-serious Lisp implementation that just mallocs every cons cell individually. You'd have to put them into a global linked list to be able to do the sweep part of GC. Or a global array that just contains pointers. I've seen at least two toy Lisp project someone banged up in one weekend in which cons cells were malloced and leaked; GC was left as a giant TODO.Global arrays can end up happening anyway, even if cells come from a packed array heap. E.g. if you implement generational GC in a non-copying allocator, one way to round up the baby objects so you can sweep them in a fast GC cycle is to add them into an auxiliary array; that then represents the nursery.replyhgs3 21 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Good article, but I'll mention two gotchas:1. Storing nodes in a resizable array means as the input program grows the compiler will need a larger and larger block of contiguous memory (which may or may not be available). You could work around this by allocating page-sized blocks to pool from.2. Care needs to be taken with how AST nodes are represented in code. For example, using a union type to store nodes is self-defeating as a union type is as large as its largest member and since not all AST nodes are equal size, this means small AST nodes will be pointlessly padded to account for the size of the largest AST node.replydist1ll 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> small AST nodes will be pointlessly padded to account for the size of the largest AST node.This is a great point, and something I mentioned in my blog post on custom-bitwidth integer types: https://alic.dev/blog/custom-bitwidthDiscriminated unions can work, but you have to be clever with your memory footprint.replyJoker_vD 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Sometimes I wish we didn't end up with flat address spaces. The \"virtual memory\" technique allows us to stitch fragmented regions of physical memory into a contiguous region of virtual memory and if virtual address space was segmented, it simply would not ever become fragmented; any memory region could always be grown in-place, without intersecting with any other region, so realloc() implementations could just drop their memcopy() paths... oh well.replycomonoid 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Can be mitigated by a rope(?) structure (i.e. the vector is split into chunks of fixed size, no re-allocation required) with real pointers.

When you're allocating a bunch of items with the same lifetime, you can more efficiently allocate them from one or more large chunks of memory, and then at the end of their collective lifetime you free the large chunk(s) rather than freeing the items individually. The allocation can also be more efficient since you can just incrementally use the space in the parent chunk - no need for free-lists like a general purpose heap allocator.In this context, the \"flattening\" aspect of this - using indices rather than pointers - could be viewed just as using pointers (offsets) that are relative to the parent chunk.replyFullyFunctional 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]I was surprised to see nodes still have two pointers (\"references\") given that you now know that that the first pointer will always point exactly to the next node.

Granted it doesn't make for the most readable code, but it's even smaller and faster.replyt43562 21 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Flattened memory seems rather like normal memory. ie. it's linear and addressed by an offset.

This kind of flattening had the nice side-effect of unlocking the ability to implement GOTO as well as the ability to more-accurately capture and handle \"interrupts\" in the language executor.Anyhow, I'll have to keep this article in mind when I end up implementing flattening for expression evaluation as well, which I haven't gotten around to yet :PreplyJoker_vD 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]AFAIK, many BASIC implementations worked in-place: each input line was replaced by its tokenization, then by the bytecode, then the labels would be resolved. Consequently, printing the program listing was not a matter of simple \"print all earlier input lines\" (those are gone), it involved actual pretty-printing.In fact, replacing the program text with its tokenization as the first compilation step was a very popular strategy back in the day, due to memory constraints. IIRC the early IBM FORTRAN compilers, being quite large (they performed quite a lot of optimizations), would not even fit into the core memory together with the source code of any reasonably useful program. So they were instead written as a series of passes (about fifty or so, I believe) each of which took the output of the previous pass and transformed it into the input for the next one; the tokenizer was quite tiny but it freed lot of space (text is quite redundant) so the next passes had room for the auxiliary structures and could themselves be larger, too.replyjmmv 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Right, thanks.

This drives up the global number of connecting users from approx. 3M to almost 5M.Hard to imagine that so many people in Germany suddenly switched to TOR, especially since there has not been any significant event lately that may have triggered such a decision (afaik)?My personal experience with TOR (as an administrator of various websites and services) is that it is a major source of unwanted/malicious traffic (spam, etc.) and most of it is automated. The big increase is probably not users but bots?replyriedel 20 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The interesting question is if there is a bot net spreading in Germany since the 17th of June. What would be the likelihood of that going undetected. If you like conspiracy theory, the rise in one country could point to state actors.replytw04 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Off the top of my head - Germany hosts a disproportionate amount of sensitive data because it's the location of choice for cloud providers storing things for EU member countries. They have lots of fiber, lots of ISPs, plenty of datacenter space, a stable government, and data security laws that meet or exceed everyone else in the EU.replythrowaway2037 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]  Germany hosts a disproportionate amount of sensitive data because it's the location of choice for cloud providers storing things for EU member countries.Hat tip to this. My German teammate and I have discussed exactly this point. The Microsoft Azure cloud has a German specific cloud that targets exactly this market. Some marketing genius made billions for Microsoft with that idea.One weird thing to me: You are right about \"lots of fiber\" -- specifically Frankfurt Internet Exchange is (was?) the busiest in the world for a long time. Why does non-urban, non-commercial (retail) Internet access suck so hard in Germany? It is the topic of endless (but understandable) crying by German residents on HN!replyredprince 9 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Why does non-urban, non-commercial (retail) Internet access suck so hard in Germany?To cut a very long story short, what should have happened a long time ago in Germany is to treat internet access at a reasonable speed (however that is determined) like access to electricity or the plain old telephone system: It's the law you get connected like everyone else at the price everyone else pays, even when you are in a very rural setting. Leaving that decision to commercial interests, has lead to very slow or unavailable rural internet infrastructure because either the price would be ridiculously high to become connected or the companies would lose money.It's political failure, plain and simple.Looking back in time, the original sin was committed in Germany in the early 80s when the SPD run government understood that fiber optic networks were the future for the telephone system and television distribution. They had a 30 year plan to convert West-Germany's telecom infrastructure to fiber. That was way before the internet, but would that plan have been enacted, Germany would have sat on a high speed fiber infrastructure in the 90s when the Internet exploded onto the scene.Unfortunately the conservative CDU government under Kohl immediately scrapped that plan when they came into power and went for cable as the distribution medium for TV and the telephone system continued to operate on copper at least on the last mile. So here we are in the 2020s with crappy cable modems and crappy DSL connections. (Where available.)replyballenf 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Why would it be so localized to one country? Does Germany have a unique enemy compared to other NATO countries?replyaeyes 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]My guess is that a certain router is getting infected with a botnet because ISPs usually hand out the same router to their customers. And ISPs are usually limited to a single country.replyriedel 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That would be an explanation and probably by okhams razor be more likely. But wouldn't that ISP notice the difference in traffic patterns drastically and react? It is just unlikely (but far from impossible) that this is something 'normal' happening.My fear would be that someone still is trying to gather a critical mass of nodes to contact controll servers via TOR to cause mass havoc in a single country from within a single country. Generally IMHO Germany would be a good target for destabilisation currently. But I think and hope this could just a bit of overinterpreting. Probably one would need a good statistic on the subnets the users come from.replyNoZebra120vClip 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I can't speak to German ISPs or anyone outside of these USA. But I believe that ISPs are absolutely the weakest link when it comes to malicious botnets and other types of widespread network-based compromises.ISPs certainly have the tooling and the positioning to be able to detect C&C channels, outgoing DDOS attacks, and compromised customer premises equipment. But do they? And if they do detect any of it, do they take action? When is the last time you heard about an ISP disconnecting a paying customer because of the customer's compromised device(s)? When is the last time you even heard of an ISP notifying a customer about such a thing?Two months ago, my router was compromised and joined to some sort of botnet in the capacity of a DNS resolver. I would never have been able to detect such WAN-side traffic if I hadn't had a special setup on my part. My ISP was the first to hear when I'd detected it, and I sincerely doubt that they receive many such reports, especially with logs as evidence.Can you imagine receiving a phone call, \"Hello, this is your ISP! You're pwned! Please follow through these remediation steps as I prompt you: ...\" You'd undoubtedly think it was a phishing scam. Because ISPs just don't seem to care about abuse.They will send you copyright strikes and prosecute you for BitTorrent, but it does't seem like they'd lift a finger to prevent the next big DDOS or spam factory originating from their own customers.replyFatnino 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]My parents home lan got caught up in a bot net and their isp was sending emails about it to their isp provided email address.But it's possible they were just passing on abuse reports from the numerous targeted victims of this botnet who bothered to complain.The intrusion point was a Linux system with a 3 letter password and ssh exposed on a nonstandard port. So if you're someone who still thinks the bad guys won't find your computer because you changed the port, know that that is very outdated thinking.replySoftTalker 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I don't even know how to log in to my ISP provided email., so it goes without saying that I'm not reading it.

For almost a decade we've been in a race to the bottom regarding pricing and as a result, service quality. I wouldn't be surprised if critical parts of the infrastructure are maintained by outsourced jobs from half around the world.The only somewhat professional player is the Deutsche Telekom, which was kinda the Bell of Germany and got privatized in the 90s, when the phone network was also opened to other players. They are more expensive though. Other than that, you might be lucky and have some small regional ISP that's competent enough. Otherwise there are just two other companies left that offer service nationwide, after a lot of mergers.replyzirgs 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]My ISP actually sent me an email that said that one of my devices have an open TCP 445 port and advised me to fix it.

So it may be the case that your ISP regularly runs sweeps to detect customers who are running servers, and this warning may be a side effect of that sweep.I often used to poke holes in my firewall and run VPN or ssh servers that were discoverable using my dynamic DNS service. My ISP never got involved with that. Of course, that was a case of me running a server for my exclusive use, rather than some sort of public web or login server that would have randos sending traffic across my link.replyZalorCakeLord 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]My ISP will send letters or emails, but only if they get a complaint from the company in question.

Are these commercial IPs, dynamic (biz/residential) IPs or a mix? If they're mostly dynamic IPs, are they from more than one ISP?TOR has country of origin data so it seems reasonable they'd also have network of origin.All that said, I don't precisely know how TOR determines country of origin. Entry node data would seem to be the likely source. However I've long assumed that entry nodes are public supplied, like Relay and Exit nodes. Within that assumption it isn't clear to me how that data would flow to TOR - while maintaining anonymization of traffic.replymantas 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Maybe German state itself is the actor.replytetris11 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]My bet is Russia.I work in a German institution.

The creator made a physically accurate pin-hole camera and film inside Blender. I hadn't realised that this is even possible with existing off-the-shelf renderers, let alone open source software.

Would probably kill the T-stop value when full open due to less than perfect transmissivity though..I also wonder what would happen if you could substitute an angle-limited piece of glass (kind of like a privacy screen - visible head-on but opaque from an angle) instead of the diaphragm.replythenickdude 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]You can get smooth-edged bokeh in a physical lens by inserting an apodisation filter inside:http://www.4photos.de/camera-diy/Apodization-Filter.htmlThis is an aperture with fuzzy soft edges so that the bokeh fades out smoothly around the edges instead of being formed of hard circles.It makes the images look like they have Photoshop- or cellphone-faked bokeh, because you end up with effectively a Gaussian blur in the background.replyplastic3169 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Reminds me of \u201dhow to animate cube in Houdini\u201d -https://youtu.be/NLiL0GLSvIwreplyantonjs 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]This is so delightfully ridiculous.

Once you implement the core physics needed for any raytracer, things like lenses and aperture blades just work.I can't want for full-scene realtime raytracing to hit the consumer market.replyterribleperson 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]In a similar vein, when raycasting was being added to second life I built a rudimentary approximation of a camera. It took some time to put together an image because of the limits of SL scripting and the rate limits on raycasting, but the first successful image had incredibly obvious vignetting. The solution was changing the size of my 'aperture' equivalent.It's always very cool when simulation behavior starts to resemble real behavior.replyconstantly 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This is where I\u2019m losing track of what\u2019s going on here. I generally understand the principles from at least the first half of the video, the pinhole camera and lenses and can imagine how it works in real life, but this is blender. It\u2019s not real life. How does this work in BLENDER? Is it because the underlying physics models in Blender are so accurate one can recreate even these increasingly convoluted things in real life?replycrote 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Well, that's the best part of it: the underlying physics model is really easy!A pinhole camera requires zero additional physics, just a simulation of light rays passing through a small hole. A lens just requires Snell's Law - which is pretty much trivial. Adding dispersion is just a matter of using a formula instead of a constant for the refractive index of the lens, and doing the raytracing using random wavelengths instead of a single \"composite\" one.Raytracers capable of doing this are implemented in a few hundred lines of code as a toy project. The difficult part is getting it to render quickly - and of course modeling the scene properly.replyAlexAndScripts 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The physics of light is relatively simple. Blender wants to look photorealistic, so cycles (a branched path tracer, commonly known as a ray tracer) almost perfectly models how light works. That means these emergent properties just work.It wouldn't work under a rasteriser (Blender has one, called Eevee) as those operate using a complex series of approximations of reality that are more difficult to create but run far faster. But because Cycles (slower, but more realistic) operates by mimicking how light works this kind of thing is entirely possible.replyturnsout 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Also keep in mind that Cycles and most renderers use a simplified version of physics\u2014rather than pathtrace all wavelengths, they use a simplified RGB model, which means certain optical properties behave differently. For instance, you don\u2019t get the chromatic aberration with the simulated lens.replyrcxdude 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]raytracing rendering moved to physics based rendering a while ago: the core idea is to approximate the physics of light as accurately as can reasonably be made fast. It's not like it's solving a wave equation directly, it's using a statistical sampling of a model of how light interacts with different interfaces between mediums. This is basically the easiest way to get photorealistic renders: the human brain is very good at noticing when your scene has non-physical lighting (not in a 'ahah, the specular highlights violate conservation of energy' way, but in a 'this looks fake' way).(this approach was started by some researchers who basically said 'well, let's make a simple scene for real and measure everything and make our render look identical' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box )replyEA-3167 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I just keep remembering the original Half Life 'can your computer handle this test' and thinking \"This is the absolute height of tech, footage from within a game displayed in-game, live.\"And now...

Developer, the bath you put film in to activate the still blank but exposed reel, to turn the grains into actual \"developed\" photo, is a complex and local analog process. \"Developer\" is expended while developing film & becomes less effective at developing, creating a much stronger local contrast across pictures in a natural chemical way.There's a pretty complex Shannon Information Theory system going on here, which I'm not certain how to model. There's maybe a information->transmit->medium->receive->information model between the scene and the film. Then an entirely separate information->transmit->medium->recieve->information model between the undeveloped scene and what actually shows up when you \"develop\" the film.As you say, there are quite a variety of film types with different behaviors. https://github.com/t3mujin/t3mujinpack is set of Darktable presets to emulate various types of film. But the behavior of the film is still only half of the process. As I said in my previous post, developing the film is a complex chemical process, with lots of local effects for different parts of the image. There's enormous power here. https://filmulator.org/ is an epic project, that, in my view, is incredibly applicable to almost all modern digital photography, that could help us so much, to move beyond raw data & help us appreciate scenes more naturally. It's not \"correct\" but my personal view is the aesthetic is much better, and it somewhat represents what the human eye does anyways, with it's incredible ability to comprehend & view dynamic range.replyGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",

I'm currently dealing with a bakery business that was suddenly suspended from Google Maps. This is a big deal because it's the main way, by far, that people find us.7 days ago, boom. Your account has been suspended for not following the business guidelines. The only thing I've updated recently was our hours. It's been listed without problems for about two years.Of course they don't tell you what the issue is. They just tell you to fix it and then beg them to reinstate you. It takes up to two weeks apparently (7 days so far). And if they decide not to, the only thing you can do is delete the listing, and two years worth of hard earned reviews go up in smoke.A few days ago one of our staff told me a Korean tourist came in the day before we were suspended and accused us of being fake. I don't know exactly what happened but due to the tourist's limited English nobody could persuade them we were the real location. Or maybe they were looking for somewhere else entirely? Who knows. Apparently they left a negative review, which I can't see while the account is suspended. Probably they reported the location as fake.So that's it. Two years, over 100 positive reviews sitting at 4.9 stars. Gone because of one confused tourist. Or maybe because I updated the hours. Or maybe an automatic spam check didn't like us.I sincerely hope that the next round of EU laws tackles this instead of privacy. It's just as big an issue, especially if you're running a small business.replycan16358p 10 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> I sincerely hope that the next round of EU laws tackles this instead of privacy.

I believe this is a much more bigger, huge problem compared to privacy, which is preventable (users can choose not to use a service) but this can take down entire businesses because of data giants' crappy/false alerting systems.It should be illegal for Google, say, to remove listing without proving, or if that's not possible, if they remove they should legally be forced to compensate for the damage done.

Parking required an app. There were park rangers there, the location was staffed, but they did not accept cash or credit card. Just an app. And there are two phone operating systems now, Apple and Android. So no. Can\u2019t live without FAANG. I ended up downloading the app on the spot and purchasing a pass.I\u2019m sure the park service does this for their convenience. And it\u2019s so populated near the coasts that if anyone doesn\u2019t comply, they still have plenty of people who would gladly use the app. They can get away with demanding smartphone use. You can certainly get away with not having a smartphone further inland, and not needing to depend on FAANG explicitly. But I know this expectation is going to creep into the continent over time. In 5 years, if you say \u201cI don\u2019t have a smart phone\u201d you\u2019ll just be denied service. Period. No questions asked.

That\u2019s bonkers.I\u2019ve recently seen more use of Apple Pay via websites. Assuming it works as Apple Pay usually does, this at least is technically more secure (though I don\u2019t like giving Apple more power) since it\u2019s basically an exchange of cryptographically secure/verifiable one time tokens.PayPal is no one\u2019s favorite but at least if you use that you\u2019re not handing over your CC number.

It\u2019s not great as a consumer either - I have had my card locked for traveling within the same city and spending maybe $20 at a merchant I don\u2019t usually visit.

For at least of half of that time, I've complained about it vocally and customer service can't do anything. Now I think about this every single time I hear \"AI-assisted fraud detection\", and by extension, \"AI-assisted security\" and really \"AI-assisted XYZ\". Without another credit card, I guess I'd simply live in constant fear of being embarrassingly declined totally at random on any/every transaction. It's not like I* know the billing cadence, even though my bank has a decade of history.Clearly they are simply selling my history to the highest bidder, because they certainly aren't using it to help me. On a related note, ever notice that vanilla \"exact substring match\" search even in gmail is just as bad as google web search? All these corporations that are allegedly indexing us to \"value-add\" with some perfect high-resolution consumer model can't even do basic shit despite all the spying. I almost expect* my privacy to be fucked, like I guess hey that's modernity. What never ceases to surprise me lately is how the pretense has kind of dropped and we get nothing in exchange, even petty conveniences.replypedrocr 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Unfortunately we didn't use the contactless change to finally fix this. NFC payments are still stuck in the world where the client doesn't have a way to make the payment themselves so has to trust the payment terminal the merchant puts in front of him with their secret information. The transaction should have been reversed. The merchant should have the dumb side, where they only communicate payment details, and the client's phone should be the one doing verifications and initiating the payment. It's bonkers that this hasn't become standard yet. Even more bonkers that internet payments didn't make the same switch long ago.replylxgr 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That would have been nice, but not backwards compatible with millions of POS terminals and payment processing setups out there.One big advantage of contactless card payments as implemented in most countries is that you can seamlessly introduce it, making it look like a regular chip or even magnetic stripe transaction to the POS and everything behind it.replyjhugo 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]With the recent new QR systems around Southeast Asia, they got around this by adding support to existing terminals with just a software update.

QR codes are universal - can be scanned by any UPI app.I have other reservations about the digital trail this leaves for every petty transaction of your life -- and the small risk of a petty vendor being able to harass you later based on the information you leave in their records.If we don't trust the government -- this makes us jittery about how much they can track you or even cripple your life by disabling a few key things that you need this all to work smoothly.Those risks aside,this UPI system has been a boon to ease of transactions (without worrying about handling cash and change) across the country.

The only remaining hole is creating a magstripe card, but these are becoming rare even in the US). The card does see and verify the transaction. The two main issues are the PIN entry onto the pad (which exposes some information, though with NFC this hole is somewhat removed), and the fact that the payment is still initiated by the terminal, with no way for the user to independently see the transaction amount before authorising the transaction (NFC on a phone can in principle fix this, though in a somewhat annoying manner: it could refuse the transaction the first time, then prompt the user, and accept the next transaction for the same amount).replypnpnp 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> You can blame the evil competitor but the real problem is that credit cards are not the right tool for payments to strangers over the internet.Granted the entire system needs a revamp, but credit cards are one of the best tools we have to pay strangers right now.

The following methods I have had for the 3DS card payments are (ultimately depends on the bank):- Bank sends you a tiny card reader that you enter your PIN and it gives you a one time code. If you want to make payments that require 3DS (online only ofc) you have to have this card reader on you but it doesn't actually require an app or internet connectivity.- You have an app on your phone, you drag a code from a notification onto another area of the app itself which does something (somehow - no idea the purpose) and verifies the transaction. Certificate is stored on device only.- You open an app and it'l notify of the purchase amount, location, merchant and you just tap allow- You receive a code in the mail that is renewed once a year which is then combined with a SMS message (or app notification). The payment flow asks you for some characters from both codes.You do not require cell service for any that I have used and wifi is enough.Further Edit: Just to clarify though, all of these are ONLY for online purchases. Purchases in shops you just use your pin if it requires authorisation.replyjhugo 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Not rare at all.
