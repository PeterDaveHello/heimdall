        "hn_content": "An article on Hacker News discussing the negative impact of GPT-4 has gained attention. While some are concerned about the potential loss of jobs due to better AI, others believe a fairer economic system could allow people to welcome it. A freelancer from Sweden argues against this, pointing out the high taxes they already pay. The discussion on taxes and productivity leads to conflicting opinions with some claiming that taxes above a certain level can reduce productivity, while others believe people will work despite high taxes. The article highlights the debate between those who believe money is the only motivator and those who think there are other incentives to work.There are mixed opinions regarding taxation and the welfare system and how they affect entrepreneurship, job security, and work motivation. Some argue that higher taxation and better welfare lead to more entrepreneurial freedom by providing a safety net, while others argue that high taxation can disincentivize productivity and cause financial hardship for lower-income individuals. The discussion also delves into topics of productivity, socioeconomic classes, salary, medical insurance costs, wealth distribution, and government regulation. One user suggests that the Norwegian tax system, which is focused on natural resource use, is a noteworthy example of how tax policy can affect the economy's growth and sustainability. Some users suggest a shift towards \"real world\" professions could improve infrastructure and housing problems.A mass professional shift is happening all at once which can cause social turmoil due to lack of planning; some suggest building guillotines for the impending unemployment. However, others argue that every time automation creates a paradigm shift, there's an increase in demand for technical skills and an expansion in labor market. Automation can lead to higher productivity and cheaper goods, and this time technology is targeting knowledge workers directly, which accounts for a small percentage of the workforce, but it could take a decade to fully develop. The impact of automation on society is not yet clear, but all agree that people have to buy the products made with AI, and if they have no money, AI will not benefit the users.A discussion ensues about the safety of trades work, with some suggesting that the risks depend on the environment and on the stresses put on the body. Others debate whether trades will be automated in the near future, with one arguing that progress is slower when it involves physical manipulation rather than information. Meanwhile, some express concerns about the future of democracy in the face of widespread automation and AI, with others debating the merits of different economic systems.The Tech Times reports on the democratizing force of LLMs available to as many people as possible through Microsoft and Google, with hopes that it stays that way. Some comments contain political statements regarding the labor theory of value, the drawbacks of the current capitalist system, and the suggestion for society to invest real effort into inventing something new. Other comments bring up the challenge of wealth distribution and the concept of ownership in a free society. The article suggests the importance of capturing key points in a concise, neutral tone, while avoiding dull facts and arrogance.The labor theory of value is controversial and of little use in practice according to some experts. Capitalism involves the ownership of land, buildings, and ideas, and it relies on regulatory and rule of law to function correctly. While capitalism may have some issues, the problem is more exacerbated by how the law around it works. Various solutions have been suggested, such as communism or taxes on the value generated by AI, but there is no clear way forward. Finding a new solution is required to minimize the downside of AI's widespread adoption.Comments on Hacker News discuss potential solutions to issues of corporate taxation and social programs, such as a national dividend where a percentage of profits is distributed to all adults or technological advancements being used to create a fair and money-less economy. Some express concerns about technological advancements leading to job displacement and loss of income for certain fields, while others believe that AI advancements will raise the bar for the quality of work in the programming industry. There is debate over the reasoning capabilities of GPT-4 and its potential to replace developers in certain areas, with some users frustrated by what they perceive as misunderstanding of the technology.Access to computing has drastically improved as barriers were dropped, enabling more people to become empowered. However, software developers must adapt to new layers of complexity and advancement. While open source development models and closed source models each have their advantages, some companies struggle to compete with closed companies. The increase in lifespan led to an increase in the retirement age, but the older demographic is not the only factor. Wealth has been generated by artificial scarcity created by patents and copyrights. The fear of losing income due to better AI is a sign of the times.Wealth inequality in the US is already at absurd levels with the top 1% of Americans having a combined net worth of $34.2 trillion, while the bottom 50% of the population holds just $2.1 trillion combined. Advanced AI and cheap energy could increase the UBI to a livable salary by taxing corporations, though this is not a simple matter. The current economic system doesn't make everyone welcome better AI because people are not confident it will make everyone wealthier, and when previous job obsoletions occurred, income inequality grew. Some users suggest that fairness is defined as a system that makes everyone wealthier, but this depends on individual beliefs and orientations towards equality or proportionality.Users discuss their experiences using ChatGPT to generate code and script, with some noting limitations and others suggesting workarounds. ChatGPT has helped users feel more confident using programming languages and DSLs they previously avoided. Users speculate about the potential impact of AI-generated code on frameworks and libraries, expressing concerns about the increased likelihood of bugs. It is acknowledged that AI is a ratchet and becoming good at a particular skill may lead to eventual job displacement, but some users remain focused on using AI as a tool to improve productivity now.Asks how fast AI will move to automate jobs, and predicts that the jobs left will be extremely low paying. Worries about a future without legislation, and that in 10-20 years, robots with guns will patrol food production and distribution. Discusses how AI tools could replace developers, and how LLMs can force engineers to change their approaches. Considers AI as new powerful productivity tools and doubts that LLMs will end society. Urges for discussions on how to reduce technology's impact on humans on a social and legal level.The Tech Times reports on HN user opinions of LLMs and GPT-4. While many are excited about their potential, they acknowledge that LLMs are best used by those already knowledgeable in their field, and that the gaming industry is attempting to cut costs by outsourcing to young developers. Users overall found LLMs to be useful, but not a replacement for functional programming, stack overflow, or compile time type checking. The article features discussions on the future of the workforce in the advent of AI technology, concluding that while AI can make certain processes more efficient, it is not intended to replace human skill and judgment.Comments on GPT-4 reveal that it is a powerful productivity tool, especially for coding tasks. The tool is seen as an \"engine on steroids\" that can replace human effort or accelerate it. GPT-4 is deemed better than ChatGPT by users as it generates functional code that compiles and often works without human intervention. Users indicate that the more knowledgeable they are about the domain, the better the tool performs. While AI's current capability is often disputed, experts believe that AI's long-term impact will be far-reaching and that AI will present new paradigms in the industry.The experience and knowledge of humans using AI will be a key differentiator; however, we may see advantages in creativity. Writing assembler code may not be a lucrative commercial enterprise. The divide between experienced and less experienced people will increase, especially with projects spanning multiple fields. The more a writer knows the area, the less fact-checking they need; writing the first draft is easier with this knowledge. Y Combinator applications for summer 2023 are now available.",

        "content": "In her article \"Violent Enough to Stand Still,\" Tove K discusses the controversy that surrounded anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon's findings on Yanomam\u00f6 warfare. Chagnon documented that Yanomam\u00f6 men made war over women, which contradicted the Marxist view that humans only go to war over resources. The reason Yanomam\u00f6 societies never reached a Malthusian condition was because of their high level of violence that kept populations down. With abundant resources, Yanomam\u00f6 men focused on protecting their women and obtaining other men's women for themselves rather than working hard to provide for their children. This article sheds light on pre-Malthusian societies and their unique cultural practices.Humans have existed in a state of population equilibrium, focusing on reproductive interests and avoiding development. The default condition of humans is similar to other animals: males fighting each other over females. Human development is episodic, focusing on technology and teamwork during specific occasions. The question arises, what made human males finally abandon that zero-sum game and develop more complex societies? The article suggests a new perspective on human history and the evolution of civilization. Comments bring in diverse perspectives, including Marxist views on war in primitive societies.",

        "hn_content": "An article on Hacker News discusses why human societies did not develop much in the last 300,000 years, with one commenter noting that the author ignores the fact that agriculture took tens of thousands of years to develop. Another commenter suggests that the rapid changes in human society are due to a much larger population and increased communication through technology, and another provides statistics that show 90% of human history was lived after the agricultural revolution, and that most people worked in agriculture with little surplus before then. Infant mortality rates and the definition of what counts as an infant are also discussed.Discussion on the slow pace of human societal progress throughout history, and some theorizing as to why technological advancement progressed so slowly. Some comments suggest that readily available and communicable recorded knowledge is a key factor in how much humans have managed to achieve. Other comments point out that some societies may have achieved impressive feats that are not as well documented, while others argue that the slow pace itself is relative depending on how far back in history one looks.An expert comments that the ability to communicate long distances with others who share interests existed in Ancient Rome, but did not require literacy; literacy only made communication faster once the message could be moved faster than a physical object. Another user argues that literacy is necessary, but not sufficient for rapid social and technological change, pointing to China's stalled progress despite pervasive literacy, although Europe's explosion in social and technological change followed the development of moveable type printing with widespread literacy. Users also debate the relationship between literacy and accurate, trustworthy communication, and factors influencing when literacy and writing become important technologies. Another user hypothesizes that the acceleration of human innovation that coincides with agriculture is largely driven by population growth and ease of communication, and would not occur in a small, stable population.The comments on the post present arguments regarding the lives of hunter-gatherers versus farmers, with differing views on the advantages of each. While some claim that early farmers were barely more efficient than hunter-gatherers with a decrease in food variety, others argue that farming societies had the advantage of organization and numbers. Some comments also discuss the concept of land ownership, which is not a uniquely human trait, and how centralized societies created a \"genotype\" of centralization. The post itself focuses on the struggles of settled tribes in foraging grounds and the effects of violence on human society, with a special emphasis on the relationship between our entertainment and human violence.A discussion on an article by David Graeber focuses on the idea that power over humans and the desire to exploit them is the only reason for anything happening, and the author's supposed agenda detracts from their credibility. One user points out that Graeber was an anarchist, not a Marxist, and another questions whether the developments of agriculture and larger communities were about people's ability to communicate or about developing the tools to handle them. The conversation acknowledges that early human progress was likely a slow march forward marked by rediscovery and reinvention, with much knowledge being lost through bad luck or bad judgement.HN users discuss the skills and resourcefulness of ancient humans, including questions about how they cut their nails and the difficulty of linen production. The conversation touches on themes of innovation, traditionalism, and power dynamics within tribes. Users note the importance of specific knowledge in fields like engineering and mathematics, and marvel at the engineering feats required to create seemingly simple tools like ballpoint pens.An HN thread discusses the standard response to innovation where \"the thing you've created reduces pain points I'm so used to that I no longer see them\" and how certain inventions only get made by determined individuals; the human lack of imagination for certain levels of technological innovation of very disruptive changes has an evolutionary basis; the engineering and complexity of modern-day toilets and ballpoint pens are given some airtime, with a nod towards the existence of prior knowledge from beyond Europe, which didn't have the benefit of the printing press; and there is a discussion of the challenges of original thinking in math and science.Anthropologists have observed that men kill each other at high rates in conflicts over distribution of women across different cultures. The same phenomenon has been observed in different regions including Australia, Papua New Guinea, and South America. The article discusses the similarities between humans and animals, how humans are not as \"special\" as they like to think, and projects those observations to all of human history. However, this projection is not entirely substantiated, and some anthropologists have come to different conclusions. The significance of the article may be debated, but it does make one wonder if there is more nuance to this argument.Some commenters on a substack article about the development of societies challenge the author's primary premise, citing the precariousness of any conclusion based on a small sample size. The article's focus on the Yanomam\u00f6 tribe is called into question, some saying it detracts from the complexity of the topic. Other commenters address the idea that humans are not \"special\" in the animal kingdom, and one suggests that human rights arose from human struggle rather than recognizing inherent specialness. Some discuss the possibility of replicating human consciousness in machines. Discussions about the gender dynamics of past and present societies also arise, and one commenter draws comparisons between society and nature, introducing the idea that catastrophic climate change is indeed a form of progress.An article and comment section discuss the \"Becky\" concept and its societal implications. There are varying opinions on whether it is a legitimate reaction to societal change or just sexist garbage. The Yanomami tribe serves as an example of pre-modern societies that organize around fertility and don't have significant development, attributed to their relative abundance of food. Some comments point out examples of other societies and researchers that also observed this pattern. A correlation is made between bootstrapping progress and how humans subsist until they are comfortable enough to start developing higher order civilizational structures.An HN post asks why humanity took so long to progress but then accelerated rapidly. Comments discuss the importance of understanding different perspectives in anthropology, the nature of violence and wars in ancient societies, and the need for certain conditions to progress such as improved information preservation and ethical systems. Theories on the impact of dog domestication, the difficulty of developing written language, and the challenges of maintaining a civilization are also explored. The post highlights the need to look beyond material technology and consider the societal and cultural factors that enable progress.The Tech Times reports that there are various aspects in which human societies can improve. The article caters to experts in the field and aims to provide concise and insightful information. If commenting, stay neutral and avoid political or religious bias. There is no room for dull facts; focus on key points that interest the readers. Be confident but not arrogant and avoid expressions such as \"this may be.\" While comments may include sarcasm, they are not the main point. Applications for YC Summer 2023 are now open.",

        "hn_content": "A new edition of The Garbage Collection Handbook has been released, which provides information on Concurrent copying and compaction GC, page fault handling, and modern, efficient RC implementation. Some users have pointed out the benefits of userfaultfd over read barriers, as well as the use of linear logic to insert explicit \"dup/drop\" operations in the Perseus paper. There is also a discussion on the use of garbage collection in Java and Ada, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of tracing GC and reference counting connectors in managed languages.The post discusses performance of garbage collection (GC) and how most memory allocations should be on the stack, and minimal on the heap, and that shared_ptr in C++ is rarely popped up in the profiler. A user mentions that Java is in the process of integrating tracing and reference counting, and another notes that Swift and Objective-C ARC performance is poor. GC can be a time-space tradeoff, and reference counting is highly optimized for memory efficiency, but for greater programming ease, tracing GC is better. Bob Nystrom wrote a tutorial implementation of precise tracing GC, and Andreas Kling has an amusing observation on scanning registers and stack in conservative GC.Routledge is releasing the new edition of \"Garbage Collection: Algorithms for Automatic Dynamic Memory Management\" in June; the first edition is considered a definitive reference for those exploring GC algorithms and how they work, and those interested in writing a GC or a programming language, rather than those tweaking an existing VM's GC for optimization purposes; the book even reviews reference counting as GC. Real-time and non-real-time GCs exist, with some new GCs reducing pause times dramatically. Some users discuss GC technicalities, such as pointer authentication and encryption or the design of dedicated deadline-based GC algorithms.The article discusses the issue of garbage collection in programming and how it relates to language design, with one commenter pointing out that they feel garbage collection is a mis-feature, while another points out that it is essential for certain types of algorithms. The discussion focuses largely on C++ and Rust programming languages, with some commenters feeling that manual memory management is still necessary, while others prefer the use of smart pointers and reference counting. Some commenters note that language design expertise does not necessarily equate to expertise in computer science as a whole.An HN user asked about the goal of comparing memory management techniques in a network driver study, while another user clarified that the goal was to write a network driver in various languages. Some users debated the use of value types in Swift and their reference counts, while another user expressed sarcasm about a book on garbage collection in Rust. Finally, a user joked that Rust has rendered all of computer science irrelevant.",

        "hn_content": "New Orleans teenagers have discovered a novel proof of the Pythagorean Theorem, which is based on the Law of Sines and has got experts talking. While some are confused about the proof, others found it clever and creative. The authors have presented their work to the American Mathematical Society. The proof constructs an infinite series of nested triangles, assuming functions and trigonometric notational conventions without Pythagorean-derived properties. The proof isn't using anything previously thought to be impossible, but a belief that the proof couldn't use the Law of Sines is rejected. Other users have suggested alternative ways to prove the theorem.Two teenagers from a private Catholic school in New Orleans may have discovered a new proof for the Pythagorean theorem, although some experts believe the concept is not new, just the proof. The two teenage math students are female, African-American, and from an area which is not known for producing high academic achievers. However, the girls have yet to publish their work, leaving the peer review process up to other mathematicians. The proof was constructed through simple trigonometry, but its elegance has inspired interest from experts in the field.The article discusses how a private school education can indicate parent involvement and supports the idea of elevating the achievements of underrepresented groups in math. Some comments express disagreement with this idea and suggest that the proof is valid regardless of the students\u2019 background or the school they attend. One user shares Stanford\u2019s definition of a mathematical proof but other users point out that a proof only needs to be logically correct, not necessarily explain the \u201cwhy\u201d behind it. The article's title is not accurately reflected in the HN post.High school students have developed a beautiful and simple trigonometric proof of Pythagoras' theorem subject to intense scrutiny by experienced mathematicians. The proof uses a construction of infinitely many triangles and the formula for the sum of a geometric series. While this point of view has been questioned in recent decades, trigonometric proofs of Pythagoras have been made before, and this proof is not new, but it is the most beautiful and simplest trigonometric proof to date. Experts from varying locations share their perspectives on the student's accomplishment.The post highlights the importance of creativity and originality in breakthroughs, beyond AI black-boxes.

        "hn_content": "A study suggesting that judges give harsher sentences when hungry is being disputed by HN users with fasting experience. Comments argue that the body adapts to extended fasts and that longer fasts do not lead to greater hunger; that religious fasting develops a necessary discipline in judges and could actually benefit their judgement; and that short Ramadan fasts, typically only lasting from sunrise to sunset for a month, are not comparable to longer fasts. Some users also criticize the practice of fasting, suggesting it results in increased weight gain and food wastage.HN users share their experiences with fasting. Some describe feeling clear and productive, while others note hunger subsiding after 24 hours. There is disagreement among commenters about the effectiveness and scientific basis of psychology and social sciences studies.A discussion on fasting on Hacker News includes a range of differing experiences and opinions, with some users highlighting the psychological and individual factors that influence hunger and metabolic function during fasting. One Muslim user notes that Ramadan, a month of fasting in Islam, is intended to have a spiritual effect that could be contributing to the observed increase in mercy from judges. The article encourages a neutral and professional tone, avoiding political or religious statements in order to cater to the publication's audience of experts in the field.The original study which claimed that judges were more lenient before lunch and more strict before a break had a flawed methodology as it did not take into account that cases were not randomly ordered. Anecdotes and individual experiences can be underrated, but bodies can vary widely, which should be acknowledged. There was no mention of \"meeting fatigue\" in the article (or study), even though it can have a significant impact on productivity. Finally, fasting can have benefits such as clearness and focus, although this could be harmful for complex knowledge work, and it might be that the \"clearness\" comes from a shorter attention and horizon.Studies show positive correlations between ketone production and cognitive performance, particularly in patients with cognitive impairment. Fasting or restricted carbohydrate diets can cause the body to switch to ketogenesis for fuel. Being fat-adapted can help the brain burn ketones instead of glucose, leading to improved brain function. Digesting food can burden focus and reduce cognitive performance. Hunger can be a distraction for some, but intermittent fasting can allow individuals to align their intake with their most productive hours. Keen senses, including smell, may increase while fasting. However, research on the effects of hunger on cognitive performance is limited.A new study examined the decision-making abilities of judges who were fasting during Ramadan, and found their decisions were more favorable before breaking their fast compared to afterwards. However, some Hacker News users in the comments section shared their personal experiences, stating fasting had the opposite effect on their productivity and cognition. One user recommended researching the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems and how they relate to fasting and energy expenditure. Others debated the impact of full meals versus light food or energy drinks before a test or meeting. However, it is uncertain whether hunger always leads to better performance, with one user calling the premise of the article \"silly\".A new study found that judges who fasted during Ramadan in Pakistan and did not receive food or water were 10% more likely to acquit defendants each additional hour they fasted. However, a commenter argued that the sample size regarding Muslim judges was too small to make broad conclusions, while others discussed the effects of different types of fasting, refeeding syndrome, and potential scheduling biases. The discussion highlights the challenge of designing studies to account for all possible variables and the inherent subjectivity in human judgment. Overall, the comments suggest that scientific studies on social phenomena can be unreliable and open to different interpretations.An HN user discusses the nature of science and how it progresses with new data and knowledge, warning against revisionist thinking. Another HN user criticizes the CDC for not releasing key COVID data, but a third user argues that good faith and shared truth are necessary for scientific discourse. Another user questions how scientists can publish data they don't know exists, while one user warns against categorizing every idea as \"antivaxxer\". Finally, a user laments the lack of self-development among judges who should have a better understanding of science.",

        "hn_content": "An article posted on Hacker News argues that everything advertised on social media is overpriced junk. It criticizes targeted advertising for being expensive, and claims that ads are a liquid market where one channel cannot remain better than another. Commenters provide counterarguments, pointing out the costs of customer acquisition as significantly higher than the lifetime value of a customer, and the effect of targeted ads in enabling small businesses to advertise for less money. Despite claims of perfect competition and monopolies, the discussion concludes by highlighting the quality and price discrepancies between Chinese and European/Japanese-made home products.The rise of niche, sometimes lower quality, products sold through targeted ads on social media is the topic of this article, with a particular focus on the razor market. While big brands like Gillette may spend millions on advertising, smaller companies like Jeremy's Razor are acquiring a dedicated customer base through their \"anti-woke\" messaging and highly targeted ad campaigns. However, these companies are also becoming increasingly focused on growth, leading to questions about their long-term viability. Some commenters argue that a lack of regulations and gatekeepers in digital advertising has allowed questionable products to proliferate across the internet, ultimately leading to an erosion in quality across the market.HN users discuss walking posture and shoe quality for long-term comfort, with one suggesting Merrell as a reliable brand. Another user proposes the market gap for \"more expensive but high quality\" products, and the difficulty in finding them without being an expert in the field. One user suggests that buying second-hand shoes at thrift stores is a more sustainable option. Running shoe lifespan varies but can be as little as 600-700km, and some users repurpose old running shoes for casual use. No notable releases or developments are mentioned.HN users discuss the difficulty of finding high-quality products due to unreliable sources and misleading marketing. The search is especially challenging in oversaturated markets flooded with generic Chinese brands. Experts recommend sticking with trusted brands and seeking out independent reviews or specialty forums for specific products. The importance of transparent pricing and returns policies is also emphasized. Despite the challenges, quality brands still exist and can be found through diligent research and seeking out vendors with robust customer service programs.Experts point out the limitations of product ads which often mislead customers, and suggest marketing regulations as a solution. One commentator suspects that the tech giants value quantity over quality and disregard user satisfaction. When shopping for replacements, experts suggest looking for \"buy it for life\" products instead of advertised ones. Wirecutter and Consumer Reports are mentioned as trusted sources for unbiased product evaluations, although the former's recommendations have become less trustworthy in recent years. Finally, a subreddit, r/buyitforlife, is recommended as a valuable resource for finding reliable products.The article discusses the effectiveness of targeted ads and the quality of product reviews. Several users share their experiences with ads and their purchasing habits, with some expressing frustration at the lack of quality reviews. A user suggests that niche review sites could be a lucrative business. There is some discussion of the Better Business Bureau's rating system, with some users calling it a pay-for-play scam. One user suggests that social media marketing is ineffective, while another points out that ads are necessary for high-profit luxury goods. Some users comment on the challenges of avoiding impulse purchases and purchasing high-quality items.The article discusses how the market has adapted to a two-tiered system for products with either low quality/low prices or high quality/high prices. The middle tier has disappeared due to this. Commenters discuss the pitfalls of buying products promoted on social media ads and the need for consumer behavior change. While some doubt the effectiveness of passing a federal privacy law, others see GDPR as a good example. Finally, some point out that the decline in product quality is not new, happening in both physical stores and e-commerce platforms.Amidst multiple HN members sharing their personal experiences with targeted ads on social media platforms, an HN user suggests that newer brands concentrating on growth rather than profit often offer better deals than established companies; an expert journalist thinks regulation for untargeted advertising seems increasingly unrealistic as it is too easy to track usage data these days, leading to the positive observation that the GDPR in the EU at least makes the issue visible; readers may find it interesting to learn that targeted ads might cost about 10% more on average and come from vendors with low ratings from the Better Business Bureau; it is also worth noting that terrible targeting is a common issue across all advertisements-may it be digital, social media or TV, according to another HN user; while not everything is overpriced junk, buying anything purely based on an ad is risky, with some HN members sharing their less-than-positive experiences from Facebook ads.An HN user expresses frustration with a product's incorrect representation of lunar topography. Another user points out a scam involving a purchased product being delivered to a different address. A user disagrees with the claims made in an article about advertising costing businesses and points out the benefits targeted advertising provides to small businesses. An HN user shares a list of long-lasting and money-saving products they have purchased.",

Users suggest alternatives like musl-cross or cross-compiling with zig. Some caution that cross-compiling can be difficult beyond basic libc dependencies. HN users also discuss the merits of touching servers directly and the benefits of a local environment that matches the OS of servers. There are concerns about the Go port of SQLite's stability and transaction behavior, and some recommend using the C library instead.

The post in question is a neat project that would be acceptable for 90% of use cases, although there is room for improvement of optimizations. The SQLite test suite is not open source, and it is challenging for Go to beat C in a benchmark. There is also a line of code that may make someone unhappy if using this project.The Tech Times reports that a comment on Hacker News highlights that openbsd/amd64 is not a supported target, listing alternatives. The article features a discussion among a group of experts about the benefits of implementing SQLite in Go, as opposed to using import-heavy cross-compilation. Among the benefits of Go-sqlite, one user pointed out that the lack of a C library call means that the main loop avoids getting clogged or damaging the real-time path, which can be beneficial in high-performance analytics systems. It's worth noting that not using CGO appears to be the main advantage of Go-sqlite over the standard SQLite drivers available.A new way to embed SQLite in Go with no need for CGo has been developed by an 'HN user'. The method involves using a C to Go compiler and then compiling SQLite's C code base to produce the SQLite Go code. Some users praised the new method while others had trouble with transaction lock errors. The new method is quicker than using gcc on Windows, making it ideal for non-performance-critical purposes.

        "content": "Culture Amp, a company that once heavily relied on Elm as the preferred language for new front-end code, has recently announced that it has ended its investment in Elm after four years. The company moved away from the language despite the formerly elaborate promotion it received from Kevin Yank, the engineering lead of the company. The move came as a result of a decision from culture Amp's design reach, which attempted to build and maintain an element library of reusable user interface components and styles that supported both Elm and React.Culture Amp's design team experimented with Web Components to create a language-agnostic library of shared UI components but found the technology demands its own framework to scale.\nAfter considering Elm and React, Culture Amp chose to stick with React because it acquired another company whose entire code base was written in React and TypeScript had grown to be capable enough of matching Elm's state management.\nElm's momentum was losing steam, and Culture Amp could only justify a single front end application framework.\nThe breaking changes of Elm 0.18 to 0.19 took a small group of volunteers about a year to complete, suggesting a lack of motivation to keep the technology healthy in Culture Amp's stack.Culture Amp is considering moving Elm from \"adopt\" to \"contain\" status on their Tech Radar due to an increasing trend towards selecting React in TypeScript for new projects. The decision would mean that while existing Elm codebases would continue to be maintained and have features added, it would no longer be selected for new projects. Engineers provided constructive feedback on the decision, with Louis Quinnell acknowledging the benefits of Elm but ultimately supporting the decision to contain it due to the complexity it creates. The author notes that success means being just as good at ending things as starting new ones.",

        "hn_content": "The article 'Why and How We Retired Elm at Culture Amp' discusses the process of replacing Elm with TypeScript due to compatibility issues. The article raises discussions about whether preferring a specific language preference during hiring is a good idea. Additionally, there are comments by HN users about their personal experiences with interviewers who have been dismissive of functional programming languages such as Erlang. Some users also warn about red flags during interviews, such as abusive or toxic work environments. Overall, the article and comments provide insights into the challenges and lessons learned during the technology development process.Experts suggest that when speaking to a manager, you should lead with an interest in building great products, and that being professionally interested in learning business domains is important. It's better to hire someone who knows standard industry technology, rather than someone who's motivated by the excitement of learning new technology. A team needs to balance getting shit done with powering up with new ideas. Managers prefer pragmatic people over those who are too excited about a specific language. Consistency is important, and it's better to be boring but practical.An expert describes situations in which a team's preference for advanced technology over necessary functionality impeded progress and how those problems were resolved. The article advises employers to be careful when hiring engineers who may value their love of tech over the needs of the business. While valuing new and complex technologies is not a bad thing, it is important to ensure that progress is not impeded in favor of satisfying a love for technology. Ethically speaking, commenting on immutable qualities about prospective candidates is on the same level as considering unrelated attributes, so it is important to focus on actual indicators of expertise when hiring.The Tech Times editor must provide a concise summary of a discussion among Hacker News users regarding a company's decision to reject job candidates who express interest in functional programming. The comments range from agreeing with the company's stance to disagreeing and suggesting that it may be counterproductive to reject candidates for expressing interest in certain technologies. Some users suggest that being overly zealous about a technology or lacking knowledge about prospective employer's products may be more of a red flag than expressing interest in a specific programming language. The editor should not be politically biased and must maintain professionalism while avoiding any political or religious statements. Additionally, the summary should avoid repeating dull facts but instead focus on capturing vital points about the post that are interesting to its primarily tech-savvy readers.Culture Amp has implemented a hiring rule that disqualifies candidates who are purely technology-focused and don't align with the company's culture. Some Hacker News users argue that it's an overreaction and doesn't consider the possibility of functional programming being the best choice for a project in the future. Others believe that the rule is in place to avoid science projects being created, rather than finishing client work. Furthermore, some believe that hiring rules are arbitrary and may cover personal biases, while others see the benefits of using a language that employees enjoy working with.Despite having a vibrant community, the adoption and hiring for Elm has slowed down, making it challenging to compete with more established frameworks like React. Elm's primary disadvantage is that it requires frontend developers to 'think in Elm' to use it effectively. The comments section recommends various languages including, gren, Roc, or Solid for better performance and cleaner codes. A notable issue with React is its innate performance issues that begin to appear in more complex interactive web pages. While Fast-enough is a myth, instant apps are magic.Elm, a programming language for web development, is the subject of discussion on Hacker News. While some praise it for being a finished product with infrequent updates, others criticize it for lacking features and being developed behind closed doors with limited discussion with library authors. It appears that some people have been banned from the Elm community for expressing confrontational views. Despite the controversy, Elm's creator, Evan, will be giving a talk about using Elm on the backend.A range of comments on Hacker News have been made regarding the challenges of managing an engineering organization, design systems, company culture and software choices. Some technical comments on the article state that Elm is being replaced in favor of React due to a mismatch with another company's tech stack. An overview of the key points that interest readers shows that companies should hire people excited about the product and not just the tech stack. Design systems provide logistical and economic benefits for large companies, but they are usually not worth the investment for smaller companies. Company culture is discussed in detail, including Culture Amp's tools to help manage personal development goals and employee surveys.A former Elm user shares their experience choosing TypeScript over Elm due to the latter requiring more faith and potentially being harder to get off, despite offering similar benefits such as static typing and predictability. The rise of TypeScript may have clipped Elm's wings, making it harder to hit critical mass and change the future. Users weigh in discussing justifications for tech stack choices and popular but declining technologies such as Ruby, SQL Server, and Postgres. Some comments reflect on the challenges of bridge-building between different languages and tools when transitioning to new technologies.A company decided to contain their use of Elm due to difficulty maintaining two frameworks and the popularity of React among new hires as a result of an acquisition. The use of Web Components with Stencil didn't impress them, but it was not the main point. Hiring Elm developers was also difficult. Some HN users expressed concerns about the use of hype to determine what constitutes superior technology. Elm's explicit design to be hard to integrate with JavaScript was a sticking point for some users. The article title may be misleading, and it's more of a \"phasing out\" of Elm than a full retirement.",

Other users share experiences of introducing Minecraft to their young children. The game has evolved since its beta days, with more specialized blocks and items. The challenge is only open to kids in the US, but HN users suggest that current airport designers could learn from 12-year-old kids. Overall, the post generates interest among users due to the unique combination of Minecraft and aviation design.The FAA held a competition in which students used Minecraft to design airports. This competition was an amazing educational experience and a fantastic way for students to learn about engineering. Minecraft is not just for entertainment: it can be used intellectually to stimulate a child's growth. The competition was a great way for the FAA to crowdsource hyper-realistic 3D world replicas for infrastructure projects. It would be ideal if government infrastructure projects were open-sourced for public contribution; Microsoft Flight Simulator could further be used as a tool to test changes to the layouts of proposed airports. Many people love reading and understanding technical documentation, such as procedure design documents, especially when their job requires it. Lego League and Minecraft's ability to engage kids can not be overemphasised. However, it helps if children's use of video games is carefully moderated.HN users share anecdotes and opinions about kids and video games, with some expressing concerns over addiction and dependence. Others, however, recount fond memories of playing computer games as a child, underscoring the potential for tech use to cultivate later interest in the field. A Minecraft-inspired project that teaches children basic programming skills elicits positive responses from users. The project encourages tactile and collaborative learning, with children using Lego blocks to create virtual machines. Despite various opinions, users commend the project for its creativity and potential pedagogical benefits.",

Some suggest that instead of just treating the symptoms, Google should prevent apps from refusing to work or disabling unrelated functionality just because some permissions are denied. Suggestions include creating a two-pronged approach to make it a rule in the Play Store and presenting convincing fake data to apps when permissions are denied. However, some express doubts about how users would react if presented with fake data. Some suggest that control over app stores needs to be transferred to an independent organization, and others point out similar features on other platforms.New secure core architectures in every OS and chip manufacturer promise that executed code will run inside OS and silicon-level sandboxes, with all memory spaces being randomized and encrypted, leading HN users to think malware will soon be extinct. Some HN users express concern about apps wanting excessive permissions, while others complain about predatory loan apps accessing and misusing data from users' phones on a wide scale, with some calling for better regulations or even a whitelist limiting access of loan apps. One user's attempt to use a loan app resulted in his accessing it for free, only to later discover that it was just a new accounts funnel.An app was rejected by Apple for accessing contacts, despite them staying on the device at all times and only being exported when sending a debug log, leading to worsened user experience. Some users suggest that contact access was not an absolute requirement for the app to exist, and that they will not grant access to their contacts due to privacy concerns. Both mainstream mobile operating systems have APIs for handling media access and location data. iOS already has a photo selection feature but apps can refuse to work with it, and they often offer their own photo picker on top of the already-selected photos. There is a need for a similar feature for contacts.New Android architecture enables small apps to work together for camera access without individual hardware requests, but it's not as streamlined as current user expectations. Restrictions on access to contacts only to apps that need them could be eliminated by allowing individual sharing of contacts instead of full access. Some HN contributors advocate limiting access to contacts and photos by default, requiring an opt-in. Android has implemented metrics to track app activity, but it still falls short of satisfying the desires of some users. Desktop users lack permissions limits like those in Android and IOS but can monitor permissions more easily.A discussion on various tech-related topics, including regulations, dark patterns, app stores, and the necessity of apps. There are concerns about alternative app stores, which may weaken user protections. The conversation also touches on the issue of payday loans in the Google Play Store and the convenience of using apps versus websites. There is mention of a unique type of scam in Kenya involving manipulated photos of relatives. An HN user points out Google's banning of payday loan ads on search results despite allowing them on the app store.",

Because I already had a whole setof Go source trees, I picked the hard way.At this point you might wonder why the Go toolchain is dynamicallylinked against the system glibc. Although I haven't tried to analyzesymbol usage, the obvious assumption is that it's dynamically linkedbecause various Go tools want to download packages over the network,which requires looking up DNS names, which is a very common causeof dynamically linking to glibc.The good news, as pointed out to me by @magical, is thatin Go 1.21 and later the plan is for the compiler to be built usingthe pure Go resolver only and to be a static executable. Relevantreading here is apparently issue #53862 and issue #57007 (via). As faras I know, the elements of this plan have already landed in the Godevelopment version; my current development Go binaries are staticbinaries.; ./go versiongo version devel go1.21-66cac9e1e4 Fri Apr 7 23:34:21 2023 +0000 linux/amd64; ldd ./go    not a dynamic executableUnless the Go developers revert this for some reason, Go 1.21 and laterwill be static executables on Linux.(Doing this before Go 1.21 is tricky for reasons beyond the scopeof this entry.)This is a nice little quality of life improvement for people (likeme) mostly working on recent Linuxes but who periodically have todeal with older ones. It won't automatically make your own programsversion-independent, but for them you can use '-tags osusergo,netgo'when you build or install Go programs.(You might wonder why I didn't just build the Go program I neededto run on Ubuntu 20.04 with those flags in the first place. Theanswer is that I was distracted by the flow of circumstances. FirstI tried to run the program on a 20.04 machine in addition to some22.04 ones, and got glibc version errors,so I tried to rebuild it on 20.04 to be more universal, then I hadthe 'go' compiler toolchain not work with the same problem, and bythat point my mental focus was on 'make the compiler toolchain work'.)(3 comments.)Written on 07 April 2023.   \u00ab  ZFS On Linux (still) needs better ways to control the ZFS ARC    These are my WanderingThoughts (About the blog)Full index of entries Recent commentsThis is part of CSpace, and is written by ChrisSiebenmann.

        "hn_content": "Go 1.21 is set to have a static toolchain on Linux, making it faster, but criticisms about Go's handling of nil pointer panics continue to persist. However, HN users point out that retrofitting certain features into Go without breaking backwards compatibility is difficult, leading to the exclusion of sum types and algebraic data types. Though some have suggested a special \"result\" and \"option\" data type to address the issue without breaking backwards compatibility. Overall, many cite Go's toolchain and ease of use as its main appeal, which has helped the programming language prevail.Comments on Hacker News discuss the lack of a viable, fully worked-up proposal for how generics should work in Go, despite calls for such a feature. Some users argue that generics are necessary for libraries and do not significantly impact average user code. Others argue that implementing generics requires a lot of careful thought to ensure correctness, referencing issues in other languages. The discussion diverges into comparisons with Rust, which is said to prioritize zero-cost abstractions over dynamic dispatch, resulting in longer compile times but potentially better performance, and with OCaml and Haskell, which provide easier development experiences through interpreters and REPLs.Comments from Hacker News users discuss the use of Rust's borrow checker and the limitations of other programming languages in terms of memory safety. One user acknowledges the difficulty of working with Rust but claims that its strictness is beneficial, while another argues that GC languages are sufficient for safe memory management. There is also a discussion on the limitations of marking sections of a language as \"safe\" and the challenges of adding features like lifetimes into existing languages. Lastly, the comments touch on using static compiled binaries in Go and the limitations of the language's DNS resolver for resolving user IDs.An exchange on Hacker News regarding the Go Compiler and DNS resolution highlights the pitfalls of using other kinds of resolvers in comparison to a Go-internal DNS resolver implementation. A suggestion was made for the implementation of something similar to systemd-resolved for doing users and groups when it comes to asking the system for UIDs and GIDs. HN users debated the reliance on libc in programming languages, with TheDong explaining it's due to the operating system providing the kernel and libc versions together, while there are several bugs with Musl and glibc, so the process of building applications is complex. The pros and cons of dynamic vs. static linking were also raised.A discussion on how DNS lookups are handled in macOS in Go programming language proceeds on Hacker News. However, a user comments that the macOS system call interface is not guaranteed to be active, so the correct procedure on macOS is to go through libc (libSystem). The discussion mentions that using the custom stuff \"works,\" but it is not guaranteed to be stable. A user notes that building client executables in a debian squeeze docker container allows them to run on all currently supported Linux distributions, including RHEL 6, because of glibc versioning issues. Another user suggests that it is practical to use nsswitch, followed by Janky programs, which may not behave with respect to split tunnel DNS, and features like libc have to dlopen shared libraries. Another user comments that using Go will make the toolchain fully reproducible on 1.21, which will contain exactly the same bits as a released macOS toolchain built on Windows or Linux.",

        "hn_content": "An article titled \"Electricity Prices by Country\" has gained attention on Hacker News, with comments pointing out that US households use more electricity on average than those in the UK largely due to the size of US domiciles, and the widespread use of electricity for heating, cooking, and cooling in the US. The readers also discuss differences in energy usage between regions in the US and factors such as propane usage in rural areas. There is a possibility of migration away from high electricity usage areas such as the southern US, and Alaska may depopulate in time.A Hacker News user shares their experience of drastically reducing their electricity consumption to an average of 4 kWh per day by unplugging everything except the fridge and one HP Microserver. The comments include suggestions on how to further reduce energy consumption, discussions on the environmental impact of different energy sources, and comparisons between energy usage in different countries. Some comments also express surprise at the low energy usage in the original post, while others explain the factors that contribute to higher energy consumption in their own homes.Poland plans to build nuclear power plants to clean up its electricity mix and reduce reliance on Russia. German prices for electricity have been increasing because it shut down nuclear power plants in favor of fossil fuels that provide baseload, leading to reliance on gas plants. Electricity prices in France are low due to the country's reliance on nuclear power. Despite half of France's nuclear control rooms being offline, France manages to maintain a low electricity price per kw/h.A GlobalPetrolPrices.com study shows the ambiguity surrounding electricity prices across countries. While households in Denmark pay the highest average price, those in Venezuela pay the least. Electricity prices in the U.S. are diverse, ranging from 7 cents per kWh to 33 cents per kWh. The prices vary according to seasons, region, and even economic output or household income. Critics suggest the data is simplistic and overly-compares prices for marketing or deceptive purposes. However, experts find such information useful to detect trends and policy implications.Comments on a Hacker News post discussing electricity prices show that there is significant regional variation in pricing due to geography and political policies. The article linked to by the post is accused of misrepresenting data, and commenters also note that prices should be normalized by local average income for a fair comparison. Some comments suggest that energy policies, such as subsidies or price caps, can also impact prices, recalling government subsidies for renewables and taxes to phase out fossil fuels in Germany. Sweden and the UK are cited as examples of countries where the prices listed in the article do not match on-the-ground costs. Meanwhile, Venezuela's $0.00 rating for electricity is called into question, while the high prices in China and the US for commercial businesses sparks concerns about competition in energy-intensive industries.Germany's electricity prices, despite being affected by renewable energy prices, have mostly surged due to the high cost of natural gas. The country's electricity prices are regulated by a system of auctions where the price is set by the most expensive bid to meet demand. Delivery fees and surcharges can double the electricity rate in the US. Toronto residents pay a fixed rate targeted to cross-subsidize heavier users. The actual electricity rate paid in Ontario is double the published rate, and the province is overpaying for wind and solar capacity. Uranium is also considered a fossil fuel. Argentina also offers subsidized electricity rates for both rich and poor residents, making it a prime remote working location.The article discusses electricity prices by country, including coverage and availability in African countries. Some comments highlight the flaws in using averages to describe the entire sample, especially since electricity prices vary widely across regions. One user notes that the article is not arguing about which country has the \"best\" electricity, but instead provides data about prices. However, another user points out that electricity prices are not relevant if there is no electricity available in the first place.",

Regional variations in pricing due to geography and political policies are significant, and prices should be normalized by local average income for a fair comparison. Argentine and Venezuelan subsidies spark concerns, while critics suggest simplistic data comparisons for marketing purposes. Germany's high prices are attributed to the cost of natural gas, while Swede and UK prices are cited as not matching on-the-ground costs. The article covers electricity prices in African countries, though commenters note flaws in using averages to describe the entire sample, and the irrelevance of prices without electricity availability."

Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS12April 8 (Reuters) - In a further attempt to rein in the increasing number of women defying Iran's compulsory dress code, authorities are installing cameras in public places and thoroughfares to identify and penalise unveiled women, the police announced on Saturday.After they have been identified, violators will receive \u201cwarning text messages as to the consequences\u201d, police said in a statement.The move is aimed at \u201cpreventing resistance against the hijab law,\u201d said the statement, carried by the judiciary\u2019s Mizan news agency and other state media, adding that such resistance tarnishes Iran's spiritual image and spreads insecurity.A growing number of Iranian women have been ditching their veils since the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman while in custody of the morality police last September. Mahsa Amini had been detained for allegedly violating the hijab rule. Security forces violently put down the protests following her death.But although risking arrest for defying the obligatory dress code, women are still widely seen unveiled in malls, restaurants, shops and streets around the country. Videos of unveiled women resisting the morality police have flooded social media.Meanwhile, dozens of female students at schools in a central town and the northwestern city of Ardabil were taken ill on Saturday in a new wave of suspected poisonings which affected hundreds of schoolgirls across Iran earlier this year.\"This morning, students smelled an unpleasant odour, had a burning sensation in the throat and felt weak so they were immediately transferred to medical centres by emergency personnel,\" a security official in Ardabil told reporters, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.A fact-finding committee investigating the suspected poisonings is expected to report to parliament in about two weeks, its head was quoted as saying by the semi-official news agency ILNA.Authorities have accused the Islamic Republic's \"enemies\" of using the attacks to undermine the clerical establishment. But suspicions have fallen on hardline groups operating as self-declared guardians of their interpretation of Islam.Saturday's police statement on the hijab law called on owners of businesses to \u201cseriously monitor the observance of societal norms with their diligent inspections\u201d.Under Iran's Islamic sharia law, imposed after the 1979 revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes to disguise their figures. Violators have faced public rebuke, fines or arrest.Describing the veil as \"one of the civilizational foundations of the Iranian nation\" and \u201cone of the practical principles of the Islamic Republic,\u201d an Interior Ministry statement on March 30 said there would be no retreat on the issue.It urged citizens to confront unveiled women. Such directives in past decades have emboldened hardliners to attack women.

The issue has triggered discussions regarding individual freedom and religious oppression, with some feminists in the western world fighting to wear hijabs, while others believe the hijab isn't a choice, but rather coercion. The subject of hijabs raises questions about cultural and religious pride that vary in different countries; Western governments that attempt to ban the hijab also complicate the topic. Meanwhile, discussions on public safety and fear of being offended have emerged.Comments on an HN thread are debating the wearing of religious clothing such as hijabs and specifically the idea of banning or legalising it. Some argue that it is about the power of choice for the individual, while others argue it is a device to enforce modesty and related to indoctrination. Comparisons are made to nazi symbols, and the general consensus is that people should have the freedom to choose what they wear or do not wear. However, some argue that women wear items out of fear, and there are issues around migrant communities and women's rights. Lastly, one user thinks the average liberal is advocating for \"authoritarian solutions\" on societal issues.An HN user suggests that American conservatism has an unhealthy obsession with authoritarian solutions. An HN user argues that feminists are fundamentally anti-religion and anti-establishment. An HN user shares a personal experience with feminists supporting religious clothing. HN users discuss the implications of Iran's use of surveillance cameras to suppress political dissent. Some users draw comparisons to gun control laws and the impact on state-sponsored tyranny. A user specifies that there is nothing factual about claiming that possessing a firearm prevents state violence.An HN user argues against the effectiveness of guns against state power, citing examples of indigenous peoples with better access to firearms than the US Army as well as the Easter Rising in Ireland. Another user counters with specific examples of how the US government has used tactical teams and modern weaponry to quell unrest. The conversation shifts to the use of technology for oppression and the potential impact of AI-powered surveillance cameras. Some users argue that cameras contribute to oppression while others maintain that oppressive intent matters more than technology.The article discusses balancing individual freedom and limiting access to guns in light of recent events, with one person pointing out that limiting access to guns has worked well in most of Europe. The conversation then shifts to the topic of the Iranian government's treatment of women, with mixed opinions on the issue. Finally, there is mention of the ongoing poisoning of school girls in Iran, with some suggesting that the government is responsible. Overall, the comments provide a diverse range of perspectives on these complex issues.An article on Hacker News discusses the use of facial recognition technology in Iran to spy on unveiled women, which raises questions about surveillance and privacy. Some comments suggest that the technology being used is likely from a Chinese company, and there are concerns about the consequences of this type of work in the AI image recognition space. There is also debate about whether the compulsory veiling of women is objectively wrong and whether it correlates with the tensions between Iran and Israel. The article raises important issues about the use of technology for surveillance and the role of cultural values in shaping its use.",

This service relied on sessions, which consisted of interconnected Java objects that were supposed to be cleaned up either when a user logged out or after a predetermined timeout period.During the course of our capacity planning, we discovered a significant memory waste that I wanted to share with you.Capacity PlanningPart of my routine work with the team included capacity planning for the next year.By analyzing our usage metrics, growth patterns, and population research, our data scientists were able to predict how many users we could expect to have in the coming year.To determine the necessary infrastructure required to support this anticipated user base, we employed a sophisticated formula:\\[\\text{Number of Servers} = { \\text{Number of Users} \\over \\text{Users per Server} } * \\text{Safety Buffer}\\]To know how many servers we need to have for next year.One of our capacity planning sessions revealed that, due to the immense popularity of our service, we were anticipating a significant growth in the number of users in the coming year. Our calculations indicated that we would require more servers than we had available to accommodate this increased demand. Consequently, we were faced with the challenge of figuring out how to fit more users onto each individual server in order to support the projected user base.What are we bound on?With capacity measurement, we can pinpoint the bottleneck in our system, and in this case, it is the memory. As more users are added to the server, the system begins to falter under the increased load, ultimately running out of memory. Understanding we are memory-bound is crucial, as it directs our efforts towards reducing memory consumption in order to accommodate more users on the server.Investigating memory usageWe had a crude estimation of our per-user memory consumption using this:\\[\\text{Per User Memory} = { \\text{Server Memory} \\over \\text{User Capacity} }\\]Using imaginary numbers, we can say something like:\\[\\text{Per User Memory} = \\text{300MB} = { \\text{90 GB} \\over \\text{300} }\\]So we can approxiamte per-user memory requirement as 300MB.In order to understand how to reduce this number, we went into more serious memory measurement.We began analyzing the Java memory dump of our servers to identify potential areas for improvement. Initially, we reviewed the dumps manually, but due to the sheer number of servers, we developed a custom script to automate the process. Using this script, we were able to identify memory-wasting objects that were attributed to specific sessions. By pinpointing these issues, we can effectively eliminate the waste and optimize our system\u2019s memory usage.I might cover the script and analysis in another post, but for now I want to focus on a specific quick win the memory analysis gave us.A very big stringWe started with going over our thousands of memdumps and looking for very big objects. Our biggest whale was a 1.5GB string. It looked something like this:In case the picture didn\u2019t convey the message, the string contained many many backslashes. We found similar smaller ones, but this one was the biggest.Investigating what the purpose of the string was, I saw that we had classes that looked like this:class Screen { //... private Screen previous; public String toJson() {  JSONObject jo = new JSONObject();  //...  if (previous != null) {   jo.put(\"previous\", previous.toJson());  }  //...  return jo.toString(); }}class Session { //... String currentScreen; public void setUrl(Screen s) {  currentScreen = s.toJson(); }}So each screen has the previous screen the user visited, to allow the user to go \u201cback\u201d and get the exact screen they were in before (state, scrolling position, validation notices etc). The user session also has the current screen the user is in, so if the user reconnects to an existing session, we can return to where they were.There are two design problems here:The \u201cback\u201d stack is unlimited, meaning we\u2019re saving more and more state until we explodeby running jo.put(\"previous\", previous.toJson());, we\u2019re converting the JSON dictionary to a string. Since JSON fields have quotes, and those quotes need to be escaped when stored in a string, they are stored as \\\".That backslash needs to be escaped when this string is stored inside another string, compouding into \\\\\\\". A couple more rounds of this, and we get \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"It turns out that a user with a session with lots of screens produced a currentScreen String of gigantic proportions.Handling and followupWe divided the problem into a quick fix and a long-term one:The quick fix was truncating the \u201cprevious\u201d string if it goes over a specific char amount (e.g. not letting it go over 100MB).While this is not a complete solution and might impact the user experience, it was very quick to implement and easy to test, boosting our reliability (preventing a specific session from inflating and bringing the server down).The long-term fix was rewriting the \u201cprevious\u201d stack solution completely, creating a dedicated real stack with self-imposed size limits and reporting.It took a long time to write, and longer to test and slowly release, but it really prevented memory waste, rather than only hide away whale-strings as another form of memory (e.g. very deep JSON objects).EpilogueWe continued to use the memory-dump analysis tool and found more nonsense we killed, but nothing as easy as this.My main takeway from this story is that sometimes, checking the details of how your program uses resources (e.g. examining a memdump rather than just measuring overall memory utilization) is crucial for success and produces quick wins from the start.

While Substack is seen as a potential alternative to Twitter, the issue of profitability and the prevalence of conspiracy theorists is brought up. The idea of a \"classy\" or \"thinking person's\" social media company is suggested, but commenters debate if niche communities can replace them. Discoverability is identified as a challenge for alternative social media platforms, and the network effect is acknowledged as a determining factor for social media success. Breaking news and democratizing journalism may be a aspect that would be difficult to replicate outside of Twitter.Twitter banning links to competitors conflicts with Elon Musk's ideal of being a digital public square for free speech, based on the comments. Musk has the right to choose who gets reach and who does not, as it is his platform and he paid for its audience, according to an HN user. Substack, a Medium-style blog host with monetization functionality, just launched \"Substack Notes,\" a Twitter clone according to an HN user. Recently, Twitter has disabled likes and retweets of any post mentioning \"substack\", and Substack bloggers are forced to choose between the two platforms.An anonymous HN user suggests that there may be vote and account trading happening on the platform. Another user discusses the benefits of anonymity and rotating accounts. Some users express their opinions on Substack, with some liking it and others on the fence. Discussions also arise about Elon Musk's role in his companies and whether they succeed despite him or because of him.Comments on a Hacker News (HN) thread discussing Elon Musk's leadership style and public image suggest that his success with Tesla and SpaceX could be attributed in part to his leadership qualities. However, some users also criticize Musk for surrounding himself with \"yes men\" and for his recent actions on Twitter. Some comments seem to suggest that the thread is fueled by bias confirmation, while others question the veracity of the claims made about Musk. Some users suggest that Musk's mad visions, relentless drive, and notoriety may still be essential for SpaceX's continued success, while others argue that the company has already benefited from the leadership of Gwynne Shotwell.Elon Musk's management style and behavior towards safety have led some individuals to swear off buying a Tesla or anything Musk is involved in. Some speculate that Musk may have an exceptional ability to assemble a team capable of managing him, making him very capable of starting and growing companies. However, the bad management behavior even in successful companies is well-documented. Musk's purchase of Twitter has destabilized the company due to his erratic behavior, and a blind spot may have caused Paul Graham to misunderstand Twitter's value proposition when he tweeted last fall. The next iteration of social media should be non-profit with explicit content guidelines.Substack is expanding into microblogging, competitng with Twitter, leading to concerns among Twitter personalities about migration to Substack. While some suggest investing in Substack, others question the company's financials and the viability of its business model. Twitter's troubles include vapid inanity and endless political bickering, while it attracts hateful content, leading to calls for more regulation. Twitter's former profitability and the ill-advised strategy pursued by Elon Musk after it was bought damaged the revenue stream and caused the firing of the ad sales and moderation teams. Meanwhile, issues with bots have plagued Twitter, raising concerns about the use of paid bots in the future.",

It appears field agents did not come across anyone at the site, however, and that may be due in part to questions about whether the church is even open any longer. Some postings online say the Eastside Free Methodist Church has gone dark for good, raising questions about whether it is the church members \u2013 or someone else \u2013 that is using the space.Nevertheless, under federal law because Eastside Free Methodist Church owns the building, it is potentially on the hook for enforcement action related to the pirate station. The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau is giving the property owner ten days to respond to the warnings with any evidence they may have, showing they are no longer permitting pirate radio broadcasting to occur on their property. The warning letter to the church also points out it could face a penance of more than $2.3 million in fines.It is the second Oregon-targeted pirate action to be released by the FCC in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the FCC proposed an $80,000 fine against an alleged pirate operating in La Grande, OR. The FCC says Thomas Barnes was the man behind a pirate station operating on 100.5 FM since at least 2018. Under FCC rules, Barnes has until mid-April to decide if he wants to pay the penalty or file a request that it be cancelled or reduced.The FCC says it logged its first complaint regarding the eastern Oregon pirate station in 2018. It dispatched Portland, OR-based field agents to investigate, and they tracked the station on 92.3 FM to Barnes\u2019 former residence at the Orchard Motel on Adams Avenue in La Grande. After speaking with him, the FCC says it became apparent that Barnes was the operator of the unlicensed stations. At the time, he agreed to voluntarily surrender his transmitter to the agent.But a year later, in April 2019, the FCC received a second complaint stating that Barnes was again operating a pirate radio station in La Grande. They tracked the station, again on 92.3 FM, to Barnes\u2019 new home on Jefferson Avenue. He agreed to voluntarily surrender another transmitter to the agent.Both times the FCC notified Barnes that he could face severe penalties, including substantial monetary fines, for running a pirate station. But that apparently was not enough to discourage him. It received a third complaint about another pirate station in La Grande in March 2022 that agents again traced back to Barnes\u2019 home. This time Barnes\u2019 wife, Rebecca, voluntarily surrendered two transmitters.Barnes then took to Facebook where he posted a video admitting he was operating a pirate station and that the FCC could not stop him unless it \u201clocked him up.\u201d He then signed-on another station at 100.5 FM. Digging deeper, agents also discovered that Barnes had uploaded over 30 videos to his Facebook account admitting he ran a pirate station.In its decision to slap Barnes with an $80,000 fine, the FCC said his conduct was \u201cintentional\u201d and he \u201chad been warned multiple times since 2018 that his conduct was illegal, but he nonetheless chose to continue to operate without authorization.\u201dFacebookTwitterLinkedinSMSEmailPrintSaveSite searchSearch                Sections               HomeFeaturesPeople MovesRatingsStationIntelStation SearchThis site Is For Business Use Only.

Field agents from the FCC tracked the pirate radio but did not find any individuals currently there, and the church maybe closed according to the online postings available. It is probable that the church will face enforcement action under federal law, as it owns the building.

        "hn_content": "The FCC warns a Portland church to shut down a pirate FM radio station operating under its steeple. An HN user discusses the importance of FCC regulations for emergency communication oversight. The user argues that pirate stations have the potential to interfere with critical systems used by firefighters, police, or ambulances. Furthermore, pirate radio stations do not participate in emergency alert systems (EAS), which can put the public at risk during emergencies. Another HN user applauds the radio pirate for allowing independent voices in what they perceive as a \"corporate-crap\" media environment. Caught operating a pirate radio station with a fine of $80,000, the man operating in Oregon during 2018-2022 had multiple complaints and was continuously warned by FCC agents.An HN user asks if hostile powers could build radio transmitters to interfere with emergency broadcasts, prompting a discussion on the legality and regulation of radio use, including encryption of ham radio traffic; while another user points out that the US FCC is reactionary and only investigates interference as a response to complaints, they do not need more powers to deal with radio interference of this kind now. Other comments discuss the ability of small-scale transmitters and poor regulation to degrade the quality of radio communication, and the potential inefficiency of how spectrum is allocated.Comments from HN users regarding radio broadcasting regulations and pirate radio stations, including personal anecdotes and opinions on the topic. Some users suggest using the FM band for public-access radio, while others discuss the FCC's relatively lax enforcement of certain regulations, particularly for pirate broadcasts. There are also some comments on the potential for using ham radio for broadcasting. An \"Ask HN\" thread that primarily features discussions and personal stories from domain experts rather than hard facts or developments in technology.The FCC has issued a warning to a pirate radio station operating in Portland and posing a threat to the FM band. The station was running an analog FM signal over the digital signal of a licensed independent public broadcaster, and two signals on the bandwidth between 90.5-90.6 MHz caused interference to several other stations. A potential solution to the issue could be Low Power FM (LPFM) stations, but there has not been an LPFM application filing window since 2013. Many amateur hams are ready to help nonprofits, with the FCC likely to open an LPFM window in the near future.Analog and digital signals overlap and cause significant interference, and full-power stations must be spaced apart by at least one vacant channel to avoid interference. A pirate FM radio station in Portland was shut down for compromising the signal of a licensed station running HD format. The FCC does not investigate or mention the content of the broadcast. In the US, without a license, on FM, one can operate with 250 microvolts per meter, measured at a distance of 3 meters; that equates to about 200 feet. Norway shut down its entire FM network to make people switch to DAB+.Radio enthusiasts in Norway are discussing operating FM pirate radio stations due to unused frequencies, but one user pointed out that it's tough for pirates to compete against commercial broadcast operators. In Portland, an abandoned church is being threatened with a fine for a pirate radio station that interfered with a licensed low power FM signal and belonged to another church in Salem. While some suggest revoking tax exemptions to shut down such operations, others argue that airwaves are a shared resource and need regulations. However, some feel tracking down unlicensed broadcasting is unnecessary and disruptive to licensed users.",
        "hn_summary": "The FCC warned a Portland church to shut down a pirate FM radio station under its steeple. Such stations can interfere with emergency communication, and are not part of EAS. However, some consider pirate stations necessary for independent voices. The caught pirate was fined $80,000 and had numerous warnings. Discussion on the regulation, legality, and efficiency of radio use and allocation ensued, with suggestions for LPFM stations. Interference can be caused by the overlap of analogue and digital signals. Some Norway radio enthusiasts are discussing FM pirate stations. Regulations and control over airwaves are contentious topics."

Jussi KemppainenApril 6, 2023I took an upcoming AI powered fluid simulation tool for a test dive to see if it would allow me to add realistic, interactive smoke to the game.The final realtime fluid simulations in the game build.Deciding to add fluid simulations to the gameAs my game has a a stationary camera, it would be easy for me to add pre-rendered full screen fluid simulations on top of the image and it should match perfectly. I decided to use the Maglev train sequence as a prototype scenario.I was going to use a software called EmberGen. It is realtime, but in order to get the fluid simulations to your game engine, you need to export them as pre rendered flip-book animations. Flip-book animations are simply an image with all of the animation frames in it. EmberGen generated flip-book of the train smoke when it arrives at the stationFor this fluid simulation to work, my first step would be to get the train animation to EmberGen. This is very easy with the Unity FBX exporter. It can be easily installed from the package manager.The FBX exporter worked great and the animations loaded up in EmberGen without a hitch! Setting up the fluid sim to emit from the train was easy and it looked great! I rendered the simulation and jumped over to Unity. Next I needed to make the velocity blending capable flip book renderer\u2026Pivoting to real-time 3D fluid simulationBut at this point I remembered that I had seen a realtime, AI powered smoke and fire simulation plugin for Unity https://zibra.ai/zibra-smoke-fire. For sure the fluid simulations would be better rendered in realtime, not baked to choppy flip-books with very limited duration! Maybe the realtime tool was worth a try? It being an AI tool it would also be a great fit for this project!Also, when the fluid sim is actually in 3D space, the moving characters will blend with it better and it will also automatically composite correctly with scene elements in depth.Zebra AI Smoke & Fire promotional videoMy only concern was performance. I had experimented with Niagara fluids in Unreal 5 and they eat up quite a bit of performance. To the point of being unusable for now. Luckily, I had direct connection to the Zibra guys and they showed me some demos of it running on the iPhone. It ran amazingly well! The quality was great, the frame rate butter smooth. It is amazing what you can do with AI! I have never seen 3D fluid simulations as complex as this on a phone. Ever.I quickly gave up on using EmberGen and committed fully to Zibra Smoke & Fire!The Smoke & Fire example sceneWhen I loaded up Zibra for the first time (after enabling it in the URP renderer) I am greeted with a simple demo scene that has some fire and a teapot. The fire in this scene looks amazing and runs blazing fast. I asked Zibra what evil AI magic they are doing to make this so fast, how was the AI used to run their simulations?We use it\u2019s as a acceleration component.We use neural network to represent the object\u2019s shape in the form of compact SDF (Signed Distance Field), making it possible to create performant colliders for objects of arbitrary shape, and set up interaction with complex 3D objects in just a few clicks.Alex from ZibraSDFs are indeed amazing. I use them on Pax Dei for a crazy number of things. Such a handy concept!Setting up the smoke simulationsThe smoke emitter in the Unity sceneSetting up the fluid sim in the maglev scene was very simple. I used Zibra\u2019s components to add a cylinder emitter to the train. It is important to enable the \u201cUse Object Velocity\u201d feature as the train is moving and this will add very nice motion to the smoke.Smoke & Fire cover component with the Manipulators set upThis element is then linked to the solver component. I also created a ground collision shape and a force field that adds random forces & twirls to the smoke to make it look more interesting and natural.The smoke\u2019s lighting settingsIt really did not take me all that long to set this up and have it going in the scene. Most of the time was actually spent on matching the smoke color to the scene. It was pretty straightforward with the tools provided. Zibra Smoke & Fire has a couple of dozen sliders for controlling the look of the smoke, and I did not get to thoroughly study all of them yet in this quick test.As I do not really have any lighting in the game, I lit the fluids with one directional light that has its contribution to any 3D objects set to off. As zebra is not lit conventionally, the directional light was still visible on the smoke. Then it was just a matter of finding a light direction that made most sense for the scene and tweaking the absorption, scattering and shadow colours to match the location image as well as possible.I found matching the smoke lights with the scenes pretty intuitive.In conclusion, I am absolutely amazed how well this system works! the smoke rendering added about 2 ms to my frame times based on the unity stats inspector. That is absolutely amazing. This is a full screen fluid simulation with complex scene interactions!If the plugin proves to be stable and reliable even when left running for hours, I might end up adding some fluid sim smokes and dusts to all of my scenes. It just looks so good! Previous post Development Blog, Season 01 Episode 01Animation, Art, VFXLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Rust, like most languages, has a default global allocator, but there are two proposals to add support for custom memory allocators - allocator-api and the storage proposal - both of which have their pros and cons regarding simplicity and functionality. The post provides approaches for using custom allocators in Rust data structures, with different tradeoffs including simplicity and flexibility.The article explores different approaches to custom allocators in Rust, with a focus on the fill tessellator implementation in the lyon library. The different approaches include adding a lifetime parameter or using two structures, using a static trait object or a borrowed trait object, and a Zig-style manually managed trait object. The article concludes that adding support for custom allocators is easy, and that the Allocator trait is the right abstraction. The experimental code for the approaches is available in different branches. Note that Rust experts should read the article for additional technical details.Custom allocators are a useful feature for performance-focused libraries, and their integration into crates is becoming more common as more specialized custom allocators become available. While adding generic or lifetime parameters to structs only visible internally can be tedious, it is essential in some cases, such as when performance is a factor. However, adding such parameters can have unexpected consequences, as benchmark tests have shown. Recycling allocations and picking the right allocator for specific parts of the code are two options that developers have. A healthy ecosystem needs the Allocator trait stabilized so that Storage implementations can leverage it.",

Custom allocation strategies offer advanced feature control over memory management, while the use of an unsafe API requires users of the API to uphold a contract that may not be upheld in other types of languages. Users can already do custom allocation in Rust, but efforts are being made to bring support for custom allocators to the types in 'std' to combine use with a normal 'Vec'. Rust's greatest value is having zero-cost abstractions and highest-performance code with compile-time verification of correctness.An HN user discusses the \"big box\" problem with the allocaor-api, pointing out that Bumpalo defines its own box type. Compared to Zig, Rust needs to adjust to custom allocators safely. Passing containers as a better alternative to custom allocators is another suggestion. Rust's default allocation is the same as C++'s, but lifetime annotations are a way for programmers to tell the compiler if there are any rule violations. The lifetime system may not offer much optimization, but it could allow for faster library design. A user asks for input on custom allocators for tensor operations.",

The article discusses technical and non-technical arguments surrounding the issue of free will, including that decision processes are influenced by subconscious components. While some comments challenge the claims of the article, others assert that the author is not convincing and is making unexamined assumptions. The article is criticized for its lack of evidence and for oversimplifying complex issues, including societal changes and human nature.The article discusses the concept of free will and posits that it does not exist in a fundamental sense, although it is a useful concept in everyday life. Some comments discuss the relationship between free will and love, and the lack of concrete definition surrounding the concept. The article ignores the role of psychology in the debate and leans towards determinism, which is contradicted by modern physics. However, the concept of free will is not replaceable as it is a useful self-modeling construct.Experts on HackerNews debate the existence of free will and its potential implications on society, with one user arguing that quantum physics does not support the notion of free will as the control of stochastic phenomena. The article, which focuses on the denial of free will's connection to issues of race, diversity, and criminal justice, is criticized for using narrow premises and ignoring the influence of world religions. The author's arguments are interpreted by some as dismissive of diversity training and subtly anti-LGBTQ+, but others point out that dense interpretations of phrases like \"born this way\" can lead to misunderstandings.The debate on free will has no bearing on whether governments can modify behavior through incentivizing or punishing. There is no consensus on free will in Judeo-Christian traditions, and its importance varies in different sects of Christianity. Accepting responsibility for actions is easier than admitting powerlessness. People are motivated by perceived consequences, but this doesn't prove the usefulness or existence of free will. Political beliefs seem to have shifted from an emphasis on different freedoms to an overall belief in no freedoms. The trend is sociopathic; what people believe in depends on how it furthers the party line or helps them win.An article on Hacker News sparked a discussion regarding the erosion of freedom in society. Some comments included accusations of dogmatic drivel and noted that people seem to want others to take responsibility for their lives, which they argue leads to a loss of freedom.

It is used by me as a guideline for my students and classes and I share it as open source so hopefully it can also help out others, be it teachers or students.Learning by porting something known from a language of comfort to a language you wish to learn (eg rust) is a great learning style and approach to solidify theoretical knowledge, gain new insights and get practical experience in it. So just to say that I do appreciate that way of learning and in fact when talking to students about projects they can do as part of their learning journey I pretty much always mention the idea of porting something existent as a way to learn.That being said I do not know of any good and complete step by step walkthroughs of such endeavour. If you know of any good books, blogs or videos that provide this feel free to share with me here or as a PR in GitHub and I\u2019ll review to see if it can be added (eg can be great addition to the learn more rust section where I list such ideas).Again thanks for the feedback and I wish you a nice weekend. reply  quietbritishjim 18 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I can't parse that sentence.

        "hn_summary": "A guide for learning Rust with a focus on general Rust, not just web development. Rust is a great choice for products requiring backends, 3D graphics APIs, and interaction with low-level OS APIs. Rust performs better than Go or Python on GCP cloud runs, with lower memory usage and fast execution. The 'learn by porting' approach is a great way to learn Rust; there are no good walkthroughs for the approach currently."

The latter much easier gives up just saying that it could not find anything, while ChatGPT replies based on its \"knowledge\" even on quite advanced science questions. Having a LLM trained on content generated by other LLM may be a way for disaster in future: filtering true from false (but convincing) information on scale would be hard to say the least.

Gonna fire this up now.On the topic of ChatGPT code projects, way I recently made another evening side project[1] using ChatGPT. I found a really nice pattern to use with it is to use one commit per ChatGPT iteration (including commits where it breaks the program, just don't push to main until it's good again). And in each commit, I store the full prompt or reply I said to ChatGPT as a prompt.txt[2]. I'll probably tack it onto the commit description next time for ease of reading. But other friends have found this really useful to be able to see exactly how I+ChatGPT evolved the software with each commit, and I can look back and reference useful prompting patterns I used.[1] https://github.com/dag10/timelapse[2] https://github.com/dag10/timelapse/commits/e77d11baaaf4e2a5f... reply  mikae1 14 hours ago        | prev | next [\u2013] Well, this could be close to what I dreamed off when I did the GDPR takeout two years ago!

We formulate the problem as a grid world where the agent learnshow to move the mouse and click on the reCAPTCHA button to receive a highscore. We study the performance of the agent when we vary the cell size of thegrid world and show that the performance drops when the agent takes big stepstoward the goal. Finally, we used a divide and conquer strategy to defeat thereCAPTCHA system for any grid resolution. Our proposed method achieves asuccess rate of 97.4% on a 100x100 grid and 96.7% on a 1000x1000 screenresolution.

The proposed method achieves a success rate of 97.4% on a 100x100 grid and 96.7% on a 1000x1000 screen resolution. The authors also show that increasing the cell size reduces the performance of the agent.",

Which is just run recaptcha.render and boom, it issues you a token.The problem they're solving with RL isn't the \"click the tiles with the stop sign\" its the \"click the checkbox to prove you're a human\". The token score is mainly derived from your env (medium impact on score), google cookies (high impact on score), and IP quality (high impact on score). Mouse movement is barely factored in at all, and can be ignored for botting purposes.So for now, there's no added value here over the status-quo real-world solution. That said, for future systems which use more behavioral analysis, this research might be helpful. reply  orbisvicis 22 hours ago        | parent | next [\u2013] Recaptcha v3 doesn't have any user interaction. It just returns a score and leaves the subsequent decision to the site designer.What is this about recaptcha.render? reply  runnerup 21 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] If I'm being honest, I was being charitable to the paper in the spirit of HN guidelines. Figure 1 and Figure 2 clearly shows interaction with reCAPTCHA v2. The language of the paper also evokes reCAPTCHA v2 and suggests that those figures were not just for reader enrichment:> Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodology to bypass Google reCAPTCHA v3. We formulate the problem as a grid world where the agent learns how to move the mouse and click on the reCAPTCHA button to receive a high score.> 2.2 Settings: To pass the reCAPTCHA test, a human user will move his mouse starting from an initial position, perform a sequence of steps until reaching the reCAPTCHA check-box and clicking on it.So I was responding for reCAPTCHA v2 where you'd call:grecaptcha.render('recaptcha-container', { 'sitekey': 'your_site_key', 'theme': 'light'});But like honestly there are so many methods not discussed in this paper that sort of invalidate the conclusion. They don't \"contradict\" it, they just dont validate it. One critical one is how they chose their sitekey(s).Because when a sitekey is first created, it gives 0.9/0.7 scores very often. Then over time, it adapts to the \"normal\" traffic for that sitekey. If they used a sitekey from an actual site with real traffic (bots and human), then they would need cooperation for that sites recap admin panel. Which they didn't document, so they probably made a fresh sitekey. reply  judge2020 23 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] > . Mouse movement is barely factored in at all, and can be ignored for botting purposes.Partially because they also have to do something about low-cost human clickers being hired to complete captchas in India etc. So, besides checking google reputation and the other forms of reputation you've mentioned, Google gets free mturk if the click farms manage to bypass these reputation checks. reply  jerjerjer 15 hours ago        | parent | prev | next [\u2013] I skimmed through the article twice, trying to figure out how are they using RL to detect fire hydrants, crossroads, bikes, etc. Thanks for explaining it. It's been a while for me since clicking \"I am not a robot\" resulted in a pass and not a captcha challenge, so I forgot it's actually an option. reply  twelve40 23 hours ago        | prev | next [\u2013] One thing we did for the Wells Fargo captcha for example is to pick up the audio version that's there for accessibility and parse that instead. Which makes me wonder now. These more hardcore captchas like Google's where you have to mark buses and traffic lights. How do they get around accessibility legislation? Whichever large service is relying on them can presumably get sued for a lot of money because some of them are very difficult even for a non-impaired person. reply  YPPH 23 hours ago        | parent | next [\u2013] You can use an audio alternative with ReCAPTCHA.I'm as critical of ReCAPTCHA as the next HN user, but their audio version is actually reasonable compared to the alternatives out there. It plays sensible and seemingly real audio (I'm assuming random extracts from YouTube videos), generally meaningful and audible, instead of random words with silly distortions. reply  orbisvicis 22 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] I've heard one audio recaptcha that was explicitly sexual. Which I think is ironic considering captcha is used to censor the internet. reply  thinkingemote 18 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] Doubly ironic as captcha was originally about opening up information by helping digitise scanned literature. reply  SXX 17 hours ago        | root | parent | next [\u2013] I guess you wanted to say reCAPTCHA specifically.Captchas existed for decade before it. reply  quenix 12 hours ago        | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] How does captcha censor the internet? reply  TechBro8615 22 hours ago        | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] The audio version is frequently unavailable, especially if your IP address is assigned to a datacenter or Tor exit node. reply  paulryanrogers 22 hours ago        | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Perhaps to solve for YT captions.

Alioto Veronese said his friend Don Carmignani was leaving his mother\u2019s house on Magnolia Street between Buchanan and Laguna streets in the Marina District when he was approached by three men Carmignani said were homeless and lived in the neighborhood. \u201cThey hit him with a metal pole to the head,\u201d Alioto Veronese, who did not witness the attack, said in an interview Thursday evening, citing Carmignani\u2019s account. \u201cHe is a big guy. They slashed his face with a knife and continued to hit him with a pole.\u201dCarmignani remained in surgery at San Francisco\u00a0General Hospital to repair his fractured skull Thursday evening, Alioto Veronese said. The former fire commissioner had also suffered a broken jaw and knife wounds to his face after the attack, he added.\u00a0On Friday, Carmignani's\u00a0father, Ray Carmignani, told The Chronicle that his 53-year-old son\u00a0had 51 stitches, a fractured skull and a broken jaw after he was attacked.The assault occurred a day after a prominent tech executive, Bob Lee, was fatally stabbed in\u00a0Rincon Hill, another affluent neighborhood in the city. Lee\u2019s slaying prompted widespread outrage from public officials and the tech community. FBI data shows violent crime in San Francisco is lower compared with most other large U.S. cities, but residents are increasingly expressing concerns about safety.\u00a0Representatives for the San Francisco police department did not respond Thursday to questions about the nature of the attack or whether arrests had been made, but police records said a man was allegedly struck with a metal object at that location Wednesday. The alleged aggravated assault occurred around 5:20\u00a0p.m. and left one victim with \u201cnon-life-threatening injuries,\u201d police records showed. Police announced Friday that they had arrested a man for the alleged beating.Alioto Veronese, who is also a former fire commissioner, said he believes the assault may have been \u201cretribution\u201d for a phone call Carmignani made to police Tuesday requesting that officers remove three men loitering in front of his mother\u2019s house.\u00a0Supervisor Catherine\u00a0Stefani, who represents the Marina, also believes the call to police may have prompted the attack. In remarks at a public hearing Thursday, Stefani said the victim\u2019s mother had called him to her house for help because \u201cthere were homeless people outside that wouldn\u2019t leave, had their garbage, were doing drugs.\u201dStefani, who called the victim a friend, linked the incident to San Francisco\u2019s police officer shortage.\u00a0Understaffing at police precincts across the city has been a perennial problem, with the department spending millions on overtime to fill openings as the city has struggled to hire and train enough officers.\u00a0\u201cI hope we haven\u2019t got to the level in this city where that\u2019s acceptable and we can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d\u00a0Stefani said.Stefani tried to dispel any notion that she was fear mongering because \u201cthis is what\u2019s really happening,\u201d she told her colleagues on the Board of Supervisors\u2019 government audit and oversight committee, which voted to advance a new contract with the city police union.\u201cI\u2019ve been here 21 years. This didn\u2019t use to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it is a direct result of the fact that we do not have enough officers on our street.\u201d\u00a0 Alioto Veronese said the incident had shaken him, especially given his friend\u2019s large stature.\u00a0\u201cWhen it\u2019s not safe in the Marina, it\u2019s not safe anywhere. Nobody is safe in this city,\u201d he said.Reach Nora\u00a0Mishanec: nora.mishanec@sfchronicle.com.\u00a0Reach Michael\u00a0Cabanatuan: mcabanatuan@sfchronicle.com; Twitter: @ctuanReach\u00a0J.D.

Others argue that social services and community outreach programs alone cannot solve the city's crime problem. Lastly, users discuss the state of gun laws in California and Vermont as it pertains to concealed carry without a permit.Comments on the post suggest that there is a lack of action being taken to effectively solve issues, with many pointing out the failure of services to provide solutions. The desensitization of people in problem areas and a lack of public safety are also highlighted as causes of issues. Some suggest that talking about the issues is a necessary starting point for change. A lack of political will and excessive political dogma are identified as obstacles to effective solutions. There is also speculation that government funds could be indirectly aiding criminal activity.Comments on a post about the problems in San Francisco discuss the Second Amendment, gun control, and the limitations of local government in the face of unconstitutional laws. One user suggests an experiment in prosecutorial discretion for self-defense cases, while another sarcastically mentions a potential backlash against the unhoused plumber community.
