The background job landscape Making decisions Build with escape hatches Choosing Postgres queue tech Introduction Postgres queue tech is a thing of beauty, but far from mainstream. Its relative obscurity is partially attributable to the cargo cult of “scale”. The scalability cult has decreed that there are several queue technologies with greater “scalability” than Postgres, and for that reason alone, Postgres isn’t suitably scalable for anyone’s queueing needs. The cult of scalability would rather we build applications that scale beyond our wildest dreams than ones that solve real problems beyond our wildest dreams. Postgres’ operational simplicity be dammed; scale first, operate later. Yet some intrepid technologists, such as those at webapp.io have risked excommunication – their product relies on Postgres queues for core functionality. Companies like webapp.io are an exception to the norm, recognizing that sometimes other principles outweigh “scalability”. When the cult of scalability fractures, the fractures are often small, but they congeal around new principles like operational simplicity, maintainability, understandability, and familiarity. Sometimes they congeal around new ideas like reusing old tech in novel ways, or using Postgres for queues. You, too, should dare risking excommunication from the cult of scalability. What is Postgres queue tech? Postgres queue tech consists of two parts: announcing and listening for new jobs (pub/sub) and mutual exclusion (row locks). Both are provided out-of-the-box since Postgres 9.5, released in 2016. By combining NOTIFY and LISTEN, Postgres makes adding pub/sub to any application trivial. In addition to pub/sub, Postgres also provides one-job-per-worker semantics with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED. Queries with this suffix acquire row locks on matching records, and ignore any records for which locks are already held. Applied to job records, this feature enables simple queue processing queries, e.g. SELECT * FROM jobs ORDER BY created_at FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1. Combined, these two features form the basis for resource-efficient queue processing. Importantly SKIP LOCKED provides an “inconsistent” view of one’s data. That inconsistency is exactly what is needed from a queue; jobs already being processed (i.e. row-locked) are invisible to other workers, offering distributed mutual exclusion. These locks pave the way for both periodic batch processing, and real-time job processing by NOTIFYing LISTENers of new jobs. Despite these Postgres features having many users, there are relatively few public advocates for combining them as a queue backend. For example, this Hacker News comment stated that using Postgres this way is “hacky” and the commenter received no pushback. I found the comment to be load of BS and straw man arguments. This thinking seems to be “the prevailing wisdom” of the industry – if you want to talk about queue technology in public, it better not be a relational database. This industry of cargo cults has little appetite for pushing back on whatever wisdom is “prevailing”. I hope to disimbue anyone of the notion that Postgres is an inferior queue technology. We’ll use “background jobs” as the pretext for this discussion since adding background job processing to applications is a common decision made by developers, which can have far-reaching implications for system maintenance burden. We can think of “background jobs” as any sort of potentially long-running task such as “generate a report and email it to a customer”, or “process an image and convert it to several other formats”. These sorts of use cases generally necessitate queues. The background job landscape Like all technology decisions, choosing how to process long-running tasks is a choice with many tradeoffs. In the past decade, the tech industry has seemingly come to a consensus that there are a few good tools for queuing long-running tasks for processing: Redis is a wonderful in-memory data store and “message broker”^ that is the backend for many popular background job libraries Apache Kafka A distributed “event streaming platform” maintained by the Apache Foundation RabbitMQ Allegedly the most widely deployed “message broker”^ Amazon SQS An Amazon SaaS product for highly scalable queues My apologies if I’ve excluded your favorite(s); this is not meant to be exhaustive. ^ “Message broker” simply means that a queue system does other fancy stuff on top of being a queue, but for our discussion, let’s consider message brokers queues. There are multiple words and phrases that I consider effectively synonymous with “queue” and “queue processing”: “message broker(ing)”, “stream processing”, “streaming data”, etc. I’m aware that these mean specific things that are not exactly “queue” or “queue processing”. I think it’s important to pause here and discuss Redis’ significance in the world of “background jobs”. If you browse the background jobs GitHub topic, the top five most popular libraries are all backed by Redis: Sidekiq (ruby) resque (ruby) rq (python) Hangfire (C#) asynq (go) There’s a reason for this; because Redis stores data in memory, both its insertion and retrieval speed are phenomenal. It also has a pub-sub API built in, and with native list and set data structure which, when combined, make for a fantastic queue. Redis scales. For many developers, that scalability has made it the default choice, and defaults are profoundly powerful. But before choosing Redis because it scales well, consider this quote from Ben Johnson’s I’m All-In on Server-Side SQLite. It’s specifically talking about database scalability, but the statement holds for scaling all sorts of infrastructure, like queues: When we think about new database architectures, we’re hypnotized by scaling limits. If it can’t handle petabytes, or at least terabytes, it’s not in the conversation. But most applications will never see a terabyte of data, even if they’re successful. We’re using jackhammers to drive finish nails. As an industry, we’ve become absolutely obsessed with “scale”. Seemingly at the expense of all else, like simplicity, ease of maintenance, and reducing developer cognitive load. We all want to believe that we’re building the next thing that will demand Google, Facebook, or Uber scale, but the fact is, we’re almost always – not. Our technology decisions should reflect that fact. We’re more likely building for relatively small scale, and should be optimizing our decisions around a completely different set of factors that have more to do with team composition than technological superiority. When we’re starting projects and businesses, we should be optimizing for everything but scale at the outset. Of course, we don’t want to back ourselves into a corner with technology decisions, but we also don’t want to build Kubernetes clusters to serve marketing sites for products that are likely to fail for every reason but the fact that they don’t scale well. We should be thinking about what technologies we know well, what is good enough, and what is the least toilsome solution that meets user needs and our team’s skill sets. Be proud of choosing “good enough” over “the best”; sometimes “the best” is simply a more difficult path to inevitable failure. List in your head every product that failed because it couldn’t scale. There’s a much longer list of products that failed long before they needed to. What hasn’t been said yet, is that Postgres actually does scale well. But Postgres is general-purpose software, and it’s not going to be “the best” at scaling for queue use cases. It’s going to perform pretty well for that use case, just like it performs pretty well doing everything that it does. Making decisions If you’re here and feel like you’ve seen enough of what I have to say, feel free to abandon this page and scroll through Dan McKinley’s choose boring technology slide deck. I’m confident that whether you finish this post or Dan’s slide deck, you’ll make similar decisions when it comes to your next queue technology choice. After all, Dan’s “Choose Boring Technology” talk was the inspiration for this post’s title. The most important question to ask when making technology decisions is: what technologies am I currently using and understand well? The answer to this question informs the “cost” of choosing technologies for your software stack. Technologies already in use are, presumably, cheap. Assuming they’re well understood. There’s a good chance that you’re already using a relational database, and if that relational database is Postgres, you should consider it for queues before any other software. If you’re not using Postgres, you should consider whatever is the most boring technology to you, before considering anything else. When costs are low, choose any. Source: https://boringtechnology.club Technologies not (yet) in use are more expensive. When costs are high, choose few. Source: https://boringtechnology.club In other words, boring technology is relative to what is already in use. Applications that are oriented around message-passing, like notification systems, might consider RabbitMQ boring technology. Caching applications might consider Redis boring technology. Applications with a large amount of relational data might consider Postgres boring technology. The maximally boring choice is likely the right one for you and your team. If you’re not already using Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS, adopting any one of them only for background jobs is expensive. You’re adding a new system dependency to every development, test, and production environment, likely for the rest of the application’s life. A new set of skills is now required of every future Developer, DBA, and/or SRE role on the team. Now they need to know these new systems’ intricate failure modes and configuration knobs. Job candidates must be convinced that learning this new technology is a worthwhile time investment. DBAs/SREs need to know how to recover from operational failure, diagnose problems, and monitor performance. There’s a lot to know; and there’s a lot that nobody on the team realizes they need to know. These systems’ unknown unknowns are a risk. Especially if these systems are a default choice for you, and you haven’t put a lot of though into why they’re your default choice. This is not all to say that the most boring technology is a panacea – Postgres included. What one gives up for familiarity, known failure modes, and amortized “cost” might be paid for in performance, or some other vital principle. After all, pushing and popping from a Postgres queue is considerably slower than Redis. Using Postgres for queues may mean that instead of having a single relational database on a single server, applications now require an “application” database and a “queue” database. It may even mean an entirely separate database server for background jobs, so background jobs are independently scalable. It may mean databases need to be VACUUMed more frequently, incurring a performance hit in the process. There are many implications that one should consider before adopting Postgres for queues, and they should be weighed against team and application needs so that an informed decision can be made. Postgres shouldn’t be a default choice. Similarly, neither should Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, or any other distributed queue. Choosing boring technology should be one’s default choice. Technology choices are tradeoffs all the way down. I found that Dagster had a pragmatic approach to adopting Postgres for their queues. When in doubt, consider the following an axiom: If and only if boring technology is provably unable to meet demands should alternatives be considered. Build with escape hatches Earlier I mentioned “not getting backed into a corner”. With respect to background jobs, that means application code for processing jobs should be queue-agnostic. One day’s cutting edge tech is another day’s boring tech. As applications grow and success is achieved, new technologies tend to get bolted on to applications out of necessity. It’s common to add memcached or Redis as caching layers (but do consider Postgres unlogged tables first!). That means these technologies become “boring” over time, reducing their cost, and changing the calculus for using them as queues. Building with escape hatches is all about abstraction. Earlier I listed the top five most popular background job libraries on GitHub. Except for Hangfire, none of those libraries provide an escape hatch to queue technologies other than Redis. That means switching queues requires rewriting application code because there’s no robust abstraction in front of the underlying queue. It shouldn’t be that way. Queue tech should be abstracted away, so users can choose the right queue for the job. I’m not a Hangfire (or C#) user, but Hangfire appears to have gotten the abstraction right. It was with the preceding philosophy of choosing boring tech and building with escape hatches that I built Neoq https://github.com/acaloiaro/neoq. Neoq queues can be in-memory, Postgres, or Redis (contributions for your favored boring tech welcome!). Users can switch between queues without changing any application code – simply initialize it with a different queue backend. Neoq is more abstraction than it is concrete implementation. While both the in-memory and Postgres implementations are first-party, the Redis implementation is asynq. It’s more about providing escape hatches than locking developers into a specific underlying queue technology. I’d love to see more neoq-like libraries for languages other than Go. I think the lack of software libraries with escape hatches is what backs a lot of developers into a corner, forcing them to begin simple projects with a Redis dependency, long before Redis is warranted. Redis is fantastic, but it’s not always the right queue, or right amount of complexity for the job. The same goes for Kafka, RabbitMQ, and SQS. Choosing Postgres queue tech I hope this post encourages others to risk excommunication from the cult of scale the next time they’re choosing queue technology. There are so many important principles that are not “scale” to consider when choosing technologies. Make boring technology your default choice, and choose Postgres if it bores you. Cheers!

If I want to copy FAANG or another startup, and set up an infinitely scalable queue-based architecture, I can find dozens of high quality guides, tutorials, white papers etc, showing me exactly how to do it. Yes maintenance is higher, but I can get set up with redis, SQS, any of the &#x27;scalable&#x27; solutions within a few hours of copy-pasting commands and code and configuration from a reputable source.If I want to use NOTIFY in postgres? I googled \"SQLALchemy notify listen postgres\" and I find a few unanswered stackoverflow questions and a github gist that has some code but no context.I would honestly love to use this approach for a side project, but I don&#x27;t have 2-3 days to figure it out on my own. The direct choice for me might seem to be* simple, but not scalable (ie just use postgres)* complex, but scalable (ie redis, sqs, whatever)and then it&#x27;s a tradeoff, and the argument goes that I am blinded by cool tech and FAANG and I&#x27;m choosing complex but scalable, even though I don&#x27;t need scalable.But taking into account guides and other resources, the choice for me is actually* complex and not scalable (this, because I don&#x27;t know how to implement it and I can&#x27;t predict what pitfalls I might face if I try)* simple and scalable (what everyone actually does)and that makes the engineer&#x27;s choice to follow faang look a lot more reasonable. reply ranting-moth 0 minutes agoparent> Yes maintenance is higherThis is what kills you if you&#x27;re a small startup. Of course it gives you a lot too. But if you&#x27;re belly up then it doesn&#x27;t matter.Of course go for whatever solution gives you the most that still doesn&#x27;t distract you too much from your main goal.I&#x27;ve seen a startup where devs spent around 80% of the time fighting their tools and infrastructure. I still shudder form just the thought of it. reply zozbot234 48 minutes agoparentprev> If I want to use NOTIFY in postgres?The nice thing about \"boring\" tech like Postgres is that it has great documentation. So just peruse https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;sql-notify.html . No need for google-fu. reply ritzaco 11 minutes agorootparentPython, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Postgres all have great documentation individually, but if I am building an application at the intersection often a guide on exactly how to join them all up is much faster than using each individually and trying to figure out the interactions in four places.AWS white papers and engineering blogs tend to give me everything I need in one place, and I don&#x27;t think there are any for apps built with NOTIFY. reply natmaka 1 hour agoparentprevAnother point is: you don&#x27;t need scalable now, but may (or even hope) to need it later, and you know that when you will need it you probably won&#x27;t have time to invest into migrating this component.Also: you may think that you may one day want to be hired by a FAANG. reply tmpX7dMeXU 2 minutes agorootparentYeah.

I have some experience with \"web scale\" systems, but I tend to reject FAANG recruiters because Leetcode makes me want to become an apple farmer (no pun). reply vineyardmike 31 minutes agorootparent> How relevant is it to be hired by a FAANG?If you want a job there, very relevant.> I tend to reject FAANG recruiters because LeetcodeI understand the pain of leetcode interviews. They’re terrible. But optimizing your career based on the interview process seems… backwards?FAANG companies (for example) are very relevant if you want to make a lot of money and live in Silicon Valley without being a successful founder&#x2F;VC. Apple farmers… not so much. If you live in Tokyo, then FAANG companies might be less relevant.Either way, doesn’t seem like the interview is where you should draw the line. reply polyrand 4 minutes agoprevSome time ago, I wrote a queue using SQLite[0]. Instead of SKIP LOCKED, you can use RETURNING to lock-and-read a message and ensure only one worker is going to pick it up: UPDATE ... SET status = &#x27;locked&#x27; ... RETURNING message_idOr you can just use an IMMEDIATE transaction, SELECT the next message ID to retrieve, and UPDATE the row.On top of that, if you want to be extra safe, you can do: UPDATE Queue SET status = &#x27;locked&#x27; WHERE status = &#x27;ready&#x27; AND message_id = &#x27;....&#x27;To make sure you that the message you are trying to retrieve hasn&#x27;t been locked already by another worker.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;litements&#x2F;litequeue&#x2F;[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;litements&#x2F;litequeue&#x2F;blob&#x2F;3fece7aa9e9a31e4... reply aduffy 13 hours agoprevFor several projects I’ve opted for the even dumber approach, that works out of the box with every ORM&#x2F;Query DSL framework in every language: using a normal table with SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKEDhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgcasts.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;the-skip-locked-feature-in-...It’s not “web scale” but it easily extends to several thousand background jobs in my experience reply matsemann 13 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve done even simpler without locks (as no transaction logic), where I select a row, and then try to update a field about it being taken. If 1 row is affected, it&#x27;s mine. If 0, someone else did it before me and I select a new row.I&#x27;ve used this for tasks at big organizations without issue. No need for any special deployments or new infra. Just spin up a few worker threads in your app. Perhaps a thread to reset abandoned tasks. But in three years this never actually happened, as everything was contained in try&#x2F;catch that would add it back to the queue, and our java app was damn stable. reply refibrillator 9 hours agorootparentPSA: This is a read-modify-write pattern, thus it is not safe under concurrency unless a transaction isolation level of SERIALIZABLE is specified, or some locking mechanism is used (select for update etc). reply deredede 3 hours agorootparentThe part about checking the number of affected rows hints at using `UPDATE ... WHERE ...` which should act as an atomic CAS regardless of isolation level.Edit: To clarify, I mean `SELECT id WHERE used = 0` followed by `UPDATE ... SET used = 1 WHERE id = ... AND used = 0` reply RichieAHB 3 hours agorootparentThis works fine as long as you’re happy to do the same task multiple times. I.e. the task is idempotent and cheap. reply kdps 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t get it :(. Why could the same task be executed more than once? From my understanding, if the UPDATE is atomic, only one worker will be able to set `used = 1`. If the update statement is not successful (affected != 1), then the worker should drop the task and do another select. reply klauserc 1 hour agorootparentWith a transaction isolation level below SERIALIZABLE you can have two transactions that both read the old row (with `used = 0`) at the time they perform the update (but before they commit the transaction). In that case, both transactions will have performed an update (rows affected = 1).Why would both transactions see `used = 0`? The DB server tries to isolate transactions and actively hides effects of other transactions that have not committed yet. reply matsemann 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is spot on! We let the db provide the atomics. reply mjb 7 hours agorootparentprevThis should be safe under SI (other than the ABA issue, which isn&#x27;t even fixed with serializable). The update forces a W-W conflict, which is sufficient to make the behavior serializable under SI (and therefore, I think but am not sure, PG&#x27;s RR level too). reply valzam 9 hours agorootparentprevThe reason why you want to use skip locked is so that Postgres can automatically skip rows that are being concurrently accessed for updating the \"status\". You are right, if you update a \"status\" field you don&#x27;t really need to worry about advisory locks and skipping rows that are locked but it still helps with performance if you have a decent amount of concurrent consumers polling the table. reply andrelaszlo 13 hours agorootparentprevI guess you update it with the assigned worker id, where the \"taken by\" field is currently null? Does it mean that workers have persistent identities, something like an index? How do you deal with workers being replaced, scaled down, etc?Just curious. We maintained a custom background processing system for years but recently replaced it with off the shelf stuff, so I&#x27;m really interested in how others are doing similar stuff. reply matsemann 13 hours agorootparentNo, just update set taken=1. If it was a change to the row, you updated it. If it wasn&#x27;t, someone updated before you.Our tasks were quick enough so that all fetched tasks would always be able to be completed before a scale down &#x2F; new deploy etc, but we stopped fetching new ones when the signal came so it just finished what it had. I updated above, we did have logic to monitor if a task got taken but never got a finished status, but I can&#x27;t remember it ever actually reporting on anything. reply fbdab103 13 hours agorootparentI would set the taken field to a timestamp. Then you could have a cleanup job that looks for any lingering jobs aged past a reasonable timeout and null out the field. reply magicalhippo 1 hour agorootparentWe have a \"status flag\" column which is either Available, Locked or Processed (A, L and P), an Updated column with a timestamp of when it was last updated, and a Version counter.When grabbing a new message it selects \"Available or (Locked with Updated timestamp older than configured timeout)\". If successful it immediately tries to set the Locked status, Updated timestamp and bumps the Version counter, where the previous values of Status and Version has to match. If the update fails it retries getting a new message.If the Version counter is too high, it moves the message to the associated dead-letter table, and retries getting a new message.This isn&#x27;t for high performance. I tested it and got 1000 messages&#x2F;sec throughput with handful of producers and consumers against test db instance (limited hardware), which would be plenty for us.I wrote it to be simple and so we could easily move to something AMPQ&#x27;ish like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus when needed. Overall quite easy to implement and has served us well so far. reply Izkata 6 hours agorootparentprevWe do it with two columns, one is an integer identifying which process took the job and the second is the timestamp for when it was taken. reply tylergetsay 13 hours agorootparentprevit wont work with a timestamp because each write will have an affected row of 1 beacuse the writes happen at different times. setting a boolean is static reply jayd16 12 hours agorootparentYou can do something like UPDATE row SET timeout = NOW() WHERE NOW() - taskTimeout > row.timestamp. You&#x27;re not stuck with comparing bools. reply twic 12 hours agorootparentprevupdate tasks set taken_timestamp = now() where task_id = ? and taken_timestamp is null reply AdamJacobMuller 10 hours agorootparentprevupdate row set taken=true,taken_by=my_id,taken_at=now() where taken is false; reply SahAssar 12 hours agorootparentprevThat is the sort of thing that bites you hard when it bites. It might run perfectly for years but that one period of flappy downtime at a third party or slightly misconfigured DNS will bite you hard. reply matsemann 12 hours agorootparentBut compared to our rabbit setup where I work now, it was dead stable. No losing tasks or extra engineering effort on maintaining yet another piece of tech. Our rabbit cluster acting up has led to multiple disasters lately. reply SahAssar 11 hours agorootparentAgreed, I&#x27;ve had my own rabbit nightmares. But setting up a more robust queue on postgresql is easy, so you can easily gain a lot more guarantees without more complexity. reply fsniper 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can combine this \"update\" with a \"where taken = 0\" to directly skip taken rows. reply calrain 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve done this successfully with a web service front that retrieves jobs to send to workers for processing, by using a SQL table queue. That web service ran without a hitch for a long time, serving about 10 to 50 job consumers for fast and highly concurrent queues.My approach was:- Accept the inbound call- Generate a 20 character random string (used as a signature)- Execute a sql query that selects the oldest job without a signature and write the signature, return the primary key of the job that was updated.- If it errors for any reason, loop back and attempt again, but only 10 times, as some underlying issue exists (10 collisions is statistically improbable for my use case)- Read the primary key returned by that sql query and read it, comparing it&#x27;s signature to my random one.- If a hit, return the job to the caller- If a miss, loop back and start again, incrementing attempts by 1.The caller has to handle the possibility that a call to this web service won&#x27;t return anything, either due to no jobs existing, or the collision&#x2F;error threshold being reached.In either case, the caller backs for it&#x27;s configured time, then calls again.Callers are usually in &#x27;while true&#x27; loops, only existing if they get an external signal to close or an uncontrolled crash.If you take this approach, you will have a function or a web service that converts the SQL table into a job queue service. When you do that, you can build metrics on the amount of collisions you get while trying to pull and assign jobs to workers.I had inbuilt processes that would sweep through jobs that were assigned (had a job signature) and weren&#x27;t marked as complete, it actioned those to handle the condition of a crashed worker.There are many many other services the proper job queues offer, but that usually means more dependencies, and code libraries &#x2F; containers, so just build in the functionality you need.If it is accurate, fast enough, and stable, you&#x27;ve got the best solution for you.&#x2F;edited for formatting reply samus 11 hours agorootparentprevI recently got introduced to this system at work, and also built a new job using it. It works fine, but since I had to implement work stealing to deal with abandoned jobs in a timely manner, I wouldn&#x27;t dare to use it for actions that absolutely must not happen twice. reply A1kmm 1 hour agorootparentExactly-once is only meaningfully possible if you have a rollback for tasks of unknown completion state - for example if the task involves manipulating the same database as the one controlling the task execution. Otherwise, it becomes the (impossible to solve) two-generals problem between updating the task status and performing the task. reply mbb70 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve done the same with MongoDB with findOneAndModify, simple and solid reply dminor 7 hours agorootparentAgenda uses this, and we found the hard way on mongo 4 that it can lead to mongo spinning the CPU at 100% if it gets too many at once.

The PG transaction will be rolled back. The row and sendEmail will be retried. reply Karrot_Kream 4 hours agoparentprevIn my experience, a queue system is the worst thing to find out isn&#x27;t scaling properly because once you find out your queue system can&#x27;t architecturally scale, there&#x27;s no easy fix to avoid data loss. You talk about \"several thousand background jobs\" but generally, queues are measured in terms of Little&#x27;s Law [1] for which you need to be talking about rates; according to Little&#x27;s Law namely average task enqueue rate per second and average task duration per second. Raw numbers don&#x27;t mean that much.In the beginning you can do a naive UPDATE ... SET, which locks way too much. While you can make your locking more efficient, doing UPDATE with SELECT subqueries for dequeues and SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, eventually your dequeue queries will throttle each other&#x27;s locks and your queue will grind to a halt. You can try to disable enqueues at that point to give your DB more breathing room but you&#x27;ll have data loss on lost enqueues and it&#x27;ll mostly be your dequeues locking each other out.You can try very quickly to shard out your task tables to avoid locking and that may work but it&#x27;s brittle to roll out across multiple workers and can result in data loss.

I&#x27;d be happy for others to chime in with their experiences&#x2F;opinions, too. reply mianos 6 hours agorootparentThe software works excellently in a development environment and performs well when running as a single instance. However, I encountered issues when scaling it up for high availability in a clustered setup. The system would fail inconsistently, with two masters consuming messages simultaneously, which wasn&#x27;t ideal for my use case. Eventually, I switched to Kafka and haven&#x27;t revisited the original solution since.It&#x27;s worth noting that these issues might have been due to my improper configuration. Nevertheless, if the configuration process is fraught with pitfalls, that&#x27;s problematic in itself. I&#x27;ve had these experiences more than once.Additionally, I found a critical race condition in the Python library, rendering it practically unusable for me. I submitted a bug report with a minimal example demonstrating the issue. I considered fixing it myself, but since using RabbitMQ wasn&#x27;t crucial for my project, I switched to ZeroMQ, which didn&#x27;t require a broker. The issue was acknowledged and fixed about a year later. At the time, I had to assume that nobody else was using the Python bindings.Three years ago, I worked on a project that used the software for a Celery queue. Messages would occasionally go missing, although this could have been a configuration issue on our part. Ultimately, we replaced it with a Redis queue (not the best practice, I admit) and didn&#x27;t look back. This was for a lower-availability use case where a single instance of Redis sufficed. reply boyter 4 hours agorootparentprevI used RabbitMQ for a while and nothing but problems.Admittedly I probably shouldn&#x27;t have used it the way I did. I dumped many millions of tasks into it, then fanned out processes pulling from that queue that took a variable amount of time to run. Some ran in seconds, some hours.I had picked RabbitMQ because I wanted that queue to be durable and resist workers dying, or being restarted. However long lived tasks like this is not really what it was designed for (in my opinion). I kept running into issues where it would take a long time to restart, and stop answering connections and need a restart to continue. I ended up having to write monitoring code to check for this and handle it to have it be slightly reliable.Im sure it works well for smaller short lived messages, but considering the issues I bumped into I would be hesitant to try it. Id probably reach to redis first with wrappers allowing me to swap out to any other queue as required first. reply phamilton 5 hours agorootparentprevI can share our experience with RabbitMQ&#x2F;SQS&#x2F;Sidekiq. Our two major issues have been around the retry mechanism and resource bottlenecks.The key retry problem is \"What happens when a worker crashes?\".RabbitMQ solves this problem by tying \"unacknowledged messages\" to a tcp connection. If the connection dies, the in-flight messages are made available to other connections. This is a decent approach, but we hit a lot of issues with bugs in our code that would fail to acknowledge a message and the message would get stuck until that handler cycled. They&#x27;ve improved this over the past year or so with consumer timeouts, but we&#x27;ve already moved on.The second problem we hit with RabbitMQ was that it uses one-erlang-process-per-queue and we found that big bursts of traffic could saturate a single CPU. There are ways to use sharded queues or re-architect to use dynamically created queues but the complexity led us towards SQS.Sidekiq solves \"What happens when a worker crashes?\" by just not solving it. In the free version, those jobs are just lost. In Sidekiq Pro there are features that provide some guarantees that the jobs will not be lost, but no guarantees about when they will be processed (nor where they will be processed). Simply put, some worker sometime will see the orphaned job and decide to give it another shot. It&#x27;s not super common, but it is worse in containerized environments where memory limits can trigger the OOM killer and cause a worker to die immediately.The other issue with Sidekiq has been a general lack of hard constraints around resources. A single event thread in redis means that when things go sideways it breaks everything. We&#x27;ve had errant jobs enqueued with 100MB of json and seen it jam things up badly when Sidekiq tries to parse that with a lua script (on the event thread). While it&#x27;s obvious that 100MB is too big to shove into a queue, mistakes happen and tools that limit the blast radius add a lot of value.We&#x27;ve been leaning heavily on SQS the past few years and it is indeed Simple. It blocks us from doing even marginally dumb things (max message size of 256gb). The visibility timeout approach for handling crashing workers is easy to reason about. DLQ tooling has finally improved so you can redrive through standard aws tools. There are some gaps we struggle with (e.g. firing callbacks when a set of messages are fully processed) but sometimes simple tools force you to simplify things on your end and that ends up being a good thing. reply chucke 1 hour agorootparentSQS limits you further in other ways. For instance, scheduled tasks are capped to 15m (delaySconds knob), so you&#x27;ll be stuck when implementing the \"cancel account if not verified in 7 days\" workflow. You&#x27;ll either reenqueue a message every 15m until its ready (and eat your the SQS costs), or build a bespoke solution only for scheduled tasks using some other store (the database usually) and another polling loop (at a fraction of the quality of any other OSS tool). This is a problem well solved by sidekiq, despite the other drawbacks you mention.Bottom line, there is no silver bullet. reply pqdbr 4 hours agorootparentprev> Sidekiq solves \"What happens when a worker crashes?\" by just not solving it.

With a Postgres queue, if you insert the job to send the email and then in a later part of the transaction, something fails and the transaction rollbacks, the email is never queued to be sent. reply theptip 11 hours agoparentWorth being clear that bridging to another non-idempotent system necessarily requires you to pick at-least-once or at-most-once semantics. So for emails, if you fail awaiting confirmation of your email you still need to pick between failing your transaction and potentially duplicating the email, or continuing and potentially dropping it.The big advantage is for code paths which async modify your DB; these can be done fully transactionally with exactly-once semantics since the Job consumption and DB update are in the same transaction. reply skybrian 10 hours agorootparentEmail might never arrive, though.

I often end up using a combination of Postgres and SQS since SQS makes it easy to autoscale the job processing cluster.In Postgres I have a transaction log table that includes columns for triggered events and the pg_current_xact_id() for the transaction. (You can also use the built in xmin of the row but then you have to worry about transaction wrap around.) Inserting into this row triggers a NOTIFY.A background process runs in a loop. Selects all rows in the transaction table with a transaction id between the last run&#x27;s xmin and the current pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot()). Maps those events to jobs and submits them to SQS. Records the xmin. LISTEN&#x27;s to await the next NOTIFY. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agoparentprevI agree - having to tell a database that something was processed, and fire off a message into RabbitMQ, say, is never 100% transactional.

It&#x27;s just an append-only log, and a client is essentially just holding an offset. This is conceptually very simple to reason about. It&#x27;s also persistent and pretty fault-tolerant (you can just go back and read any offset).Unfortunately, Kafka carries with it enough complexity (due to the distributed nature) that it ends up not being worth it for most use-cases.Personally I&#x27;d love something similar that&#x27;s easier to operate. You&#x27;d probably be able to handle hundreds (if not thousands) of events per second on a single node, and without distributed complexity it&#x27;d be really nice.And yes, in theory you could still use postgres for this (and just never delete rows). And maybe that&#x27;s the answer. reply chalcolithic 11 minutes agoparentI used to hope that FasterLog would eventually be mature enough reply valzam 9 hours agoparentprevConsidering that you have a native \"offset\" (auto incrementing id) and the ability to partition by date I would say postgres is a great candidate for a simple Kafka replacement.

If you observe the values 1, 2, and 4, you can&#x27;t actually conclude whether 3 exists or not. That transaction may have failed after incrementing the serial, meaning 3 does not exist, or it may be an ongoing transaction which hasn&#x27;t yet committed, meaning 3 exists but is not yet visible to you.So if you update your offset to 4 before the transaction for 3 commits, you&#x27;ll lose 3 forever (unless you control for this, eg by periodically detecting & requeueing orphaned jobs, or by using a strictly serial&#x2F;gap free integer rather than the built in auto incrementing type). reply afhammad 1 hour agoprevThere are a few mentions of Oban [1] here.

It&#x27;s not going to exactly show the state of things but it&#x27;s helpful for working through a live incident (especially when most job queues just delete records as work is processed).And if you make all the background tasks idempotent anyways then you&#x27;re almost always safe with running a thing like \"send a job to the task queue to handle this job\".If you rely _just_ on message queues, there are a lot of times where you can have performance issues, yet have a lot of trouble knowing what&#x27;s going on (for example, rabbitMQ might tell you the size of your queues, but offer little-to-no inspection of the data inside them). reply vhiremath4 7 hours agorootparentUltimately you have to figure out the separation of concerns of the job state and other core state. Ranging from “all state stored in message and will never become out of sync” to “no state stored in message and will never become out of sync”. In between you have “some state stored in db and some in message” and what I’ve found to be useful is keeping stuff in the db that needs to have high end state integrity (or as you said just making sure jobs are cancellable&#x2F;idempotent).Tangible example:We have a video transcoder queue. The state of the video model in our db can change as the video is being finalized in various ways. The transcoder generates thumbnails and assets from the video and also updates its state in the db. So we store job information in the message about what thumbnails we want to generate and the video ID but nothing else. This allows us to look up the video row, see if the same media was already transcoded from the video (and cancel the job), and, if not, run the job and update the video row.Also (and I know you’re not saying this), but I’ve never understood the argument that keeping queues in Postgres leads to higher data integrity via transaction guarantees. The job is still running on another process outside of the db. The only time this could be true is if the job itself mostly updates state in the db, in which case it’s the small minority of queued workloads (with the majority needing to do non-db compute work). reply bicijay 9 hours agoparentprevTransactions, data consistency.

A partial index should make things fly here. reply figassis 3 hours agoprevThe way I implement my queues (usually as part of my monolith application) is as go routines. Each instance of the app launches with a unique id, and also a role. It can be a worker or the app itself. So when the app generates a queue item, it simply adds it to a table as pending. A worker will then, via transaction, update a set of items to add its instance id as well as an expiration for this lock. If that succeeds, no other worker will pull a queue item with a non null id or with an id different that it’s instance id that is not expired. Worker can then start processing and update item status accordingly. If it crashes, another worker will just repeat the process after the lock expires.The code that does this is maybe 100 lines at most. It’s very effective especially if you deploy your app in kubernetes where you can expect instances to be ephemeral. It’s one of the components of my apps that has never needed any updates since I first wrote it circa 2017. reply perfmode 3 hours agoparentHow are workers notified of new work?

It&#x27;s still in use today. The company processed large volumes of transactions and we were able to do things in real-time in terms of payments. Our system reached a point where I realized that we can scale almost infinitely just using a 2 tier architecture (Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix &#x2F; Oban and PostgreSQL)The industry standard for real-time was anything under 30s end-to-end. We hit many scaling limits as our platform grew. We worked on improving the system instead of looking at postgresql as a problem. We measured and measured and postgresql was never the problem when it came to scaling. Most of the problems that existed was mostly due to design decisions in the system or some technical debt that needed to be solved. When we solved those problems the system flew.There was one incident where our PostgreSQL instance CPU usage went up to 100% during peak hours and would cause problems in the system. We wondered why, there was a lot of debate around the topic, PostgreSQL doesn&#x27;t scale, we need a larger instance, or move to a dedicated queue system etc...I didn&#x27;t believe the hypothesis that PostgreSQL didn&#x27;t scale. So I conducted a performance audit on the system myself I discovered one of the engineers forgot to add an index on one of the columns on a major table with > 60m records. There was a lot of back and forth between engineers that discussed whether we should add the index. I simply conducted a small experiment and PG analyze clearly showed a missing index in one of the key tables. After we added a single line of code and deployed the index, during peak hours DB CPU usage would not even exceed 20% we had to scale down our DB to save some $$.PostgreSQL backed queue system does work.I&#x27;ve been building distributed systems in large and small scales for over a decade. Before building systems with Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix I also used to work with Rails where the default is as mentioned in this article is you just adopt Redis. While Redis does have additional overhead when it comes to management of the infrastructure, it also worked well.Having been through both I&#x27;d say a simple PostgreSQL backed solution is the clear winner when it came to not having to manage a 3rd dependency when you already have a complex system. There was no 3rd or 4th piece of the puzzle to theorize hypothesize or experiment with. You just had 2 pieces it is either your application or your database that&#x27;s the problem. That simplicity saved us a lot of time for debate and doing experiments also squashed any dogmatic values and opinions that just didn&#x27;t hold any water. reply SanderNL 5 hours agoparentInteresting how the immediate reaction is “postgres does not scale” when there is a single table lacking an index.This also tells how important competence and knowledge of the system is.

And then you need to worry about fsync, and backup. And of course you need to be careful to flush to the queue after each write to avoid partial writes.Basically I’m saying that there are just a number of potential footguns when using files as queues - I speak from experience! - which are trivially taken care of by a database, especially if you have one already.I’m not saying that it’s not possible, just that for non trivial applications, it’s certainly more complex than just an atomic file move. reply repiret 11 hours agoparentprevThat’s a key property leveraged in the Maildir mailbox format. reply andrewstuart 10 hours agorootparentIt was learning about this that led to me understanding file systems make perfectly acceptable queues. reply codeadict 8 hours agoprevThis is exactly what the Oban https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getoban.pro&#x2F; Elixir library uses and combining postgres plus actors for queues scales pretty great for 90% of the needs out there.

A bonus reason, and why I originally wanted this was the ability to use transactions fully - i.e. I can start one, do some stuff, add a job in to the queue (to send an email), .....and either commit, or roll back - avoiding sending the email. If you use resque, I found sometimes either you can&#x27;t see the record (still doing other stuff and it&#x27;s not committed), or it&#x27;s not there (rollback) - so either way you had to deal with it.QC (and equivs) use the same db, and same connection, so same transaction. Saves quite a bit of cruft. reply winternewt 2 hours agoprevThe official JDBC driver for PostgreSQL provides no way for the database to push events to the client. So you need a dedicated connection to continuously poll the database to see if there are any events available.

How do the workers know when they have to process a new job?Also, am I right in assuming this is typically a single node setup only, as all the files are mounted on a non \"share-able\" XFS disk? reply donatj 5 hours agorootparentThey ask for work after they finish the previous job (or jobs, they can ask for more than one). Each worker is a single process built just for one task.If there&#x27;s no work for them there&#x27;s a small timeout and they ask for more. Simple loop. It&#x27;s all part of a library we built for building workers. For better or worse, it&#x27;s all done over http.You are right, though, it is one XFS volume per queue instance.We just run multiple instances (EC2) on a load balancer. Each instance of the queue gets it&#x27;s own set of workers though so the workers know the right server to report done to.We want a way to have a single pool of workers, rather than a pool per queue instance, and have them talk to the load balancer rather than directly, but we haven&#x27;t come up with a reasonable way to do that. reply latchkey 4 hours agorootparentI like how GCP cloud tasks reverses the model. Instead of workers pinging the server asking for work, have the queue ping the worker and the worker is effectively a http endpoint. So you send a message to the server, it queues it and then pings a worker with the message.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;docs&#x2F;dual-overview reply donatj 4 hours agorootparentOoh, that&#x27;s kind of interesting. Am I reading this right that it holds the HTTP connection open for up to thirty minutes waiting for the work to complete? That&#x27;s kind of wild. reply latchkey 4 hours agorootparentIndeed. If you&#x27;re hitting AppEngine or GCP Functions, they auto scale workers up for you to manage long running tasks. Ideally though, you finish as quickly as possible by breaking the work down into more tasks. That way, you can parallelize as much as possible.It is all configurable, but I&#x27;ve scaled up to hundreds of workers at a time to blast through tasks and it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all.Workers being an HTTP endpoint makes them super easy to implement and even better... write tests for. reply lysecret 4 hours agorootparentprevI love Task Queues. We are using them extensively. Also, they give you deduplication for free and a lot of other nice features like delayed tasks storing tasks for up to 30 days extremely detailed rate limits etc. reply latchkey 4 hours agorootparentGCP is really under rated in this regard.Are there any open source implementations of Task Queues? It feels like something that has been missing for years. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentprevJust like using JMS, MSMQ or similar queues, I fail to see what is so great about it. reply ahoka 3 hours agorootparentprevBut this way you can lose messages, but I guess it’s fine for your use case. Having to provide redundancy is when things get usually complicated. reply lijok 2 hours agoparentprevBuilt very similar but on S3. Jobs have statuses, land in &#x2F;jobs, indexed by status at &#x2F;indexes-jobs&#x2F;PENDING, etc. Scheduler polls for jobs in PENDING index, acquire lock, pass job to processor, change its status to COMPLETE or DEAD.300~ LOC or so and fairly easy to test. Wouldn&#x27;t take that approach every time, but definitely worth it when you&#x27;re aiming for a simple architecture. reply hknmtt 2 hours agoparentprevWhy files though, and why move them into different directories?

They are built for one technology stack, be it Python&#x2F;NodeJS&#x2F;etc. This is fine if you&#x27;ve only got one stack, but in a microservices world it doesn&#x27;t work where jobs can span multiple systems. You might be able to find some abandoned library that supports that queue tech on the other platforms you need, but now you&#x27;ve basically become a queue tech maintainer. reply mrkeen 3 hours agoparent> My main issue with pretty much all queue approaches is that they don&#x27;t work across platforms.What technology stack are you working in which doesn&#x27;t support postgres?> but in a microservices world it doesn&#x27;t work where jobs can span multiple systemsThe point of the queue system is to be able to span said microservices.

My travels eventually took me to Great Island Commons in New Castle, NH where Whaleback Lighthouse is prominently featured 0.8 miles offshore. I was hoping to capture big waves crashing around the lighthouse, and Mother Nature didn’t disappoint. Great Island Common is a wide open park where people come to picnic during the summer and to watch the ocean during the winter. After arriving, I set up my tripod and my Canon 5D Mark IV with Sigma 150-600mm lens on a tripod and positioned myself just to the right of a tree in order to help reduce the pummeling Northerly winds. As many of you know, it’s a challenge keeping 600mm stable in high winds, even on a tripod. I set the camera up and then waited until I saw a wave starting to hit the lighthouse. I then kept firing until the splash ended, not knowing ahead of time the action of the wave. Most shots never panned out, but about three of them over the course of about 45 minutes were pretty decent. Once back at home, I culled through the images and choose one to edit and upload to Instagram, replacing an earlier upload that was done in haste while still in the parking lot. When a local TV station shared the photo to their Facebook page (with permission) it started to receive a large amount of shares, comments, and likes; however, there was one comment that mentioned that I had stolen the image from another New England photographer, Eric Gendon. After letting the commenter know that it was indeed my image and that I possess the original RAW file, I headed over to the other photographers page and was blown away. We had what looked like the exact same image, taken at the exact millisecond in time, from what looked like the same exact location and perspective. Aside from choices made in Lightroom, the photos at first glance look virtually identical aside from water in front and some of the white caps being in different position. Even then, the white caps were identical in size and shape—and I know those things are easily moved using the clone stamp in Photoshop—so I was concerned that maybe MY image was stolen and altered a bit. Initially, I only had access to his shared, low-resolution, image so I wasn’t able to make out some of the very fine details that ultimately helped to convince me that we both had originals. After overlaying and aligning the images in Photoshop I was blown away that the lighthouse and waves were carbon copies, almost to the pixel. As mentioned already, there were many differences in the foreground water and the white caps on the horizon, and it was these differences that held me back from claiming he stole my image. It wasn’t until another local photographer started comparing my photo to a higher resolution version of Eric’s image that he noticed that the iron gating around the top of the lighthouse had slightly different spacing between the vertical bars compared to my image. This would indicate that the other photographer was likely standing just a little bit left of where I was standing. Since the 60D uses an APS-C sensor he would have also likely been back a little further to compensate for the 1.6x “zoom” / crop of the sensor or using a shorter focal length to compensate. This would also explain the white caps being in different positions. However, the fact that the lighthouse doesn’t really show any rotational changes—and the crashing wave is an exact match—makes this all the more remarkable that these were captured randomly from two different photographers. The next morning, Eric woke up to a flood of messages from me as well as other photographers, and immediately contacted me to share his EXIF data, and to agree that it was astounding that we both captured the exact same image of water motion at the exact millisecond in time. What makes this even more amazing is that this wasn’t a planned event (aka. sporting event, shuttle launch, etc.). I also didn’t know Eric—we each chose this location randomly, and we both shot with different cameras (60D and 5D Mark IV) with different size sensors. The 60D has a burst mode of 5.3fps, the 5DMKIV is 7fps; we both used a 600mm focal length; our exposures and depth-of-field were almost the same as well (F8 aperture, ISO 400, 1/1600th shutter vs. F8, ISO 320, 1/1000th shutter); and, ultimately, we both selected the same photo from that day to promote. Come to find out we were only 28 meters away from each other. He was hunkered down under a picnic enclosure to help block some of the wind and I was up against a tree to help reduce the wind. I did a Google search to see how often this happens and could only find one article from 2011 where two photographers filming a surf competition on Huntington Beach ended up catching a virtually identical image of a surfer and its wave action. If you shoot water in burst mode you know how different each exposure is even when the difference in time is just 1/7th of a second between shots. And I have been leading night-sky photography workshops for five years and have had well over 200 photographers who are often aiming at the same subject, shooting with similar cameras and lenses, and capturing at the same moment in time, even doing continuous shooting for time lapse, and until now I have never seen two images that were so close as to be virtual clones of each other. While this is a rare occurrence, I believe that with cameras getting faster and photographers taking more time to prepare for their shots, I have to imagine that these situations will happen more frequently. It happens every day with stationary or slow motion objects (buildings, sun/moon rise) but almost never with water movement. One commenter on my FB post mentioned how this mistake brings to light the importance that post-processing plays in making your images your own. Here we had two essentially identical images—one edited to preserve a more natural feel, while the other image was edited to enhance the drama and emotion of the scene.

The woman who lived in the house I parked in front of asked if it was a class assignment, because several people had apparently stopped that afternoon to do the same. I thought that more beautiful than the photo itself. reply dehrmann 12 hours agorootparentIt also tells us sometimes we fail to see the beauty around us. reply thenewwazoo 12 hours agorootparentOr maybe it says that we all see the beauty around us, but we don&#x27;t notice everyone else seeing it, too. (More than one person stopped, but only two people knew that.) reply throw310822 11 hours agorootparentWhy only two? In fact, several of those who stopped to take the picture were also informed by a neighbour (each time a different one) that others had taken the same picture before. reply cutemonster 8 hours agorootparentAt least if the woman in the house was good at forgetting and asked everyone if it was a class assignment? :-) reply j33zusjuice 7 hours agorootparentprevIn fact?

Ibsaw both of them, and they are exacly the same. Both only discovered that after having run into each other again the same day on a different spot. They had quite a few outings together since then.Fun fact, over a year later my dad and I had almost the same experience at the same spot shooting geese in flight. Judging by the angle, we were maybe just shy of a half a second or so appart. Maybe we should look at EXIF data to be sure!Seems this stuff happens more often then people think. reply akira2501 2 hours agorootparentprevI would assume the _reason_ the picture is being taken is the primary driver of that bias, and in this case, they&#x27;re both professional photographers with similarly nice equipment and public portfolios that are involved in creating income for them.Plus, the picture obscures it, but you can see the waves coming for a good distance. You&#x27;d expect two drummers to be on beat without much difficulty. reply bane 6 hours agorootparentprevI remember being struck by this when Microsoft Research first started releasing their photosynth technology, some of the demos showed raw flickr dumps for certain large cities, and there were massive clusters of photos around the most famous tourist bits. In fact, the technology somewhat relied on this overlap. reply sneak 6 hours agoparentprevI think rather than \"a similar metric for beauty\" that the art of taking photos for retouching and posting on the internet for strangers is such a generally stale and predictable form.I&#x27;m a visual artist and I&#x27;m so over the standard \"internet photographer\" look. Who takes pictures of lighthouses? It&#x27;s so boring.It&#x27;s always people in the same demographic doing it, too. Give me some variety. Formulaic art is uninspiring. reply Arainach 5 hours agorootparentClaiming that only unique or original things are good is toxic to growth and the development of culture.Saying \"who takes pictures of lighthouses\" is like saying \"who writes their own [editor&#x2F;operating system&#x2F;firewall&#x2F;whatever], there are already dozens of great ones\".People get better by doing, and if they never did anything that had already been done they&#x27;d never be any good at all.Besides, Lighthouses are cool and pictures of them are pleasant. reply demondemidi 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s like Fry said: “ Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.”You’re right, but no one likes to be told their taste is banal.

So the precise timing of the flash needn&#x27;t coincide with the moment captured on film.A focal-plane shutter actually consists of two \"curtains\", front and rear, which expose the film in a slot at high speeds. Below a sufficiently slow speed, the shutter is fully open for a period of time, which is what is necessary for flash photography.Shooting either unsyncronised (shutter opens or closes before flash fires), or at too high a speed where the entire frame isn&#x27;t exposed at once results in a partially-exposed shot (example in the first image in the Wikipedia article below).That was usually 1&#x2F;60th of a second, or slower, and some interesting effects can be had when shooting with a flash, or multiple flashes, on a scene that&#x27;s otherwise lit. It&#x27;s also possible to sync the flash to the beginning or end of a long(er) exposure, which has the effect of either capturing the beginning or ending of a movement sequence. Rear-curtain sync is popular and shows the subject moving toward its final position which is fully illuminated by the flash.The two cameras in the Japanese photo (the one capturing the flash of the other, which you show, and the image taken by the camera with the visible flash) likely occurred within 1&#x2F;60th of a second of one another, but might differ in exposure start&#x2F;end by as much as twice that interval, or 1&#x2F;30th of a second. What we can be reasonably certain of is that when the flash fired, both shutters were open, but that&#x27;s a relatively long period, photographically, at 16.7 1&#x2F;1000ths of a second.Some modern phones, and possibly smartphone cameras, may have a faster effective flash synch, particularly if they use an electronic shutter. reply prmoustache 3 hours agoparentprevWould you be so kind to share the context of that picture? reply dredmorbius 2 hours agorootparentPost-game celebration in Japan: The two \"simultaneous\" images are the one linked, and presumably the one taken by the woman whose camera flash is seen fully illuminated in the first picture, though as I&#x27;ve described, there might actually be a considerable difference the moments exposed due to flash sync speeds. reply dogman1050 13 hours agoprevThis is great! When I look at each picture with one eye simultaneously, I see the image in 3d. reply stefandesu 4 hours agoparentHow do I do this? I tried but I don&#x27;t have individual control of my eyes, so I&#x27;m not sure what to do. reply mxmlnkn 13 minutes agorootparentI also can&#x27;t control my eyes directly, but I can implicitly control them somewhat by deciding what to look at.For parallel viewing, try focusing your eyes on some object in the distance while still focusing your brain, not your eyes, on the image in front of you. It can take some hours of trying if it is your first time.I find cross-eyed viewing much easier. For cross-eyed viewing, try to focus your eyes on your nose, and then slowly try to focus your brain on the image in front of you, just like when trying look at something in the corner of your eye without side-eying. At the start, this might mean that you see two versions of the image far apart from each other. While focusing your brain on those images, try slowly focusing your eyes a bit more in front of your nose until the images perfectly overlap. reply jdthedisciple 25 minutes agoparentprevSeriously, how do you do that?I seem to be unable to see in 3D. reply interestica 6 hours agoparentprevPro tip: this is also how you can quickly solve those \"whats different between these images\" puzzles. reply Agentlien 5 hours agorootparentI wonder how widespread this understanding is.I figured it out a few years ago, but haven&#x27;t heard anyone else mention it. It&#x27;s a really cool hack. reply tobr 58 minutes agorootparentI’ve used this technique since I was a kid, and have always been fascinated with how my eyes perceive both a 3d image and simultaneously two separate images overlaid.It’s something I think about many times per day - I mean, I’m looking at stuff all day, and this is such a fundamental aspect of the experience of looking at something. But my impression is that most people are only barely aware of how this works? reply hef19898 2 hours agorootparentprevI sometimes do, but usually it is more fun doing it the trafitional way with the kids! reply stouset 13 hours agoparentprevSame!

If you swap the positions of the two pictures it will look correct. reply lloeki 3 hours agorootparentAlternatively you can look at them by relaxing the eyes to infinity (parallel lines), which I find much less painful than going cross-eye. reply tetris11 13 hours agorootparentprevI could hold of for a few seconds, but my eyes kept rejecting the image. It&#x27;s like they somehow knew that they were more than the usual spacing apart (if that matters, for stereoscopic images?) reply smeej 11 hours agorootparentTry moving closer to or farther from the screen.My eyes did this too up close, but could focus once I backed up. reply jdthedisciple 24 minutes agorootparentHow far back? reply behringer 4 hours agorootparentprevnope it doesn&#x27;t matter. It is known to cause motion sickness in VR, but as for viewing photos, any amount of separation works as long as the subject and details have a relatively narrow angle opposing each other all the way from the bottom to the top. The very close waves for example are probably simply too far apart compared to the waves in the background, but everything else is great in this set of photos. reply jpc0 12 hours agorootparentprevi just want to say thanks for pointing this out.New found possible love, stereoscopic photography.

The visual content of a photo is generally not what is used to determine the moment in time when it was captured. There&#x27;s metadata in the image format that specifies when the photo was taken.There are pictures taken at almost the same moment in time all the time around the world, and there are many pictures taken of the same place, what&#x27;s special about the situation here is that both of those things happened, and the subject isn&#x27;t hyper famous, and it isn&#x27;t a static object, so the chances of it happening were very low. reply ipython 10 hours agorootparentThe distributed part is the clocks on the cameras across the world. The article discusses the timestamp is included in the exif data embedded in the jpeg file.The clocks are most likely synchronized based on gps assuming they’re already pulling location data from the satellites, the time is “free”. However, the precision of the clocks is not specified and like any process is subject to error. So at the small timeframes here (sub millisecond), you are potentially within the margin of error. When the error bars of several measurements from distributed parts of your system overlap, how do you determine an ordering between them? reply ezconnect 8 hours agorootparentWhoever arrives first?

But usually no one cares about sensor data, people care about \"deliverables\", like JPEGs or printed versions, and they will not be the same because everything after sensor capture would be different for each photographer. reply tantalor 8 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"scene\"?

It is possible to genetically engineer Streptococcus mutans, the dominant human mouth bacteria, to produce ethanol instead of cavity-causing lactic acid. Further modifications cause it to outcompete native mouth bacteria, without spreading outside of the mouth. All research suggests that a one-time brushing of this GMO strain onto the teeth will dramatically reduce, or entirely eliminate, dental caries. A variant of this organism was first created in 1985, and volunteers deliberately inoculated themselves with the modified strain. This has, to our knowledge, caused no ill effects since.

Stable states further trend towards states where fast mutation becomes disabled because it&#x27;s in a \"good\" stable zone.Symbiosis is the ultimate stable state.You can get stable states in intermediate zones like hiv infections, but these zones are not as good as symbiosis. They have potential to kill off a weak population, additionally humans are actively combatting the virus. In symbiosis there&#x27;s no negative for either side.There is no evolutionary pressure to \"mutate\" in symbiosis. Mutations will occur in the beginning. Those will die off fast and eventually the strain will become more and more stable as the gene starts mutating towards a configuration that has slow mutations. reply lolinder 15 hours agorootparentAs I understand it you left off the key reason why symbiosis is a stable state for a parasite&#x2F;symbiote: because other states tend to destroy the host, causing the mutated strain to (usually) have a harder time propagating.

Much of our medical treatments were unappealing at one point in time. Colonoscopy? Sticking a camera up your ass to prevent cancer. Surgery? Cutting you open to fix something. None of it appealing but all of it necessary and worth it in the end.Also keep in mind we live in times where much of the food we eat is bioengineered to live in symbiosis with us. The difference is instead of directly manipulating the gene, we indirectly manipulate it through artificial offspring selection. All domesticated animals and plants have been manipulated this way at a macro level for eons. The difference here is that the manipulation is happening on the molecular level rather then the macro level.Your aversion to it is just instinctive and habitual but it&#x27;s no different to much of the things we already do. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparent> A parasite can make a host less healthy and less likely to reproduce.

You are only moving the low pH stomach acid around your mouth and exposing more teeth to the acidic environment. Instead you should try to neutralize the acid (baking powder or similar).On one hand, I could believe you are just spreading the damage around. On the other, it feels hard to believe that some residual ~2 pH stomach acid would remain when massively diluted by a mouthful of ~7 pH tap water. reply rcoveson 11 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t sound like a conflict to me. People actively resist allowing vomit to touch most of their mouth. We tend to do the opposite with soda. So swishing with water after vomiting puts vomit where it otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have been, while swishing with water after drinking soda only dilutes the places that soda already was.The brushing thing has to do with the effect acid has on enamel.I doubt you could find a dentist that wouldn&#x27;t recommend swishing with water after drinking soda. reply fbdab103 11 hours agorootparentPerhaps I am an explosive vomit-er, but mid-act, I have little concern to what area of my mouth is being exposed.

This is a really bizarre leap because the floss is made of PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), which has fluorine, but is unrelated to PFAs even if you squint, despite both being fluropolymers.PTFE is safe unless heated to over 300C, which doesn’t happen in your mouth. At one point in history the manufacturing process used PFOA, which is not an awesome chemical, but has not been used since 2013.However it carries a reputational stigma from that time to this day.

They&#x27;re already well versed in selling people intangibles packaged with inert ingredients. They&#x27;ve got a long history of \"science to order\" (9 out of 10 dentists agree!). They&#x27;ve got a large body of known sadists to call on for the less civil dispute resolution processes they might choose to employ.I salute the folks behind this effort. Even if its all fairy dust you&#x27;ve put your lives on the line. reply acyou 11 hours agoprevAdding live organisms to complex living systems tends to have unpredictable and destabilizing consequences. Invasive species being introduced to ecosystems can have knock-on effects that go far beyond their immediate biome. The human body is a complex living system, and the consequences of perturbing that system are difficult to predict.There are probably also lots of \"good\" bacteria in the mouth and gut using salivary lactate. I could not begin to guess at the number of additional metabolic pathways happening that are related to this. Not to mention the mutacin production that they mention, that they think may also kill off some of the bacteria in the mouth, that hopefully isn&#x27;t replaced with nasty S. aureus, C. difficile, Candida.The gut flora angle is just a whole other rabbit hole.In light of the potential benefits, the \"reasons not to\" might fall by the wayside, hopefully none of the cautions end up being a big deal. But the status quo doesn&#x27;t suck that much, if you look at how bad it could be.Personally, I would like to see more resources go to diagnosis, study and understanding, rather than seeing people try to jump straight to the silver bullet and test on volunteers. Is it moral because they are \"volunteers\"? Are they really volunteers given that they would most likely get paid?More importantly - and I cannot emphasize this enough: If this was such a great and simple solution, evolution would have already given this mechanism to us to and other animals. There is (or was at some point) a very, very good reason that our bodies don&#x27;t already do this. reply bkm 15 hours agoprevAlternatively, a non-intrusive supplement with DIM has recently been found effective against the Streptococcus Mutans bacteria.3,3′-Diindolylmethane (DIM) decreased the Streptococcus mutans biofilm, a leading contributor to plaque and cavities, by 90%.Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scitechdaily.com&#x2F;90-reduction-scientists-discover-na... reply lusus_naturae 16 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s easy enough to test this without investor money, you just need a simple kit and some dentures (not literally, I meant teeth essentially).

Or do what the government does in bioweapon simulations and just start spraying cities with it to see how easily it spreads. reply nemo44x 16 hours agoparentprevWhat’s a fair price? Spending well over $20k on dental work over a lifetime is easy for many people. Adjust for inflation and it’s a steal. Cavities often lead to eventual root canals which require a crown which one day will probably require an extraction and a dental post and prosthetic tooth. That is probably around $8k or more for a single tooth at todays rates. reply imjonse 16 hours agorootparentIf this is such a revolutionary technology and it is cheap to mass produce, it should be like water fluoridation and similar state funded measures that increase overall population health. I am not arguing that $20k is more than regular dental work&#x27;s cost over a lifetime, in the US at least, but that it&#x27;s because dental work is so expensive is why oral health is so bad worldwide,Lifestyle, sugar consumtion and the like notwithstanding. reply nemo44x 7 hours agorootparentMaybe it ought to be that way.

They’ll get a handful of customers, if that.$2k is more likely as a price point for mass adoption. reply zugi 15 hours agorootparent$20k is likely the price for early adopters, while production rates are low. Within a year or three the price would likely fall to some stable long-term rate. $2k indeed sounds about right. reply nemo44x 15 hours agorootparentprevHealthcare (including dental) costs have outpaced inflation though. The price of all those procedures is likely to increase more than inflation.Similar to how it would be a bargain to have paid for a college education today 20 years ago. reply guraf 16 hours agorootparentprevThe average American probably spends about 20k in their lifetime, that&#x27;s probably where they got their pricing from. They get a check-up a year and a handful of fillings with some prosthetics if they live long enough. Which totals to around 20k.The average American also cannot afford 20k in one shot they can&#x27;t even afford 2k. reply LegitShady 16 hours agorootparentprevthats not the way this works. Paying $20k over a lifetime vs an up front $20k payment means the up front $20k payment also includes the opportunity cost of the interest made - your up front payment of $20k is much more valuable than $20k over 60 or 70 years. That same $20k might be a large part of a downpayment on a mortgage and you&#x27;d get back many more times the value than if you spent it on your teeth all at once. reply nemo44x 15 hours agorootparentRight but the price of dental work goes up in price over time too. And healthcare has dramatically outpaced inflation. reply LegitShady 15 hours agorootparentSure, but you&#x27;re literally throwing an opportunity to own property which historically is the best possible return to get preventive work done on your teeth. And not all healthcare is the same, so I&#x27;m not even sure dental costs are rising at the same rate as \"healthcare\". replyMagicMoonlight 16 hours agoprevIf the bacteria is in the public domain, is there a way we could just order some and try it out ourselves?

Just like a street with a name might also be part (or the entirety) of a numbered route, and we&#x27;d want the map to show both. reply lucideer 54 minutes agorootparentThat seems correct in theory but it is inconsistent between islands - I suspect it&#x27;s to do with adminstrative levels differing between different nations.e.g. With the first example - Isle of Man - you won&#x27;t see the same happen with either Great Britain or Ireland, nor with smaller adjacent islands. The labels font-sizes & zoom behaviour are also very different between Northern Ireland and Ireland - the UK having countries within a country and adding an extra admin level in the hierarchy.

It seems like it isn&#x27;t available in OsmAnd though, sadly. reply bscphil 7 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s odd given that OsmAnd is the most feature complete OSM app for Android that there are so few custom map styles for it. I know the weird format it uses is a contributing factor (I think everyone else uses Mapnik compatible styles). But I find all the included themes really hideous and haven&#x27;t found a good alternative. There are really good raster styles for outdoor use, so if anyone has advice on adapting an existing theme for OsmAnd I&#x27;d be curious to hear about that. reply matkoniecz 12 hours agoparentprevAs far as I know there is no significant overlap between this two: except that both use OpenStreetMap data as source. reply lom 1 hour agoparentprevOsmAnd already has a way of showing elevation in the same manner reply thriftwy 12 hours agoparentprevOSM is basically a dataset. Everybody renders this dataset differently unless they are sharing a renderer. Android apps such as Maps.ME and OsmAnd do their own vector renders. reply sva_ 11 hours agorootparentI think it might be possible via the Online Maps feature by adding an online source, but for that I&#x27;d need the url of the source. For example, I can pick CyclOSM as the map tile source both in OsmAnd and on openstreetmap.org. reply thriftwy 11 hours agorootparentThat would defeat the purpose of having a vector map app. reply lucb1e 10 hours agorootparent...and add all the benefits of having online slippy maps, yes, nice way of telling the full storyI enable this when I want to zoom to a random place in the world without first downloading a 600MB map file, want satellite imagery, or indeed want to view different styles. I wish there was better integration, like being able to also search worldwide with online services when this view is enabled (but it&#x27;s also not like I got time to implement that myself so I can understand nobody else has gotten around to yet, either). replyBroussebar 3 hours agoprevIt looks beautiful especially the way altitude is displayed, on large scale the colors look great and when zooming in you get detailed shadows. reply shrx 12 hours agoprevFor some reason, the Tracestrack Topo layer doesn&#x27;t load for me in firefox. reply rstarast 11 hours agoparentSame here, I get 403s from tile.tracestrack.comEdit: I think it&#x27;s due to referrer filtering. I can load the tiles fine if I pass &#x27;Referer: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x27;, but Firefox sends &#x27;Referer: tile.tracestrack.com&#x27;. Presumably that&#x27;s a measure to preserve privacy, possibly due to some extension (though I&#x27;ve disabled various adblock, tracking protection things...) reply lucb1e 10 hours agorootparentWhat do you use to suppress the referer header?For my job, I needed to know whether to dissuade a customer from using the referrer for CSRF protection. I looked for stats on how many people filter this but could find nothing at all. You&#x27;re the first person I hear runs this in practice, so maybe I can find usage stats on the software you use.

But like another one commented, I also have the same referrer. I also saw that I somewhat locked down 3rd-party cookies and the tile request doesn&#x27;t have any cookies. This might be another reason (I haven&#x27;t checked if there should be a cookie there though) reply gerdesj 10 hours agorootparentI use Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin in the browser and pfBlocker-ng at the router - that is similar to PiHole.You mention \"I also have the same referrer\" - I&#x27;m not too sure what that means.It sounds like you might want to go easy on the funky stuff.

It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s a \"social media site\" that there cannot be an HTML+CSS representation.Anyway I don&#x27;t think disabling javascript wholesale is workable these days, so complaining about that is not very constructive (i.e. I sort of agree with you). Especially for open source products, those people should feel free to contribute or sponsor a non-JS version rather than complaining to volunteers to do a ton of extra work for what I suspect is literally no more than a few dozen people on the globe (particularly with noncommercial software like mastodon which isn&#x27;t going to be annoying when JS is turned on).I should start complaining that sites don&#x27;t look nice with CSS disabled :P (Sometimes I turn css off using an extension to avoid the rules that make the text thin+gray on a grayish background.) reply progval 4 hours agorootparent [–] > those people should feel free to contribute or sponsor a non-JS versionIt will be rejected.

That should be read as praise of the AI models, not a slight against the photographer.Those models are going to squeeze “real” photographers into an ever smaller niche, which is ironic given that the original photography is the ground-truth training material that enabled the models in the first place, and the generosity of this particular photographer is probably furthering this vicious cycle. reply great_psy 16 hours agoparentMy take as a hobby photographer (3 years).I started doing photography as a means of staying sane during COVID lockdowns. It has been a great way to get me outside and moving (mostly in nature) when there was not much else to do.Having said all that, I think the real value in photography is the doing itself. Yes, the profit generated by each photograph will go down to zero, but I think the real value for people will come from the experience of going out and making a photo.My most memorable photograph is waking up at sunset in the middle of the mountains only to see the sun shine on a giant piece of rock. The photos I took are good, but you can just google it and you will see thousands of them.The photos I took are just a reminder of me running out of the tent to stare at the beauty of nature. AI will never give me that.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Inside the row of workshops in an industrial stretch of Pacoima, men labored over hefty slabs of speckled stone, saws whining over the sounds of Spanish-language rock. Pale dust rose around them as they worked. Many went without masks. Some had water spurting from their machines, but others had nothing to tamp down the powder rising in the air. \"Nobody uses water,\" one man in a Dodgers cap said in Spanish when Maria Cabrera approached, holding flyers about silicosis, an incurable and suffocating disease that has devastated dozens of workers across the state and killed men who have barely reached middle age. Cabrera, a community outreach worker with the nonprofit Pacoima Beautiful, urged him and others at the Branford Street site to try to protect themselves. Silicosis can ravage the lungs of workers after they inhale tiny particles of crystalline silica while they cut and grind stone that contains the mineral. The disease dates back centuries, but researchers say the booming popularity of countertops made of engineered stone, which has much higher concentrations of silica than many kinds of natural stone, has driven a new epidemic of an accelerated form of the suffocating illness. As the dangerous dust builds up and scars the lungs, the disease can leave workers short of breath, weakened and ultimately suffering from lung failure. \"You can get a transplant,\" Cabrera told the man in Spanish, \"but it won't last.\" In California, it has begun to debilitate young workers, largely Latino immigrants who cut and polish slabs of engineered stone. Instead of cropping up in people in their 60s or 70s after decades of exposure, it is now afflicting men in their 20s, 30s or 40s, said Dr. Jane Fazio, a pulmonary critical care physician who became alarmed by cases she saw at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. Some California patients have died in their 30s. \"They're young guys who essentially have a terminal diagnosis,\" Fazio said. Read more: Shape Your L.A. — at the county level In Pacoima, a 27-year-old father said he now has to hustle home from the park with his 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son because his oxygen tank starts to run out as they play. Leobardo Segura Meza said he could no longer run around on the soccer field or exercise the way he used to. Nor is he able to work. For a decade, he made a living by cutting, polishing and installing countertops in and around Los Angeles County. Dust was everywhere, he said, and he was given only a dust mask — one he said was inadequate for the job — to protect himself. Sometimes he brought a hose and tried to attach it to the machine to reduce dust, but there were no machines dispensing water as they were cutting, he said. He began to suffer a cough that wouldn't go away and lost his breath when going up stairs, he said. His weight dropped. At one point, he was hospitalized when one of his lungs collapsed. Segura Meza had never heard of silicosis before he was diagnosed. \"There's no cure for this illness. The only thing they can do is a lung transplant,\" he said in Spanish. What he fears, he said, is that as more workers grow ill, \"there aren't enough lungs for us.\" At a state hearing this summer, Segura Meza said two of his co-workers had already died waiting for transplants. To warn workers about the threat, Cabrera and another Pacoima Beautiful outreach worker, Claudia Vasquez, made their rounds at the parking lot of the Home Depot in San Fernando, where laborers in long-sleeve shirts waited for people to drive up and offer them work. Few had heard of the disease. \"It's very dangerous, this illness?\" asked one man in Spanish, leaning against a palm tree in the parking lot. Cabrera told him there was no cure. She urged him to use wet saws to limit any dangerous dust rising in the air and NIOSH-approved respirators to avoid breathing it in. Workplace safety regulators have recommended a suite of measures including water spraying systems, ventilation and vacuum systems to clear dust, in addition to protective respirators for workers — ones covering the entire face if silica levels in the air are high. The risk is serious for workers in the industry: Although estimates of its prevalence vary from study to study, some screenings in Australia have found roughly 1 in 5 stone workers had the disease. In California, workplace safety regulators have estimated that out of roughly 4,000 workers in the industry across the state, silicosis will afflict between 485 and 848 — and that as many as 161 could ultimately die. A recent study by UCLA and UCSF physicians found that among dozens of California workers who got silicosis from grinding countertops, nearly a fifth had died. Their median age at death was 46. More than half had suffered delays in getting diagnosed, as the disease was mistaken for bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis, and over a third already had severe scarring in their lungs when they were diagnosed. Los Angeles County has been an epicenter of the debilitating disease, with 60 out of the 83 cases among countertop workers identified across the state since 2019 by the California Department of Public Health. The San Fernando Valley is a hub for the stone \"fabrication\" industry — those who cut and polish the slabs made by manufacturers — and county officials also said that growing awareness spurred by Fazio and others may have resulted in better reporting of such cases in L.A. In July, the state sent out an advisory to healthcare providers about the threat, recommending that physicians ask if ailing patients have worked as countertop cutters and urging them to report any identified cases of silicosis to the state. California workplace safety regulators are now drafting emergency rules to try to protect workers as engineered stone has come to dominate the countertop industry. The material is also sometimes called artificial or synthetic stone, made with crushed quartz bound together with resin. L.A. County is exploring whether to go further and ban the sale and installation of \"silica engineered stone\" entirely. Existing safety standards must be followed, but \"we feel that there need to be additional changes to the standards to make it even more safe in the workplace,\" said Dr. Nichole Quick, deputy director of health protection with the L.A. County public health department. The county department is now preparing a report requested by county supervisors on options for a potential ban, as well as other possible steps. It has also partnered with Pacoima Beautiful to provide outreach. \"This is a preventable disease,\" Quick said, \"and we want to take appropriate action to make these workplaces safer.\" One question before the county — and government regulators across the globe — is whether any safeguards will effectively protect workers grinding materials so high in silica. The Agglomerated Stone Manufacturers Assn., an international group representing manufacturers of engineered stone, maintains its products can be cut \"with no safety issues or health hazards if it is performed according to the best practices.\" In a statement, the association said the risk lies not with engineered stone itself, but poor adherence to safety measures by fabricators, arguing that safety regulations need to be \"simplified and rigorously enforced.\" Members of the Stone Coalition, which represents fabricators as well as manufacturers, said an L.A. County ban would have \"severe economic consequences\" and argued for additional enforcement and training on workplace safety, especially efforts to eliminate \"dry cutting.\" And the Los Angeles County Business Federation contended that enforcing safety regulations \"will do more to prevent disease, while not adversely [affecting] the cost of construction at a time when Los Angeles is seeing a devastating housing crisis.\" But Raphael Metzger, a Long Beach attorney who represents Segura Meza and other workers suing manufacturers of engineered stone such as Cambria and Caesarstone for damages, argued that typical respirators and other standard measures don't go far enough. Even with many \"wet methods,\" workers can be exposed to dangerous levels of silica and need additional protection, NIOSH research has found. Read more: Tens of thousands of Kaiser healthcare workers approve possible strike Nearly half of the workers suffering silicosis in the UCLA and UCSF study said their workplaces were using water to control dust. Roughly a quarter said they always had respiratory protection. Fazio said studies have found that in many shops, dust is so thick in the air that respirators cannot filter out a sufficient amount. Metzger argued that the kind of sophisticated and costly measures that would be needed to reliably protect workers cutting engineered stone are not economically plausible in an industry where immigrant workers typically labor in small shops and are often paid in cash. Engineered stone \"is too dangerous to be used safely,\" he said. \"If there’s any industrial product that should be banned, this is the product.\" Segura Meza agreed, calling it \"very deadly.\" Vasquez, with Pacoima Beautiful, said that when she and Cabrera started talking to workers about engineered stone and silicosis, many of them asked, \"How come they don't do anything with the stores that sell the products?\" In Australia, where the government is weighing whether to ban engineered stone, a professional group whose members assess worker health hazards concluded that the high concentration of silica in engineered stone makes it difficult for measures such as wet cutting and ventilation to adequately protect workers. Additional measures for respiratory protection are needed, but such systems \"have largely been absent from this sector,\" the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists wrote. In light of those concerns, it recommended prohibiting engineered stone containing more than 10% crystalline silica, but said it would also support banning all engineered stone because of the rigorous compliance needed even at a 10% level. In California, existing rules to protect workers have often not been followed, state regulators found. Cal/OSHA, which is now hustling to draft emergency standards to protect California workers in the stone cutting and polishing industry, found rampant violations of the current standards when it looked closer in 2019 and 2020. Despite the rise of the deadly disease, homeowners and other consumers shopping for countertops know little about the threat it could pose to the workers behind the surfaces in their kitchens and bathrooms, Fazio said. Engineered stone is now estimated to represent more than 60% of materials used for countertops, the L.A. County business federation said, and market researchers say its popularity is only expected to rise. Engineered stone “is everywhere and people have no idea,\" Fazio said. Consumers \"have a right to know that the countertop that might be the cheapest one ... may really be costing folks' lives.\" Sign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

They do a quick demo of the equipments they used back in the day, in a pre cut hole. Even with your hands on your hears it&#x27;s painful, teeth chattering - and they don&#x27;t even really hit the rock.People working in there weren&#x27;t wearing any sort of hearing protection and became deaf within months. And after introducing pressured air driven equipment, they were all dying in a few years from silicosis. Until someone added water spraying to precipitate the dust into mud (wherein their issue became to fiddle caked in mud all day long in the dark, which I guess is an improvement over certain death). Which happened years later.Thinking about the kind of life they had terrorizes me. I don&#x27;t get how, for the longest time, people were fine with that. I mean no judgement on the workers, they probably didn&#x27;t have a choice - but the people sending them in probably saw them as kettle.Makes you think about the sort of progress in worker protection that was made since then. But also this kind of story reveals how people are still ready to profiteer from such deadly practices, if given the opportunity.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britanniaminemuseum.ca&#x2F; reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agoparentToday the leading cause of death is heart disease. In that era it was infectious disease. You could have a cushy job doing numbers work in a city and still die of tuberculosis from being in close quarters. People were fine with it because everything was terrible.In the century between the 1850s and 1950s we went from not even having radio communications or the germ theory of disease to building nuclear submarines and fiber optic data networks.Once we had penicillin and cities stopped dumping raw sewage into the water supply, people started to have better options and these kinds of businesses had to improve safety to attract workers.If you had to choose between the job you have now and the ones they had then, how much more would they have to pay you to get you to choose the latter? More than it costs for the safety equipment, right? So they started installing it.Then governments passed laws requiring it because politicians are adept at taking credit for good things that were about to happen regardless. reply staz 12 hours agorootparentPeople were definitely not fine with it but whenever they tried to do something about it the owner class sent the army and massacred themhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ludlow_Massacre reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentYeah, the operators of company towns were violent pricks who didn&#x27;t much like it that workers increasingly had better options than to die in a mine.

Otherwise you can just threaten to quit unless they meet your terms and actually do it if they don&#x27;t.Conspiracies only work if the market is concentrated enough; if there are ten thousand employers and it&#x27;s easy to start a new one then you&#x27;re not going to be able to hold together a secret illegal cartel.None of those actually work in a competitive market. reply syntheweave 11 hours agorootparentThe market can de-competitiveize itself through non-compete agreements, intellectual property laws, and other barriers to entry. The competitiveness occurs around the \"ruleset\", which shifts around according to the regulatory environment.The government tends to default to supporting strikebreaking(and still generally does in any era, including this one) because industrialists, financiers and politicians share lines of mutual support: legal ownership of intangibles like a corporation acts as an alternative to feudal fiefdoms and warlords, in that it&#x27;s less destructive and lets complex processes evolve.Corporations are very effective at putting taxable assets on the books, which allows a more complex state bureaucracy, so politicians end up wanting the support of business for government power and expenditures. Financiers want their thumb on the scale, for the winners they picked to continue winning, rather than to run off and form a competitor. And the industrialists themselves, though they are often at the forefront of the most dramatic reorganizations, tend to get stuck in equilibriums where either they&#x27;re the evil monopolist, or someone else is. Once you arrive at the equilibrium, the elite players lose their dynamism and are pressured to stay within the existing trends or lose their place.Thus when the Pinkertons or their modern counterparts come in, the officials shrug and say \"business as usual, business as usual\". The system convulses when it becomes a riot and property is destroyed because that weakens the whole premise: less capital to deploy, fewer assets to tax, failure to return on investment. And people out of a job, but if they were rioting it may have been a crummy job.

Summary:Cass Sunstein was the administer of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The OIRA is given the remit to review drafted rules (ie regulations) that various federal agencies want to enact. The OIRA is supposed to perform an external cost-benefit analysis of the proposed regulations. OIRA is suppose to turn around rulings in 90 days.While Cass Sunstein was administrator (2009 to 2012), various pieces of regulation were submitted for review, and ended up being reviewed for ~3+ years. Examples include:* Requiring rear-view cameras (submitted for review in 2011, regulation finally passed in 2014 with a 2018 deadline for compliance)* The silicosis workplace safety regulations (as mentioned - submitted in 2011, finally passed review in 2013)* Coal ash handling regulations (from the EPA) delayed from 2009 to 2014For the specific case of silicosis specifically, it doesn&#x27;t appear that the OIRA ended up blocking the regulation, though it certainly slowed it down.Some news articles:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucsusa.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;attacks-on-science&#x2F;white-ho...* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;investigates&#x2F;special-report&#x2F;usa-regu...* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregreview.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;26-verchick-silica&#x2F;It is worth noting that these delays continued after Sunstein left office, and there&#x27;s certainly evidence of OIRA significantly delaying review processes prior to Suntein&#x27;s term as administrator. reply bagels 16 hours agorootparentThank you for collecting this. A couple years to draft & study some proposed regulation doesn&#x27;t seem that heinous to me.

Legal immigrants, documented workers, citizens and refugees have access to provincial or federal health insurance which pays for care.Undocumented or illegal immigrants have neither (and also would not get WSIB which would be the payer for most silicosis cases) and actually have better coverage in California.Additionally:Ten patients (19%) were uninsured, 20 (38%) had restricted-scope Medi-Cal, 7 (13%) had Medi-Cal, 8 (15%) had private insurance, and 7 (13%) had workers’ compensation.So 34&#x2F;52 had some form of government provided or mandated insurance.As an aside while restricted-scope Medi-Cal and uninsured rates are the surrogates for undocumented immigrants in this study, those over the age of 50 (or 19-25) are also eligible for full scope Medi-Cal but were not identified in this study. Medi-Cal will also be expanding in January 2024 to cover undocumented immigrants aged 26-49.Even if we assume Canada’s silicosis incidence is lower, all of the above strongly suggests your public health system cost-savings incentive hypothesis is incorrect. reply PaulDavisThe1st 15 hours agorootparent> Note that public health system in Canada is not “free”.I&#x27;m enough of a pedant to annoy the fuck out of most anybody who knows me, but really?

I used scare quotes around free because it&#x27;s obvious that a socialized system is funded by taxes, what&#x27;s not obvious a bill is always generated during healthcare delivery in the Canadian system.You yourself seem to not understand this distinction with your comment: \"no charge at the point of service\".There is always a charge at the point of service and a bill is generated. The difference with the US is that the Canadian healthcare system, which also functions mostly privatized, uses a single payer model so the government is the only one legally permitted to pay for insured services. In other words, each province runs a large insurance company and there is a law that states that no one is allowed to charge any person or company other than the government insurance plan for anything the government has deemed reimbursable for any person covered by the plan.(So you don&#x27;t misinterpret my statements again: while government run hospitals, but not the physicians working in them, do get capitation payments they also bill for some services. What is billed vs paid through capitation varies by province. Services rendered to uninsured patients are never from capitation funds and are always charged directly to the patient).If the services rendered or you are uninsured, like the patients in the article study, it functions the same as the US and you will personally receive a bill in the mail with similarly obscene rates much higher than what the government insurance company would have paid.This distinction has everything to do with the article and GP&#x27;s point which asserts that the Canadian government will bear some cost for the care of the patients in the California study which is flatly incorrect. If there was no charge at the point of service none of this would matter. reply PaulDavisThe1st 11 hours agorootparent> There is always a charge at the point of service and a bill is generated.I was thinking more broadly than just the US or Canada.

Do tell us your impartial take. reply haldujai 14 hours agorootparentPerhaps you are unfamiliar with medical research but stating that available data is poor quality is an objective assessment. I provided a brief explanation in parentheses which you excluded for some reason.I also provided a reference that is open access but here is the relevant section for you:In Canada, there are no national data on the incidence or prevalence of silicosis. In the province of Alberta, where silicosis is a notifiable disease, health insurance data revealed 861 cases with at least one reported diagnosis of ‘silicosis’ during a period of 10 years from 2000. These results were based on raw data and not a secondary review of primary imaging and clinical information. Data from 2000 through 2009 showed that only 29 workers&#x27; compensation claims were accepted for silicosis in Alberta. Data from Quebec&#x27;s compensation system revealed 351 compensated cases of silicosis between 1988 and 1998. Of note, workers who participated in regular surveillance had milder disease at the time of compensation.The JAMA study is from 2019-2022. Data that is 20-30 years old is relatively poor quality.Changes in medicine, workplace safety rules and occupational trends makes it hard to compare to silicosis rates in Canada to the US in order to assess the claims of the comment I replied to therefore I think the relative incidence described in this review article (from 2022) is inaccurate.If you want to disregard my quality assessment, the discussion ends with the review article showing silicosis rates are 3x higher in Canada.Can you elaborate on how any of this shows I have an axe to grind or that I’m biased? reply retrac 14 hours agorootparentprevCanadian here who believes our labour safety standards are generally better than the USA (based on anecdote and experience, not data).Canadian data is poor quality. On any issue you might care to pick, the topic is better studied in the United States. I run into this all the time. For example, we make allocation decisions at a charity I volunteer at with, about what health problems unemployed LGBT people tend to have. We use data for American urban populations. The data doesn&#x27;t exist for Canada, AFAIK. It&#x27;s a smaller country! There&#x27;s simply less research and statistic-taking done!

Please stop misrepresenting things.> You&#x27;re making the claim there&#x27;s more than a negligible negative effect not me.The cost itself is a nonnegligible negative effect.> Did I say there is a sizable positive effect on overall survival? I said it&#x27;s irrelevant.You&#x27;re wrong.It&#x27;s borderline fraud, in my humble opinion, to go around suggesting that massive interventions should be evaluated based on their effects only on the people who benefit most, ignoring the negative effects on the other 98% of the population. Which is exactly what you did in your first reply to me:> What you want to do is look at stage at presentation, treatment costs by stage, and screening costs. These were done for nearly every recommended screening program.> The available evidence behind currently recommended screening programs unequivocally shows improved cancer-specific survival and earlier stage at diagnosis.This approach to evaluating an intervention is intellectually dishonest and emotionally manipulative. Any evaluation that does not take into account the other 98% of the population--through overall survival or QALY or some other metric--is giving an extremely biased picture of what the intervention is actually doing to the population as a whole. reply haldujai 9 hours agorootparentWhat are the downsides? You&#x27;re speaking nebulously about negative effects on 98% of the population without mentioning them.Several screening programs like breast have been rigorously evaluated from costs, benefits and harms. I know very well what the negative effects are, do you? You haven&#x27;t mentioned anything specific or provided estimates of harms yet you&#x27;re the one making the assertion.> You&#x27;re wrong.So if we&#x27;re all wrong, what&#x27;s the argument and where&#x27;s the evidence without resorting to no OS benefit ignoring that this is again not the point of screening.> It&#x27;s borderline fraud, in my humble opinionYour humble opinion disagrees with the entire medical community, including the study you initially cited. So we&#x27;re all fraudulently screening for what purpose? You know that physicians don&#x27;t collect billings or work fee for service in academic medicine correct?> Which is exactly what you did in your first reply to me:Did I say that was the only reason to screen and ignore the harms? I used that as an example of why overall survival is not useful as an isolated statistic.You&#x27;re the one who wanted to limit the discussion to one measure, I was pointing out the flaws. reply sershe 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a reference for this? This was a weak hunch for me before but I always assumed I was wrong based on e.g. insurance rates.

We are talking about inexpensive highly processed foods made predominantly from ingredients that are subsidized specifically because of their caloric density. I.e. corn.High caloric density is what you want if you need to be able to feed your country in war, so we subsidize these foods.No one wants to eat just plain corn though, so companies process it into other foods that are then sold cheaply because they are receiving these large subsidies.People end up consuming large quantities of these foods because they are cheap, and our brain reward centers a pre-wired to love lots of cheap easy calories.Knowing all of this, it makes perfect sense to tax the living crap out of highly processed foods that are made from subsidized ingredients.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to navigation News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Show More Sun 24 Sep 2023 02.00 EDT O n a frigid evening in January 2018, Brian Wharton was sitting at home in Hawkins, a small town in the backcountry of east Texas, when there was a knock on the door. A woman introduced herself as a lawyer working to spare the life of Robert Roberson, a death row inmate who had come within four days of execution. Wharton immediately understood the significance of this visit. He was a retired detective from the police department in Palestine, another small town about 80 miles away, and in 2002 he had been involved in a case that stuck in his memory. On 31 January that year, Wharton was called to Palestine hospital after receiving reports of a mortally ill child. Her father, Roberson, had brought his two-year-old daughter Nikki into the ER in a comatose state, the little girl lying limp in his arms and turning blue. She died the following day. Wharton led the investigation. He arrested Roberson hours after the girl died, even before an autopsy had been performed, having been advised by doctors that this was a case of “shaken baby syndrome” – the theory that the child had died from violent shaking that caused fatal brain injuries. Wharton went on to testify at Roberson’s capital trial. The jury convicted Roberson in February 2003 and sent him – now branded Prisoner 999442 – to death row. A photograph of Robert Roberson and his daughter Nikki. Robertson was convicted of her murder in 2003, though new evidence has emerged casting doubt on his conviction. Photograph: Courtesy of Gretchen Sween Wharton had been troubled by key aspects of the case from the start. Why had the doctors and nurses seized on shaken baby syndrome as the cause of Nikki’s injuries almost immediately, and why with such certainty? Why had a nurse told him she had found indicators of sexual assault on Nikki’s body when he could see no such evidence? Why, when he escorted Roberson back to his house on the day of Nikki’s collapse, could he find no signs of a violent altercation? Why were there no marks or indentations on the walls, no holes in the sheetrock, nothing – and no blood anywhere except a few drops on a washcloth Roberson gave him? Above all, why had Roberson himself acted so strangely? As a police officer, Wharton had dealt with both perpetrators and victims of violent crimes, but Roberson’s behavior fitted the pattern of neither criminal nor victim. He came across as flat, emotionless, matter-of-fact, as though nothing was registering with him. All these things bugged the former detective to the point that he felt haunted by them. So when the doorbell rang, and Roberson’s lawyer stood before him, Wharton knew exactly what to do. “Come in,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for you.” O n Tuesday, the US supreme court will convene in Washington for what is known as a “long conference”, preceding the start of its 2023-24 term. The justices will meet in private to sift through the backlog of cases that have amassed over the summer, tossing out those they are disinclined to consider. The lawyer Gretchen Sween will be waiting on tenterhooks for news of which petitions the court has discarded. Among the huge pile of requests awaiting the justices’ attention is one she prepared for her client: Roberson. “We’ll be watching anxiously to see if we make it through that gauntlet,” Sween told the Guardian. Roberson’s supreme court appeal could be his last shot at judicial review. Should the justices reject his approaches, the state of Texas would be free to set a new execution date. Roberson has asked the court to review the decision of the Texas state courts to deny a retrial despite new evidence that has emerged casting doubt on his conviction. Since Sween took over as his attorney in 2016 she has discovered that: Nikki, who shortly before she died had been placed in Roberson’s custody, was chronically sick almost from birth. She suffered bouts of breathing apnea which caused her suddenly to stop breathing and collapse. Shortly before her father rushed her to hospital, she had had diarrhea for five days and had a fever of 104.5F (40.3C). Nikki also had severe undiagnosed pneumonia. She had been prescribed medications, including an opioid, that are no longer considered safe for children as they can cause fatal breathing problems and oxygen deprivation. The sexual assault allegation was unsupported by any evidence, and the nurse who raised it was unqualified to identify it. Then there is the overarching question of shaken baby syndrome. The petition asks the supreme court to weigh whether a death sentence based largely on a scientific hunch presented to the jury as fact should be allowed to stand when, in the intervening years, that theory has been largely discredited. In other words: should Texas be allowed to execute a man on the basis of junk science? “This is a shocking, social failure,” Sween said. “This is not simply a matter of having the wrong guy, it’s a matter of there having been no crime committed in the first place.” Texas houses its 179 male death row inmates in the Allen B Polunsky Unit, a complex of windowless grey boxes resembling a Walmart supercenter shrouded in barbed wire. Roberson, 56, was waiting in the secure metal cubicle assigned for media visits. He was wiping smudges off the bulletproof glass, an attention to detail that seemed incongruous given the circumstances. He was dressed in the all-white onesie that is death row uniform in Texas. From the first exchange, his highly unusual way of speaking was evident. “Thank you for for for for for, ah ah, this interview, sir sir,” he said, blinking fast behind his glasses, in time with his stutter. That was a clue as to why medical staff were so quick to suspect Roberson when they encountered him, and why Wharton found his behaviour so singular. Long after his capital trial – too late for the jury to factor it in – Roberson was diagnosed with autism. Brian Wharton, the former lead detective in the death penalty case against Robert Roberson, has changed his opinion about the guilt of Roberson. Photograph: Callaghan O’Hare/The Guardian Roberson described his life of poverty at the time he began looking after Nikki. Separated from the girl’s mother, and living with a new partner, he worked three newspaper delivery routes to try to support them. “After gas and stuff, you don’t make too much from a paper route,” he said. Asked what he hoped for Nikki when he took custody of her, he said: “I was hoping to raise her, you know, to be a father to her, to raise her to have a good life and stuff, and for us all to be happy. To provide for her best I can, to nurse her, to love her, to pray for her.” Roberson said Nikki was sick from the day she joined him, recalling that they had to visit the doctor’s surgery because she was so ill. On the morning of 31 January 2002, he said he found she had fallen out of bed and was lying face down on the floor. “She had a little bit of blood on her lip, I wiped it off on a towel,” he said. He lifted her back on the bed and they went back to sleep. Then he described what happened after he awoke a second time. “When I got back up she wasn’t breathing and I listen to her heart, weren’t breathing. I tried to wake her up, her heart was still beating but she wasn’t breathing.” He added: “Only thing I could think was she might have fell off and might have hit her head, but I didn’t see it, so I don’t know.” He drove Nikki to the ER and handed her to the medical staff. “They lifted the little girl, and she’s limp and started turning blue, and stuff.” He said he could tell that the nurses and doctors suspected him straight away of doing something bad to Nikki. During the trial, the prosecution said he came across as cold and uncaring because he didn’t cry, but he said that was because he had trained himself not to cry during his difficult childhood. “It’s hard for me to cry because I got my behind whooped by my father who would say, ‘Shut up or dry it up or we’ll give you some more.’ My dad was kind of abusive, you know.” Roberson was taken into custody within hours of Nikki’s death. He remains there more than 21 years later. The Allan B Polunsky Unit, in Livingston, Texas. Photograph: Callaghan O’Hare/The Guardian I asked him how he felt about being convicted of shaking his daughter to death. “I would never think about shaking her,” he replied. “And that’s God’s honest truth. I don’t know what happened to her, Mr Pilkington. I wouldn’t want that to be on nobody: to lose a child, especially if you tried to do right and you loved her and tried to get to know her, then to be accused.” Roberson said he knew nothing about the medical hypothesis that fueled his prosecution until long after he was arrested. He read about it in a brochure someone gave his mother. “I’d never heard about shaken baby in my life,” he said. S haken baby syndrome (SBS) began life in the early 1970s as a medical hypothesis for why some children become severely ill, some fatally, showing signs of internal head trauma but little or no signs of external trauma. One of the first to float the idea was a British pediatric neurosurgeon, Norman Guthkelch, who in 1971 suggested the cause might be violent shaking. By the 1980s, SBS had developed into a detailed theory focusing on three symptoms, known as the triad, that it was believed could indicate abusive shaking: bleeding between the tissue layers covering the brain, swelling on the brain, and bleeding at the back of the eyes. When that triad was seen, even without any outward sign of force, child abuse might be behind it. By the 1990s, a form of groupthink had crept in, medical practitioners firming up what had begun as a mere hunch into a formal diagnosis. The collective thinking now was that where those three symptoms were seen in young children, not only could abusive shaking be presumed, it had to be taken as the cause. In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the world’s leading pediatric medical organization, issued official guidance. It said that where a young child had internal head injuries there was “the need for a presumption of child abuse” – a categoric finding that rapidly became medical, and then forensic dogma. The conversation was about shaken baby, so for me and my detectives that’s the direction we were going Brian Wharton So it was that a year later, when Roberson brought Nikki to ER, he was met by a cordon of medical staff trained in this thinking, with detectives and prosecutors following their lead. “When we got to Palestine hospital, the conversation was about shaken baby,” Wharton recalled, “so for me and my detectives that’s the direction we were going.” The problem was that the presumption that the triad must be caused by violent shaking had no scientific foundations. As a new book of essays, Shaken Baby Syndrome, published by Cambridge University Press and edited by prominent scientists and law professors in the US, UK, Europe and Japan, points out, shaking is essentially a biomechanical issue pediatric doctors know little about. One of the first biomechanical studies to be carried out into SBS was conducted in 1987, almost 20 years after the hypothesis emerged. It found that violent shaking produces a force inside the head well below that involved in impact injuries such as car crashes, and much weaker than child abuse experts had assumed. The new book’s conclusion is that 50 years after Guthkelch’s hunch, “this hypothesis still lacks a scientific evidence base”. In 1997, shaken baby syndrome became a global sensation with the televised trial of a British nanny, Louise Woodward, in Massachusetts. She was prosecuted following the death of the eight-month-old in her care, Matthew Eappen. Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life, later reduced to involuntary manslaughter and time served. Her trial was so high-profile that it brought to public attention serious doubts about the credibility of SBS raised by the nanny’s defense attorney, the co-founder of the Innocence Project, Barry Scheck. Since Roberson was sentenced to death in 2002, those doubts have steadily grown. Dr Patrick Barnes, a key prosecution witness in the Woodward trial, retracted his testimony and became a vocal critic of the syndrome. The trial of Louise Woodward, a British nanny in the US, brought to public attention serious doubts about the credibility of SBS. Photograph: Getty Images Even Guthkelch, its creator, came out in 2012 and said his work had been distorted. He never intended, he said, to suggest that the three symptoms could be assumed to be shaken baby syndrome in the absence of any other evidence of abuse. “There was not a vestige of proof when the name was suggested that shaking, and nothing else, causes the triad,” he said. Over time those medical doubts have filtered through to the courtroom. Since 1993 there have been 32 exonerations in the US following SBS convictions, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. This week, an appeals court in New Jersey ruled that SBS was “junk science” and “scientifically unreliable” and could not be used by prosecutors at trial. In Ohio, Alan Butts was released in December after 19 years in prison having been granted a new trial. His story is uncannily similar to Roberson’s: he was accused of the “shaking baby” death of his girlfriend’s two-year-old son, Jadyn, in 2002, the year Nikki died. New evidence showed Jadyn had pneumonia at the time of his death – just like Nikki. The toddler was on medication no longer given to children because it can cause sudden death – just like Nikki. Katherine Judson is a lawyer who has represented Butts for several years. She is also executive director of the Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences, which has filed a brief supporting Roberson in his supreme court petition. In Judson’s view, the Butts and Roberson narratives are so remarkably akin that they provide an excellent example of “flukey justice”. “You can have the exact same facts in a different jurisdiction,” she said, “and one person gets released while the other person languishes on death row.” I n recent years, the Innocence Project has become increasingly involved in exposing junk science. The group has focused on a range of forensic techniques that in their application have put innocent people at risk. They include bitemark analysis, under which it was believed erroneously that a bite on a corpse’s skin could be matched to a suspect’s dentition; hair microscopy, which claimed falsely that a single hair from a crime scene could be linked visually to an individual; and fire science, which suggested that analysis of a burn pattern could determine whether a fire was arson – until it was discovered that intentional and accidental fires leave the same imprints. ‘Can you spell lynching?’: lawyer’s shocking note in Texas execution case Read more The Innocence Project has joined Roberson’s legal team. Vanessa Potkin, director of special litigation, said the group had decided to fight for the prisoner’s life because “an innocent man is at serious risk of being executed”. She added: “Like so many faulty forensics that have played a role in the nation’s exonerations, the evidence upon which his conviction and death sentence rest has been disproven since the time of his trial.” Paradoxically, Texas is a leader in countering junk science. In 2013, the state introduced a first-in-the-nation “junk science writ” that allowed prisoners – especially those on death row – to challenge sentences on grounds of misused forensic science. It was under this law that in 2016 Sween saved Roberson from imminent death by securing a stay of execution four days before his scheduled lethal injection. But the hope generated by the new junk science law in Texas has proven a chimera. There have been about 70 attempts by death row inmates to utilize the law and of those the number that have obtained relief is zero. Kosoul Chanthakoummane was one of those who appealed through the junk science law. He had been put on death row on the back of three different types of junk science: hypnosis of a witness to obtain identification, bitemark analysis and a discredited form of DNA testimony. In August 2022, Texas executed him anyway. There is a real possibility that that fate now awaits Roberson. Having secured a stay of execution, he was granted an evidentiary hearing at his trial court. Sween presented a mass of new evidence. Expert witnesses were called to speak about the growing consensus that SBS is junk science. The court heard that Nikki’s symptoms could all be explained by natural rather than violent causes, including her pneumonia and chronic illness and the life-threatening medication. It was also told about Roberson’s autism, and the unfounded nature of the sexual assault allegation. It was just three words: shaken baby syndrome. Without them, he would be a free man today. Brian Wharton Despite the voluminous testimony, a state judge denied the appeal. She said shaken baby syndrome remained a reasonable diagnosis and that Roberson “failed to provide any newly discovered evidence” undermining his conviction. In January, the Texas court of criminal appeals affirmed that decision. The state is now actively lobbying the supreme court justices to persuade them not to take Roberson’s case. Its argument cites testimony from Teddie, Roberson’s estranged girlfriend, who said he had a bad temper and would yell at Nikki and hit her. Roberson’s legal team counter that Teddie was not a credible witness. Her own sister testified for Roberson, insisting she had never seen him mistreat Nikki and telling the jury Teddie had a problem with telling the truth. Brian Wharton, who after retiring from law enforcement retrained as a cleric and is now pastor of a United Methodist church situated 10 miles away from death row, testified at the junk science hearing. He told the court that, drawing on his 14 years’ experience as a police officer, he had come to the view that shaken baby syndrome was a fallacy and that without it there was no evidence supporting Roberson’s death sentence. “What case would we have been able to make?” Wharton told the Guardian. “There was no crime scene, no forensic evidence. It was just three words: shaken baby syndrome. Without them, he would be a free man today.” Roberson said the worst part of his fight to stay alive was not knowing. Will the supreme court take his petition, or will they not? He has had so many knock-backs that he knows the worst could happen. But he says he’s ready for whatever comes. He recently participated in the first faith-based program on Texas’s death row and said it had deepened his religious belief. Roberson has a tattoo on his right arm which he inked himself when he was still a child, aged 17. That was many years before he grew up and became a father to Nikki.

That’s how I felt when I was a kid. But I changed, and now it’s ‘Follow The Way’.” That will be his guiding star for whatever lies ahead. “I hope and pray that God gives them the knowledge for the people to make a righteous decision,” Roberson said. “I know I didn’t do it. I’m not guilty. So I’m at peace with the Lord.” I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian’s journalism.

It seems like a reasonable question to me. reply rossant 16 hours agorootparentShaking and child abuse are obviously real things. However, the way to diagnose shaken baby syndrome has been the subject of an ongoing scientific controversy for decades. With several colleagues, we have just published a textbook about this sensitive issue [1].

Is there a particular history of using hypnosis to convict innocent people of shaking babies to death in Texas and impose the death penalty on them? Is this common knowledge?The original comment to which I was responding still makes absolutely no sense to me. And getting downvoted because I asked for clarification is making even less sense to me. I must be missing something fundamental here. (Either that or HN has jumped the shark, which I fervently hope is not the case.) reply rossant 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know anything about hypnosis, but I think the comment you replied too made an analogy between the contested science of SBS, and the unreliability of hypnosis induced testimonies. There are many other scientific methods in criminal law that have been criticized for their poor reliability, yet many of them are still routinely used in courts.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obamawhitehouse.archives.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;20&#x2F;pcast-r...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innocenceproject.org&#x2F;misapplication-of-forensic-scie...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;the-problem-wi... reply lisper 15 hours agorootparentSure, I don&#x27;t disagree with any of that. But contrary to the claim made in TFA, SBS is not junk science, at least not if you consider the Mayo Clinic to be a reliable source. It&#x27;s a real thing. What constitutes sufficient evidence to convict someone of it is a different question. You can&#x27;t just dismiss a claim of SBS a priori as \"junk science\". reply rossant 14 hours agorootparent\"Junk science\" doesn&#x27;t really capture the nuance associated with this diagnosis.Although SBS is a highly disputed and contested diagnosis, most medical authorities (Mayo Clinic, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC...) do not recognize any legitimate controversy associated with it. The most notable exception is the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services which published a systematic review in 2016 criticizing the scientific reliability of SBS diagnoses made on the so-called \"triad\" of subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy [1]. This report itself generated intense debates.The difficulty here is that definitions are generally vague and change over time. What does \"shaken baby syndrome\" mean? An abusive gesture, a medical theory, something else? That alone is unclear.What is being really contested is the idea that you can reliably infer shaking whenever you observe this \"triad\" of findings in an infant with no history of major trauma, and no other evidence of trauma (no bruises, no fractures, no neck injury...). This idea was universally accepted between the 1980s and the 2000s. But the science has shifted, to such a point that medical authorities no longer officially support this theory — however, diagnoses are still being made by inertia of clinical practice and criminal justice. Yet, authorities still claim there is no controversy on the existence and severity of abusive head injuries, which isn&#x27;t really the point. More on this issue here [2] and in this paper [3].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbu.se&#x2F;en&#x2F;publications&#x2F;sbu-assesses&#x2F;traumatic-sh...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyrille.rossant.net&#x2F;introduction-shaken-baby-syndrom...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wlr.law.wisc.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;1263&#x2F;2020&#x2F;... reply Omni5cience 13 hours agorootparentprevAFAICT The Junk Science at play here is not that SBS doesn&#x27;t exist, but that the triad of symptoms is enough to definitively prove SBS.The reference to Texas is because the subject of the article is a particular case in Texas (with references to other laws&#x2F;cases in Texas like the \"junk science writ\" and Kosoul Chanthakoummane whose case had nothing to do with SBS). The reference to hypnosis is sort of orthogonal to SBS, it&#x27;s used as another example of junk science in the article.This section of the article is probably the most relevant:Paradoxically, Texas is a leader in countering junk science.

It makes the unsubstantiated claim that shaken baby syndrome is junk science. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a real thing, at least according to the Mayo Clinic, which I consider more trustworthy on this topic than The Guardian.It may well be that the evidence for SBS in this particular case was bogus, but it does not follow that SBS is bogus in general. reply beerandt 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is, but those claiming psedoscience aren&#x27;t even claiming that the set of symptoms aren&#x27;t \"real\", just that they don&#x27;t deserve their own label because of the implication.\"We can&#x27;t explain this trio of internal head&#x2F;brain&#x2F;eye trauma with lack of corresponding external trauma, but don&#x27;t you dare make the reasonable claim that shaking a baby can&#x2F;does nominally cause the symptoms we see when a baby is, in fact, shaken.\" reply Yoric 15 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that you got it backwards.As far as I understand, the claim is that internal head&#x2F;brain&#x2F;eye trauma can have many causes, so these symptoms do not automatically mean that the baby was necessarily shaken. Sadly, this combination of symptoms have been named \"Shaken Baby Syndrome\", which means that people naturally assume that the baby has been shaken, which is apparently a crime in Texas.Had this same syndrome been named \"Guthkelch Syndrome\", or anything else, the man currently on death row might have been deemed innocent.I, for one, find this scary. Just as (in a very different domain) the \"movie piracy == slavery\" equation I&#x27;ve seen float in Blockbusters many years ago. When people who don&#x27;t know better start believing in names&#x2F;PR&#x2F;..., this can have very real (in this case, deadly) consequences. reply beerandt 14 hours agorootparent>internal head&#x2F;brain&#x2F;eye trauma can have many causesBut almost all have corresponding external trauma.The cases that don&#x27;t have matching external trauma narrow it down considerably.Restrained in a car seat in a rollover wreck? Maybe.Rolled out of her bed? Not really plausible. But might seem like a good excuse for someone looking to cover up abuse.Sort of agree with it being scary that a diagnosis implies a crime, but this is a case where the girl died from bad parenting, whether you call it SBS or not.Hell, even his excuses are giving a 2-year old too many opiates and letting her sleep somewhere she could fall from while sick.

We kill them simply because the punishment has to carry the same weight as the offence. The family of the murderer must go through the same anguish and pain that the murder victim’s family went through. The killer has to be stopped from enjoying all the things that come with being alive. When you kill another person, you deprive them of worldly enjoyments like food, sex, conversations, bathing, laughing, crying and therefore it is only befitting that you too get deprived of same and the only way to do so is through the death sentence. If we are going to shy away from punishing wrong-doers on the basis that the punishment won’t stop other people from committing the same offence then we might as well not send anyone to jail because sending people to jail has never stopped other people from committing the same offences.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sundaystandard.info&#x2F;iocom-a-retributionist-i-sup... reply Scarblac 18 hours agorootparentAnd that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s horrible.

I don&#x27;t think claiming that innocent people who happen to be related to criminals should be forced to suffer is a universal premise; if you&#x27;re going to claim it, you&#x27;re going to need to back it up with an argument about why that&#x27;s somehow more reasonable than \"we shouldn&#x27;t go out of our way specifically to punish innocent people\".> If we are going to shy away from punishing wrong-doers on the basis that the punishment won’t stop other people from committing the same offence then we might as well not send anyone to jail because sending people to jail has never stopped other people from committing the same offences.If your goal is a 1:1 justice system where the guilty party suffers the exact same punishment that their victim suffered through their crime, doesn&#x27;t that also imply that imprisonment should basically only ever be used as a punishment for kidnapping&#x2F;holding people hostage? Do you punish a drug dealer by forcing them to buy drugs from the victim, or a fraud doctor to get care only from people without medical degrees?

Most people rarely feel a desire to kill, and most people know they would feel guilty for killing someone. A person&#x27;s feelings will keep them in line even if their character won&#x27;t. The police add an extra incentive.But executions change all that. Whether or not a person supports capital punishment reveals if their morality is a flimsy thing of feelings and self-interest or a thing of principle. It is safe for someone to hate a heinous criminal and wish them ill. There&#x27;s little fear of guilty feelings or reprisal. The average person will give in, baying for blood purely because they want to see the hated person suffer.

In all of those cases the killing is justified by more than just bloodlust. I am not a pacifist and never have been.Executions are different.

If someone comes at a group of people (e.g., at a temple, mosque, church), they have a right to protect yourself, potentially up to the point of killing the attacker.If someone keeps coming at member of society, society has a right to protect itself.In modern times, with modern prisons, it is much easier to keep these people isolated from society at large, and so the need for the mechanism has been diminished, but the principle is still there. reply Retric 18 hours agorootparentprevRetribution would require mimicry of the original crimes.

I get why the victims would want this but why is that a reason for our legal system to adopt it as a guiding principle?\"The pact the government has with people is that the government metes out justice so that people don&#x27;t try to get it themselves. Some measure of retribution, it doesn&#x27;t need to be the death penalty, works towards this goal. If people believe the courts will punish a criminal they are less likely to do it themselves, it reduces the risk of vigilante justice. That&#x27;s a good thing because vigilantes are less discerning about getting the right person and considering extenuating evidence. It&#x27;s a compromise.Imagine the government found a way to cure psychopathy with a pill. They catch a serial killer who brutally murdered dozens of people, utterly rehabilitate him with their pill and release him the same day. This might satisfy you and some of the other wise and enlightened commenters in this thread, but many people would not be satisfied with it and people would be more inclined to kill murderers in retribution, since the government no longer punishes them. reply thomastjeffery 9 hours agorootparentA responsible government would punish the vigilantes instead of the innocent or rehabilitated. reply dsego 22 minutes agorootparentI always wonder how moral and fair it is to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation to someone guilty of a heinous crime, since they didn&#x27;t provide a second chance to their victims. It seem like a great cosmic injustice. As for punishing vigilantes, should settling the score be more severely punished than the original crime? Let&#x27;s say a person kills someone I love, and I take my revenge by killing them, am I now not worthy of rehabilitation? reply chipsa 15 hours agorootparentprevThe purpose of the justice system is many-fold: One is reform (serve your penance and be better). One is retribution: you did a bad thing, so bad things are going to happen to you. One is deterrence: knowing that you&#x27;ll get caught, you won&#x27;t want to spend time in jail, a flip side of retribution. The last is removal: it&#x27;s hard to commit crimes against innocent people if you&#x27;re not around innocent people. The death penalty is the ultimate in removal. But it&#x27;s final. So, you can&#x27;t fix it if you screwed up in applying it. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m against it, generally speaking. Our justice system is not reliable enough to avoid innocents getting ground by the wheels of justice, even at the level of scrutiny of capital punishment.

Trial is the point that you show all available evidence to the jury.In Illinois you can attempt to present your evidence only after you have exhausted all of your regular appeal routes (appellate court, state supreme court, SCOTUS, state habeas corpus, fed habeas -- there are 11 levels here first) which can take a decade. Then you have to petition the court. But you have to do it yourself, you don&#x27;t get a lawyer to help you at the first stage. So if you have no idea what you&#x27;re doing (and certainly a prison is going to do whatever they can to impede you in this by restricting your access to any instructions or legal materials), then you just have to suck it up and take the needle.In fact, I don&#x27;t think enough emphasis is put on the fact that these people are generally fighting their cases from prison and it is 1000X harder to do from inside than outside. They have no access to a phone directory to try to call anyone. They might not have any money to make calls. The prison might only give them one free letter a week. And then you need an address to write to - where do you get that? A phone call is probably limited to 20 mins, and if you call and the other person misses it, you can&#x27;t call back to a prison.And don&#x27;t get me started on legal materials in prison. If you are lucky enough where you can actually get to a library (all prison law libraries shut during COVID and many have never reopened) you&#x27;ll rarely see a computer. Often it is just piles of moldy books. And of course the previous person didn&#x27;t want to risk the chance they would ever get back to the library, so at the very least they have torn out all the pages they need from the book you wanted to read, or worse, have straight up stolen the book.And we&#x27;re not taking into account how much energy is required to fight the system and how exhausting it is for an inmate. It is mentally unbelievable to do all this work locked up. You have to do everything on paper with a pencil too at most places. Copying out huge citations and writing huge motions. Then you have to perhaps write them out another 19 times because that&#x27;s how many copies the court requires by law and you don&#x27;t have access to a photocopier. Plus everyone around you at the prison is just running buck wild, screaming, shouting, fighting, gambling. It&#x27;s no fun.And these lawyers fighting for death row inmates are awesome, amazing, unbelievable people, but there are very, very few of them. And only death row cases get any real traction. The innocent people who are convicted and get life without parole don&#x27;t get noticed. The innocent people who get 80 years without parole are way down the list, even though it is a de facto life sentence.I&#x27;m helping a guy now who is inside on a life-without-parole case. No lawyer has stepped up to help him out. I&#x27;m trying to help him find a lawyer. I&#x27;ve just been helping a guy reconnect to modern life after getting out from a 40 year sentence for a crime he didn&#x27;t do. reply epicureanideal 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m completely shocked that the \"defund the police\" movement was where the progressive activists chose to dedicate their attention.Whereas issues like you mention above, and trial reform in general, and prison system reform in general, would have wide bipartisan support.It really makes me suspicious why activists and the media are not advocating for the things 90% of people would agree with. Is the other stuff just an intentional distraction so nothing gets fixed? reply jfengel 18 hours agorootparentThe police is where you can get obvious, overwhelming evidence of abuse. It literally takes a man being murdered on video to move the needle, and even then you get a ton of pushback.There are many prison reform movements, but none of them get any traction without such visceral, concrete, and shocking symbols. You hear about defunding the police because it&#x27;s the only one with even a shred of a chance to accomplish anything at all.People might agree with other improvements if a pollster asked them, but only because it&#x27;s abstract. If they got any serious traction there would be an equivalent objection using the same tactics to defame and harass the people who were trying. And since it doesn&#x27;t involve a death it will get chalked up to \"both sides are bad\" and dropped.I&#x27;d love to see politics work on something more coherent and beneficial but we&#x27;re way, way past that. reply hexane360 16 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with prison reform is politicans are incredibly afraid of being seen as \"soft on crime\". Paradoxically, this is especially true for democrats, because republicans are assumed to be tough on crime by default. Opposing prison reform is an easy way to seem tough on crime because convicts don&#x27;t vote and most people aren&#x27;t familiar with the prison system. Policing is more controversial, because a lot of people have had negative personal experiences with the police, and many are suspicious of government or authoritarianism. reply morkalork 18 hours agorootparentprevJustice reform doesn&#x27;t really matter to the suspect if he&#x27;s killed being taken into custody. reply UncleMeat 15 hours agorootparentprev> trial reform in general, and prison system reform in general, would have wide bipartisan support.They absolutely do not.

Thomas is unfit and disappointingly partisan, but this appointment came from the executive branch, not the justice system itself.

For elections there is an emphasis on finality and we would never overturn an election years later because of something like I had \"an incompetent campaign manager.\" You can do things like recounts but the process ends shortly after the election and then that&#x27;s it. But for criminal trials the appeals process is effectively endless, in most cases if there&#x27;s new evidence that that proves your innocence you can get a new trail or if it&#x27;s definitive enough just be let out of jail with an \"our bad.\" I think this is good but Thomas wants it to be more like elections where once it&#x27;s decided it&#x27;s decided, you go through your punishment and we just accept that sometimes mistakes will be made. reply GlumWoodpecker 21 hours agoprevPowerful article.

And it doesn&#x27;t do a realistic depiction of the rate at which people get completely screwed over by corruption. And it doesn&#x27;t do a great job pointing out how often prosecutors will take cases prioritized for their own political careers.I am not a lawyer, and the lawyers I watched L&O with were civil litigators not criminal litigators, so some of my perspective is probably off (though I suspect in ways that are more favorable to the show).

Known as the CSI effect: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CSI_effect reply hirundo 19 hours agorootparentI was on a jury last month, an assault and battery case in which the identification of the rusty-colored substance on the grip of a handgun could easily make a big difference. We convicted on the assault and acquitted on the battery because of the lack of the evidence, though I think most of us thought the defendant was guilty of both.This was the second try at this case after a prior jury hung, but the two years between the charge and the second trial were not enough to get _any_ results back on the substance.

If you want to be a competent and successful lawyer while holding those opinions you have to firewall half your brain off from the other half. Partially because fringe people who want to change the law make terrible legal arguments[0], and partially because nobody wants to hire a lawyer that&#x27;s arguing that forensic software should be decopyrighted and its source code forcibly expropriated by the state for the sake of avoiding a miscarriage of justice.[0] Like me, right now, who thinks we should demand copyright term maximums reply adfgiionio 15 hours agorootparentWho said anything about the state claiming ownership of this software?

Generally a \"legal argument\" means something argued in front of a judge about how the law is, rather than something argued to Congress about how the law ought to be. The reason why reformers make bad legal arguments is because they&#x27;re trying to use the legal system to do an end-run around Congress, because the rich people already own Congress.That being said, they also own the legal system indirectly. It&#x27;s staffed by professionals who have a vested interest in a set of rich people paying them money. If SCOTUS said tomorrow that, say, 1A overturns the Copyright Clause, half the legal profession would be homeless by the day after.Also, trademark as copyright is already precluded by the federal preemption clause of US copyright law; you specifically cannot cobble together other rights into something that looks and quacks like a copyright. reply kergonath 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are alternatives to “decopyrighting”: a government-sponsored development effort, open source from the beginning, for example.

The first case addressing a situation sets the bar, which is backwards. The most important decisions are made when we, collectively, know least about the topic at hand. reply kmeisthax 16 hours agorootparentCommon law is only one basis of law and it&#x27;s almost exclusively an English thing. In England, alternative bases of law were associated with horrific abuses of power. In response the Anglosphere has adopted a sort of extreme legal conservatism: anything other than inviolable natural rights decided on the basis of \"we&#x27;ve always done it this way\" is not freedom, but privilege[0]. Every acquittal binds the law, ideally forever. This is the same form of law that gives us things like \"human rights are what you afford your worst enemy\", which is contradictory[1], but sounds like a really strong bulwark against tyranny.Outside of the Anglosphere judges are free to ignore precedent, which they call \"jurisprudence\". This is a tradeoff: you get justice \"in the moment\" in exchange for less future surety about how the legal system will react. The legal system might just decide that you doing the exact same thing someone else did and got away with is now illegal.My personal opinion is that any basis of law can be used for tyranny, and that common law and inviolable rights are less protective than we have been propagandized to think. Even common law legal systems occasionally overturn precedent if they feel like it - remember when anti-abortion laws were a violation of the 4th Amendment until they weren&#x27;t?[0] This even extends to the word \"franchise\", which means \"French-ize\", as in to be given freedoms by being turned into a Frenchman[1] What if your enemy seeks to take away your rights? reply wizerdrobe 20 hours agorootparentprevAs the saying goes, it’s a “legal” system rather than a Justice system.So long as you follow arcane procedure and precedent, the deeper facts don’t matter and don’t get much respect from the system. reply dmvdoug 20 hours agorootparentprevAnd criminal law and procedure doesn’t care about precedent as much as it cares about finality.

Medical questions about what happened to a victim are often highly relevant, and doctors are legitimate, credentialed experts qualified to speak on that topic.

The child is unlikely to have had any adult friends or relations that would want retribution so much that they kill the late child&#x27;s parent.If this was manslaughter&#x2F;murder of an unrelated adult, then I could see that there could conceivably be some friends or relations inspired to vigilantism, but this thread has mainly been about manslaughter of children by parents due to incompetence. reply BeFlatXIII 16 hours agorootparentprevIf blood feuds become that much of an intractable issue, why not target those regions for fentanyl-powered self-mollification?That&#x27;s obviously a galaxy brain argument, but what&#x27;s to stop someone from going Tim McVeigh over a routine miscarriage of justice? reply mcpackieh 13 hours agorootparentWhat? replyaqme28 19 hours agoprevAnother similar story about a man executed by Texas based on junk arson science: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2009&#x2F;09&#x2F;07&#x2F;trial-by-fire reply kyrra 20 hours agoprevA version of this that just spells out the man&#x27;s defense can be found on the opinion pages of WSJ: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;texas-may-execute-a-man-based-o...The news side also had a piece on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-debate-over-shaken-baby-syn... reply Rebuff5007 17 hours agoprevWow, I did not realize there are easily accessible public records of Texas&#x27; current death row inmates: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tdcj.texas.gov&#x2F;death_row&#x2F;dr_offenders_on_dr.htmlCredit to the guardian article for linking this.

None.From a purely economic POV, it makes no sense. Compare the average annual cost per state prison inmate [1] ($22,000 for Texas) to the annual cost of a death row inmate. For example, $90,000 per inmate per year for Nevada [2].In addition capital cases are significantly more expensive to try. Each Federal execution cost an estimated $1 million [3].Since 1973, at least 190 people sentenced to death have been exonerated [4]. People exonerated of crimes tend to skew heavily towards minorities, particularly African-American [5][6], which shows it&#x27;s not really about the severity and certainty of a conviction but instead emotional retribution disproportionately targeted at black people.The American carceral state is an abject failure and a blight on humanity.

They might overlap a bit, you get some religious people with a live and let live mentality or a social conservative who believes that social structures should be enforced by community rather than law, but they&#x27;re distinct ideologies.It&#x27;s like how everyone says liberals are socialist progressives.

Just look at what happens whenever they take political power. They profess \"local control\" when they only have control of the localities; when they achieve power at the state or federal level, they immediately place restrictions on the ability of localities to set their own rules and laws. (I&#x27;ve seen this happen over and over.) And traditionally over the decades, conservatives have been and continue to be the biggest proponents of censorship: in schools, in the media, in businesses, etc.I think the fairest thing to say, from that Wikipedia article, is this: \"Conservatism in the United States is not a single school of thought.\" \"The history of American conservatism has been marked by tensions and competing ideologies\".Limit government interference in the market?

Read what Jesus said about money! Sometimes it appears that most contemporary conservative Christians in the US have not read The New Testament at all, and in some other countries, such as in South America, Christian social movements tend to be (more naturally IMO) explicitly anti-capitalist.

    "originLink": "https://tomscii.sig7.se/2022/07/uMon-stupid-simple-monitoring",
    "originBody": "Inte så lagom best-of id μMon: Stupid simple monitoring Jul 2022 Let me introduce you to μMon, my personal, minimalist, opinionated take on host monitoring based on RRDtool, SNMP, some lightweight shell scripting, and a small FastCGI server written using a modest subset of modern C++. Migrating my monitoring setup to μMon also serves as a case study in complexity reduction, which is the broader theme of this post. Here is an example of how μMon might look like: Main view of my Pinebook Pro (click to enlarge) The above view covers the better part of my Pinebook Pro upgrading itself to OpenBSD 7.1, compiling the whole system from source. The vertical gaps are due to the machine being off.1 Here is a second example with a different view on another host: Upsc view of the server that brought you this webpage (click to enlarge) This view captures a short planned test of my UPS (visible in the middle). Data is sourced directly from the output of the upsc command, as opposed to SNMP. (Yeah, I know. Time for a new UPS battery.) Why μMon? I created μMon due to my love of minimalism and how short existing solutions fall from that ideal. Specifically, I migrated my stack of Prometheus + Grafana that I have been running at home for the last couple years to μMon. By doing so, I managed to finally get rid of: A full-blown time-series database (with gigabytes of rolling on-disk data). Several Go binaries dozens of megabytes each, also consuming runtime resources. (One of them got habitually stuck in an endless loop, so I put in a crontab entry to restart it daily. I do not appreciate black boxes like that.) Lengthy configuration files and lengthy argument lists to said binaries. Systems continuously talking to each other over the network (even when nobody is looking at any dashboard), periodically pulling metrics from nodes into Prometheus, which in turn runs all sorts of consolidation routines on that data. A constant source of noise in otherwise idling systems. A mind-boggingly complex web front-end (Grafana) with its own database, tons of JavaScript running in my browser, and role-based access control over multiple users. A bespoke query language to pull metrics into dashboards, and lots of specialized knowledge in how to build useful dashboards. It is all meant to be intuitive, but man, is it complicated! (People write whole books on how to operate and use this!) Tons of eye candy I did not really mind, but did not really appreciate either. No doubt this complex (and to me, opaque) stack would inevitably get obsolete, necessitating migrations prone to failure, or demand my attention in other, even less predictable ways. In short: keeping up with the state of the art requires an ongoing investment. I have a general inclination towards minimalism, and a preference for long-term durable solutions that do not need continuous attention and care. Having spent many years as a student of complexity (commonly referred to as a career in IT), I have come to hate the kind of surprises that complex (clever, if you will) systems are so prone to. Nowadays, when I provision something, I ask: would this run for 10 years if I forgot about it? How long before it would break, or need to be redeployed with a new (incompatible) major version? Or, if nothing else, go hopelessly out of fashion (hello docker!)? So I substituted all the above with an extremely lightweight stack based on very well understood, several decades old concepts and programs. I now have a system that is comprehensible in its scope and size, and trivially understandable in its simplicity. I did this in the hope that it will serve me for decades to come, without any undue need of caring for it. In fact, my ambition was to solve the problem of server monitoring once and for all, at least for all systems in my care. This fits neatly into my overall strategy of establishing fully autonomous, sustainable personal computing. Less bells and whistles, less overhead and less churn equals less to worry about, while keeping all the features actually needed. By the way, I am not meaning to pick on Prometheus and Grafana in particular. If you have used Cacti, Collectd, Graphite, InfluxDB, Nagios, OpenNMS, Zabbix, or anything similar, then you will probably agree that setting up and using any of these tools is anything but simple. In fact, any monitoring stack will be similar to what I described above in terms of its complexity.2 Granted, if you get paid as a sysadmin DevOps Site Reliability Engineer, you probably need to master some locally useful combination of these comprehensive tools. If that is not your job, and you want something simple and stupid, you might find μMon interesting. Keeping it simple and stupid is such a priority that as an all-time reminder, I decided to include the word simplicity right in the μMon logo I “designed”: In total, I estimate that I spent the equivalent of at most one week of full-time engineering work (scattered over about a month of evenings and weekends) on creating μMon. Including the logo! Granted, μMon does not cater to every need, only my very own — and those are definitely modest. I do not run anything that could be considered modern or fashionable; I only run a bunch of Unix boxes (a mixture of Linux and BSD). No Docker (or podman), no ProxMox, no Kubernetes. Anywhere I get to decide, I use stable, proven, old technology. In addition, my monitoring needs are fairly modest: I only want basic metrics. Most importantly, I do not use any fancy alerting functionality.3 That could be added on top of what exists in μMon, but it stands for a sizable chunk of complexity in the “real” monitoring systems mentioned above; getting it right is very non-trivial, and not just from a technical perspective.4 Since the small-scale servers I run work pretty much unattended year in and year out, this is fine — I only want to be able to look at metrics to spot trends and interesting times to investigate by looking at event logs, etc. That said, μMon gives me everything I have ever gotten from my old setup (mostly the “interesting subset” of the output of node_exporter, plus the metrics of a custom upsc feeder I hacked together). And there are distinct advantages to μMon: A well understood, constant-space storage model thanks to RRDtool. I know exactly how much disk space the aggregated data takes, and more importantly, I know it will never grow beyond that extent. A well understood model of data consolidation and retention, built on RRDtool’s consolidation functions. I can look back at anywhere between the last one hour and the last two years, with the right temporal resolution. Independent nodes. Each host runs μMon on its own, both to collect metrics and to serve the webpage. There is no single point of collection, storage, or access to the system, nor a single point of failure. (Arguably, this can be a disadvantage depending on your perspective, but it matches my preference.) Very lightweight data collection. Each host collects its own metrics in locally stored round-robin archives; data collection does not incur any network activity. Configuration of metrics collection equals listing the probes you want (but you can use all the power of shell scripting, if you wish). Very simple server setup. I use (x)inetd to serve the FastCGI of μMon via a TCP socket to whatever web server I have on the host (or a different host). The μMon collector script is run by cron. Everything that belongs to μMon resides and runs under an unprivileged user. Extremely minimal dependencies. To install μMon, all I need is a Unix system with a POSIX shell (/bin/sh), a modern C++ compiler, and the ability to install rrdtool. No PHP (or other web toolkit), no Python, no NodeJs. No database (time-series or relational). A local webserver (with FastCGI support) is optional; a remote webserver can act as the proxy as well. Graphs (plots of certain groups of metrics) and views (collections of graphs) can be created or modified any time, by editing simple, small shell scripts. They can even be edited in place for immediate effect (nothing to restart). Of course, knowledge of RRDtool and the POSIX shell is mandatory, but then again, μMon is for hardcore Unix sysadmins with modest needs. Anything you need to know above what is already etched into your brain you will find in the rrd* man pages. But you can get started without changing anything. Not invented here? You could argue that I am exhibiting NIH syndrome by inventing my own (inferior) solution to a problem space well understood and explored by many, many others. You would perhaps not be very wrong. To my defense, let me state that I am not forcing (not even encouraging) anyone to adopt and use μMon. Rather, I am showing it here as a case study in the noble pursuit of complexity reduction, something that I feel is getting more and more important. Especially when focusing on one’s own personal computing affairs. Reduction in complexity Here is a table to recap the transition from all-in to minimal complexity. Note that this is not a moral stance against higher complexity, which you might need for fully legitimate reasons (such as requiring complex alerting over metrics aggregated from different hosts) that μMon does not support. Aspect Prometheus + Grafana μMon look and feel shiny, modern old-school development probably several man-decades one man-week (tops) system model central servers, distributed feeders one independent node per host technologies Go, HTTP, JavaScript, TSDB, … /bin/sh, RRDtool, SNMP daemons collectors, prometheus, grafana umon_fcgi invoked by (x)inetd database bespoke TSDB with WAL, etc. RRDtool db size dynamic; gigabytes constant; a couple megabytes db activity has its own inner life, runs GC, etc. static (in-place RRA overwrites) frontend complete web stack FastCGI server invoking hooks configuration point-and-click, stored in opaque db small shell scripts plugins bespoke (large) binaries SNMP and simple shell scripts collection over the network local (works offline) via cron alerting complex conditions, several channels no support at all maintenance ongoing upgrades & migrations minimal, if any Conclusion I am not saying that “big solutions” are necessarily bad or wrong. But I do want to argue that there is a place for small, perhaps even bespoke, site-only solutions that can serve the common 80% of needs just as well, at several orders of magnitude less complexity. All the while retaining nimbleness to be extended to cover the remaining 20%, when prompted by actual need. There is something to be said for a (figurative) napkin’s worth of code hacked together in a man-week that is capable of bringing the same ultimate value as a full-fledged stack that was no doubt developed in what is probably several man-decades (if not centuries) of engineering work. Sometimes a simple, dumb solution can be fairly robust and complete. I believe μMon is a good illustration of this general idea. At the same time, I feel this is ultimately less of a surprise than it might first seem. Let us not forget that running Unix-descended or Unix-like systems means we are standing on the shoulders of giants: we have time-proven architectural tenets, open standards and systems programming APIs, plus free development tools at our disposal. On top of that, the venerable RRDtool embeds some pretty sophisticated, time-honed data sampling and graph rendering logic. Granted, it takes an educated sysadmin to make use of it all (being a competent systems programmer as well is a big plus), but that is pretty much the original intended audience of these operating systems. μMon is released to the public under the BSD license (the same zero-clause flavour that OpenBSD uses). If you feel inclined to try it yourself, please recall that it is not my goal to supply you (or the world) with a toolkit that works out of the box and suits everyone. I am specifically not advocating μMon as a direct substitute to any of the well-known monitoring stacks.5 In the spirit of the BSD license, it is simply my gift to the world. What you do with it (whether or not you find it useful) is up to you. At any rate, you are expected to read your way through some simple shell scripts and adapt them to your needs. That said, if you have educated questions or constructive feedback (positive or negative) about it, feel free to contact me. 1 The machine froze Friday night, which I did not notice for over an hour. Apparently building the OpenBSD base system with -j 6 was too much to ask from the hardware, so I resumed with my usual -j 4. 2 What looks like the closest existing solution to μMon is a stack of programs called symon, consisting of (at least) symon, symux and syweb. This is also largely RRDtool-based. But… the user needs to configure listeners with port numbers just to get some data collection going; needs to install RRDtool into a webserver chroot; needs a webserver with PHP enabled, etc. 3 I do have my personal collection of cron-driven scripts that check essentials (such as expired SSL certificates) and email me if there is anything that needs my attention. I just prefer to keep these things separate from monitoring data rates and disk usage percentages. 4 I could rant about the incessant floods of useless email/pager alerts coming from everywhere, seemingly so inseparable from Big Tech Company Culture, complete with the inevitable result of people ignoring/filtering them out, for a net result of precisely zero business value achieved at a tremendous cost. But that is another post patiently waiting to be written. 5 Let’s be real: μMon absolutely does not support many of the important use cases of the more complicated stacks. Do I care about any of it? Absolutely not. The point of this exercise was not to create a rewrite of Prometheus + Grafana (they are fine as is), but rather create something that is at least three orders of magnitude smaller, while providing all the functionality I need.

This whole procedure could be automated in a Dockerfile, and actually running uMon would be vastly simplified. Docker itself is not much more than a wrapper around Linux primitives, and if they dislike it specifically for e.g. having to run a server and run containers as root, there are plenty of other lighterweight container alternatives.There&#x27;s an argument to be made that the \"Simple\" Network Management Protocol they&#x27;re a fan of is far from being simple either[2]. Configuring the security features of v3 is not a simple task, and entire books have been written about SNMP as well. They conveniently ignore this by using v2c and making access public, which might not be acceptable in real-world deployments.I&#x27;m all for choosing \"simple\" tools and stacks over \"complex\" ones, for whatever definition of those terms one chooses to use, and I strive to do that in my own projects whenever possible, but simplicity is not an inherent property of old and battle-tested technologies. We should be careful to not be biased for technology we happen to be familiar with, but be pragmatic about picking the right tool for the job that fits our requirements, regardless of its age or familiarity.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomscii.sig7.se&#x2F;umon&#x2F;#Installation%20and%20getting%2...[2]: I have a pet peeve about tools or protocols with \"simple\" or \"trivial\" in their name.

If SNMP is supposed to be \"simple\", I&#x27;d hate to see what the Complex Network Management Protocol looks like!(I have a similar peeve about LDAP, on that note; I guess compared to wrappers around it like Active Directory and FreeIPA it&#x27;s \"lightweight\", but I dread imagining what a heavyweight directory access protocol would entail) reply jdougan 3 hours agorootparentBoth of those are based on old OSI protocols, which were terrifying in their complexity. LDAP mostly subsetted DAP and X.500 and added Internet concepts. SMNP leveraged ASN.1 with some ideas from CMIP but using Internet concepts and attention paid to operations when the network is marginal (unlike CMIP)\"What do you get when you cross a mobster with an OSI standard?You get someone who makes you an offer you can&#x27;t understand.\" reply medellin 5 hours agoparentprevWhen i read that they thought docker was outdated I figured i would open the repo to find go code and pre built binaries… when i found c++ i was left thinking the same as you. reply throwbadubadu 1 hour agorootparentIf it&#x27;s simple doesn&#x27;t need docker, and as someone else said you might even want to stuff it into your docker containers.. so a minimal thing doesn&#x27;t need docker imo.

Do you mean the OCI Image Format, Docker Inc, Docker Engine, something else…? reply intelVISA 1 hour agorootparentprevDocker may be a terrible mess, sure, but something something VC. reply ahofmann 13 hours agoprevI like the concept of simple monitoring. Simple means it is simple to install, simple to maintain and simple to use. For me, this is netdata. Netdata could be much more, but I just install it on whatever machine and never think about it again. And when something is strange on that machine, I go to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:19999 and look around. reply jerrac 12 hours agoparentNot sure I haven&#x27;t run across it before, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried using Netdata. Looks like it is very good for metrics, at least in the 10 minutes I have spent installing it on my local desktop and poking around the ui there.I&#x27;m not seeing anything in it for logs, though. I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t aggregate or do anything with logs? What do you use for log aggregation and analysis?I&#x27;m very interested because I&#x27;ve been getting frustrated with the ELK Stack, and the Prometheus&#x2F;Grafana&#x2F;Loki stack has never worked for me. I&#x27;m really close to trying to reinvent the wheel... reply thinkmassive 8 hours agorootparentPrometheus has become ubiquitous for a reason. Exporting metrics on a basic http endpoint for scraping is as simple as you can get.Service discovery adds some complexity, but if you’re operating with any amount of scale that involves dynamically scaling machines then it’s also the simplest model available so far.What about it doesn’t work for you?Edit: I didn’t touch on logging because the post is about metrics. Personally I’ve enjoyed using Loki better than ELK&#x2F;EFK, but it does have tradeoffs. I’d still be interested to hear why it doesn’t work, so I can keep that in mind when recommending solutions in the future. reply hadlock 11 hours agoparentprevBack in 2017 when I had a bunch of physical machines and unmanaged VMs we ended up putting netdata on the servers. The reason why was because most of the team was used to manually logging onto servers and diagnosing the issue manually.The reason I liked it was because it exposes a standard Prometheus endpoint I can scrape and then view using something like Grafana. There are only about 20,000 Grafana dashboard modules available for netdata but generally you can find one that works for you. Having that prometheus endpoint allows you to springboard into the cloud and get like-metrics out of your cloud stuff as well, with a nice long historical data trail from your older&#x2F;est machines. reply xrd 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been struggling with graphana and netdata looks so much better.Is this a tool where you can boot up the docker app and then connect a bunch of servers into a centralized dashboard? Or, is it better to think of netdata as a dashboard for a single server that permits monitoring of a bunch of processes only on that machine?I&#x27;m not sure I understand whether agents can be configured to talk to a dashboard, or if you don&#x27;t need to do that configuration because they expect to talk to localhost. I have a bunch of VMs running on a bunch of different random hardware and want a way to monitor those VMs (and perhaps the hosts as well). reply dizhn 11 hours agorootparentIf you connect your servers to the netdata cloud, you can manage all of them there.

It’s extremely lightweight and efficient for metrics collection, and the UI is very good as well.

I think munin fits better (uses the same RRDtool graphs, too), though possibly its configuration is too lengthy for the requirements. reply abrookewood 9 hours agoparentprevNetdata deserves way more attention. It automatically configures itself with all relevant modules, runs very lean and has more information available than most people will ever need. reply dobin 2 hours agoprevI was also overwhelmed by Grafana and co. In the time required to install it, i coded a simple monitoring alternative DMSR \"Does My Shit Run\" in python. Each agent has plugins which basically just sends a data structure to the monitoring server, which will display it as yaml. No persistence, history, graphs or similar. uMon looks like a behemoth in comparison.Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dobin&#x2F;dmsrLive: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mon.yookiterm.ch reply nine_k 12 hours agoprevI like the idea of simplicity and doing exactly what you need. And the single executable.The words \"stupid simple\" and \"C++\" together make me scratch my head though. C++ itself is not simple, and you have to recompile if you need to change something (and sometimes you inevitably do), which is slow. I&#x27;d likely go with a relatively simple C program that embeds the FFI for RRDtool and other stuff, and embeds Lua, or, better yet, Janet. Then most of the thing could be written in these languages, and would be easy to tweak when need be. That would still allow for a single executable + a single config file, on top of the logic already embedded. (But the author went and built the thing, and I did not, so their solution so far outperforms mine.) reply uxp8u61q 4 hours agoparentSimple means simple for the end users. Not necessarily simple for the developers. The end users do not care if the dev has to spend a couple of minutes recompiling, as long as the result is fast and simple to use. reply lost_tourist 11 hours agoparentprevc++ can be relatively simple if you don&#x27;t throw in all the bells and whistles and stay away from template metaprogramming. I use it all the time. Sure compiles can be slow, but with proper file partitioning and creating libraries 95% of that can be controlled for. reply posix86 10 hours agoprevWhy&#x27;s everyone hating on Grafana? I find it fairly easy to use, it has a good balance between power & simplicity. And with docker you can make it run in seconds. reply keyle 9 hours agoparentNo one is \"hating\" on Grafana. But if you used tools of the past, you&#x27;d know how light they were compared to the Grafana&#x2F;Kibana&#x2F;Elastic mongrel.But I should mention that there is nothing \"stupid simple\" about the solution of the OP. Just look at the install procedure... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomscii.sig7.se&#x2F;umon&#x2F; reply xrd 10 hours agoparentprevThe difficult thing for me was understanding how to think about and then configure agents. I never could reason about getting the central server up and then connecting nodes to it, whether those nodes were applications or entire servers. The terminology didn&#x27;t make sense to me and it made me question whether I had the right framing for the purpose of grafana. reply dewey 2 hours agorootparentIn the authors case he used Prometheus and Grafana was just the \"frontend\" for it. Basically a way to build pretty dashboards our of your PromQL queries. There&#x27;s no Grafana agent you have to configure. reply roger_ 11 hours agoprevI was recently looking for an ultra minimal monitoring solution for OpenWrt and other lightweight systems (Pi’s, etc.) and was disappointed not to find one that met my needs (negligible CPU, disk space and RAM).I ended up hacking together a shell script to send data to Home Assistant (via MQTT) which runs on pretty much any system that has at least netcat: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roger-&#x2F;hass-sysmon reply synergy20 9 hours agoparentwhy not use https:&#x2F;&#x2F;collectd.org&#x2F; which is in C and used by openwrt&#x27;s luci already along with rrdtool, small in size, low on resource, and has so many plugins already? reply kburman 13 hours agoprevI really like the idea behind μMon. It reminds me of when software was simpler. I remember using a program called \"Everything\" by voidtools. It was small but could search a lot of files quickly. Nowadays, some projects use big tools like Elasticsearch just to search a few things. Some even use PostgreSQL, a big database, for small tasks. I wish more software would keep things simple. reply dave8088 13 hours agoparent“Everything” is a must have for me. It’s shocking that Windows doesn’t come with local search that works. reply sphars 13 hours agorootparentMicrosoft has added basically the same functionality to Power Toys, called Run[0], taking heavy inspiration from Everything.

However, there is a third party plugin for powertoys run that integrates the everything search service. reply zacmps 12 hours agorootparentprevDoes it read the ntfs journal?

Can run on very minimal resources , without hogging your CPU reply evilc00kie 2 hours agoprevNice work!I often think about the \"reinventing the wheel\" argument. Isn&#x27;t open source about diversity? There are so many fork, clones, \"Yet another...\"&#x27;s (yacc, yaml,...).So many times I&#x27;m looking for suitable go libraries that solve a certain problem. There might be a few out there but every lib has its own pros and cons. Having the possibility to choose is great. Nothing sucks more than depending on a unmaintained clib nobody cares without alternatives.The only counter-example that comes in my mind is crypto. You don&#x27;t want to do your own crypto. reply madsbuch 2 hours agoparentI think it mostly depends on purpose. Crypto is being reinvented several times a day by students needing to understand the mechanics of various algorithms.Personally, I find it rewarding to reimplement something known. There is always a solution when you are stuck, and who knows. Maybe one will develop a better API for the system of something else. reply rcarmo 3 hours agoprevRrdtool is still my go-to for a lot of things. The only functionality I would like to have from it is an SVG version of the charts that allowed for panning and zooming into particular points in the past. reply Borg3 13 hours agoprevNot bad. I like KISS concepts. I personally run old Cacti instance for monitoring here. Not that simple as uMon, but not very complicated either. And even wrote cacti_con CLI like graph viewer, to see specific port of that fat 100+ ports campus switches I had at work :) reply vsviridov 13 hours agoprevLooks more or less like munin... reply golem14 8 hours agoprevLooks nice. I would like to use something like this to remotely monitor machines. Currently use Prometheus (but without Grafana), since the alerting and built-in graphing is sufficient.But agree with OP that Prometheus feels more complex than need be for simple use cases. But so does sendmail ;) reply amar0c 3 hours agoprevMonitoring should be: \"central\" location with GUI&#x2F;graphs + agents per bunch of servers. Let me chose from dropdown what I want to see.If I have to deploy this on each machine than it makes no sense.

Great work!I did something different but in a similar vein for one server network. We had Seq already deployed for log monitoring so instead of setting up a separate network&#x2F;node&#x2F;app health monitoring interface I configured everything to regularly ping seq with a structured log message containing the needed data that could be extracted and graphed with seq’s limited oob charting abilities in the dashboard. Not perfect, but simpler. reply wtcactus 3 hours agoprevNice nifty project, he had me until the \"no alerting\" part.Anyway, I might still deploy this in a Proxmox homelab where I don&#x27;t want to fight with the complexity of a grafana dashboard. reply rcarmo 3 hours agoparentWhat’s missing from the Proxmox charts that you would need a dashboard for? reply new_user_final 11 hours agoprevIs there any simple monitoring system for kubernetes that will monitor memory and CPU usage for each deployments and node? Prometheus and Grafana is good but too much configuration. I also like stats page of HAProxy. Something like that for per service? reply gjulianm 2 hours agoprevI honestly don&#x27;t get the criticisms of the Prometheus + Grafana stack.> A full-blown time-series database (with gigabytes of rolling on-disk data).Prometheus has a setting that allows you to limit the space used by the database. I&#x27;m not sure however how one can do monitoring without a time-series database.> Several Go binaries dozens of megabytes each, also consuming runtime resources.Compared to most monitoring tools I&#x27;ve tested, the Prometheus exporters are usually fairly lightweight in relation to the amount of metrics they generate. Also, \"several dozens of megabytes\" doesn&#x27;t seem like too much when we&#x27;re usually talking about disk spaces in the gigabytes...> Lengthy configuration files and lengthy argument lists to said binaries.Configuration files, yes if you want to change all the defaults. Argument lists, not really. In reality, a Docker deployment of Grafana + Prometheus is 20 lines in a docker-compose.yml file. Configuration files come with defaults if you install it to the system.By the way, I&#x27;m not sure that configuring a FastCGI server will be easier than configuring a Docker compose file...> Systems continuously talking to each other over the network (even when nobody is looking at any dashboard), periodically pulling metrics from nodes into Prometheus, which in turn runs all sorts of consolidation routines on that data. A constant source of noise in otherwise idling systems.Not necessarily. Systems talk to each other over the network if you configure them to do so. You can always install a Prometheus + Grafana on every node if you don&#x27;t want to do central monitoring and you&#x27;ll have no network noise.> A mind-boggingly complex web front-end (Grafana) with its own database, tons of JavaScript running in my browser, and role-based access control over multiple users.Grafana, complex? I think dragging and dropping panels with query builders that don&#x27;t even require you to know the query language are far better than defining graphs in shell scripts.> A bespoke query language to pull metrics into dashboards, and lots of specialized knowledge in how to build useful dashboards. It is all meant to be intuitive, but man, is it complicated!Again, this is not a problem of the stack. Building useful dashboards is complicated no matter what tool you use.> maintenance: ongoing upgrades & migrationsNot really. Both Prometheus and Grafana are usually very stable and you don&#x27;t need to upgrade if you don&#x27;t want to. I have a monitoring stack built with it in my homelab and I haven&#x27;t updated it in two years, and it still works. Of course I don&#x27;t have the new shiny features, but it works.To me, it seems that the author is conflating the complexity of the tool with the complexity of monitoring itself. Yes, monitoring is hard. Knowing which metrics to show, which to pull, how to retain them, it&#x27;s hard. Knowing how to present those metrics to users is also hard. But this tool doesn&#x27;t solve that. In the end, I don&#x27;t know how useful it is to make a custom tool that collects very limited metrics based on other ancient, limited, buggy tools (SNMP, RRD, FastCGI...) that is missing even basic UX features like being able to zoom or pan on charts. reply pphysch 6 hours agoprevThis doesn&#x27;t seem much simpler than Prometheus+Grafana, if it all.Some pushback:- SNMP sucks. It&#x27;s very limited, difficult to secure, etc. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time with it, and it&#x27;s more complex than Prometheus&#x27; simple HTTP metrics model. I use it where I have to (non-server devices), but I prefer dealing with Prometheus.- Grafana is not necessarily complex. It&#x27;s powerful, and you can waste a lot of time overinvesting in dashboard design, but that&#x27;s not required. It can be used quite elegantly.μMon does seem like \"old school for the sake of old school\". SNMP and RRDTool were designed when memory & bandwidth were much more limited. I will happily trade the overheads of HTTP and static Go binaries for the much superior UX they offer. reply toxik 5 hours agoprevWhat about netdata? reply mayli 11 hours agoprevfyi, here is a very similar project.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pommi&#x2F;CGP reply louwrentius 13 hours agoprevI do run Grafana + InfluxDB at home and I agree it’s not trivial to setup. Grafana in particular makes creating informative, easy to read graphs&#x2F;dashboards a PhD worthy endeavor.Yet, I run some hobby projects that collect data and this setup is absolutely perfect for it. I even challenged myself to use SSL for the InfluxDB server (run small CA).Also, I use slack-based alerting through Grafana, for example if a disk would fill up, or something is down.So it’s really about what your needs are.And often, basic metrics about systems like CPU usage, load or network traffic doesn’t tell you anything useful or actionable. reply random3 12 hours agoprev [–] it&#x27;s 2023. Tracing has been around for 20 years(dtrace, x-trace https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.brown.edu&#x2F;~rfonseca&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;xtr-nsdi07.pdf).Very simple logging, if not structured, while not completely useless it&#x27;s not very useful either. except for maybe showing some nice charts.Any serious monitoring tool is useful when it can explain things and only tracing gives you causal information. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

So our final was a thermostat instead. reply goku12 6 hours agoparentAn unstable rocket (almost all of the big ones) is an inverted pendulum of sorts. The combined center of thrust and aerodynamic forces is usually below the C.G, and the rocket tends to tip over if not actively stabilized. To add a little, a slight margin of tipping is allowed, but the rocket tends to break up if the angle of attack crosses certain limit at high speeds. reply regularfry 2 hours agorootparentLiquid fuel rockets complicate matters: think \"inverted pendulum with a couple of stacked, full wine glasses that you absolutely must not spill balanced on top. Oh, and there&#x27;s a gremlin drinking from them so both CG and total mass are constantly moving.\" reply goku12 1 hour agorootparentTrue. Liquids make control difficult.> full wine glasses that you absolutely must not spill balancedI&#x27;m not sure what you mean by spilling. The liquids are usually contained in fully closed tanks and cannot spill. The thrust usually keeps the liquid at the bottom around the engine intakes. However, liquid sloshing inside the tanks is a problem. Even with slosh dampers, sloshing liquid manages to create attitude disturbances that can cause control instability unless managed carefully. reply thfuran 2 hours agorootparentprevAlso, it&#x27;s extremely windy. reply jcarrano 12 minutes agoparentprevHolding a fixed position on a double integrator system (like a hovering drone) in discrete time is a nice problem too. reply e-_pusher 6 hours agoparentprevSome engineers do balance inverted pendulums in their careers! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;space.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;15486&#x2F;how-does-the... reply tnecniv 4 hours agoparentprevClearly your professor hasn’t had to stand upright in his career or walk for that matter.The (spring loaded) inverted pendulum was one of the earliest analyzed models of legged locomotion. reply FirmwareBurner 2 hours agorootparentYeah, his professor wasn&#x27;t too bright if he said that.

Even using digital instead of an RLC implementation in a coffee machine seems like a waste, but I&#x27;m old. reply goku12 5 hours agorootparentEven if you could, floating point may not be the best representation for control applications. There are a lot of problems, like NaN, as somebody pointed out. Even neglecting that, a fixed point representation may be better.You don&#x27;t need the fine precision or large range that floats have (we get those using exponents). Signal variations below a certain threshold are drowned out by the noise floor. Signals in control systems also have an expected maximum bound.At other end, stability calculations based on quantization noise may be difficult with floats, since their least count changes with exponent. Fixed points have a uniform LC throughout its range. reply TD-Linux 8 hours agorootparentprevCortex-M4&#x2F;M33 are pretty widely deployed on microcontrollers with control hardware, for example the STM32G4 and Reneasas RA series.There&#x27;s still a few reasons not to use it, though. Saving and restoring the float registers adds interrupt handling overhead. If you can fit into 16 bit integers, you can also use the 2 way SIMD instructions and get at least double the throughput.Finally, floats themselves have a lot of footguns. You have to be very careful about propagating NaNs etc into control loops. It&#x27;s also really easy (in C) to accidentally promote to double. reply not_the_fda 9 hours agorootparentprevMost PID applications are not IoT. Many use a cortex M0 which doesn&#x27;t have hardware float support, or non Arm, even 8bit.

What do these M0s go into? reply CalebJohn 7 hours agorootparentI used an 8-bit PIC micro a couple years ago for power applications (think non-IoT lighting). The specific microcontroller we used had nice peripherals for sensing, and controlling diodes, but no FPU. I remember looking into getting something external to handle the PID, but the cost and board layout constraints made it challenging. reply Espressosaurus 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had about as many floating point PID implementations running on the attached core of an embedded ASIC as I have fixed point implementations (running fully within the hardware).Both are useful. reply Philpax 10 hours agorootparentprevNot all PID controllers are destined for embedded. They’re quite useful in gamedev, for example. reply ghotli 7 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re willing to expand on this, color me interested. reply sho_hn 4 hours agorootparentI encountered an example recently in a Star Citizen changelog entry about the PID controller governing the interaction of an NPC character pushing a trolley, and tuning the constants for it.My reaction was a similar \"Huh - makes sense\". reply waste_monk 2 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not a gamedev myself but have played a few games (Stormworks, Garry&#x27;s mod with Wiremod, From The Depths, at least one or two more which I can&#x27;t think of the name right now) that allow PIDs to be used in player-designed contraptions. Quite useful for building stabilised gun platforms and things.I would be sure there&#x27;s plenty of applications for PIDs in a game engine itself - a quick search turns up things like self-balancing physics objects, making game entities turn to follow a mouse pointer, and so on. reply Karliss 1 hour agorootparentprevAny time you are using physics engine in game and need to control a thing while maintaining proper physics interactions a PID controller might be used. You could achieve desired state by cheating and directly animating position or velocity (which gamedevs often do), but if you want to maintain proper interactions with other physics objects the best way is to control force. How do you calculate required force - using a PID controller.It could be a moving enemy, flying robot or a spaceship, rotating gun turret, maybe even doors which need to be moved to desired position.Even without physics engines PID controllers can be useful in games for making procedural animations. Having an object suddenly starting and stopping a movement doesn&#x27;t look natural. It looks much nicer if initially an object slightly lags behind, slows down closer to target and maybe even slightly overshoots the target. It looks more natural because that&#x27;s how things move in real life even non mechanical things. Try quickly swing a hand and then stopping it, you will see a little bit of overshoot&#x2F;oscillation at the end.PID controller isn&#x27;t the only solution to the situations described above and sometimes it&#x27;s an overkill. Sometimes you might just script or animate certain behavior. Sometimes you might use a simplified control model. Sometimes you might implement P, and intentionally or not achieve other components by adjusting physics object properties like friction (unfortunately you can&#x27;t easily change physics properties in real world). With regards to animation example similar look can be achieved by directly animating it and any good animator will be familiar with things like ease in, ease out and overshoot, that&#x27;s fine for static animations but games are interactive so it&#x27;s nice if things react to player movements. Procedural animations can also be achieved by simply using the physics engine and letting things dangle, but that will probably be more computationally expensive than simple PID controller, also harder to constrain and prevent violent shaking in case of unexpected collisions with other world objects especially when some of them are manually animated.Each approach has their own tradeoffs. And which one gets chosen will depend on the specific situation and skillset of people making the game.There are couple of factors that make using a PID controller in games a bit easier compared to real life. In games you can usually directly read the exact positions and speeds of all objects, you can generate force out of thin air, you can generate unrealistic forces and if something goes wrong you can simply clamp the numbers. In games you also choose at which level to operate the PID loop thus making tradeof of code complexity and while still getting benefits of nicer looking animations. In real world you might want to control position of flying quadcopter while the thing you can directly control is speed of propellers with linear velocity, linear acceleration, angle, angular acceleration being between without a way to skip them. reply the__alchemist 8 hours agorootparentprevCortex-M4s&#x2F;M7s&#x2F;ESP32s&#x2F;Nordics are cheap and ubiquitous. They all have hardware floats. M0s are available fast enough to do soft floats. reply sgtnoodle 8 hours agorootparentprevMaybe that was true up until the 90&#x27;s, but doing anything but floating point for a PID is just a waste of development time, even on an 8-bit AVR. reply jbay808 7 hours agorootparentAbsolutely not! The choice of fixed- vs floating-point for a controller should be based on domain knowledge of the problem, and the right choice may vary depending by operation. For example your PID&#x27;s integrator needs to accumulate a running sum. Fixed-point addition is well-behaved for addition, with only the need to deal with overflow (which can be dealt with; the integrator likely needs to saturate anyway to respect a physical limit, so you choose a datatype that doesn&#x27;t overflow before then). Floating point addition has much more nuance; adding a small value to a large one can result in no change at all to the output, causing a controller&#x27;s small-signal transfer function to change based on the system state. This can lead to all sorts of unexpected bad behaviour, like vibration and limit cycles, which might happen only in edge cases after the controller has been running for some time, and so are very hard to catch in testing.There are also many cases where floating point is the clear winner, but again, you should think about it and not just choose floating point reflexively because it seems easier. Its convenience makes it very easy to sweep errors under a rug, and they always come back to haunt you later. reply nullc 7 hours agorootparentprevEven where the hardware is available, it can be harder to prove properties about the behavior of the floating point versions. It&#x27;s no fun when everything turns to NaNs because of surprise cancellation in subtraction. reply forgotusername6 3 hours agoprevAfter a course on balancing PID controllers in university, our professor said that something like 90% of PIDs would be on out of the box factory settings.. reply nebster 10 hours agoprevThe \"Ball on Platform: Edge Balance\" one seems super interesting to me.Is the sample solution just hardcoded or is there some maths behind it to make it work from any location&#x2F;initial speed? reply jstanley 1 hour agoprevThis is brilliant, what a good idea.On the \"Cruise Control Intro\" challenge it&#x27;s not made clear what the output of the controlFunction is.

While a controller designed with this method can get the position error measured at the sampling times to zero very quickly, it gives no guarantees that the error stays zero between the samples. This means the block could be wildly oscillating around the arrow in reality, but oscillating in such a way that it&#x27;s exactly under the arrow at the times your digital controller measures it.This would probably not be a concern in this digital simulator, but such an error can pop up when trying the same thing out in real life.See slide 17 here for a plot: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideserve.com&#x2F;sibyl&#x2F;finite-settling-time-design reply bagels 4 hours agoprevI put in large constant forces, but the acceleration doesn&#x27;t seem to depend on the force (on the inclined car level) reply c7DJTLrn 5 hours agoprevTerry Davis did a nice introduction to PID controllers in his own physics engine SimStructure: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=25hLohVZdME reply goku12 5 hours agoprevThis is really nice!

Franks later pled guilty and testified that this was a lie.So this document is for investigators to ensure they have a specific framework for being able to collect the appropriate evidence to use in court that prevents a defendent from using a LARPing defense.Which actually makes a tremendous amount of sense. When armed militia members claim all of their organizing&#x2F;preparation is just recreational, and totally unlinked to violence that members do eventually commit, it&#x27;s important to have delineated standards to be able to refute that. reply Jensson 12 hours agoparentIt isn&#x27;t just courts, these are for police officers in general, they say it near the top \"which may be helpful to both law enforcement and prosecutors if suspects of targeted violence claim they were playacting\".These standards will likely make officers go after more genuine LARPers than before. These tips are very problematic if police officers start to follow them, for example:> Role players will not discuss law enforcement concerns on social media or provide guidance to each other if confronted by an officer. Also, they will have no demonstrated interest in criminal cases involving claims of LARP.If police officers are going after LARPers then LARPers will start to talk about what to do in those cases.> The foremost distinction between LARPers and violent extremists is that genuine role players will not care whether others are watching. They may even embrace third-party observation, such as nonplayer characters or a general audience. After all, LARP is a performance.Lots of people are embarrassed to do things in public, a police officer coming across some people LARPing in private shouldn&#x27;t be cause for investigation. reply viscanti 12 hours agorootparent> These standards will likely make officers go after more genuine LARPers than before. These tips are very problematic if police officers start to follow them.It sounds like it might be a dangerous time to LARP about and plan terrorist acts. That could be very problematic for those who enjoy that as a recreational hobby. But in some ways there&#x27;s a precedent for it with flying. Lots of people used to love to LARP about taking a bomb on a plane and that recreational activity has been significantly curtailed. Maybe we&#x27;re heading for a world where it&#x27;s no longer safe to plan the kidnapping of state or national government officials and then practice the steps necessary to carry it out, and where we can no longer joke about a bomb look-alike device that we want to take on airplanes. reply ToValueFunfetti 9 hours agorootparentI have been interested in planning a bank heist (but obviously not following through). It&#x27;s sort of the same motivation for lockpicking, LARPing, or even homesteading- an exploration of the criminal world, the fantasy of being a Ocean&#x27;s 11&#x2F;Clooney type, the (admittedly, likely false) comfort of being able to make a difference if fascists&#x2F;Russia&#x2F;China invaded and took over. I have never given this much thought, as I&#x27;ve assumed this counts as conspiracy to commit a crime or similar.So, counter to your (ironic?) point, I think the existence of this article will make me more likely to explore this avenue- I have a reference for what I would need to do to avoid crossing the line.

Except of course when the victim is Black, and then they switch back to not caring.At the end of the day, a good person can&#x27;t be convinced to engage in terrorism or violence of any kind, whether politically or religiously motivated. The notion that people who wanted to kidnap someone--for the stupidest and most ignoble of reasons--are \"victims\" here is lacks any moral credibility or seriousness.And what&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s whiny, weak, and hypocritical. If you ask those criminals (that&#x27;s all they are) or their supporters whether they think masculinity is in decline and under attack in America, they&#x27;d probably launch into a whole spiel of grievances, yet when it push comes to shove, those guys wanted to be absolved for responsibility for their actions and for the corruption of their own hearts and minds.

When I was a teenager I was working in a shop and a number of people around there had more radical views on the government.

Paintball is not allowed with camouflage or red paint. And then you can legally go to an event on a former military hangar with bunkers and then there is an actual tank and only people in camouflage and realistic looking weapons..So if you would want to create a stealth militia in germany, this would probably be the way to go.And in the events I participated, I knew the orga and I knew they were clearly into LARPing - but with some of the other people who attended, I was not so sure.So I really hope it stays legal as it is a lot of fun, but I also hope it does not go out of hand, as increasingly with covid, there has been some radicalisation in certain groups ...edit: to share an anecdote of why it is interesting to me, aside from the shooting:There was a big event last year, with an apocalyptic setting.

Some are mildly cracked, sometimes harmlessly -- the guy who exclusively played female characters and might have identified as trans had he been born later -- and some not so harmlessly -- the gal who forged her own sword which she took with her everywhere, even the mall, by concealing it under a cape, and genuinely believed she was the last special warrior of some sort from a fictional series.* She believed she was female to signify she was the last.So that may complicate sorting out who is just playing games from who is a genuine threat of planned violence.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elric_of_Melnibon%C3%A9 reply throwaway128128 6 hours agoparentThe FBI is concerned more with the militia-like \"tacticool\" style of LARPing. reply hock_ads_ad_hoc 11 hours agoparentprevI thought there was a “has difficulty differentiating LARP persona from real identity” criteria on the list.

Thus, to avoid really annoying discussions, they prefer no spectators.Components: \"Features of organized gaming (e.g., rules, character sheets, scenario scripts, in- and out-of-character designations)\" vs \"Absence of documented rules, character sheets, scenario scripts, in- and out-of-character designations; all “characters” are frontline fighters or operational support personnel\"There exist LARP system where there exist many rules, but also those where such things are handled in a more \"loose\"&#x2F;\"spontanous\"&#x2F;\"improvisatory\" way.Relationship with law enforcement: \"No concern with law enforcement in out-of-character life\" vs \"Demonstrated concern with law enforcement and prosecutions of similar criminal behavior\"Of course, those who distrust the law enforcement (often for good reasons) are suspicious to be extremists - that is what the FBI claims ;-) . Seriously: there likely exist LARP players with about any possible stance concerning law enforcement.Equipment: \"realistic prop weapons often discouraged in the rules\"It depends on the LARP system whether these are discouraged or encouraged.Personal grievance: \"No personal grievance toward out-group(s) outside the voluntary, fantasy world\" vs \"Personal grievance toward out-group(s) believed to pose an imminent and existential threat, requiring violent action\" and Mood: \"Euthymic and joyful; anticipatory fantasy to enjoy the event\" vs \"Dysphoric and angry; anticipatory fantasy to harm or kill the target(s)\"This depends a lot on the setting of the LARP: of course some cyberpunk, horror or dark-fantasy themed LARP will be much more dark than, say, some high fantasy or utopic science-fiction setting. reply dnd_was_evil 12 hours agoprevRemember when DnD was the cover for a nation wide cult that murdered children by the dozen?Congratulations you&#x27;re as out of touch as our parents were.>Individuals can engage in such activity informally or as part of an organized group.

    "originBody": "UNDERJORD Blog Services Newsletter YouTube Podcasts Elixir Jobs UNPACKING ELIXIR: RESILIENCE 2023-09-24 The nine nines. 99.9999999% of uptime. Whether the AXD301 actually deserves to be held up as a system of nine nines seems debatable. I am not particularly interested in that debate. Erlang has a strong record for reliability and a design intended to help you as a developer and operator achieve your nines. Maybe just five of them. Up to you really. Previous episodes of this article series has unpacked Concurrency, Real-time & Latency and the syntax. In this one we talk about how Elixir and Erlang achieve reliability. There are agressive, defensive and rigorous practices you can adopt in a variety of ways to achieve reliability and resilience. Testing, profiling, specifications, design, observability, culture, operations and so on. This is not about most of those. This is about software abstractions that serve you in making your system more resilient and allow you to construct resilient designs. Erlang implements the Actor model, the typical actor in Erlang and Elixir terminology is the GenServer. The generic server. It is a process that has some nice facilities for receiving calls (“synchronous” messages, expecting a response within a timeout) and casts (asynchronous messages, with no expectation of reply). A GenServer is a bunch of API wrapped around the basic Erlang process. A process can receive and send messages. A GenServer (also other related types, gen_event, gen_statem) implements capturing errors that occur and the subsequent exit and passing information about the problems to the parental process as a message. So what is the parental process. Well it is usually a special type of Erlang process called a Supervisor. A Supervisor can run multiple child processes that implement the necessary API for being a child. The Supervisor then handle problems with the children falling over by applying a strategy. The strategies are normally one_for_one, one_for_all and one_for_rest. One for one indicates that if a child crashes it, it and only it should be considered when restarting. Leave the others alone. One for all means that the supervisor should restart all children if one child fails. This is often useful if the children are sharing a workload in some important way where restarting one would cause trouble with the others. One for rest is kind of nuanced in that the Supervisor will restart any child defined in the starting order after the crashing one. This can be used to kill a supporting process if the main one dies for example. So a Supervisor supervises a set of child processes. This set can be dynamic, growing and shrinking as the system operates. In Elixir that would be a DynamicSupervisor. If a single crash happens within a child it will apply the strategy. If the new child crashes immediately it will try again. If there are enough failures within a given threshold the Supervisor will consider itself failing at the job and crash. This crashing is a feature, not a bug. By crashing it will propagate a signal to whatever Supervisor started this Supervisor that there is an issue. This Supervisor can in turn apply strategies to try and recover the Supervisor through the tried and true practice of turning it off and on again. Or via custom logic if you are feeling spicy. How many restarts, how often, how intense it is allowed to get. That’s all configurable. You might be fine with the defaults but if you have something particular in mind you have a pretty solid set of knobs to twiddle. By having Supervisors supervise Supervisors all the way back to the root Supervisor which sits on top of your particular Erlang application we have defined a supervision tree. The idea being that any issue out in a nice leaf node of a tree is probably addressable there and should not affect the rest of your nice stateful actor-packed system. But if it isn’t, it is probably addressable at a branch closer to the tree. A typical use-case for a Supervisor is a connection pool. And it might be the case that if any of the connections crash that indicates a problem with the server and you know from experience that you might as well re-establish every connection in the pool. Cool. Your Supervisor should do one_for_all. While if a phone-call crashes you probably don’t want to dump out every call in the system just because one had a weird issue. one_for_one should do it. This is where the Erlang “Let it Crash” idea comes from. It is a bit of a meme (often repeated, poorly examined, often misunderstood, sometimes with funny pictures). Fundamentally, if there is nothing useful your code can do on a failure, no mitigation, no meaningful fallback, then you might as well have it blow up and rely on the underlying tree to make whatever is most useful out of it. You should probably handle the usual suspects “oh, data is missing, let’s 404”. That is an expected failure mode. “oh, hard drive has imploded and disk can’t be read” is a very different error and a 500 Internal Server Error is probably fine. I don’t think I’ve seen an up-and-running Elixir application go down due to exhausting the Supervision tree with erroring out. I have seen it many times as a failure mode for a misconfigured deploy, typically missing an env variable, where starting the initial supervision tree fails. Supervision is the fundamental building block in Erlang’s resilience story. How is it used in Elixir? Not much. As in, we don’t typically need to think about it. Phoenix ships a practical and helpful Supervision tree. Ecto ships a good Supervision tree for your database connections and all that. These Supervision trees live a peaceful secretive life under the guise of library code and you get all the advantage with none of the work. And the moment you start coloring outside the lines and building your own GenServers the facilities are there for you. With your regular generated Phoenix web application all you see is that your application.ex file contains a few entries for different purposes. These are the first branches of your supervision tree and all that you really see. You get MyApp.Repo for your Ecto Repo which is the abstraction for all your database connectivity, hiding your connection pools and whatnot. You get MyApp.Endpoint which wraps up your HTTP server (Cowboy or Bandit) in Plug and Phoenix abstractions to respond. Under this you will build up a subtree with a variety of jobs. For HTTP requests you have processes that respond. I believe Cowboy uses a pool and Bandit spawns more ad-hoc. There are also the WebSockets and the specific Phoenix Channels or LiveView processes that belong to the state of your application. This all branches out from your Endpoint as it is all related to your web serving. You can hear more about how Bandit operates on the BEAM Radio episode we did with Mat Trudel. We got into the process usage a decent bit there. Separately you’ll have MyApp.PubSub which starts the Process Groups (pg2) or Redis adapter for doing cool PubSub stuff. This is not strictly web-related, so it has a separate sub-tree. Someone did a thinking. I appreciate that Phoenix doesn’t try to hide this stuff from you any more than abstracting away the details. If you want to run your app without the web part you can quickly get to the idea of dropping the Endpoint from the list. You simply don’t start it. Same with the DB, just cut out the Repo. Likewise if you need multiple DBs or multiple web services. You can make more Repos and Endpoints. It is explicit. The code is right there. It uses the standard Erlang and Elixir way of starting things. Anyway, that’s a detour from resilience and reliability. Fundamentally you have these supervisors, strategies as a structure to contain the blast radius of errors. The places this approach falls down is if you build a native implemented function (NIF) in C or similar. A crash in that brings down the whole VM. This is why doing work in properly managed BEAM code is preferred in most cases and why you’ll often see attempts to re-implement things in Elixir/Erlang rather than just binding to an existing C library. Rust and Rustler, Zig and Zigler both offer NIF implementations with some additional safety. Of course they don’t entirely remove the risks of native code though. Rustler uses dirty schedulers and I expect Zigler does something similar or at least supports the old and the new options for building NIFs. So they should play nice-ish with Erlang scheduling. But fundamentally native code doesn’t quite offer the same safety or same behavior. Beyond Supervision trees there are more aspects of Erlang that are resilient. Scheduling and pre-empting was intended to produce consistently low latencies but it also protects you from heavy workloads bogging things down, it prevents infinitely looping bugs from slowing the system to a crawl and in general makes things resilient to things not being ideal all the time. Another thing is the Erlang heart. That’s a module that can be used to detect the Erlang application itself going down and being able to start it again. An almost-supervisor for your entire application. The IoT Nerves project also uses a variant of this to help ensure a resilient device. Having built in other web frameworks and languages this is all a bit foreign. It is more reminiscent of building a microservice architecture than building a single application. But it does occur at the application level. It gives you tools to think about bringing up your system, bringing down your system, handling failure in your system. Those concerns all exist in other languages but the control-mechanisms tend to be quite coarse. Erlang and Elixir helps you think about how you design your application.

Other systems with traditional threads&#x2F;co-routines&#x2F;green threads can mimic supervision trees, but unless they have isolated heaps and can safely crash at any time never affecting any other processes, it would be hard to achieve the same safety properties.> Scheduling and preempting was intended to produce consistently low latencies but it also protects you from heavy workloads bogging things down, it prevents infinitely looping bugs from slowing the system to a crawl and in general makes things resilient to things not being ideal all the time.Well put. Reliability was one of the initial requirements of Erlang, but soft real-time properties was another one. This is hard to do, but BEAM VM does a great job there. To get this right the VM has to be able to preempt processes, even if they run a tight CPU bound loop. A misbehaving process may not just crash, it could just endlessly recurse, burning CPU cycles, but still shouldn&#x27;t bring the system down.> The strategies are normally one_for_one, one_for_all and one_for_restMinor correction, the last one is rest_for_one https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erlang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;man&#x2F;supervisor.html#supervision-p... reply thruflo 13 hours agoprevOne of the great things about the Elixir ecosystem is that, in so many cases, the libraries you’re using make the appropriate use of supervision trees so you don’t have to.Obviously it depends on what you’re building and you can craft your own supervision structures if you want to. But most of the time you can get the benefits of BEAM resiliency without having to drop down into the details. reply jlouis 55 minutes agoparentThis sort-of stems from the underlying OTP principles from Erlang. Each application has their own isolated supervision tree, and your system contains a number of applications.Hence, a library which contains a service is likely to have their own internal supervision tree. Your code can then sort-of latch onto this tree and piggyback on its existence. This is very common in web applications because when a new connection is opened, you spawn a process to handle the connection. If connections are (de-)multiplexed into channels like in HTTP&#x2F;2 and HTTP&#x2F;3, you&#x27;d just move up one layer and spawn a process per channel.Likewise, if you have a limited resource such as Postgres connections, they are usually maintained in a pool, and access is queued until a connection from the pool is ready for use. This can circumvent the need for something like pg_bouncer in some use-cases. reply pests 12 hours agoparentprevThe one thing I dislike about Elixir is the confusion caused by how some libraries execute their functionality in-process and others spawn a supervision tree and message pass - putting your work in a possible queue that can get overloaded.Its a common pitfall for more inexperienced devs and I think its just a symptom of the language conventions.Everyone is taught genservers with a client-side API existing inside the same module as handle_ functions and it blurs the distiction some.I think if the convention was to create a separate module to implement the client-side convenience functions then the client-server split would be more obvious. reply lawik 6 hours agorootparentYeah, there are a few common mistakes that can get really troublesome when library authors make them. Assuming how you want to structure execution (by using GenServers in the library usually). Another one is only one instance of config. Meaning if you have a plan to use the library for multiple distinct activities or with multiple accounts, you have trouble.Both simple config and GenServers have their place in libraries. But if a library doesn&#x27;t expose the fundamentals it gets gnarly quickly. reply anonymousDan 2 hours agorootparentprevWhen you say &#x27;execute their functionality in-process&#x27;, what exactly do you mean?

I&#x27;m not sure separating the client and API logic in tutorials would necessarily stop them from doing this. People who are hellbent on shoehorning familiar idioms into an unfamiliar language are going to do so regardless. But I see what you&#x27;re saying.I think it&#x27;s more important to drill home that modules and processes have nothing to do with each other. I still catch myself conflating them once in a while three years in and it&#x27;s caused the most confusion while trying to teach friends (although I&#x27;m not a particularly good teacher). reply cgio 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is an allowed practice, just not idiomatic, mostly following on Erlang convention I think. If you do the coding gnome elixir course, he quite explicitly has a section on this and proceeds with separating API from server. At the end of the day, it is equivalent and all it takes is getting used to one or the other. I would argue spending the time to get used to the idiomatic way a community establishes is to your benefit in the end. reply jlouis 48 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s an Erlang convention. Erlang suffers from having a very rudimentary module system, so a clean separation between the public API and the gen_server API isn&#x27;t that easy to make. If you have access to a better module system, you should definitely induce a cleaner separation and adapt that as a convention. It helps people in general, but the in particular the less experienced. reply pests 11 hours agorootparentprevI agree and love Elixir and use it daily. I think my downvotes above is really strange lmao. This is just a common footgun I see new developers struggle with. reply sodapopcan 11 hours agorootparentMy guess re: downvotes is the wording. The opening sort of reads like you have written-off Elixir entirely because of this one issue. That was the impression I got, at least, though I was able to figure out that wasn&#x27;t the case before I responded. reply jongjong 7 hours agorootparentprevI feel like Elixir get pushed too hard on people. Makes me skeptical. Same way I feel about TypeScript community. Calm down, it&#x27;s just a programming language.I don&#x27;t believe the programming language matters much. What matters is one&#x27;s familiarity with it. There are good tools and frameworks available for just about any moderately popular language. Every language has caveats. Every language has lots of pros and cons and when you average them out, they&#x27;re essentially all the same.Just a matter of personal preferences and habits. reply weatherlight 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just a programming language—it&#x27;s an entire philosophy centered around fault tolerance and concurrency, thanks to its foundation on the Erlang VM. While Elixir&#x27;s syntax and features are certainly appealing, the real power lies in its integration with the Erlang VM. When people praise Elixir, a significant portion of that praise is directed at the capabilities you get with OTP&#x2F;BEAM right out of the box. These include robustness, distribution, and real-time processing, which are not as readily available or as mature in other ecosystems. the Erlang VM is 38+ years old. replysriram_sun 13 hours agoprevNice article! FTA: \"One for one indicates that if a child crashes it, it and only it should be considered when restarting.\" What is \"it\" in this context? reply jlouis 1 hour agoparentThe one_for_one policy means that if a child process terminates, it will get restarted. It is appropriate when the child processes managed by the supervisor are (relatively) independent. The contrasting policy is one_for_all where a terminating child will also induce a restart of all the other children of the supervisor. This is appropriate when there&#x27;s a number of important dependencies between the children processes, and you&#x27;d better just rebuild the whole subtree.It is key to run the thought process of system failure. You need to understand what will happen if a certain part of your system errors out in an unforeseen way and make sure your restart policies are likely to right the ship. reply actionfromafar 12 hours agoparentprevThe should be a first comma after “crashes” IMHO. reply amilner42 12 hours agoparentprev“It” is the child.So if the supervisor (“parent”) has other children, they won’t be restarted reply ecmascript 2 hours agoprevThe thing about Elixir resilience is that it takes experience to fully appreciate what it does and realize that in a web app, the actual use case when this becomes important is not that often to be totally honest.I can give an example where this could be useful, I once worked on a node-app that couldn&#x27;t use clustering mode because reasons and we only had 1 server running this particular piece of code. It turned out that we had a bug that made the node app crash whenever a user posted some invalid data. The problem here was that the app itself was a SPA and the users could just keep on posting even if it failed and they did in frustration.So then app crashed and took a few seconds to reload, then crashed again. This mean that the entire api went down while the user was posting and thus could not respond to any other requests. This would never happen in Elixir and the load would just continue being ok even if 100 users at the same time would keep posting bad data.The bad thing about Elixir resilience is that it is only applied to application logic. The rest of the time shit can go wrong is just the same as any other app since most elixir projects use the same kind of tooling (postgres, some web server in front etc). Not that many seems to use the built in mnesia database, no downtime deployment etc. The BEAM comes with many cool feature in theory but very few actually utilizes them so this 99.99999% uptime rarely comes into effect. The amount of time I&#x27;ve had downtime on apps because of things in the application logic like the first story I mentioned has been very, very few and most of the time it&#x27;s something else entirely and that thing does Elixir not really help with most of the time.Sure you could utilize all the cool features of the BEAM but it seems like in the absolute majority of cases the amount of work is simply too great for it to be worth the time investment required. reply nighmi 13 hours agoprev [–] Elixir seems to be picking up insane steam right now.

I think Erlang appeals to the CS-interested, Elixir appeals to a lot of Ruby and startup folks. The ecosystem also innovates a decent bit. I think it punches above its weight on the HN front page.It is a healthy ecosystem and seems to grow.(edit: a spelling) reply bicx 8 hours agoparentprevI built a fintech backend system using Eljxir a few years ago, and I loved it. However, I had to use Go and Python as a sort of escape hatch when companies offered massively time-saving SDKs in those languages but not Elixir. The ecosystem doesn’t seem to have really grown much since then. Looking around at the state of things, lots of important OSS packages have not been maintained, and that’s concerning. I absolutely love Elixir and the careful thought put into so much of the language and primary frameworks. However, I have become more skeptical that the actual ecosystem will hit critical mass. I really wish it would. I see a lot of articles on HN about Elixir, but my feeling is that it’s just more interesting than the constant stream of JS and Python we’ve had for decades now. reply conradfr 3 minutes agorootparentElixir is one language where you can find a library on Github that has not been updated in 6 years but will work flawlessly.I actually do small PRs to update deps etc on those kinds of repo and people are usually are OK to merge. reply ch4s3 6 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience a lot of OSS elixir libraries are basically done.

It&#x27;s been a real pleasure to work with after years of React and Next.js. The main thing I miss are types though. reply actionfromafar 12 hours agorootparentAre there no typed languages on BEAM?Or some Typescript style front for Elixir? reply jerf 10 hours agorootparentBEAM is pretty deeply untyped due to its fundamentally untyped [1] communication protocol. There&#x27;s some logical reasoning behind this choice, which is that by not having a typed communication protocol, it can defer handling mismatched types to the application layer. Since it is deeply designed with the knowledge that it will be used in a clustered context and that it is inevitable that there will be version mismatches within a cluster (during upgrade if nothing else since simultaneous anything is impossible within a cluster, including upgrades), this is a somewhat reasonable compromise approach to the problem. If you do add typing on top of BEAM you still need some sort of solution to this problem with will probably have some sort \"unsafe\" equivalent.[1]: In the sense you mean here, anyhow. It has a selection of atomic types, int, list, tuple, etc., but there&#x27;s no \"user\" types as one would have a strong typing system for. It&#x27;s not an exact match but if you imagined a programming language that had nothing but JSON, not Javascript, Javascript has user types, literally just JSON as your underlying data model, you get pretty close to BEAM&#x2F;Erlang. reply pawelduda 11 hours agorootparentprevTypes in Elixir are on the roadmap [1] but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s concrete ETAFor now you have typespecs and dialyzer that tries to infer types and detect incorrect assumptions in code but I found it cumbersome to work with. Testing in Elixir is first class so I prefer that for now. You get doctests (documentation that is also a runnable test), like in Python, which I find very useful when looking at some package source.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;giYbq4HmfGA?si=BjNyOc5cjWWA7ER6 reply lkurusa 12 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;gleam.run&#x2F; Gleam is super promising. reply bryanrasmussen 1 hour agorootparentwhy would you use Gleam instead of Elixir, is there any benefit to using both of them? reply bryanrasmussen 1 hour agorootparentah ok, reading more compiles to JavaScript, generates typescript definitions, can reuse code from all Beam supported languages.So maybe Gleam as an easier way to integrate JS and Erlang &#x2F; Elixir? reply cpursley 10 hours agorootparentprevI’ve found that function head pattern matching and guards get you very close to the benefits of types. reply Thaxll 10 hours agorootparentprevElixir gets a lot of praise but very rarely mention that is&#x27;t a dynamically typed language, people will talk about Dialyzer&#x2F;type hints but it&#x27;s vastly inferior to strongly typed language. reply sodapopcan 9 hours agorootparentI know people mean different things when they say this but Elixir is strongly typed in that it doesn&#x27;t auto-cast. Furthermore, it goes farther than most languages in that it doesn&#x27;t overload many operators. For example, string concatenation is done with ``, not `+`. This rules out many of those \"subtle bugs\" you would get in many other dynamic langues. For instance: `def compound_word(left, right), do: leftright`. Even though there are no types specified (or even patterns of guards) this function can only every succeed with strings. Yes, it&#x27;s still dynamic and will only be caught at runtime, but there are things about Elixir that make it a really nice dynamic language. reply impulser_ 9 hours agorootparentprevPython gets a lot of praise too despite being a dynamically typed language.

Wonder how clojure compares to elixir in terms of developer productivity reply julienmarie 11 hours agoparentprevBeen running our tech stack on Elixir for the last 3 years. I&#x27;m the owner of a small e-commerce company where I&#x27;m the only tech person (and also the ceo so I can only spend 20% of my time on tech).Why I love it:- The mental model just clicks for me. The syntax is really simple and the semantics are consistent. There is no abstraction. It&#x27;s all about processing data.- The REPL (IEX) is way more than a REPL. It&#x27;s \"you inside your running program\". You can poke around your code, draft it, debug it, right there. You can fire it on prod to understand a bug. Or use LiveBook, think of it like the Elixir version of Jupyter notebooks that can connect to your application.- Real life performance is great, not because of speed but because of concurrency.- The whole developer experience is great. Mix (the build tool, dependency manager, etc.) is simple, awesome. Dependencies are really rarely an issue.- It&#x27;s rock solid. In 3 years, I never had one downtime.- LiveView is a god send. Not having to switch language for UI work is amazing, performance is great, and it&#x27;s server side HTML which is amazing for SEO. My website is 99 on lighthouse without any crazy work.- You need heavy computation and performance on some parts? Use rust, via rustler.- You need to scale to multiple servers? It is distributed. Already. Just make sure to not have anti-patterns in your code.- But the real kicker it&#x27;s in its power due to the OTP platform. I think it&#x27;s quite complex to grasp how much it&#x27;s powerful when you haven&#x27;t experienced it. Need to batch insert statements or rate limit api calls to a 3rd party service who can only accept one call per second per channel? A working simple solution is only 20 lines of code. Need to launch many different workflows running concurrently, keeping their state, recovering when crashing? 100 lines.The exciting developments:- Elixir NX ecosystem (NX, Bumblebee, etc): running and training AI models directly in Elixir, in a distributed way.- Liveview Native and Elixir Desktop: two big initiative to bring Elixir to Desktop and Mobile applications.- Gradual Typesystem. Jose Valim, the creator of Elixir, is working on that right now. I really liked the approach of set-theoretic types and the pragmatism of the approach. Hopefully it will be released in the not too distant future.The \"to improve\":I have the feeling that the platform (OTP) being the killer app per se of Elixir, the whole marketing of the ecosystem if 100% targeted towards developers. Which is good in many ways. But for the ecosystem to grow I think more initiatives towards business-type applications would be welcome. By example, there is only a few payment gateways libraries existing which is for me a sign of the lack of business audience.Conclusion: Elixir made me a better developer, but most importantly a really productive one. reply anoy8888 8 hours agorootparentSome dumb questions: for liveview web &#x2F; liveview native, is it possible to save rendered code offline and every time it connects to server , it will first check a defined version number ,if the version changes , it will update the code. If the the version is the same or if there is no internet connection, it will use stored code. Perhaps Elixi can be used this way for offline apps while maintaining the dynamic server rendering feature reply abrookewood 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that would work - with Liveview the code is on the server and only the rendered HTML (or the dynamic changes) are sent to the client.

Photograph: Keegan Barber/AP Nicola Davis and Maya Yang Sun 24 Sep 2023 23.13 BST Show key events only 12h ago 23.09 BST Closing summary It is slightly past 4pm in Utah, where the historic sample capsule from Nasa’s Osiris-Rex mission carrying samples from the asteroid Bennu landed earlier this morning. Here is a wrap-up of the day’s key events: The sample capsule arrived at the highly secured clean-room facility in Utah following its landing earlier this morning in the desert. This significant moment marks the successful delivery from the Utah desert into the clean room, and of course the 1.2bn-mile journey from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth. Mission members also obtained samples from the surrounding area of the landing zone. Nasa TV showed scientists taking photos around the landing zone as well as measuring air and gas levels. Sir Brian May, of Queen, has told Nasa TV he is “immensely proud” to be an Osiris-Rex mission team member. May was among those who helped to identify the location on Bennu where the samples would be collected. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson hailed the Osiris-Rex mission’s success following its capsule’s landing in the Utah desert today. “This mission proves that Nassa does big things, things that have inspired us, things that unite us,” he said. By studying the samples from Bennu, scientists can compare their results against the data they obtained from instruments on board the spacecraft. This “ground-truthing” means they can then calibrate the latter, allowing them to more accurately explore differences in composition across the surface of Bennu. “What an incredible day this has been,” said Lori Glaze, director of Nasa’s planetary science division. “These types of samples, they are truly the gifts that keep on giving. They are a treasure and this mission Osiris-Rex is kicking off a decade of sample return,” she added. “We’re going to start processing that sample we hope as early as Tuesday of next week,” said Osiris-Rex principal investigator Dante Lauretta. “We don’t want biological organisms interacting with this so we plan to exclude it from any contact with bacteria or anything else that might compromise our scientific investigation.” “When they took the back shell off, it was extremely clean on the inside. It was remarkably similar to prior to launch,” said Nasa chief scientist Eileen Stansbery. “The spacecraft itself must have worked extraordinarily well.” Scientists say that they expect to have a “pretty good idea of what the nature of the collection is” by 14 October. They added that one of the key scientific objectives for the sample analysis program is to characterize its thermal properties. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. Updated at 23.13 BST 13h ago 22.52 BST “What we’re really looking for is that hypothesis one … did we accurately characterize the mineralogy and chemistry of the surface of the asteroid?” said Lauretta. “Did our remote sensing instruments work and did our data processing lead us to the right conclusions?” he continued. Updated at 22.56 BST 13h ago 22.50 BST “One of the key scientific objectives for our sample analysis program is to characterize the thermal properties,” said Osiris-Rex principal investigator Dante Lauretta. He added that the mission team is working alongside partners at the University of Arizona, as well as partners in Japan and Canada to “measure thermal conductivity, thermal skin depth and bulk density, and other key parameters that will feed into understanding the thermal inertia.” Updated at 22.51 BST 13h ago 22.44 BST “The Utah Test and Training Range is an amazing place to land a sample,” said Mike Moreau, Osiris-Rex recovery lead at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “It’s very flat, it’s free of hazards, and they have these amazing tracking resources here,” he added. Updated at 22.46 BST 13h ago 22.41 BST “The reason why we should be investing our taxpayer dollars in these missions of exploration – of course, the science is fantastic, the engineering is beyond amazing – but the inspirational value is really where the long-term payoff comes from these,” said Lauretta. “This is about the future generations,” the Osiris-Rex principal investigator continued. “I teach undergraduate and graduate students, and so many of them said, ‘We are here because of Osiris-Rex, we came to Tucson because the Osiris-Rex mission was based here.’ “It was just an amazing example of what people can do when we put aside our differences and focus on a common goal. We can achieve great things – this country can achieve great things but we have to work together to make that happen,” he said. Updated at 22.45 BST 13h ago 22.39 BST “Did we bring back what we thought or is it something completely different? Knowing Bennu, it might be a little both, so I can’t wait to see that,” said Lauretta. He added that he expects to have a “pretty good idea of what the nature of the collection is” by 14 October. Updated at 22.41 BST 13h ago 22.36 BST “It’s the end of a journey and the beginning of a new one because we’re going into the atomic realm,” added Lauretta. “We’re going into the mineralogy, the chemistry, the organics and the history of the solar system, which is what I signed up for all those years ago,” he said. “I’m getting really excited about getting into the lab and really digging into the samples and answering all the questions that have come up before we launch and especially from our encounter with asteroid Bennu … A lot of new science ideas came out of that,” he added. 13h ago 22.32 BST Osiris-Rex principal investigator Dante Lauretta on sample capsule landing: 'I literally broke into tears' “I literally broke into tears,” said Dante Lauretta, Osiris-Rex principal investigator, as he described the moment the main chute opened. “I knew we made it home … It was overwhelming relief, gratitude … and really trying to convince myself that I wasn’t dreaming, that it was actually happening, that the chute was open, that the capsule was coming down and we got that science treasure in hand,” he added. Updated at 22.36 BST 13h ago 22.25 BST Nasa chief scientist Eileen Stansbery on canister condition: 'It was extremely clean on the inside' “The engineering team today is documenting the handling, ensuring that we understand the environment that the science canister is in and making way for the next generation of understanding a new world,” added Stansbery. “When they took the back shell off, it was extremely clean on the inside. It was remarkably similar to prior to launch. It makes you wonder: did we actually open it up at some point? But I know we opened it,” she said. “The spacecraft itself must have worked extraordinarily well, that all of the engineering that went in to ensure that the … canister was going to remain clean, did their job,” she added. Updated at 22.29 BST 13h ago 22.22 BST “These samples are an amazing treasure trove for generations,” said Eileen Stansbery, chief scientist at Nasa’s Johnson Space Center. “The entry into the clean room has gone extremely well. They’re processing the capsule, removing portions of the canister so that they can get a continuous flow of nitrogen into the sample canister to ensure that there is no contamination from the Earth’s atmosphere into that canister and maintain the pristine entity of the samples.” She added that once the sample capsule is processed through the clean room, 200-plus people all over world can start studying the samples. “The curatorial team at the Johnson Space Center is working hand in glove with the spacecraft engineering team and the science team to ensure that we are processing and handling this sample return capsule in a measured, methodical, well-choreographed sequence,” she said. Updated at 22.24 BST 13h ago 22.17 BST “This capsule literally has a personality and it understood the assignment,” said Tim Priser, chief engineer for deep space exploration at Lockheed Martin. “It’s the best job an engineer could ever have, to help a scientist go gather this knowledge. It just is so thrilling and rewarding,” he said. “Today, Osiris-Rex, not only four hours before entry, did she understand the assignment and put this sample return capsule on a path to hit an entry interface that needed to be so precise that you didn’t skip out of the atmosphere, or you hit it too deep and you burned up before you had a chance to get to the ground. So she did that flawlessly,” he added. Updated at 22.26 BST 13h ago 22.12 BST “We don’t want biological organisms interacting with this so we plan to exclude it from any contact with bacteria or anything else that might compromise our scientific investigation,” said Osiris-Rex principal investigator Dante Lauretta. “We’re going to start processing that sample we hope as early as Tuesday of next week,” he said. Updated at 22.27 BST 13h ago 22.10 BST “It was pulse pounding, I’m sure for you watching it, even more for those of us in the helicopters, waiting for that main shoot to come out,” said Dante Lauretta, the Osiris-Rex principal investigator who was part of the recovery team. “We were with bated breath, making sure that we came down for a nice soft landing in the Utah desert, and it worked spectacularly well … It didn’t roll, didn’t bounce. It just made a tiny little divot in the Utah soil. So for the environmental sampling team, that was great,” he said. “I couldn’t be more proud. And just to remind you, not only did we bring this mission in on schedule, under budget and delivered more science than we had ever thought was possible with the encounter with Bennu, but we think we’ve got a lot of sample in that canister,” he continued. Updated at 22.28 BST 13h ago 22.06 BST “What an incredible day this has been,” said Lori Glaze, director of Nasa’s planetary science division. “These types of samples, they are truly the gifts that keep on giving. They are a treasure and this mission Osiris-Rex is kicking off a decade of sample return,” she added. “Those [samples] are going to be a treasure for scientific analysis for years and years to come to our kids and our grandkids and people who haven’t even been born yet,” she continued. Updated at 22.10 BST 14h ago 21.50 BST Nasa to hold press conference shortly on historic sample capsule landing Hello blog readers, Welcome back! Nasa is set to hold a press conference at around 5pm ET on the historic sample capsule landing from Nasa’s Osiris-Rex mission earlier today. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates from the press conference. 17h ago 18.33 BST Interim Summary Here is a look at where things currently stand: The sample capsule has arrived at the highly-secured clean room facility in Utah following its landing earlier this morning in the desert. This significant moment marks the successful delivery from the Utah desert into the clean room, and of course the 1.2 billion-mile journey from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth. Mission members also obtained samples from the surrounding area of the landing zone. Nasa TV showed scientists taking photos around the landing zone as well as measuring air and gas levels.

Have you ever wanted to use your Kindle Paperwhite to write, even more, with a vim-like editor? This is what PiWrite is for. How? The TL;DR is a webserver running somewhere a keyboard can be plugged, and a page opened in the Kindle's web browser. The not-so-short version requires more effort and details, but is the UX I wanted to get: A Raspberry Pi Zero W… Paired with a Bluetooth keyboard… Set up in access point mode… With this package installed… And configured to start automatically on boot. Why? I was inspired by SolarWriter by Michael Solomon. I had always wanted to use my Kindle for writing. SolarWriter solves that by setting up a local web server on your phone (iOS or Android), then you type with a Bluetooth keyboard paired with it. But you need to set up hotspot, keep your screen on… I didn't like those parts. So I wrote this. Contributions? This is open source, and I'll be happy to see it extended and improved. But I'm unlikely to accept contributions: I want a reduced feature set, with only what I need. This is why I didn't release this to PyPI, so anybody can have its own version with custom tweaks and installs it easily from their own repository. Installing the package With a current enough version of pip you can install directly from the repository (or from your fork) with pip install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite Or with pipx (recommended) with pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite You might need to add /home/YOU/.local/bin to your PATH (like adding export PATH=\"/home/YOU/.local/bin:$PATH\" at the end of your .bashrc, .zshenv or similar). Trying it before installing Once you have installed it you can try it locally (by default it will serve back at 127.0.0.1:80), and optionally configure host and port, like: PIWRITE_HOST=pi PIWRITE_PORT=31415 Point your web browser to this address and try! The editor is vim inspired, and the instructions can be found in help Setting up your Raspberry Pi Zero If you need a Pi, I can't recommend Pimoroni enough. I'm not affiliated, I just buy always from them. The instructions below may be missing some piece, I have written it based on my bash history and what I remember having to tweak. With the information of what you need to do, there are plenty of tutorials on how to approach each step though. Basics Best is installing a lightweight Raspbian version, since the Zero is not a terribly fast machine. By \"mistake\" (I was trying something) I updated the lite version (on Buster, I think) to Bookworm. Don't do that, not needed. To configure everything you will need to set up the Raspberry for ssh access, and better with password. For using it as a \"magical thing that lets the Kindle work as a text editor\" is better if you disable requiring password for logging in via tty. You can enable this (known as autologin) by running sudo raspi-config, in the System Options section. You specifically want Console autologin. You also better set up wifi connectivity too. You can set this up by adding a wpa_supplicant.conf file to the boot partition of the SD card with contents like the following: network={ ssid=\"YOUR_NETWORK_NAME\" psk=\"YOUR_PASSWORD\" key_mgmt=WPA-PSK } Steps needed after this: Pair with a Bluetooth keyboard; Set up a wireless access point on your Raspberry; Install the package and set it up; Nice-to-have: ssh via USB (there are many tutorials for this). Pairing with a Bluetooth keyboard Pick your poison. The standard way is using bluetoothctl. I found that installing Bluetuith was more convenient to be sure the pairing had worked. On the con side, you need to install the whole Go runtime. Remember: the keyboard will be usable in the tty session, not in any ssh-initiated session. If you want any fancy keyboard configuration (I use Colemak, and like my caps to be control) you will have to edit /etc/default/keyboard and add something like the following: XKBMODEL=\"pc105\" XKBLAYOUT=\"us\" XKBVARIANT=\"colemak\" XKBOPTIONS=\"ctrl:nocaps\" Wireless access point I followed the instructions from here: Turn a Raspberry Pi into a Web Server with Its Own Wifi Network (Tech Note). From these instructions, you can (optionally) skip the routing stuff for this. Although the post mentions only working in Buster, I followed the exact same steps and worked just fine in Bookworm. The TL;DR version: Get the access point and DNS services sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq Turn it on sudo systemctl unmask hostapd sudo systemctl enable hostapd Edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf (sudo) and add at the end interface wlan0 static ip_address=192.168.11.1/24 nohook wpa_supplicant Important When you want to re-connect your Zero to your wifi, you need to comment this out, otherwise you are out of AP access and out of SSH via Wifi (or even USB gadget) access. If you forget, you'll need to edit the raw disk from another Linux device. You now need to configure /etc/dnsmasq.conf with interface=wlan0 # Listening interface dhcp-range=192.168.11.2,192.168.11.20,255.255.255.0,24h # Pool of IP addresses served via DHCP domain=write # Local wireless DNS domain address=/pi/192.168.11.1 # Alias for this router and now that you are at it, change /etc/hostname to be pi. Finally, configure /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf with (use your country code, of course) country_code=CH interface=wlan0 ssid=EnchantedRose hw_mode=g channel=7 macaddr_acl=0 auth_algs=1 ignore_broadcast_ssid=0 wpa=2 wpa_passphrase=CHOOSE SOMETHING wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK wpa_pairwise=TKIP rsn_pairwise=CCMP Now, reboot (sudo shutdown -r now or sudo systemctl reboot). If you ever want to disable AP and enable normal wifi, run sudo systemctl disable hostapd dnsmasq AND remove the static IP setting mentioned above. Install the package and set it up Install pipx with sudo apt install pipx and then install piwrite with pipx install piwrite@git+https://github.com/rberenguel/PiWrite You'll want to add pipx's binaries to the path, for example by adding export PATH=\"/home/YOU/.local/bin:$PATH\". Since the ideal experience is not having to add a port in the Kindle browser, the default port piwrite uses is 80. But that needs allowlisting: sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/bin/python3.11 Tweak the Python version depending on what you have. You can test if it works (i.e.. if it is the right version or not) or not by starting piwrite now (you may need to change the exported host). You'll also want to start piwrite on tty user start, you can do this by adding the following to the end of your .profile export PIWRITE_HOST=pi.write # or pi, if it's not under the access point piwrite Some oddities The Kindle browser is weird and does not support everything. No websockets, only longpolling (or so it seems). For some reason, only version 3.0 of the socketio JavaScript libraries worked correctly. I found no way to get the Kindle browser to rotate the whole page via CSS so I could have a landscape view. My first trial implementation tried using pynvim (the NeoVim API layer) as the underlying editor. That would have been awesome, real vim! But it didn't work for obscure reasons (I had to do some unholy things with asyncio that caused it to explode easily). Development I wrote half of this directly on the Zero from my iPad, using Blink to SSH into it. The second half, I wrote it on my iPad with iVim, ish and Inspect Browser. The finishing touches (moving to Poetry and cleaning up), on my Mac. For local development, you can then use basically anything. Just choose a valid port for your system and make sure the host is valid. 127.0.0.1 is the default choice and the one that should work.

There may be an avenue for that. A few days ago I submitted my Raspberry Pi Pico W Host MQTT Numpad project to Hacker News, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t gain any traction. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;baiyibai&#x2F;pico-w-usb-host-mqtt-numpad. I detail some of the developments on USB Host mode. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be native MicroPython support for USB Host mode yet. I did find a project which seems to to load the pico-pio-sdk as a library and use a GamePad for input: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danjperron&#x2F;pico4legsBotAlso, about a year, I wrote down some of the requirements for an e-paper RPI Pico-based e-ink writer in a comment.

The next question is whether one could ditch the webserver-based approach and interface an e-paper screen directly to the RP2040. Waveshare offers MicroPython libraries for their e-paper displays.

    "originLink": "https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/24/tcp_congestion_control_internet/",
    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP NETWORKS How TCP's congestion control saved the internet 20 We guess it's OK it did Bruce Davie Sun 24 Sep 2023 // 14:15 UTC SYSTEMS APPROACH With the annual SIGCOMM conference taking place this month, we observed that congestion control still gets an hour in the program, 35 years after the first paper on TCP congestion control was published. So it seems like a good time to appreciate just how much the success of the internet has depended on its approach to managing congestion. Following my recent talk and article on 60 years of networking, which focused almost entirely on the internet and ARPANET, I received quite a few comments about various networking technologies that were competing for ascendancy at the same time. These included the OSI stack (anyone remember CLNP and TP4?), the Coloured Book protocols (including the Cambridge Ring), and of course ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) which was actually the first networking protocol on which I worked in depth. It’s hard to fathom now, but in the 1980s I was one of many people who thought that ATM might be the packet switching technology to take over the world. I rate congestion control as one of the key factors that enabled the internet to progress from moderate to global scale ATM proponents used to refer to existing technologies such as Ethernet and TCP/IP as “legacy” protocols that could, if necessary, be carried over the global ATM network once it was established. One of my fond memories from those days is of Steve Deering (a pioneer of IP networking) boldly (and correctly) stating that ATM would never be successful enough to even be a legacy protocol. One reason I skipped over these other protocols when earlier retelling the history of networking was simply to save space – it’s a little-known fact that my Systems Approach colleague Larry Peterson and I aim for brevity, especially since receiving a one-star review on Amazon that called our book “a wall of text.” But I was also focused on how we got to the internet of today, where TCP/IP has effectively out-competed other protocol suites to achieve global (or near-global) penetration. There are many theories about why TCP/IP was more successful than its contemporaries, and they are not readily testable. Most likely, there were many factors that played into the success of the internet protocols. But I rate congestion control as one of the key factors that enabled the internet to progress from moderate to global scale. It is also an interesting study in how the particular architectural choices made in the 1970s proved themselves over the subsequent decades. Distributed resource management In David Clark’s paper [PDF] “The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols,\" a stated design goal is: “The internet architecture must permit distributed management of its resources.” There are many different implications of that goal, but the way that Jacobson and Karels [PDF] first implemented congestion control in TCP is a good example of taking that principle to heart. Their approach also embraces another design goal of the internet: accommodate many different types of networks. Taken together, these principles pretty much rule out the possibility of any sort of network-based admission control, a sharp contrast to networks such as ATM, which assumed that a request for resources would be made from an end-system to the network before data could flow. Part of the “accommodate many types of networks” philosophy is that you can’t assume that all networks have admission control. Couple that with distributed management of resources and you end up with congestion control being something that end-systems have to handle, which is exactly what Jacobson and Karels did with their initial changes to TCP. We’re trying to get millions of end-systems to cooperatively share the bandwidth of bottleneck links in some fair way The history of TCP congestion control is long enough to fill a book (and we did) but the work done at Berkeley from 1986 to 1998 casts a long shadow, with Jacobson’s 1988 SIGCOMM paper ranking among the most cited networking papers of all time. Slow-start, AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease), RTT estimation, and the use of packet loss as a congestion signal were all in that paper, laying the groundwork for the following decades of congestion control research. One reason for that paper's influence, I believe, is that the foundation it laid was solid, while it left plenty of room for future improvements–as we see in the continued efforts to improve congestion control today. And the problem is fundamentally hard: we’re trying to get millions of end-systems that have no direct contact with each other to cooperatively share the bandwidth of bottleneck links in some moderately fair way using only the information that can be gleaned by sending packets into the network and observing when and whether they reach their destination. As fans of decentralization, we’ve moved our social media home to Mastodon. If you need any further reason to get off X/Twitter, this may help. And you can read how Mastodon is \"rewinding the clock on social media — in a good way.\" Meanwhile, Emily Bender has a new paper [PDF] on the role of LLMs in information retrieval, making a compelling case that generative AI may not be what you want in a search engine. And given our interest in network verification, we were pleased to see this paper on experience with Batfish at SIGCOMM this month. Arguably one of the biggest leaps forward after 1988 was the realization by Brakmo and Peterson (yes, that guy) that packet loss wasn't the only signal of congestion: so too was increasing delay. This was the basis for the 1994 TCP Vegas paper, and the idea of using delay rather than loss alone was quite controversial at the time. However, Vegas kicked off a new trend in congestion control research, inspiring many other efforts to take delay into account as an early indicator of congestion before loss occurs. Data center TCP (DCTCP) and Google’s BBR are two examples. One reason that I give credit to congestion control algorithms in explaining the success of the internet is that the path to failure of the internet was clearly on display in 1986. Jacobson describes some of the early congestion collapse episodes, which saw throughput fall by three orders of magnitude. When I joined Cisco in 1995 we were still hearing customer stories about catastrophic congestion episodes. The same year Bob Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet and recent Turing Award winner, famously predicted that the internet would collapse as consumer internet access and the rise of the web drove rapid growth in traffic. It didn’t. Congestion control has continued to evolve, with the QUIC protocol, for example, offering both better mechanisms for detecting congestion and the option of experimenting with multiple congestion control algorithms. And some congestion control has moved into the application layer, eg: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). Why securing East-West network traffic is so important – and how it can be done Building your own private 5G is as easy as Wi-Fi If you need a TCP replacement, you won't find a QUIC one The internet's edge routers are all so different. What if we unified them with software? An interesting side effect of the congestion episodes of the 1980s and 1990s was that we observed that small buffers were sometimes the cause of congestion collapse. An influential paper by Villamizar and Song showed that TCP performance dropped when the amount of buffering was less than the average delay × bandwidth product of the flows. Unfortunately, the result only held for very small numbers of flows (as was acknowledged in the paper) but it was widely interpreted as an inviolable rule that influenced the next several years of router design. This was finally debunked by the buffer sizing work of Appenzeller et al in 2004, but not before the unfortunate phenomenon of Bufferbloat – truly excessive buffer sizes leading to massive queuing delays – had made it into millions of low-end routers. The self-test for Bufferbloat in your home network is worth a look. So, while we don’t get to go back and run controlled experiments to see exactly how the internet came to succeed while other protocol suites fell by the wayside, we can at least see that the internet avoided potential failure because of the timely way congestion control was added. It was relatively easy in 1986 to experiment with new ideas by tweaking the code in a couple of end-systems, and then push the effective solution out to a wide set of systems. Nothing inside the network had to change. It almost certainly helped that the set of operating systems that needed to be changed and the community of people who could make those changes was small enough to see widespread deployment of the initial BSD-based algorithms of Jacobson and Karels. It seems clear that there is no such thing as the perfect congestion control approach, which is why we continue to see new papers on the topic 35 years after Jacobson’s. But the internet's architecture has fostered the environment in which effective solutions can be tested and deployed to achieve distributed management of shared resources. In my view that’s a great testament to the quality of that architecture. ® Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie are the authors of Computer Networks: A Systems Approach and the related Systems Approach series of books.

We really don&#x27;t know what to do about congestion in the middle of a pure datagram network. What saved the Internet was cheap fiber backbones. If backbone bandwidth had remained expensive, this would never have worked.When I was working on congestion in the early 1980s, our goal was to run at about 70% long haul link utilization. We would back off quite a bit if things got anywhere near saturation. This was fine with the DoD people who funded us. They wanted reliability under stress, not maximum performance at minimum cost. Much of the work on congestion since then has involved trying to squeeze out that last 30%, at the cost of much-increased complexity.The \"bufferbloat\" mess is embarrassing. If you use FIFO queuing into a bandwidth choke point, latency is going to go way up. This is well known. It is still ignored in most cheap routers. Every home router feeding limited bandwidth should have outbound fair queuing.

This was the big win. At that point, the only question was TCP&#x2F;IP or IPX&#x2F;SPX (Novell).You could use Ethernet to hook a couple computers in a room together directly and it worked (mostly). Every other technology required some expensive thing to sit in the middle and direct it all.Then, when you needed to connect a couple rooms together, you could throw a cable over a wall and hook them together.Finally, when you got tired of debugging the inevitable continuous failures due to the \"idiots in that one room\", you threw an Ethernet hub into the mix to hook the rooms together. This was a bit more expensive, but still not as expensive as the idiotic middlebox for the other technologies. And the improvement in reliability and debugging was palpable enough that your boss didn&#x27;t give you too much static. This was THE big win that other technologies couldn&#x27;t deal with.Finally, when you had enough computers that even hubs just weren&#x27;t cutting it, you bought an Ethernet switch. Yeah, that Ethernet switch was about as expensive as the middlebox from all the other technolgies. However, by now, Moore&#x27;s Law had been running for a few years so an Ethernet switch was simply expensive rather than outrageous.

If everyone played nice, the exponential backoff timers would work as expected, but it did not take long for people to learn that they could disable the Nagle algorithm, and&#x2F;or increase the length of their (AX25) preamble so they would own the channel. Increasing the preamble meant that even if there was a collision, the longer preamble would use up enough time so that the \"enemy\" packet would be finished before the \"evil\" packet began to send the important bits, so it would be received properly. Disabling the Nagle algorithm (by hard-coding the backoff timer length to zero) would ensure that the \"evil\" transmitter would be the first one to key up after a collision.CSMA&#x2F;CD works pretty well on a shared wire, but not very well on a single radio frequency where you cannot \"hear\" other people trying to reach the same mountain-top receiver. I&#x27;m glad that aspect of congestion is now a thing of the past. (Now that everything (wired) is switched, it&#x27;s all point-to-point, so the only congestion we get is from insufficient bandwidth on the trunk, and we have ECN for that.) reply Animats 10 hours agorootparent> If everyone played nice, the exponential backoff timers would work as expected,Yes.

More specifically, we would like, in the presence of both well-behaved and badly-behaved hosts, to insure that well-behaved hosts receive better service than badly-behaved hosts. We have devised a means of achieving this.The goal of fair queuing is not to improve network performance overall. The goal of fair queuing is to reward well-behaved hosts over badly-behaved hosts. If everyone is well-behaved, the queue lengths are the same, usually 1 or 0, and fair queuing does little.There is an inherent conflict between this goal and achieving maximum data transfer rates. If you try for near 100% utilization, the problems become much worse. You can run comfortably at maybe 70%. This was an accepted tradeoff for DoD systems. DoD wants things to keep working in a crisis, even if normal operation is a bit slower.This is why I&#x27;m not a big fan of HTTP&#x2F;3. It&#x27;s a attempt to get about 10% more performance in the good case, at the cost of considerable extra complexity and less immunity to gaming the system.I never wrote about that much at the time, because if I had, people would have realized earlier that traffic shaping is possible, which implies that you can sell and bill for bandwidth and quality of service.

It&#x27;s a attempt to get about 10% more performance in the good case, at the cost of considerable extra complexity and less immunity to gaming the system.To be clear, are you mainly complaining about the multiple streams aspect here, or do you have other concerns? Because while I&#x27;m no expert, using HTTP&#x2F;3 (or QUIC, I&#x27;m ignoring the terminology differences here to avoid confusion with pre-standard QUIC, though I guess maybe we&#x27;re past that point by now?) with just a single stream seems to be the only scalable solution to a certain problem.The main problem I&#x27;ve had with TCP is that anybody can maliciously inject an RST, and for long-lived active connections, the chances of this happening approach 1. If you control both ends you can just tell your firewall to drop all RST packets so the applications can keep talking to each other, but ...Dealing with this at the application layer is ... marginally possible I guess, but not easy unless your application looks a lot like a web browser (and even those tend to usually force the end user to manually fix it). Creating a new TCP connection sucks and you have no idea how much data got dropped after it left the application&#x27;s buffer.So we need a UDP reliability layer, since that&#x27;s the only other general-purpose protocol that actually gets routed (and SCTP is flawed anyway). And dozens of those exist ... but almost none have major use, so I can&#x27;t trust that they will play nice with the wider internet.With HTTP&#x2F;3, if there are major flaws found, I have confidence that - like TCP - it has enough users that someone will come up with an acceptable solution. (admittedly, since it&#x27;s not part of the kernel it will be harder to actually deploy the fix)(I guess TCP-over-VPN is also viable for some users) reply fragmede 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fascinating. RST packets are being generated by a malicious entity out there just throwing them around, to the point that the chances of that approaches 1. I&#x27;ve not seen this in the wild. Most firewalls I&#x27;ve seen will just silently start blocking packets if the connection is quiet for long enough, and not generate an RST. Is there anything you can share about your corner of the Internet where this is common? reply GoblinSlayer 2 hours agorootparentSilent blackholing is worse: in this case TCP starts retransmission with exponential delays and the connection basically hangs forever. reply throwawaaarrgh 8 hours agorootparentprevSales strategies optimize for groups of buyers, so we have pay per packet in categories. Some vendors market products based on traffic patterns, like unlimited transfer at a fixed throughput, limited transfer at unlimited throughput, rate-limited protocol layers, etc. You can absolutely find buyers who want to throw money at you for 100% utilization and then spend all their time in vain trying to get it to not be terrible. reply 1letterunixname 10 hours agorootparentprevSlotted aloha enters the chat to talk about the good ol&#x27; days.

For the study, Kaiser Permanente researchers tracked rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes among health system members aged 0 to 19 years in southern California with no history of diabetes from January 2016 to December 2021. \"Youth-onset diabetes is a serious chronic health condition, placing individuals at risk for early complications, comorbidities, and excess mortality, in particular among those who develop type 2 diabetes and those from racial and ethnic minority groups such as non-Hispanic Black individuals,\" the study authors wrote. Kids aged 10 to 19 years especially affected Over the study period, 1,200 youth were diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, 1,100 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 63 patients with \"other\" diabetes. Type 1 diabetes rates climbed from 18.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2016 to 2019 to 22.4 per 100,000 person-years from 2020 to 2021. Relative to 2016 to 2019, in 2020 to 2021, the incidence of new-onset type 1 diabetes was 17% higher (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.17). The incidence was higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR,1.17), boys (IRR, 1.18), and Hispanic patients (1.21). Rates of type 2 diabetes were 62% higher (IRR, 1.62) in 2020 to 2021 than in 2016 to 2019. The incidence of type 2 diabetes rose from 14.8 to 24.7 per 100,000 person-years over that time. Rates were higher among patients aged 10 to 19 years (IRR, 1.63), girls (IRR, 1.44), boys (IRR, 1.83), Black patients (IRR, 1.95), Hispanic patients (IRR, 1.61), and other/unknown racial groups (IRR, 2.96). The incidence rate differences followed similar patterns for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Black, Hispanic patients had heavy diabetes burden By quarter, rates of type 1 diabetes fluctuated seasonally but climbed among patients aged 10 to 19 years in Q1 of 2021. Among youth with type 2 diabetes, a spike in incidence occurred in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, especially among Black and Hispanic patients, which the researchers said suggests that they bore a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods. Sociodemographic factors, average body mass index, fasting and random glucose levels, and hemoglobin A1c concentrations didn't change from 2016 to 2021. The authors noted that research has shown that coronavirus-binding via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors damages islet cells in the pancreas and may lead to diabetes. \"Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have been noted in patients with COVID-19 infection without prior indicators of diabetes risk,\" they wrote. \"Additionally, diabetes risk factors may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic including limited physical activity, increased sedentary behaviors, sleep disturbances, and increased intake of processed foods.\" The findings, they added, point to the need for future research on physiologic and behavioral risk factors for new-onset diabetes before and during the pandemic.

My fitness went UP due to homeoofice and lockdowns. I also started to eat healthier, simply because I had more and easier control over what I eat. reply myko 7 hours agorootparentprevHow so? Ate more healthily at home, walked more, got outside more generally. Physical health likely improved with lockdowns. reply VancouverMan 4 hours agorootparentThat would really depend on where somebody was located.All across Canada, for example, the government-imposed and \"public health\"-imposed restrictions were remarkably harmful to the health of the general public.It varied somewhat by region, but pretty much all fitness facilities, including gyms, were shut down for extended (many months, if not longer) periods of time. Some never reopened. Losing access to facilities like those was a big problem in a country where harsh winters can seriously limit outdoor activities for several months each year.There were also curfews and other restrictions that prevented or severely limited people from doing exercise and other physical activity outside.The lockdowns and restrictions also destroyed or seriously harmed many businesses, which resulted in significant stress for the employees, owners, suppliers, and others affected. They suffered financial harm, job losses, business losses, and so on.The forced masking and forced shots caused significant stress for those who were lucky enough to not lose their jobs or businesses.Hospitals, medical clinics, and doctors cancelled or significantly delayed huge numbers of procedures and screenings.Those are just a few examples. It went well beyond those. I didn&#x27;t touch on the harm from the education-related restrictions, for instance.Between 2020 and 2023 in Canada, blatantly idiotic \"public health\" policies caused far more people far more physical and mental harm than any virus did. reply trimethylpurine 7 hours agorootparentprevResearch from all over the world indicates that this isn&#x27;t the case.

The vaccine produces an immune response. The initial immune response are low affinity antibodies. Those antibodies can sometimes target host cells accidentally. As somatic hypermutation happens in the months following the exposure to the antigen the high affinity antibodies that form (and which are boosted by a 2nd exposure to the antigen) are less likely to accidentally target host cells. This is presumably why I had a complete recovery after around 2 months and all I needed was an NSAID to tamp down the inflammation.The obvious objection to that article is that correlation is not causation. It needs to be replicated, and there needs to be more than just speculation about a mechanism.

But... - The path is limited to MAX_PATH (260 chars) - Unless you prefix the path with \\\\?\\ - However using \\\\?\\ disables automatic conversion of / to \\ in the path (and some other normalization) - Alternatively set a reg key LongPathsEnabled, but only with Windows 10 v1607+ and the app needs to opt in to longPathAware, and changing the registry might need a reboot (2/3) 1 2d Ashley Gullen @AshleyGullen - Even then not all Windows APIs support longer paths, e.g. PathCanonicalize. Swap for PathCchCanonicalizeEx with PATHCCH_ALLOW_LONG_PATHS, etc. Check docs per API. - Congratulations, your app can pass a long file path to Windows! But the shell still doesn't support long paths. So your app can write to long paths, but you can't access them with Windows Explorer. Even in Windows 11. - If the API returns a path, do all that in reverse. (3/3) 2 2d Ashley Gullen @AshleyGullen I probably missed a few other details and quirks.

Make your own game in your browser without coding or with Javascript. Building games has never been easier! 0 21u thradams @thradams@vivaldi.net @AshleyGullen nowadays it just works. Utf8 works on windows. You need to set locale for fopen etc. 0 16u GreenSkyOverMe (Monika) @GreenSkyOverMe@ohai.social @AshleyGullen Holy fucking shit 0 21u Matt Campbell @matt@toot.cafe @AshleyGullen I ran into the issue of converting between UTF-8 and UTF-16 when I was using Lua as the primary language for a desktop application in 2008. I ended up patching the Lua standard library's io and os modules, as well as the lfs library. These days I do a lot of work with Rust. The Rust standard library takes care of conversion between UTF-16 and UTF-8. But I wonder how thoroughly it handles the problem of long paths. 1 17u Sonny Bonds @SonnyBonds @matt @AshleyGullen I don't have a first hand source so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but to make things even more spicy I think it's possible to create files with non-unicode paths. Paths that can't be correctly represented with UTF-8 or UTF-16. (Possibly UCS-2 paths? Again, not sure on the details.) 0 19u Григорий Клюшников @grishka@friends.grishka.me What do you mean most modern software uses UTF-8? Most modern software uses UTF-16 for in-memory representation of unicode strings. Rust is one exception that immediately comes to mind that does use UTF-8 even in memory. 3 19u thradams @thradams@vivaldi.net @grishka @AshleyGullen Memory representation is also in utf8. For instance, for web servers it would be wast of time converting from to utf16 because most of the protocols use utf8 0 13u Guillaume Racicot @gracicot@mastodon.social @grishka @AshleyGullen rust, C, C++, zig, nim and Go comes to my mind when thinking of language with utf8 string representation Not many modern languages choose utf16 because it's an obviously bad choice for almost every use case. 1 13u Григорий Клюшников @grishka@friends.grishka.me Guillaume, C/C++ don't really \"use\" UTF-8 because the encoding they use is platform- and context-dependent. For example, if you have a win32 app in C++, there's a good chance you're using wchar_t* for strings, which is UTF-16. But char* can be really anything. It could as well be any of those regional 8-bit encodings like CP1251. Or it can be UTF-8... I suppose? I'm still not quite sure how opening non-ASCII file paths with open() works in Unix systems. 2 13u Guillaume Racicot @gracicot@mastodon.social @grishka @AshleyGullen the C++ standard more requires utf8 source files compatibility and C++23 allows u8 strings to be converted to narrow character strings (char const*, std::string). Also, since forever and by default, std::string and char const* are 8 bit characters compatible with utf8. (Given that the platform word size is 8 bit of course) The c and c++ fopen and io stuff also uses utf8 0 6u Elegantbeef @Elegantbeef @grishka @AshleyGullen @gracicot Nim also does not technically use utf8. The `string` type is a byte buffer with 0 awareness indexing is O(1). Though the language itself uses utf8 compatible identifiers and has a utf8 decoder in the stdlib(which actually uses a int32 to represent the individual Runes). 0 13u lonjil @lonjil@treehouse.systems @grishka @AshleyGullen some languages, like Java and JavaScript, use UTF16, so obviously even brand new applications in them use UTF16 strings, but as far as I can tell, new stuff that isn't constrained by legacy decisions tends to use UTF8. An interesting example is Swift, which used to use either ASCII or UTF16 depending on the string, but having hid all implementation details from users, could switch to UTF8, which they did in 2019. 0 19u Vinni @specificprotagonist@tech.lgbt @AshleyGullen \"Windows uses UTF-16\" Almost – Windows file paths can be UCS-2, meaning they can contain unpaired surrogates. This also means you can't faithfully convert them to UTF-8, only to WTF-8. 0 13u Christopher Smith @cbsmith@vmst.io @AshleyGullen Kids these days have no idea how easy they've got it... 0 Verkennen Openbare tijdlijnen Wanneer je een account op deze server hebt, kun je inloggen om mensen of hashtags te volgen, op berichten te reageren of om deze te delen.

You need to care if you&#x27;re accepting a file path from another app, for example. You don&#x27;t need to care if you&#x27;re using your own files in your install directory; too much of Windows doesn&#x27;t support long files (including explorer, as mentioned, not to mention third party apps), so it&#x27;s very unlikely that you&#x27;ll need to deal with them if you&#x27;re just handling your own data.- Work in utf-16 when dealing with file paths. Convert back and forth at the point of entry &#x2F; exit to &#x2F; from your app. It&#x27;s unsurprising that you need to call the conversion function twice in order to find out how much memory to allocate, that&#x27;s just how that works.Don&#x27;t change random registry settings or code pages on the user&#x27;s computer, that&#x27;s mad. reply smarkov 19 hours agoparent> Don&#x27;t change random registry settings or code pages on the user&#x27;s computer, that&#x27;s mad.A million times this.Multiple Valve games set the microphone volume in Windows to 100% whenever you launch the game, which, for my setup, makes me sound unbearably loud.

But, as far as I know, that part of the standard got ignored by basically everyone, including some of whom wrote it (Microsoft), by presenting e.g. the on-device volume control as a 0-100 scale, like Windows and ALSA still do. Except... some hardware devices actually implemented the spec, including the PCM29xx family of audio codecs. These, and clones of them, have been used in quite a few USB audio cards and some very low-end audio interface over the decades. And for those, \"100\" in Windows means something like \"+30 dBfs\" [2] - so you&#x27;ll get extreme distortion with basically any signal.[1] 1.0 is actually impressively complex and basically models the entire stack of audio devices someone could have possibly had in their TV cabinet in the 1995, including stuff like dolby and surround decoders.[2] This is defined around 5.2.2.2.3 and&#x2F;or 5.2.2.4.3.2 in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usb.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;audio10.pdf reply Aardwolf 21 hours agoparentprev> Work in utf-16 when dealing with file paths.

So 1 code point = 1 character for Unicode. Of course, in real life, character is a silly made-up word that means whatever you think it means and using it to refer to an extended grapheme cluster or glyph is probably closer to how people really think of them anyway.[0]: See section 3.4 of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicode.org&#x2F;versions&#x2F;Unicode15.0.0&#x2F;UnicodeStanda... reply torstenvl 1 hour agorootparentYour position is obviously wrong both with regard to the Unicode standard and with regard to the meaning of the word \"character.\"Unicode does not define \"character\" because that term is far too imprecise for a deterministic standard. And the Unicode standard is extremely clear that an abstract character may be represented by multiple code points.\"A single abstract character may also be represented by a sequence of code points—for example, latin capital letter g with acute may be represented by the sequence , rather than being mapped to a single code point.\"> Of course, in real life, character is a silly made-up word that means whatever you think it means and using it to refer to an extended grapheme cluster or glyph is probably closer to how people really think of them anyway.Human language and writing are the defining inventions of the known universe. Unicode just happens to be one way of representing them. Referring to them as \"silly and made up\" in comparison to Unicode is nothing short of extreme mental illness. reply usrusr 19 hours agorootparentprevMakes me wonder how bad utf-8 in off-latin environments really is: what&#x27;s the fraction of strings that is \"language content\", and how much is colons, quotes, decimal numbers and the like? What fraction of coding cultures embraces home locale script for identifiers, and how many continue on the trajectory set in motion by pre-unicode programming languages? My guess would be that utf-8 is still quite bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t be entirely surprised if actual numbers turned out considerably less bad than one might expect. And how much of the \"utf-8 tax\" remains if the actual format of most data at rest and in transit isn&#x27;t json but gzipped json? reply vlovich123 15 hours agorootparentExperiments I recall from a while back from browsers and JDK indicated the vast majority of memory is consumed by latin1 strings (even for apps in Asia). Of course, those experiments I recall are something like 20 years old and likely biased (websites were smaller, content was still latin1 dominated). It would be interesting to know the results from Chinese apps and websites today. For websites, the markup used the most space and that stuff remains latin1. For apps I don’t know. But also, text size in memory is typically a joke because the expensive bit is all the multimedia that accompanies text these days. Remember, 100mib is 25million characters even in utf32. That’s 1 hour or so of high quality audio or a few seconds of video. In terms of compression, the smaller initial file will typically compress better so not sure what you mean by “utf-8” tax. UTF8 is not slower to process than utf32 as far as I’m aware except for one small corner case of random codepoint access (but then in UTF text processing, you really shouldn’t be doing that I think but I’m not a utf expert ). reply GoblinSlayer 47 minutes agorootparentprevHow do you write code that you can&#x27;t write one function that opens a file? reply gavinhoward 16 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking as someone who did what GP suggested, it can be cross-platform; I just abstracted the string to path and path to string conversions, as well as any path operations that are different across platforms.The first thing to realize to make it work is that paths are not strings, so you actually don&#x27;t want to treat them like they are. reply shortrounddev2 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re calling Win32 functions it&#x27;s already not compatible with other OSes...

Some calls are vastly more expensive than others. Syscalls come with a significant cost, encoding conversion of short strings (esp. filenames) does not. Hiding just the syscalls behind an abstraction layer is vastly simpler than doing that and additionally hiding the string representation, so \"UTF-8 everywhere\" is IMHO the right solution. reply Someone1234 20 hours agorootparentprevI thought the OP&#x27;s point is there are too many considerations when doing this?Someone is suggesting a way of making it less tedious, and your response is \"performance?!\" even though in both scenarios you&#x27;re running the same code and it is likely the compiler in release would remove the intermediary. reply huhtenberg 20 hours agorootparent> your response is \"performance?!\"No, that&#x27;s not what I said. reply hgs3 20 hours agoprevIt gets worse. Windows doesn&#x27;t use UTF-16 for file paths it uses UCS-2. Example: Windows paths can contain unpaired UTF-16 surrogates which is illegal in UTF-16. Unix paths are no better; they are \"bags of bytes\" and not necessarily UTF-8. File paths are not guaranteed to be Unicode normalized. Even if they are canonically equivalent (equal graphemes) it doesn&#x27;t mean they are binary equivalent (equal code points). You need to treat file paths as their own special thing and not strings. reply chrismorgan 19 hours agoparentWindows uses potentially-ill-formed UTF-16.No language or environment that uses UTF-16 validates it, ever. Not a single one that I know of. But that doesn’t make it UCS-2, it just makes it potentially-ill-formed UTF-16. reply hnfong 18 hours agorootparentI just have the impression that they s&#x2F;UCS-2&#x2F;UTF-16&#x2F;g without changing anything.

You can pass invalid UTF-8 to tons of APIs and almost all of them will just work, just like you can with UTF-16 in Windows.Doing a string validation check in every single API call would waste cycles for no good reason. reply Karellen 16 hours agorootparentLinux (the kernel) doesn&#x27;t claim (AFAIK) to use UTF-8. It takes NUL-terminated strings in any charset you choose (or none) and either compares them with other NUL-terminated strings, or spits them back out again later.Interpreting a string as encoding text in particular character set is, as far as the kernel is concerned, a problem for userspace.Windows does make claims of \"supporting\" UTF-16. replyh2odragon 21 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s possible to get a file into a windows filesystem whose name contains \"*\" or \":\" characters. Windows reacts quite poorly when it find those in file names; but only in certain APIs, others pass them without concern. Makes for fun explosions.The \"260 character limit\" is a good one; mostly seen that one in \"I can do anything to this file but delete it!\" complaints. reply huhtenberg 21 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s also possible to create files whose names start (or contain) a NUL character.

Reg Edit) could remove. reply 13of40 18 hours agorootparentA similar quirk of the registry API is that it has a simplified set of methods that don&#x27;t specify the data type of the value, so you can have an application that expects to read a null terminated string value, but substitute a binary value with no null termination. If the app doesn&#x27;t handle that right, it&#x27;s buffer overrun time.Usually that&#x27;s foot-shooting, but sometimes you can do that in HKCU as a low privileged user to a value that gets read by a higher privileged process and causes it to \"misbehave\". reply dark-star 20 hours agoparentprevyou can also get \"files into a Linux filesystem\" that contain the \"&#x2F;\" character, which also leads to fantastic kernel crashes...Admittedly, it&#x27;s (probably) harder to pull off than on Windows, but still... reply quickthrower2 21 hours agoparentprevI had the can’t delete a file problem the other day.

For example, this Unicode issue is applicable to almost every API there. And it is not as simple as \"call MultiByteToWideChar twice\". Microsoft did not support UTF-16, they UCS-2, which they called \"Unicode\", but in fact back then it was just a wider ASCII. The worst thing about UCS-2 is that it does not support roundtrip.For example, imagine, that you wrote your Enterprise MS Tech Contoso Ltd.(R) authentication system, where user registers in UTF-8 on webpage, then on some layer it checks that user with the same name (in UTF-8 modern DB) does not exist, then it writes user basic information in UCS-2 encoded legacy \"Enterprise DB\". Aaand... Voila, Evil User overrides data of other user, because UTF-8 can&#x27;t losslessly represent arbitrary sequences of 16-bit code units (should have used https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonsapin.github.io&#x2F;wtf-8&#x2F; instead, but your Enterprise tech was destroyed). reply gumby 19 hours agoprevC++&#x27;s filesystem package (part of the standard library) should take care of all that nonsense for you.

It&#x27;s whole point is so that you don&#x27;t have to pay attention to format of the underlying filenames, directories, etc.Unfortunately by default it doesn&#x27;t, because the constructors which take `const char *`&#x2F;`std::string` will default to the local codepage, instead of just using UTF-8. So you have to use `u8path` or C++20&#x27;s `u8` string literals to get sane portable behavior.So yes, you technically don&#x27;t have to pay attention to the format, but as it is typical of many features in C++ the default is wrong, and you have to manually make sure you don&#x27;t write code that&#x27;s subtly broken.(Or alternatively use a linter which would warn about this, but does such linter exist?) reply LegionMammal978 18 hours agoparentprevI think some people might be wary of the std::filesystem APIs because the standard allows implementations to completely disregard TOCTOU issues internally, to the point of breaking memory safety [0]:> A file system race is the condition that occurs when multiple threads, processes, or computers interleave access and modification of the same object within a file system. Behavior is undefined if calls to functions provided by subclause [filesystems] introduce a file system race.It&#x27;s not just implementation-defined behavior, but full UB! You&#x27;re utterly at the mercy of your implementation to do something reasonable when it encounters a TOCTOU issue, or, for that matter, any kind of concurrent modification to a file or directory. And C++ has a long history of implementations being unreliable in their behavior when UB is encountered.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wg21.link&#x2F;fs.race.behavior#1 reply gumby 17 hours agorootparentThe more limited C API (system calls) is also full of race opportunities.

The windows file APIs are better, but not a lot better.Sure, there are opportunities for races, but POSIX and the Windows API limit the possible outcomes of concurrent modification, and they also provide tools (fixed file handles, etc.) for well-written programs to prevent TOCTOU bugs. Meanwhile, the std::filesystem API just throws its hands in the air and says that filesystem races are UB, period, making it unusable if the program isn&#x27;t in complete control of the directory tree it operates on.> Anyway, the problem described in the post (scanning the string twice when converting) is as race prone, or not, as the the filesystem API.I don&#x27;t see what you mean? The typical scenario here is, you receive some absolute or relative path from an external source, encoded in ASCII or UTF-8 or some other non-UTF-16 encoding, and you want to operate on the file or directory at that path. Your internal path string is never going to change, only the filesystem can change. So there aren&#x27;t any races from scanning your internal string twice to re-encode it; races can only come from using the re-encoded path in multiple calls to the filesystem API. reply grishka 19 hours agoprev> most modern software uses UTF-8[citation needed]UTF-8 is used for storage and serialization, yes, but most mainstream programming languages store unicode strings in memory as UTF-16. The notable exception is Rust, which does indeed use UTF-8 even in memory. reply chrismorgan 19 hours agoparent> most mainstream programming languages store unicode strings in memory as UTF-16This is increasingly frequently false. For stupid historical reasons, far too many languages adopted potentially-ill-formed UTF-16 semantics (never well-formed, sadly), but this makes for such a bad representation that they’ve mostly abandoned it as a sole representation, in favour of more complicated arrangements. For example, Java strings can internally be single-byte Latin-1 or two-byte UTF-16. JavaScript engines do similar tricks these days, and although Python 3 just never did UTF-16 at all (it uses code point semantics, which is almost worse than UTF-16 semantics) it does a 1-byte&#x2F;2-byte&#x2F;4-byte hybrid representation thing too.For one of the most extreme examples of becoming unglued from UTF-16, the Servo browser engine manages to use WTF-8 (UTF-8 plus lone surrogates, to allow representing ill-formed UTF-16) despite being forced by these historical reasons to expose UTF-16 semantics, and although the performance of some operations are harmed by it, others are improved, and in the balance it was a pretty convincing win when they tested it (which many people did not expect).PyPy is also a great example of changing your encoding to one that has mismatched semantics: it applies UTF-8 (or I suppose it must actually be UTF-8 plus surrogates) to Python, and likewise they found it surprisingly good for performance.These things give me hope that even environments like the JVM and .NET CLR might eventually manage to switch their internal string representations to UTF-8 or almost-UTF-8.But also I emphasise that these are historical languages that are stuck with the horrendous 16-bit decisions of the early-to-mid-’90s. When you look at newer languages, they almost always choose something more sensible, and UTF-8 is almost always at the heart of it. reply grishka 19 hours agorootparent> it uses code point semantics, which is almost worse than UTF-16 semanticsWhat&#x27;s so bad about storing a unicode string as a series of codepoints? UTF-8 is also a series of codepoints in essence.> When you look at newer languages, they almost always choose something more sensible, and UTF-8 is almost always at the heart of it.I still think that UTF-8 for memory is a bad idea. For example, it wastes a lot of bits to make sure that a string can be decoded starting from an arbitrary byte offset. This is generally a desirable property for files and some networking applications, but it&#x27;s an absolute waste of space when used in memory. reply chrismorgan 18 hours agorootparentCode point semantics, not scalar value semantics which is what Unicode strings are supposed to be. That is, a Python string can contain surrogate code points, which cannot be encoded in any UTF-*: >>> &#x27;\\udead&#x27;.encode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"\", line 1, inUnicodeEncodeError: &#x27;utf-8&#x27; codec can&#x27;t encode character &#x27;\\udead&#x27; in position 0: surrogates not allowed >>> &#x27;\\udead&#x27;.encode(&#x27;utf-16&#x27;) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"\", line 1, inUnicodeEncodeError: &#x27;utf-16&#x27; codec can&#x27;t encode character &#x27;\\udead&#x27; in position 0: surrogates not allowed(UTF-8 is a sequence of 8-bit code units, representing a sequence of Unicode scalar values.)—⁂—> For example, it wastes a lot of bits to make sure that a string can be decoded starting from an arbitrary byte offset.If you ditch self-synchronisability and ASCII purity of extension by ditching the first two bits (“1-0”) on continuation bytes, you can encode some more briefly: roughly, U+0800–U+1FFF go from three-byte to two-byte, and U+10000–U+FFFFF go from four-byte to three-byte, leaving just U+100000–10FFFF as four-byte. But honestly the difference isn’t often that much (unlike UTF-16 → UTF-8, which roughly halves memory usage most of the time, commonly even saving when dealing with text that makes heavy use of other scripts that are more compact in UTF-16 than in UTF-8 since you commonly mix things in with ASCII markup), and if you’re really trying to shave memory, other techniques like compression are far more effective.I love microoptimisation (and spent a large number of hours on my Casio GFX-9850GB PLUS, where having only 30KB of memory encouraged learning to shave single bytes here and there!), but there’s also a lot to be said for consistency. Yes, some purposes could have an encoding that is more efficient than UTF-8. But doing this complicates matters quite a bit, and I think we’re better off with just UTF-8.Also I will note that the self-synchronising nature of UTF-8 is useful for some operations: you can scan through strings much more quickly that way. So it’s not pure waste as a memory representation. replyloeg 19 hours agoparentprev> most mainstream programming languages store unicode strings in memory as UTF-16Uh.

If a formatting rule would not be followed, in the next commit hitting this code, the format would also be affected, causing a larger diff than necessary.There are other reasons for simple format linting, but the reasons above are the most profound.Lastly, formatting is part of a range of static code analysis tools.

The permitted length of using ASCII characters is about 4 times as long (may god have mercy on your soul).Macs are simple enough too if you ignore the quirks. HFS (which was never seen on a modern MacOS) usually stores no information about what encoding was used for filenames. It&#x27;s entirely dependent upon how the OS was configured when the file was named (although some code I&#x27;ve seen suggests that something in System 7 would save encoding info in the finderinfo blobs). So non-latin stuff gets mangled pretty easily if you&#x27;re not careful. Filenames are pretty short (32 bytes) minus the one byte because (except for the volume name) they&#x27;re Pascal strings with the length at the front.HFS+ (which is what you&#x27;ll find on OSX volumes) uses UTF-16 but then mandates its own quirky normalization and either Unicode 2.1 or 3.2 decomposition depending… which can create headaches because most HFS+ volumes are case-insensitive. It&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve touched anything Cocoa, but I assume the file APIs will do the UTF-16 dance for you and the POSIX stuff is obviously OK with ASCII.And, of course, let&#x27;s not forget the heavily leveraged resource forks. Of course NTFS has forks but nobody seems to use them.APFS standardized on Unicode 9 w&#x2F; UTF-8.CDs? Microsoft&#x27;s long filenames (Joliet) use big endian UTF-16 (via ISO escape sequences that theoretically could be used to offer UTF-8 support). Which sounds crazy until you realize their relative simplicity (a duplicate directory structure) compared to the alternative Rockridge extensions which store LFNs in the file&#x27;s metadata with no defined or enforced encoding.

The real problem are APIs that inherently assume that you pass in a string of at most MAX_PATH characters, because you provide a pointer but no size, and the API is expected to write to that pointer.

    "originBody": "Ned Batchelder Blog · Text · Code · Site BLM The myth of the myth of learning styles Saturday 23 September 2023 In “Advice to beginners” I said, “Learn how you learn,” and many people stepped up to tell me that learning styles are a myth. I know the research about learning styles, but people are over-applying it to dictate how people should learn. If you haven’t heard about the theory and its debunking, you can read about it in The Atlantic or Education Next. Briefly: the theory was that some people were inherently visual learners, while others were textual learners, among other kinds. This has been proven untrue. When I said “learn how you learn,” I meant for learners to take an active role in choosing what their path should be. I’m not talking about the four modalities from the debunked “learning styles” myth. There are many effective ways to learn how to program, and you have to choose your way. There are lots of possible choices: Do you want to start with computer science theory, or jump into writing small programs? Do you want to know the inner workings of things, or just how to use them? Do you want to work on small exercises, or choose a project of your own? Once you’ve started a project, do you complete it, or are you willing to leave things unfinished because something else has drawn your attention? Do you work a fixed amount of time each day, or do you adapt as your energy waxes and wanes? Do you want to dive deep into one technology or language, or dabble in many? Are you proactive (learn what you might need it later) or reactive (learn what you need right now)? Does studying with others help you, or are you better off learning alone? Are you choosing an industry, and aiming your work directly at it, or trying out many different domains? Do you like videos, or reading text? These aren’t always binary choices: you might be somewhere in the middle, or shift over time, or seesaw back and forth. Understand what works for you. I saved videos vs text for last because it seems to be the most contentious. Many people will tell you that watching videos is a bad way to learn programming. I agree that passively watching videos can lull you into thinking you understand concepts. You must write code to truly cement your understanding. Videos can be a fine way to learn, as long as you are active in the learning. But some people will simply rail against videos entirely. Some experts lean too hard on “learning styles are a myth” and “videos are bad.” This seems to be just another gate-keeping flavor of “the way I did it is the right way.” The debunking of learning styles was important because teachers were being expected to develop curriculum in many styles to suit different students’ needs. This was extra work, and could also prevent the students from developing learning skills in other modalities. But I’m not talking about teachers’ choice of modality. I’m talking about learners finding paths that work for them. Today we have an abundance of learning materials, and learners have to choose among them. Everyone has be empowered to use the ones that suit them. This is a much bigger range than visual/textual/auditory. Learners have to learn how they learn, and choose the path and materials that work best for them. #beginners #education » 2 reactions Comments mica 9:19 PM on 23 Sep 2023 I first encountered the “learning styles theory” during a time of despair, while I was six months or so into my journey to learn programming (recursion, j’accuse and curse you). This (’in’ε)famous Coding Horror article, was promising me years of wasted effort, and reinforcing an ever growing belief that I wasn’t cut out for programming. That belief was only kept at bay by the even more unsettling realization that learning how to code was my only path out of a future as a telemarketer or worse. Turning back was no option. And there it was, the “theory of learning styles”, a shortcut towards realizing my dream of chilling while CPUs were following my instructions. Now I only need to know whether I am a visual, an auditory or a text learner. Alas, this shortcut turned out to be an emotional draining detour towards realizing that there isn’t a single possible answer to what kind of learner I am, especially one that could hold true against time. And how could it be? Yes, our minds are different and to each mind its preferences for how to approach endeavours but the word mind is often used interchangeably with the word psyche for a reason. We use one or the other depending on whether we wish to convey order or chaos. When we wish to qualify a human individual as a rational thinker, we use the word mind. When we, eventually, wish to explain why a human individual is the furthest thing possible from rationality, we use the word psyche. Therefore, saying the way your mind works makes you suited for visual|auditory|text|that-fancy-sounding-adjective learning evaluates to saying: I predict that your psyche will stay in a constant state for eternity. Understanding that foreign concepts such as recursion (or space time complexity, or aynchronicity) aren’t some kind of a cognitive shibboleth but rather new notions that can be internalized and made to work in one’s favor takes time and –>–>effort<–<–. I encourage everybody to reply to Ned’s set of questions mentioned in this article because that is essentially how you keep yourself going through times of uncertainty while learning programming, a field that is as cut and dried as a field can be. As for the impact that this “theory” (the sarcastic quotation marks stay or so help me god) might have on teachers’ well being, I would like to say: kids, leave them teachers alone. They are among the most neglected, underappraciated, underpraised, overlooked, overexploited groups in human society. Or as John Lennon could have said: Teacher is the woman of the world. Ant Lockyer 2:26 AM on 25 Sep 2023 I like watching videos, I get a bunch of useful information and then can apply. Things like list[-1] for example was just on someone writing some code and I remembered. What I really like to do is when I encounter some concept I’m not familiar with, on Leetcode or something. After I’ve exhausted my effort on my own I’ll watch a video. I won’t write code till the next day so that it’s just the concept I remember and then I can practice the application and coding Add a comment: Name: Email: Web site: Name is required.

E.g., as preferring visual, aural, reading&#x2F;writing, or kinesthetic learning.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Learning_styles#Neil_Fleming&#x27;s...The body of the article acknowledges that those \"learning styles\" have been debunked:> Briefly: the theory was that some people were inherently visual learners, while others were textual learners, among other kinds. This has been proven untrue.The author is defending this idea instead:> I’m talking about learners finding paths that work for them.Fair enough, but recycling \"learning styles\" in the title is knowingly and needlessly confusing. reply Mordisquitos 19 hours agoparentThank you for debunking the myth of the myth of the myth of learning styles.Seriously now, the way I see it, there is a common problem when a general descriptive observation—in this case that some learners subjectively prefer certain learning approaches to a greater or lesser degree—derives into an overly assertive model as to which types of \"learning styles\" exist, the assertion that each person must fit into each category, and prescriptive assertions as to how each \"type\" of person learns better. This is common in many other observations that are overly reified into people believing they must fit into a category and believe that identifying as part of it confers predictive power or expectations. This happens in the myriad of personality type models, attachment styles, and, to a lesser extent, even sexual orientations (see how often young people will ask questions online in the vein of “I am a h(eter|om)osexual g(uy|irl) but I am attracted to my (fe)?male friend. Can I still be $1sexual?”).The legitimate observation of average differences and tendencies, as well as their descriptions, is overshadowed by going too prescriptive. And sometimes, when there is legitimate backlash against these overgeneralisations as happens in \"learning styles\", the pendulum goes to far the other way and society rejects the initial observation entirely. And yet, in certain circumstances, some people do prefer different ways of learning than others. They may even be correct that, in that given case, they learn better that way. Let&#x27;s accept the messiness of human diversity without coming up with overly defined boxes. reply spondylosaurus 15 hours agorootparentSomething something the map is not the territory.To your point about \"overly defined boxes,\" it&#x27;s a little ironic how 10-15 years ago the prevailing thought in LGBT spaces was (more or less verbatim) \"Society wants to fit us all into these rigid boxes, but I say fuck your boxes!\" and now it&#x27;s more like \"Society wants to fit us all into rigid boxes, but there&#x27;s actually a lot more boxes out there that you may not know about, so just keep looking until you find the right box. But you will find a box.\"E.g., the extent to which nonbinary has almost become a defined third gender category with its own set of expectations rather than a catch-all for anyone who finds that the main two categories just don&#x27;t quite cut it. reply redactyl 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, I often see people putting things into mutually-exclusive categories when I rather think they should be thinking with more of a tag system. reply pierat 16 hours agorootparentSo many people (at least in the USA, but likely everyone) are so bound to an identity that includes X but explicitly excludes Y.Worse yet those identities changed in their root definition, so that if you were some identity 20y ago, that now means something different.For example, if you were a 2nd wave feminist, you&#x27;re likely assumed to hate transgender people. reply exmadscientist 16 hours agorootparentprevOr, to sum up in a pithy sound bite phrase: labels might describe people, but must never define us. reply coldtea 18 hours agoparentprev>The body of the article acknowledges that those \"learning styles\" have been debunkedI&#x27;d say some dubious quality research (like most educational &#x2F; psychology research is) was done to favour learning styles.Then some newer, still dubious quality, research was done to \"debunk\" them.Meanwhile, we probably don&#x27;t know more about what objectively works in learning than we did before both sets of research were reported.It&#x27;s more about churning papers and taking sides in different academic camps, than actual scientific work.Like with \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" I wouldn&#x27;t bet on either the original research or the debunking, having \"settled\" the issue. reply SamBam 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s extremely difficult to prove anything in education research, just like any kind of sociology or psychology research.Humans aren&#x27;t like bowling balls dropped from towers, they&#x27;re very non-deterministic, and the number of background factors that every individual has makes it very difficult to make federal statements.Source: current ed research master&#x27;s student. reply smogcutter 18 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not even about churning papers in Ed research.The grand prize is any kind of gimmick that can be turned into staff development material and a lucrative publishing&#x2F;consulting career. reply pengstrom 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s also confusing to talk about learning styles without it&#x27;s context. They always come from the detached top. Here in Sweden it&#x27;s primarily used (along with most trends teachers have to stomach) to distract from budget cuts. The initiatives never seem to include smaller classes or more teachers, only mire work for an already overworked profession. reply dhimes 20 hours agoparentprevThey actually haven&#x27;t been debunked IMHO. They&#x27;ve done a handful of tests that tend to show that people remember pictures better than words. They have not tested, as far as I have seen, Active vs Reflective, Inductive vs Deductive (or Sequential vs Global), etc.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been studied in a long time because of the influence of the \"Learning Styles is Bullshit\" gang. reply gopher_space 17 hours agorootparentThe term &#x27;learning style&#x27; has two completely separate meanings depending on whether it&#x27;s a tool at your disposal or an external requirement. People in the latter group talk about \"debunking\" a \"myth\" in the same way that programmers write \"agile is bullshit\" blogs.It hasn&#x27;t been seriously studied since the late 90s (imho) because the people working on it were all fairly satisfied with the new tool they&#x27;d created for certain struggling teachers in very specific circumstances. From that perspective, potential research questions might boil down to \"Is empathizing with a different point of view useful?\" or \"Exactly how attracted am I to the idea of archetypes?\" reply hooverd 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m starting to think that debunkers of X are tedious than people who are pro-X. It&#x27;s so easy to find a study that says X has some flaw and debunk away. There was an oft cited study about plastic bags with some weird methodology that everyone used to smugly proclaim that their single use plastic bags were actually better and people who used reusable bags had been debooonked. reply Jensson 15 hours agorootparentNice debunking of debunking there, you found an argument and now debunking is debunked! reply hooverd 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s debunking all the way down. replydhimes 19 hours agoprevHere&#x27;s a quick response as I have to get to a sailboat race. * Most research is limited; most test memory of pictures vs words (pictures win for most). Most educators of higher levels believe that there is more to learning than memory, but this is largely not addressed by the researchers. * Most \"learning styles\" are established via questionnaire, not actually testing how people learn best * Even the \"Learning Styles is BS\" crowd is starting to weasel out of the implication of their conclusion that everybody learns the same. They are saying things like \"talent\" and \"context\" etc. give differences in how people learn, not learning styles. A distinction without a difference IMHO- with the possible exception that you could argue that you are, for example, verbal for math and visual for history or something (because of context or whatever). * I don&#x27;t have a dog in the fight. I only want what&#x27;s best for students, which means to learn how they learn. If they are all the same, so be it (but I would be surprised). * More of my thoughts here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;studyswami.com&#x2F;are-learning-styles-bs&#x2F; and my conceptual take on how we should measure learning styles if we really want to research them (don&#x27;t take the actual results too seriously). reply wcarss 19 hours agoparentcompletely tangential comment: that opener ought to be a meme reply moritzwarhier 18 hours agorootparentWanted to comment on this, too - replying instead trying to avoid being a spammer.Meme or not, I&#x27;ll try to remember this for any conversation where I want to strengthen my argument :)> Here&#x27;s a quick response as I have to get to a sailboat race:> You have no idea what you are talking about and the implications of using spaces for indentation are much more severe than you think. reply em-bee 19 hours agorootparentprevquick question while i get ready for the next tack:is that what you mean? reply nerdponx 19 hours agorootparentQuick response as I have to get to a polo match: Yes reply late2part 19 hours agorootparent...have to see a man about a horse... reply arduanika 17 hours agorootparentprevIf so, I&#x27;m coming about to your point of view reply scandum 19 hours agoparentprevEven if it&#x27;s a thing, the idea that a teacher should take on the role of psychologists and figure out a child&#x27;s optimal learning style should be preposterous to anyone with common sense.It might work in combination with a software suite, with e-readers getting cheaper and more capable, and easily lasting through a school day, it&#x27;s an option. reply ClumsyPilot 18 hours agorootparentAh yes, we can sort kids into humanities and sciences, by age, by ability, into gymnasiums and normal schools, but sorting visual learners from other ones is too hard.We can only seperate kids into groups when it serves adninistrative or industrial beenfits, when its for the benefit of the child, forget it.I mean how can you expect a ridiculously expensive system where children spend the majority of their waking hours to actually ask a child if it suits them? reply moritzwarhier 16 hours agoparentprevFive reasons why you&#x27;re wrong:* why the sudden markdown&#x2F;pre-wrap style change?* why use ChatGPT when you can afford a sailboat race, better pay some social media person* you do have a dog in some fight.

I see that you probably wrote that yourself and I don&#x27;t have any stakes in this discussion. reply 7thaccount 21 hours agoprevI think I agree with the synopsis.I don&#x27;t follow the broad research for the debate, but have a pretty good understanding of the way I learn now that I&#x27;m in my 30s.I can&#x27;t listen to lectures at all. Like I just fall asleep. I also have trouble staying awake in meetings where I have to sit still and listen to others talk without being able to engage much. College lectures were torture. It&#x27;s really hard to grok certain engineering classes and listen when you&#x27;re spending a ton of energy also taking notes and the professor is moving too fast. I have no idea why they don&#x27;t just print them ahead of time and pass them out. Who cares if students then don&#x27;t show up if they can learn the material better?I&#x27;ve found out my best way to learn is to just read the textbook chapters on my own time (no lectures) and then do the homework answering questions or writing papers with the professor available to chat if we need anything (how my master&#x27;s program works). That works best for me. Audio is just not a good medium for me. I prefer podcast transcripts instead of having to listen to the hosts talk which takes a lot longer. I&#x27;m sure others are different. reply thayne 17 hours agoparentAs a student I was similar to you, I learned best by reading a textbook and working through problems. But I also knew other people who learned best by going to lectures. And still others who learned best by having a TA work through problems or questions with them and have a one-on-one conversation with them (as a TA I was often the other side of that). For some visual imagery was extremely helpful. For others (including myself) not as much.And what works best can even depend on the subject material for a single individual.In my experience, the way people learn best is far more variable than a fixed set of learning styles.And the way our education system works is usually a shotgun approach where they same material is taught in multiple ways and hope that one of them works. Which ends up wasting a lot of the students time with the approaches that don&#x27;t work for them. And of course there will be students where none of the methods quite work for them. reply totallywrong 20 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s crazy that the prevalent teaching method is sitting for long periods while listening to someone else&#x27;s, constant-pitch voice. That&#x27;s literally the best way to fall asleep, as shown in sleep meditation videos and the like. I was a terrible student, could not keep my eyes open in any class, lost interest, never made it to colleague. Then a few years later I did self-paced distant learning and got my degree in no time while working. reply bee_rider 20 hours agorootparentI’m sure most instructors would, if they had a choice, cut lectures and just have discussion sections&#x2F;labs. But this would require that everybody read the book and come to the discussion sections ready to engage.Lectures seem more like a failure-mode that has somehow become the standard. Assume the students won’t read, and have a human take the book’s job. Humans are… not great books.It is weird that video-lectures+in person discussion sections didn’t become the standard by, like, 2010 or so. reply randomdata 20 hours agorootparentThe lecture style appears to come from a time before the printing press when access to information was poor, enabling students to be essentially human photocopiers to copy the material to bring back to the home for the rest of the family to learn from.Seems we still do it because we have a love of tradition. reply Nullabillity 19 hours agorootparentYMMV, which is kind of the entire point here. Personally I found lectures to be a great way to learn, given the right teacher. A big key for me was to stop taking notes so that I could actually focus on what was being said instead. Another was, for lack of a better word… humanity. Video lectures just don&#x27;t capture me the same way at all. reply pbhjpbhj 17 hours agorootparentI always had to take notes, still do, if I want to be able to focus on the speaker. Something about how I process speech.I&#x27;m very skeptical about the \"there are no learning styles\" results. reply randomdata 16 hours agorootparentThe idea is that it is unlikely that individuals can be neatly categorized into one specific learning style among of set of learning styles. What allows one to learn best is highly contextual and ever changing. reply muchwhales 18 hours agorootparentprevWasn&#x27;t there a math prof that did exactly that? Can&#x27;t find the link now, but after some getting used to the results were overwhelmingly positive.TBH, just staying at home and watching YouTube videos (on the same topics) is likely better than sitting in the average lecture, even if students don&#x27;t want to read at all... reply hollandheese 15 hours agorootparent>TBH, just staying at home and watching YouTube videos (on the same topics) is likely better than sitting in the average lecture, even if students don&#x27;t want to read at all...Good luck getting the students to watch the videos. reply syndicatedjelly 20 hours agorootparentprevWhen I started college in 2009, most large classes were videotaped and posted online within a day or two. Still had to show up for discussion and small lectures but at least those usually involved more student engagement reply bee_rider 19 hours agorootparentYeah, especially since COVID that seems to be popular. But, it doesn’t really lessen the workload on the instructor. IMO it would be better to just take the “best hits” video lectures from the last couple years, give those to the students, don’t do lectures at all, and then focus 100% on discussion sections (which really benefit more from the personal touch). But, for some social reason or something, this wouldn’t fulfill student expectations. reply bluGill 20 hours agorootparentprevSome people make that monotone work. I have avidly listened to one smooth monotone speaker talk for 45 minutes, while falling asleep in minutes for a different speaker at the same time of day (different day) who seamingly was much more energetic.I have no idea what the difference was, but i&#x27;ve observed it. reply BeetleB 17 hours agorootparentprevMost professors I knew would much prefer people read, and the class be used for summary, discussion and problem solving. The problem is they could never get the students to read prior to the lecture. reply Detrytus 19 hours agorootparentprevI think lectures as a form of teaching were invented in the middle ages, before the printing press was available. The whole university might have owned only one copy of each book, so learning by reading it wasn&#x27;t an option for most students. So the professor, who had read the book before, would lecture them on its contents. reply zeroonetwothree 19 hours agorootparentprevGood lecturers are far better than books. Then engage with the class, ask questions, adapt the content to what the students want to know or have trouble with, etc reply gav 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve spent a bunch of time over the last couple of years working on learning and enablement programs. The main thing that I&#x27;ve learnt is that nobody likes the bulk of online learning efforts: dated videos with forced Q&A interspersed.I&#x27;ve got a strong hunch that learners have an overall learning modality: some prefer video, some prefer audio, some prefer long form text, and so on, but--there&#x27;s also a local preference based on their current context: you might have a stronger preference to video for commuting or perhaps you like to print out materials and read it.Finding ways to allow learners to come along their own journey that meets them where they are right now is key to generating better outcomes. reply Jensson 16 hours agoparentprev> I can&#x27;t listen to lectures at all. Like I just fall asleep.Falling asleep doesn&#x27;t mean you didn&#x27;t learn from the lecture. I fall asleep during lectures and still learn a lot from them, I get sleepy when I learn stuff so falling asleep during learning is natural.So don&#x27;t conflate \"I focused\" with \"I learned\". You don&#x27;t learn by focusing, you learn by rewiring your brain, and you rewire your brain best when you sleep.I think people who got praised for working hard rather than for learning seek out activities where they work hard rather than activities where they learn, and conflates that for learning styles when it is just their own mental bias. Or people who prefer one style since it is more comfortable etc, people are really bad at evaluating how well they learned something. reply 7thaccount 12 hours agorootparentIdk. Hard to learn when the professor put you to sleep like a lullaby reply tayo42 19 hours agoparentprevWell run classes have the textbook chapters your suppsed to read for the upcoming lecture. So your ready and can interact and ask questions. Learning isn&#x27;t supposed to happen there. Then it&#x27;s reinforced with hw.The lazy thing to do is sit down and have someone talk to you. So this doesn&#x27;t happen in practice. reply brutus1213 21 hours agoprevAs a teenager and young adult, I was an extremely good textual learner. I could gobble down book chapters and retain all of it. Then grad school happened. I had an extremely hard time reading scientific papers (where generally bad writers encode text in a crazy way for readers of that sub-field to be able to efficiently grok). Now in my 40s (and a professional scientist), I find it very hard to learn from any text. Videos and interactive conversations is my comfort zone. So I&#x27;d say Youtube is my biggest source of learning.That said, I have wondered if my switch from being a great textual learner to someone unable to comprehend is due to lack of practice and my brain being lazy? I recently picked up a work of fiction from my kids&#x27; room and I was surprised at how hard it was for me to grok it (it was an old english book - Robinson Crusoe - so maybe it is the book and not me). I wish I was good at learning from all modalities again. reply dbspin 21 hours agoparentReading is definitely a skill that atrophies without use. We&#x27;re all reading more than ever - but short chunks, or dense but linear technical work (like scientific papers or business texts). Reading fiction or dense non fiction (philosophy, heavier sense textbooks) requires the kind of sustained relaxed attention that does seem intuitively to be diminished by both lack of practice, and social media use. I&#x27;m trying to build the habit again, as I find my own capacity to follow through with creative ideas and work are pretty directly linearly correlated with how much deep reading I&#x27;m doing. reply cpach 21 hours agorootparentI relate to this, a lot. I used to be quite an avid book reader. These days, I find it very hard to focus when reading books. The allure of hypertext is just so tempting. reply jonhohle 20 hours agorootparentThis seems like a quote that would be pulled into an article 40 years from now about how quaint we all were in the past. reply cpach 19 hours agorootparentNot sure what you mean. I don’t know if we where morally superior in the past. But our media consumption sure was different. For better or worse.Also, I am definitely not the same person today that I was at 25. Perhaps I had a greater thirst for knowledge when I was younger…? At least the thirst was different than it is today. I also didn’t have three kids, and because of that fact I had a lot more spare time than I have today (: reply 2devnull 21 hours agorootparentprevPoetry and philosophy seem to be good at snapping my mind back out of web reader mode. The Bible too, but that’s sort of philosophy-poetry (or poetry-philosophy if you prefer). reply tianqi 13 hours agoparentprevPersonally I think so. Reading requires a high level of concentration and immersion of the brain, as well as a low level of noise signaling. Modern video, on the other hand, does whatever it takes to destroy that ability. Think of their pacing, music, manner of speaking, and occasional insertion of canned clips or memes that habituate the brain to strong stimuli rather than low noise.

I used to read a lot when younger, then grad school happened.I think it made me burnt out of reading.I think practice and keeping up with reading is part of it.

Had a similar experience reading the wheel of time recently despite it being published comparatively recently reply karaterobot 20 hours agoprevThe issue is that \"learning styles\" as a phrase is overloaded. If you&#x27;ve read about the debunked theory of learning styles, and you hear someone use that phrase, you think they&#x27;re talking about that, and they just haven&#x27;t read the same article (headlines) you did. But, the phrase makes sense when used for something else: simply a description of what methodology an individual uses to study. The best solution would be for people to read critically and determine what the author intends by that phrase. I mean, that would be the solution in theory, but it&#x27;s never going to happen. So, the more realistic solution is to just never use that phrase unless you&#x27;re repeating that it&#x27;s been debunked. reply dhimes 20 hours agoparentThis is an underrated comment. reply oslem 21 hours agoprevIt took me _years_ to hone in my learning style- well after college.

Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number.

If \"learning styles are debunked\", what else is going on?I&#x27;m sure people don&#x27;t cleanly fit into one category (e.g. I may learn fine kinethetically as well, and I&#x27;m sure some people learn just as well visually as they do auditorally).

People are less willing to go around debunking personality, or say debunking free will. Some people do, especially in the “rationalist community” but generally fewer. Trusting the science is easier when it doesn’t conflict with reality, but there are a minority of people who have no trouble even when it does. In psychology especially, we should heed the adage, “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” It’s difficult measuring the behavior of the human mind. reply nordsieck 20 hours agoparent> Whenever people bang on about debunking this or that artifact of social science research (artifact of the academy to be more precise), I recall that personality can’t really be established empirically by modern psychological science.Do you mean aside from this?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_Five_personality_traits reply 2devnull 18 hours agorootparentNot exactly, because we don’t experience people’s big five, we experience a personality. You can argue that personality isn’t a real thing, and that differences can be reduced to five traits but have you ever wondered why five? Why not one? Personality as we experience it is something closer to mbti, but that also boils down to traits and isn’t very reliable. Personality doesn’t really change, but mbti does.People who downplay personality, social psychologists, will point to numerous studies where behavior is determined by social forces or external circumstances alone. There’s not a lot of experimental evidence that people differ from one another, despite our entire legal&#x2F;ethical system holding that as a fundamental truth. From an empirical perspective is looks like determinism is, if not in the lead, having a good run at the moment. reply Jensson 15 hours agorootparent> Personality as we experience it is something closer to mbtiWhat, how is mbti a personality but big five isn&#x27;t? reply 2devnull 13 hours agorootparentIt’s hard to answer that concisely but one way to answer it concisely might be: mbti are often described as personality types, “The INFP tends to like x and often does y, they dislike z, …” the big five are just five arbitrary dimensions arrived at through factor analysis, they are descriptive more than predictive, they were not developed by Jung, a personality theorist. My point is that the things we can easily measure are not what we think of as personality. Your wife, daughter, dog, are not reducible to the big five. Whatever the extra stuff is, beyond those five dimensions, that’s specific to individuals and persistent, what we call a personality, is a very real thing that cannot be demonstrated empirically. That should humble us to the limits of our ability to understand the human mind, and complicated human mental processes like learning. reply syndicatedjelly 19 hours agorootparentprevHow is something like that verifiable? reply ta988 18 hours agorootparentIf you do like all those pseudo psychologists, always find one category a person they meet fits in.

At all. It has no references other than links to articles that show \"learning styles\" are a myth.This is a problem because there is real scientific evidence showing that people do not have specific learning styles.The ideas that the author proposes center around \"do you want to\" and \"do you like\". Don&#x27;t you get people telling you that they prefer \"kinesthetic learning\" because they \"like it\" better?

The rest is fluff, getting ready to be debunked next.I disagree with the comments about \"metacognition\"... I agree that is critical, but I don&#x27;t see any sign that this article is addressing that.

There are no shortcuts. To put effort into learning something, you need discipline and&#x2F;or motivation. Biggest problem with learning for me has always been finding the motivation.

I feel that coding videos can be extremely useful for certain things. Like when introducing a new syntax it’s helpful to use the video format to point out structures and placement of syntax in real time (type definition goes here, you can also define a function like this, etc.)To go back to the OP, a huge huge skill of learning is successful intuiting those modalities yourself. “I think a video would help me here”; “Here I can just read the docs to understand” reply quickthrower2 21 hours agoprevThe title: myth of myth.Article: myth -> strawman (learning styles are debunked replaced with (in my words) learning strategies are debunked) -> strawman “debunked” reply LorenPechtel 21 hours agoprevThere certainly are styles.Tell my wife how to do something, she&#x27;s going to do poorly.

However, without conceptual understanding, learning devolves to rote learning. Without practice and repetition, long-term in-depth learning is impossible.As far as approaches to learning, by far the best methods involve a fair amount of one-on-one attention. The quickest way to learn something is to have it directly explained to you by another person, with questions allowed. Similarly, the best way to test your own understanding of a subject is to explain it to someone else.Of course, these are the most expensive methods of education, because they require a large investment in people - skilled teachers and other staff, and parking kids in front of Youtube videos is a lot less expensive (see also computer-automated grading of homework assignments and projects). Note that societies that don&#x27;t place a high value on education are doomed to stagnation at best.P.S. &#x27;Learning styles&#x27; can be very important with dyslexia or dyscalculia, e.g. listening to an audiobook while reading along in a text can help the former, as does allowing calculators for the latter for the same reason. Students without these issues can adapt to different presentation styles without much difficulty, and if their school is any good they&#x27;ll have access to all kinds of supplemental resources (libraries, tutors, access to online databases etc.).P.P.S \"Self-taught\" is possible, but realistically it takes much more time and effort.

Just learning an instrument without looking at theory behind it wasn&#x27;t really motivating to me after a while. On the other hand, learning theory without having an instrument to use it on doesn&#x27;t really click. However, putting these two together and in parallel results in a much more motivating and whole situation for me.

Me doing it a lot of time didn&#x27;t lead to knowing how to beat it. Then I watched my brother play it once, after that I never took damage from that monster again.

The top position, which I do want to point out does change, doesn’t always mean people will immediately click on it. This automatic behavior of indiscriminately clicking the top result is being disrupted in part due to how many ads google is stuffing on the top now that look like real results, compounded with the fact of how truly awful google search has become. People are beginning to be much more choosy with what site they click through to.The thing that bothers me is how much weight you are ascribing to organic search given each of the communities’ niche. Being in “the know” here usually comes with the knowledge of where to find the wiki and other resources. If they have to stumble around to find it the first time, maybe they see the old (or replacement) Fandom site and instantly realize what a horrible mistake they made by clicking thru to the trash heap it is. reply frutiger 15 hours agorootparent> People are beginning to be much more choosy with what site they click through to.I would love to believe you (especially as someone who exclusively uses Kagi now); but do you have statistical data on this, as it pertains to the median usage of Google results? reply samtho 13 hours agorootparentNope that remains unstudied. Trust me, I’ve looked. A lot of my assertions are based on how I’ve seen other people behave - which I fully acknowledge is subject to stuff like confirmation bias.For context, I volunteer at a community center and library helping people use computers (usually focused on kids going into stem field, but the general public uses it too). It’s not a diverse sample as this serves only a only a specific middle and working class neighborhood, and I have not been rigorous in data collection (or have literally any strategy to do so). reply nzgrover 15 hours agoparentprevThe Path of Exile wiki moved off fandom to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poewiki.net and has been very successful. If I google \"path of exile wiki\" it&#x27;s the top result for me (in an anonymous window). The creators of PoE even agreed to host the new wiki.

This creates a perverse incentive for Fandom to maximize ad revenue at all costs. A publisher who is also the steward of the community will typically be more selective with what ads and where to put them.I find it tragic that after the heyday of self hosted software like forums, we entered what I fully believe will become a dark age for the internet where content is walled away by the larger providers who have every incentive to extract value from users and hoard their data, both given and created, to maximize their own interests. reply xboxnolifes 14 hours agoparentprevIt takes a while, but it can eventually transition.

If I told you I had a business with:- $120M in annual revenue- 1M fiercely loyal customers who paid every month- 5 distribution centers spread across the country- 100 happy employees, each with a tenure of a decade or longerYou&#x27;d probably say that I had achieved the definition of success in the business world and should be proud of myself. To Netflix, on the other hand, this business is so irrelevant that they&#x27;d rather take it out back and shoot it in the head just to save the bother of continuing to run it. reply abraae 6 hours agoparentYou didn&#x27;t mention how profitable the business is - thats the only metric that really matters.All those happy employees have to be paid.The 1M fiercely lyal customers will only be 950K next month.The lease on 3 of the 5 distribution centers comes up this year and business would have to commit to another 5+ year lease. reply tiffanyh 47 minutes agorootparentTo support your point …Just 3-years ago, the DVD business was generating $200M in revenue.Today, it’s only $120m.That means total revenues are down 66% in just 3-years.You can’t fault Netflix for wanting to divest a business that is rapidly declining.And that doesn’t even speak to the profitably of that business unit which is fair to assume to be losing money when you have that much revenue decline.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediaplaynews.com&#x2F;netflix-indifference-to-disc-r... reply modeless 1 hour agorootparentprevEven given all that it seems totally possible to make profits for years to come.

Great Netflix is shutting down the business that produces so much unneeded plastic. Sad others would gladly keep that business forever when it makes money. Fuck the planet, hell yeah. reply m463 3 hours agorootparentStreaming video is completely controlled and customers have to hunt down each specific movie - if available - from specific streaming services.Meanwhile DVDs are relatively democratic and unencumbered way of distributing video. Netflix can make any movie available via dvd without licensing or asking permission.I found it to be a very good way of getting high quality movies from the largest selection.But your complaint seems to sidestep all this, sort of like complaining that paper money wastes so many unneeded trees without acknowledging the huge benefits. reply pilsetnieks 31 minutes agorootparentGoing off on a tangent, it&#x27;s actually not that much trees wasted on paper money. Some of it is made of plastic but a lot of it should be called rather cloth money - at least the US dollar and euro are made of cotton and linen fiber instead of cellulose from wood pulp. reply patrec 3 hours agorootparentprev> Great Netflix is shutting down the business that produces so much unneeded plastic.I&#x27;m baffled to see such an innumerate take on HackerNews of all places. Yearly US per capita plastic consumption is a few hundred kg. How much do you think a netflix subscription adds to that? reply Sankozi 3 hours agorootparentYou are calling it innumerate while forgetting those plastic consumption number consists of lots of tiny things like the Netflix DVD consumption.Almost every problem can be divided into many tiny ones, and solution to each tiny problem can be ridiculed that it solves only tiny bit of a problem. reply tfgg 3 hours agorootparentHonestly this sort of climate & environment tokenism frustrates me - spending a lot of energy trying to reduce and elimate things that barely matter (or even actually make things worse by displacement), while ignoring the big ticket items. At best it&#x27;s innumerate, at worst it&#x27;s greenwashing. reply Sankozi 2 hours agorootparentBut nobody was doing that in this thread. Walteweiss was just pointing that Netflix DVD service closing has a significant positive side - less trash generated. Pointing it was called as \"innumerate\".There are bigger problems for sure but there is also \"there are bigger problems\" fallacy (aka fallacy of relative privation). reply FeepingCreature 2 hours agorootparentThe disagreement is precisely over whether the positive side is significant. reply bawolff 1 hour agorootparentprev> Honestly this sort of climate & environment tokenism frustrates meAs an hn&#x27;er you should be used to premature optimization ;) reply walteweiss 2 hours agorootparentprevI replied in the other comment, but I thought I’ll mention you as well. I agree that this is a tiny drop into the ocean, but I thing it’s still a positive change. reply Xylakant 2 hours agorootparentHow much plastic does this actually produce? The DVDs are reused multiple times, as are the boxes. They are comparatively unlikely to end up in the environment, since they are in a closed and controlled environment - people are unlikely to just throw them out in the garbage. Packaging may be an issue. But there are many better ways to reduce plastic pollution - for example just driving a few miles less per year, or driving a lighter car: Tires are a much bigger source of plastic pollution and they shed microplastic directly into the environment and water runoff: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;article&#x2F;tires...I&#x27;d rather have people kick back on their couch and watch a Netflix DVD instead of feeling great that they saved so much plastic, and then smugly drive their SUV to the next shopping mall. replysph 3 hours agorootparentprevSuch a flame bait hot take. While you are right in a vacuum, it is completely off topic: if this was a growing market, like the person you are replying to was saying, Netflix would give a rat&#x27;s arse about ecology and happily ship its plastic. reply walteweiss 2 hours agorootparentI’m sad to say that it feels like you are right. I didn’t mean that Netflix is all good, I just meant that we also have an ecology question here that’s involved, not just the money. If it generates tons of money but also generates tons of waste— do we really need it?I know it’s some naïve idealism, but I would love to see the world where we, as human race, choose to do nothing rather than trash our planet even more. I may sound like a crazy ecology fanatic (I’m not yet), yet I’m becoming more and more worried over all this. While the other commenter legitimately pointed out that servers aren’t free (ecology wise) either, I think they can be optimised over time. Shipping physical disks, I don’t see as rational these days. Even when it gets you money, discard half of your customers and the other half would switch to subscription anyway, you just push them to do that earlier. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentWe don&#x27;t need it - that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s closing. It&#x27;s been replaced by digital services.I don&#x27;t understand this comment - it might make sense as a (bad) pitch for digitising Netflix in the 2000s, but the millions of FTE days to do that have already been pitched, paid for and worked. What is this adding? reply rakoo 24 minutes agorootparentprevNetflix requires high bandwidth, ever new high performance servers and routers and all the jazz, and thanks to DRM requires newer equipment to watch content. The pollution created by the digital Netflix is WAY higher than the physical one, it&#x27;s not even a comparison. reply wbl 4 hours agorootparentprevThe physical disks let you access far more movies than are showing on streaming because there are no rights issues. reply pbhjpbhj 1 hour agorootparentIn my personal opinion, we should fix this in the streaming market -- basically force media producers to be blind as to the buyer (as with DVDs), if they sell at $X per unit, in order to maintain their copyright then $X is the sale price and any distributor can acquire a license to redistribute (for private use) a work at that price.I would give a grace period to allow for exclusives; 2 years from release, maybe.Popcorn Time (free torrenting service) but with a payment of a few cents for each work would be possible. Instead of subscription to lots of expensive services.IPR is a system maintained by the democratic government, make it work for the people. reply walteweiss 4 hours agorootparentprevValid. I never thought about it, but the problem not in the medium here. It’s more in the laws&#x2F;contracts. It could be done differently, I assume. reply Karellen 43 minutes agorootparent> It could be done differently, I assume.Yes, we could have compulsory licensing, like with music on the radio.If radio stations have a copy of a song, then provided they pay the legally-mandated royalties to the rightsholder, they can play it. They don&#x27;t need to negotiate with the rightsholder, and the rightsholder cannot prevent them from playing it.We have a working model for how it can work, so we could do the same thing with TV shows and movies on OTA&#x2F;cable&#x2F;streaming... but we just don&#x27;t.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Compulsory_license reply pyuser583 4 hours agorootparentprevNot really. When you (or Netflix) buys a disk, you own it. It’s yours.When you license a show via a streaming service, you don’t own anything.This is the problem with the tech economy. The consumers don’t own anything. They just rent. reply walteweiss 4 hours agorootparentWell, many of us know that popular phrase ‘piracy, it just works.’When I download a movie this way, I truly own it. Same as I own a DVD disk. It’s just the medium that is different. E.g. I have a collection of Friends on disks, which is legal, I own it. But when it’s ripped as files and stored on an old hdd so I could rewatch some episodes just plugging the disk via USB. I assume it is likely to be illegal.The thing is, copyright holders think it’s wrong, and they want us to rent the content, not own it. I mean it could be done other way technologically, avoiding physical medium and still making it legal somehow. It could be done if the party was interested in it. The problem is not in the physical medium itself. reply phlo 4 hours agorootparent> [Piracy:] When I download a movie this way, I truly own it.When you download a pirated copy, it&#x27;s more likely that you _possess_ it, rather than _owning_ it. You are in control of the bits and bytes, they will not just disappear; but since your copy is unlicensed and illicit, the copyright holder could take legal steps to make you delete your copy (and pay for your infringement on their copyright).> Same as I own a DVD disk.That&#x27;s different. You own the physical disc, and the right to re-sell or potentially lend out that physical disc. (However, you can&#x27;t take the data from that disc, and stream it to a public audience on the internet.)> [...] rewatch some episodes just plugging the disk via USBDepends on your jurisdiction, but in many places it is legal for you to create a backup of a physical disc that you own, and make personal use of that backup. In some places you are allowed to share your backup copy with friends and family (on a non-commercial basis, of course). It gets nuanced. reply developer93 3 hours agorootparentRipping is pretty much undetectable though unless they decide to torrent it for others. So in practice they own it. As to the 2nd point, it&#x27;s not really 1:1, a more accurate equivalent would be a netflix dvd rather than a bought one. reply jedberg 3 hours agorootparentprev> When you (or Netflix) buys a disk, you own it. It’s yours.Only because the laws say that physical media is treated differently. If the law said that you could buy a disk and then stream as many copies as you have of the disk, it would completely change the business model.But the law doesn&#x27;t say that. reply developer93 3 hours agorootparentprevStreaming is also bad for the planet, it needs a ton of servers which all need energy to run and produce emissions. I don&#x27;t have figures to mind right now but it wasn&#x27;t nothing. I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to distribution though. reply Matthias247 2 hours agorootparentIt is much cheaper. A server can easily handle hundreds to thousands of simultaneous streams. Even if the server is requiring 1kW of power for that, it makes a worst case of 10W per client. Maybe double it if you want to count in the datacenter overhead (like AC), but realistically Netflix is doing more like 4 digits of concurrent streams than 3 digits, so 10W as an upper bound feel wrong.That&#x27;s less than an end users TV will utilize, and it&#x27;s probably also less than a standalone DVD player requires. reply bzzzt 1 hour agorootparentYou&#x27;re not counting the energy costs of producing the DVD&#x27;s, shipping, storage and all the people involved who have to travel to work etc. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentprevIt’s much more ecological than every customer buying their own discs. It’s keeping that plastic in circulation instead of being trashed, and Netflix can ensure that defective discs are properly recycled, which consumers often won’t do.Streaming unfortunately is not a replacement, mostly due to the limited selection of titles and, in the case of Blu-ray&#x2F;UHD discs, reduced quality. reply tass 1 hour agorootparentprevThe planet is helped if this shutdown actually does reduce plastic and&#x2F;or gasoline use. For many people the alternative to Netflix dvd&#x2F;bluray rental is buying their own copies of discs instead.In my case I have a very good video rental store nearby but now I need to drive somewhere I wasn’t driving before. reply JKCalhoun 3 hours agorootparentprevNetflix is when I stopped buying plastic discs because I could rent them. reply usr1106 4 hours agorootparentprevData centers &#x2F; the internet are not ecological either: Similar energy consumption as the airline sector.(And that a significant part is wasted on running ads doesn&#x27;t make it any better.) reply bawolff 1 hour agorootparentI would assume in a direct comparison - streaming a couple gb from a data center is probably much more environmentally friendly than moving a physical disk across the country. reply walteweiss 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is valid statement. But I assume that will get much better over time, as computers are getting more energy efficient, which could change a lot en masse. Delivery of disks is harder to optimise, as you cannot just teleport them as easily. reply developer93 3 hours agorootparentIn practice it doesn&#x27;t though. Greater efficiency just leads to higher usage, if you look into it. Total emissions go up, this is why we can&#x27;t just technology our way out of this thing. We need to actually reduce total emissions not just per unit. reply Brybry 1 hour agorootparentUS residential electricity usage per capita has been relatively flat for a decade or two[1] so I think efficiency increases can offset higher usage.In regards to Netflix I suspect there&#x27;s a streaming bandwidth plateau we will hit (if we have not already): there are only so many hours per day people can watch content, population growth isn&#x27;t that strong (and can&#x27;t increase forever), and video resolution then becomes the driver of increased data use (and that probably can&#x27;t increase forever either).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=49036 reply rightbyte 2 hours agorootparentprevI guess the fundamental problem is that there is money in showing webpages for the sake of it, due to ads.It is like litter.Paper ads are somewhat limited due to consumer complaining about having their mailboxes filled with them and someone has to go there and put it in and can&#x27;t avoid a homeowner guarding the mailbox if they would force the issue.Using e.g. uBlock Origin might be the most impact for no effort environmentally friendly thing you could possibly do. reply mighmi 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is called Jevon&#x27;s paradox. reply midoridensha 4 hours agorootparentprev>(And that a significant part is wasted on running ads doesn&#x27;t make it any better.)Right, which is why it&#x27;s a moral imperative to use an ad-blocker.

Surely, for a desirable business, Netflix should be able to find a buyer for $1 or higher. That would let Netflix liquidate the asset &#x2F; business while keeping the business running.Tech industry economics are besides the point. Suppose tech industry economics expects (for the sake of argument, insanely) an internal rate of return of 300% on every dollar spent, while the IRR of the disc business is some measly fraction of that. By liquidating the disc business, Netflix gets to take whatever proceeds from the liquidation - even if it&#x27;s only $1 - and put it towards other internal usages that it expects that 300% IRR from.A price like $1 is so small that, presumably, you would go to whoever the current salaried worker is responsible for managing the disc business, offer them ownership for $1, and the manager-worker would happily take the opportunity to become a manager-owner of the desirable business that employs him at a price that anyone could afford.Of course, in the real world, there are various costs involved. So presumably, (a) the costs associated with liquidation are lower than the costs associated with spinning off the disc business, and (b) whatever the cost associated with spinning off the disc business, no buyer could be found for at least the sum of that cost plus $1; that such costs are indeed above what the salaried manager-worker of the current disc business could afford.Maybe that&#x27;s bullshit, maybe not, I don&#x27;t understand enough about Netflix&#x27;s disc business to know. But Hanlon&#x27;s Razor is the better guide here. Either Netflix&#x27;s board is going where the money is leading them to go, or they&#x27;re leaving money on the table for malicious reasons, and the second doesn&#x27;t make sense since it would expose them to shareholder lawsuits. reply gnomewascool 1 hour agorootparentSuch a disc-renting business would be a competitor to Netflix, both directly (especially in the hands of somebody who tried to focus on it, rather than reluctantly maintaining it, as Netflix has been doing recently) or because it could eventually try to repeat Netflix&#x27;s own pivot into streaming. Consequently, selling it off would be rather risky.The start-up costs and need of name-recognition are probably sufficient that it&#x27;d be hard for a new company try to fill this niche, but if they bought Netflix&#x27;s distribution network they could likely manage. reply jstanley 2 hours agorootparentprevEither the board knows something we don&#x27;t know, or they&#x27;re actively malicious? Are those the only 2 options?What if the board is just too busy, or mistaken, or stupid? reply solatic 1 hour agorootparentToo busy: what typically happens is that the concern of the spin-off of the disc business would be delegated to one &#x2F; a few board members whose responsibility would be to examine the issue and make a recommendation to the rest of the board. The board member(s) themselves are rarely the people doing the analysis of the options; instead they delegate to salaried workers (either of Netflix, a contractor, or working directly for the board member) who do the legwork. So the amount of time that a board member themself will spend on the deal is either zero (they&#x27;re not a member of the committee responsible for sourcing the recommendations) or fairly minimal.Mistaken is another form of stupid.And do you really think you get to be on the board of a ~$168 billion market cap public company by being stupid? reply checkyoursudo 1 hour agorootparentI know quite a lot of board members of various companies from my days as a lawyer.High intelligence is rarely a requirement.

They pioneered eerily accurate recommendations (anyone remember the Netflix recommendation challenges?). You rated all the movies out of 5 stars and Netflix recommended the best movies without any limits. Because they more or less had every movie ever made in their library! Their only incentive was to make you discover the best movie you wanted to watch! Irony was that dvd Netflix still maintained this rating system at least a few years back when I used it. I paid and kept it more for the list and recommendations than the discs themselves.When streaming started Netflix’s incentives changed: if you had a rank ordered personal watchlist, you’ll notice if the movie you added left the service. Back then they were also playing this game of circling the expensive movies in and out of the service every six months or a year - if your watchlist was unordered, you eventually saw the movie you wanted to watch in that list and could see it. They end up paying only half the license fees.In the end their recommendation system couldn’t be honest because they basically couldn’t stream the best movie you’d like to see. Not to mention they’d have to openly say the movies they commissioned are likely not going to be enjoyable for you personally. So they completely gutted the recommendation system into the ghastly crap we have today which is designed to hide their selection flaws than to serve you honestly.The other frustrating thing for me to see online is when people criticize Netflix for bad design decisions - till Hastings was running the ship, I felt every bad UX move they made was in genuine service of hiding the flaws necessitated by their limited licensing abilities. And they were damn smart about it too. Netflix’s greatest downfall was their content strategy which seems to be some idea of data driven predictive crap. They likely got buoyed by the success of the first few shows into thinking they can do everything with data. For the budget Netflix has nowadays if they actually got their content act together theyd be a much larger powerhouse.

There was no way they actually worked, and they clearly had one real antenna on the roof somewhere. reply rasz 1 hour agorootparentThe sad thing is technologically their argument was 100% bulletproof and system indeed worked. \"antenna\" was whole tuner system outputting digitized video feed, one per customer - USB TV tuners have been single digit dollar cheap for last 10 years.Supreme Court (donors&#x2F;lobbyists) simply didnt like the business model. &#x27;these behind-the-scenes technological differences do not distinguish Aereo’s system from cable systems&#x27; means it doesnt matter how you provide content as long as end effect is similar to cable TV. Imo bad ruling. reply bonzini 5 hours agorootparentprevThe suggestion in the parent comment is a bit different because one would think that the first sale doctrine applies. Unfortunately the courts are chipping at it more and more every year. reply VanTheBrand 2 hours agorootparentFirst sale doctrine doesn’t give you at right to publicly perform something any more than tuning in with an antenna does. Wouldn’t make a difference here. reply nlawalker 10 hours agoparentprevZediva!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=zedivahttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Warner_Bros._Entertainment_Inc....> The court held that the defendants were transmitting and publicly performing the plaintiffs&#x27; copyrighted works, and thus granted plaintiffs&#x27; motion for preliminary injunction. reply bigtunacan 7 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s been a couple of attempts, but that wouldn&#x27;t service the same customers. Most customers still using Netflix DVDs by mail are in rural areas without adequate internet or just not interested in streaming. reply tim-- 1 hour agoparentprevNetflix had deals with the studios. When you rented a Netflix DVD, it was highly unlikely (not impossible) that you would receive a retail disk. reply jquery 8 hours agoprevIs it unprofitable? The article seemed to imply the business was still profitable, it was just small relative to the success of streaming. Or perhaps it suffers from adverse selection... the only people still using the service are the least profitable heavy users? I wish the article delved into that instead of being a Netflix puff piece. reply kibwen 8 hours agoparentRight? With $60 million in revenue, that&#x27;s quite a few customers (and if they haven&#x27;t switched to streaming by now, those are loyal customers indeed). If there&#x27;s any profit in it at all, that&#x27;s a lifestyle business waiting to happen. reply upon_drumhead 8 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a ton of smaller players that have gotten a huge bump.

More are in the works though. reply quickthrower2 7 hours agorootparentDisc via mail can win these sorts of people:* People&#x2F;areas with poor internet connection. Or no internet connection (but a way to occasionally get on e.g. a library)* People who want to make watching a movie a special event at home, not just a dooms-scrolling life filler.* People who want to see decent movies :-) that are not available for streaming* People who want to rip the DVDS :-)* People who are set in their ways have a DVD connected to a big TV and don&#x27;t want to mess around with tech. reply fbdab103 7 hours agorootparentPlus the quality. I do not think any streaming service offers the same fidelity as a local Blueray. reply bombcar 7 hours agorootparentEven DVD to be honest; the resolution of the stream is basically unimportant, what really matters is the bitrate, and DVD is high, Blu-ray is insane (10.08 Mbit&#x2F;s vs 40-100Mbit&#x2F;s). reply ihattendorf 6 hours agorootparentDVD’s mpeg 2 is vastly inferior to h.265&#x2F;av1 used by most streaming providers. And there’s only so much quality you can get out of a 480p frame.4k blu-ray is much better than any streaming provider, though. And 1080p blu-ray about equal to 4k streaming. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentprevResolution stops mattering much at a certain point, but that point is higher than a slightly widened standard definition.And other people mentioned that codec matters, but not the full extent. Not only is the encoding on a DVD about 10x worse than a modern codec, 10Mbps is a peak you&#x27;re unlikely to ever see. I&#x27;m skeptical that a well-encoded 1Mbps 720p stream would ever lose to a DVD, and I&#x27;m confident that at 2Mbps you&#x27;d leave the DVD in the dust. reply ramraj07 6 hours agorootparentprevThis would be true if you’re still using Huygens satellite internet lol. reply throwaway2037 1 hour agorootparentDo you mean \"Hughes\"?

Most content lends itself to being heavily compressed with minimal loss of quality. reply tivert 6 hours agorootparentprev> * People who want to see decent movies :-) that are not available for streamingOr people who don&#x27;t want to juggle 10 different streaming services reply jjav 4 hours agorootparent> Or people who don&#x27;t want to juggle 10 different streaming servicesThat&#x27;s the huge one. Availability is so fragmented for streaming that it&#x27;s just not worth it. A DVD service that has everything in one place is gold. reply alostpuppy 4 hours agorootparentprevGood call!! Also people that want the original music on older TV shows. reply tivert 4 hours agorootparent> Good call!! Also people that want the original music on older TV shows.A DVD rental service won&#x27;t necessarily get you that either. For some stuff filmed before buying DVD sets was a thing, you may only be able to get the original music from a tape someone made off of TV.

It LOOKS scammy as hell, too, and copy like \"No Black-out period...why wait up to 56 days! Rentals ship same day as the official Blu-ray!\" doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence.The link to check their SSL certificate is also invalid. &#x27;There is no readily available contact info, or corporate info.Every hallmark of a scam site. reply quickthrower2 7 hours agorootparentprevIt would be less than 1% of their revenue. So imagine a programmer on $100k&#x2F;y, who makes $600&#x2F;y on a side hustle, that $600 cannot grow but needs to do extra tax paperwork, devote attention to it. And the customers of that hustle will leave if they sell the business on. At the same time they are on an upward trajectory at work and expect to get to $500k&#x2F;y and are putting their focus into that. reply kibwen 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not arguing that it isn&#x27;t a negligible percentage of Netflix&#x27;s profit, I&#x27;m arguing that this is a service with high demonstrated demand and it&#x27;s a shame to see it shut down despite that demand. reply fbdab103 7 hours agorootparentprevI would love to see a survey, but my guess of those customers is that streaming is not a viable option. An unfathomably large percentage of the USA still has meager internet connections. reply capitainenemo 7 hours agorootparentPersonally I&#x27;m in a metropolitan area, but I just liked the far greater selection on the DVD service, and the availability of French and Spanish language tracks. reply evan_ 8 hours agoparentprevThey tried to spin the DVD business off in 2011 (as “Qwikster”) and the user base revolted. I wonder if it would be more successful if they tried it today. reply deaddodo 6 hours agorootparentThey weren&#x27;t really trying to spin it off.Regardless, that&#x27;s not why people \"revolted\"; people were annoyed that their legacy subscriptions (streaming + DVDs) would no longer exist and that they would have to buy two 10usd subscriptions, essentially doubling the price overnight. reply rightbyte 5 hours agorootparentThat is the thing. Renting DVDs provide way more value for less dollars for most consumers. Especially movie watchers. reply anoncow 8 hours agoprevat around 100 mil of revenue, I wonder how profitable the DVD business was for netflix. reply ClassyJacket 6 hours agoprev [–] When I first heard an American on the internet talk about Netflix mailing DVDs, I thought it was a joke.Kind of like if someone said TikTok existed in the 90s and they used to mail VHS tapes of people&#x27;s home recordings. reply jtuple 5 hours agoparentNetflix has been around since 1997. At that time, directly streaming movies to consumers was techincally impossible anywhere in the world. As a non-American, how were you watching movies in 1997?And yeah TikTok&#x2F;etc didn&#x27;t exist then. No one hard smartphones and the Internet was text&#x2F;GIF only.That said, we used to have the America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos show. People mailed in VHS recordings of their kids&#x2F;pets doing cute, funny, or cringe things. This aired on TV and people voted to pick a winner. People could win $10k-100k in prize money. So yeah, proto YT or whatever was a thing, just scaled to available tech at the time.EDIT: Just realized AFHV is still around, and will outlive Netflix DVDs. *That* certainly feels like a joke. How does a network television meme show still exist in 2023??? reply pyuser583 4 hours agorootparentNetflix was founded on August 29, 1997. In the Terminator franchise, that’s the day nuclear war destroys the world (“Judgement Day”).I wonder if that was coincidence. reply eCa 4 hours agorootparentprev> directly streaming movies to consumers was techincally impossible anywhere in the world.Yeah, a 33.6 kb&#x2F;s modem vs a station wagon hurtling down the highway with a dvd is a fair fight. reply ClassyJacket 5 hours agorootparentprevI did not think they were streaming movies in 1997 and I did not say I thought they were streaming movies in 1997. I thought they simply did not exist until years later when they started streaming.
