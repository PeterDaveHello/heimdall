Now, only Stellantis remains uncommitted. By Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Dec 19, 2023, 10:24 PM UTC| Share this story Image: VW Volkswagen Group, which also owns Audi, Porsche, and Scout Motors, is finally doing what nearly every other automaker has already done: announce its intention to adopt Tesla’s electric vehicle charging standard. VW said it is “exploring adapter solutions” so that its current EV owners can access Tesla’s Supercharger network and expects to have something to roll out by 2025. That same year, you’ll start to see new VW electric vehicles rolling off the assembly line with Tesla’s charging port natively installed. All told, VW says the deal will give its customers access to 15,000 Supercharger locations in North America. VW said it is “exploring adapter solutions” Of course, VW is incredibly late to this parade. Things started rolling in November 2022, when Tesla announced that it was renaming its charging technology to the North American Charging Standard (NACS) and would be opening it up to other automakers. Ford came first, then GM, and then, well, everyone else. Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s largest automakers, with brands like Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Porsche, and Lamborghini under its umbrella, stayed mum throughout. All we got was some reporting that the company was “in talks” with Tesla. That story followed the news that Electrify America, VW’s EV charging subsidiary, would begin adding Tesla charging plugs itself. The rest of Germany’s auto industry soon followed, including BMW, Mini, and Mercedes-Benz. Until recently, Tesla Superchargers were exclusive to Tesla owners. In fact, it was one of Tesla’s main selling points: consistent, exclusive, and abundant EV charging. But that began to change several years ago when the company started offering access to non-Tesla EVs —first in Europe and then in the US after the Biden administration said it would be a prerequisite to tap into some of the $7.5 billion for EV charging in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Tesla’s Supercharger network is widely recognized as superior to many of the third-party EV charging stations, most of which feature CCS plugs and the less utilized CHAdeMO charging standard. The company says it has 45,000 Superchargers worldwide, 12,000 of which are located in the US. And while other EV charging stations struggle with software glitches and faulty chargers, Tesla says its Superchargers are nearly perfect in their reliability. The company says that the average uptime of Supercharger sites last year amounted to 99.95 percent, down marginally from 99.96 percent in 2021. Now, with VW out of the way, Tesla can train all of its attention on the last real holdout: Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep, Chrysler, Ram, Dodge, Peugeot, Fiat, and many more.

We are working on crazy-low-cost L2 chargers for multifamily apartments. Plug-and-charge is a sine-qua-non for us.One still major unsolved problem is the lack of agreement on a standard for payment&#x2F;powerline communication from the EVSE to the vehicle. OCPP 2.0.1 and ISO 15118 is supposed to bring \"Plug and Charge\" capabilities -- this, in theory, would allow drivers to simply pull up to a station, plug in, and charging start right away. i.e. No more fiddling with multiple different manufacturer&#x27;s apps, no more being SOL if your phone battery is dead.While we&#x27;re seeing agreement on the physical standard for the shape and size of the conductors, there&#x27;s still progress to be made on the protocol between vehicles and charger. Tesla refuses to implement OCPP because they have a great walled garden right now and don&#x27;t want to release the stranglehold on the payments.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starlightcharging.com reply xpe 6 hours agoparentSome feedback: I only barely realized \"plug-and-charge\" means something specific. [1] Generally speaking, I wouldn&#x27;t expect people to know what you mean by the phrase. The problem is that people think they know because it sounds so obvious. The phrase comes across more like: \"obviously, yeah, I plug it in and it charges\". That understanding leaves vague the number of steps required between \"plug\" and \"charge\".[1] e.g. \"The Plug and Charge protocol tells the charging station what kind of EV you&#x27;re plugging in and conveniently bills you.\" from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caranddriver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;a35044132&#x2F;plug-and-charge-... reply akouri 6 hours agorootparentThis is helpful. Generally the customers that land on our website are people who are researching which EV charging solution to install in their apartment complex, so I assumed that they already knew the term. But I guess it&#x27;s helpful to spell it out. reply lvturner 5 hours agorootparentfurther: EV user and have also have been involved (lightly) in some public(ish) EV Charging projects -- this is the first time I&#x27;ve come across the term \"Plug And Charge\" in reference to a protocol!Upside: Every day is a school day and now I have something fun to read in to! reply bravoetch 4 hours agorootparentThe phrase seems like it&#x27;s charge as in billing, not charge as in electricity. Not sure if that is intentional or a happy pun. Anyone that has only experienced Tesla may even assume that superchargers are what everyone else experiences too. Just plug it in and get charged... and billed. reply taneq 5 hours agorootparentprevAah wait so it&#x27;s Plug-And-Supply-Currency rather than Plug-And-Supply-Current? reply why_at 15 hours agoparentprevCan you explain why you feel plug-and-charge is so important? I have used chargers with and without it and while it is slightly more convenient to just plug in and go, it doesn&#x27;t feel like such a huge improvement that I absolutely need it.I agree that having a different app for every brand of charging station would be annoying, but what about just accepting a credit card the way we do with gas stations now? reply jakewins 14 hours agorootparentHave you done any road tripping in an EV? my experience of the app-based charging landscape has been complete horror; apps don’t work, chargers don’t start, payments don’t through..Just last month was a new app at McDonalds in Sweden, that one asks me to, in the freezing cold, scan a dirty QR code sticker, which takes me to a website I’ve never heard of that wants me to manually enter credit card info, like a phishing attack smorgasbord.It’s the one thing I miss from a gas car: just let me fill up. reply afavour 14 hours agorootparentIMO that would be better solved by mandating tap and pay payment at EV charging spots. Integrating payments into the charging standard feels like a wild overcomplication by comparison. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentNot only that, how do you even propose to do it?If you just send the payment info via the charging plug, now you have to worry about the payment info being stored in the car and potentially stolen if the car has any security vulnerabilities, including in the charging port.If you use some kind of tokenization or similar then you&#x27;re inserting third party payment processors into the system and they&#x27;ll be wanting a cut.Just put a card reader on the charger and be done with it. reply tzs 11 hours agorootparentAnother reason for a card reader is that it easily handles the case of a borrowed EV.It is customary when borrowing someone&#x27;s ICE car to pay for the gas used by returning the car with as much gas as it had when you borrowed it, or even with a full tank. I&#x27;d expect people will want to continue that custom when the car is an EV. reply chmod775 8 hours agorootparentprevAll the car needs to store is some private key corresponding to yourself, to prove it&#x27;s that car. On modern hardware you can make these really hard to steal, short of taking the entire chip with you.Worse case, if someone steals that key (or the hardware that stores it), they can steal electricity with it. Which also means they&#x27;ll be caught approximately tomorrow.If you have that level of access&#x2F;capability, there&#x27;s better things to do than using it to get 50 dollars worth of electricity and probably being picked up by police as you siphon it.Besides, there&#x27;s easier and stealthier ways to get free electricity. reply mikepurvis 11 hours agorootparentprevParticularly in a world where every new phone and smartwatch integrates tap-to-pay, seems like a no-brainer to just integrate at that point. reply Retric 10 hours agorootparentprevCars don’t need to have credit card details onboard.Hypothetical standard: Charger lets car open a low bandwidth internet connection. Car uses it (or cellular) to open an encrypted channel to a 3rd part service (Tesla&#x2F;Visa&#x2F;whatever) saying it’s VIN, password, and the charger’s ID. Charger gets payment from 3rd party.PS: I would rather chargers just had working credit card readers, but individual chargers don’t do many transactions per day so apps are a cost saving thing. reply AnthonyMouse 4 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re getting at the root of the problem here, which is that Visa doesn&#x27;t actually support anything like that and \"whatever\" is going to add another grubby middle man to the transaction, which is the thing that most needs to be prevented.You&#x27;re fundamentally trying to transfer your money to the operator of the charger, but they aren&#x27;t standing around to give cash to, so you want something digital. Alright, so your bank should do this -- you authorize your car&#x27;s private key to make withdrawals from your bank account at charging points and we&#x27;re all set. Except that banks suck at this sort of thing, which is why we have the credit&#x2F;debit network to create some kind of standard. Except the standard is credit cards, not public key cryptography.You wanted to give your money to the charging point operator but instead you have to give it to your bank to give it to Visa to give it to the charging point operator. Now we&#x27;re going to add \"Tesla&#x2F;whatever\" to the chain? This needs to stop. You stick with the card reader until you figure out how to get banks, using some kind of standard, to support the public&#x2F;private key thing and we can remove a middle man instead of adding one. reply matthewdgreen 2 hours agorootparentVisa et al are going to charge a minimum transaction fee for small-value transactions, which covers the typical charging session. Third party services are an advantage, because they can bundle small transactions together and take advantage of their economies of scale and their own fraud models. There is a world where Visa and the payment card industry looked forward in the year 2005 and said “IoT devices like EVs will need payment capability, let’s think about how to be essential to this ecosystem in a way that removes the need for third party services and saves everyone money” but that kind of technical innovation seems to be outside of their core competency. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentThe transactions are of higher value than many public transport tickets, and those are already common — either as normal purchases from a ticket machine, or with the special transaction type used when the payment card is touched to the reader on the ticket barrier.Following a recent trip I had a bunch of ~1€ transactions from buying single bus&#x2F;metro tickets from machines. reply matthewdgreen 1 hour agorootparentVisa charges a 5-10 cent fixed fee plus a percentage for those 1 Euro transactions. Presumably public transport just eats those costs, but in a commodity business like electricity I imagine it’s a noticeable chunk of the profit margin. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparent1 cent fixed fee + percentage seems to be the standard where I am. It might be difficult in other EU countries but IIRC the fixed fee is capped at 5cents. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentprev> of ~1€ transactionsIn Europe, sure because the fees are capped. In the US you pay a fixed fee + x% which makes small transactions like this prohibitively expensive reply Retric 3 hours agorootparentprevI agree, except Visa and Mastercard are willing to innovate. Apple Pay&#x2F;Google Wallet for cars isn’t an unrealistic goal. reply sonicanatidae 12 hours agorootparentprevWouldn&#x27;t presence of the key address most of this?Sure, they can steal the car AND the key, but more often, it&#x27;s the car alone. reply afavour 14 hours agorootparentprevnext [3 more] [flagged] AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThis is something you add support for as an optional convenience feature because you can do it entirely in software, not something you require people to use. You still need a card reader on the charger.This is the fundamental problem with all of this stuff -- nobody wants your app. If you can&#x27;t make it better than sticking a card in the machine, go away. If you can, prove it, by making it an alternative to sticking a card in the machine instead of the only option. reply andrelaszlo 13 hours agorootparentprevCan&#x27;t read. Does it say USB-C? ;) reply Animats 12 hours agorootparentprevThe tap-and-pay RF people need to get their act together. The average number of tries needed to get a good read is > 1. For Veriphone units, > 2.Please make it clear where, exactly, the near-field antenna is. Behind the screen? Behind the logo that looks like WiFi? Somewhere inside a separate hockey-puck device? And indicate when the reader is active, too. Light up something.One place I visit regularly had a POS system which worked perfectly. They recently switched it out for a Clover unit with much lower read reliability and a worse customer-facing UI. reply VBprogrammer 11 hours agorootparentFor what it&#x27;s worth, contactless is ubiquitous in the UK – the experience is almost always seamless. The only exception being the odd reader with the antenna in a stupid place (these have gotten less common over time) or when your bank decides to force a pin check. reply g_p 10 hours agorootparentHow would paying for an EV charge work like this? Would you select an amount of credit in currency (presumably via buttons on the charger?) then tap-to-pay for that amount?(I believe there are some limitations on tap-to-pay transactions to prevent a merchant presenting the transaction with a different value after actually tapping the card.)I think a lot of \"pay at pump\" fuel stations require a full insertion of the card to pre-authorize a large amount, then release it as a partial refund once the amount of fuel dispensed is known.Would this be a barrier to EV charging, if you need a way to communicate this upfront, or have to effectively replicate out EMV infrastructure on totally unmonitored terminals with PIN readers (and likely the next card skimming scandal brewing)?Also, how would contactless-only work for cards that get soft locked to be inserted for a PIN check? Would there be a way for EV chargers to be exempted from this? Or would people end up stuck and unable to charge as there&#x27;s no available place with a PIN reader they can use to unlock their contactless payments? reply sitharus 8 hours agorootparentPay-at-pump is ubiquitous here in New Zealand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen a station without it for years. This may be because around 90% of all retail transactions are done with payment cards here.It&#x27;s easy. You select the max amount (up to NZ$200), tap your card, and it&#x27;s done. Pick up the right fuel nozzle, refuel, and go. Exactly the same can be done on EV chargers.The process card-side is not a charge-and-refund as refunds have fees to the merchant. Rather it&#x27;s a pre-authentication and finalisation. Pre-auth holds the funds for a set time (determined by the merchant agreement with the bank) and the vendor can finalise the charge up to the pre-authentication amount. Most hotels and car rental places do this for security deposits as well, if they don&#x27;t charge or explicitly cancel your bank will release the fund hold at the end of the holding period. reply baloki 10 hours agorootparentprevThey generally pre-auth for either £20 or £40 and then update the amount post-transaction.In terms of PIN check, the card is just declined with an appropriate error message because you can’t insert it and the next time you use a contactless machine it asks for the card to be inserted and a PIN entered.For petrol (gas) pumps in the UK it generally auths either £1 or £99. reply g_p 10 hours agorootparentMakes sense and matched my understanding of the pay at pump preauth for a fixed amount.I guess the issue then becomes relying on contactless (only) without the hardware for full EMV with PIN, as then someone whose card has been used contactless one too many times can&#x27;t charge, and potentially ends up stuck there.It does feel like contactless is a good convenience measure, but probably isn&#x27;t ideal as the only mechanism on a reader for charging infrastructure.Unrelated to this, but not being able to initiate charging without internet access (for online auth of cards, and the ones that can only be used online) also is likely to become an issue in rural areas, as well as give quite a few resilience issues if cloud infrastructure isn&#x27;t available, or internet backhaul from the area is disrupted. Even once power is restored after a storm, if comms are down (like with Storm Arwen), this doesn&#x27;t sound ideal for EV charging... reply aaronmdjones 4 hours agorootparentprevI only have experience with Shell, Morrisons, and Tesco pay-at-pump stations. In all of those, you have to physically insert your card and type in your PIN; contactless does not exist. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentprevPublic transport transactions (where the reader is directly on the ticket gate) are exempted from the soft lock, so maybe EV chargers could be too. At least for small amounts. reply tharkun__ 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s a large amount? I haven&#x27;t inserted my card at Costco for a very long time now. Just tap.If the pump pre-authorizes an amount (many non-Costco gas stations I go to make you choose an amount to authorize) it simply never captures more than was actually used.Now why would any of this be fundamentally different for EVs? You have a rough gauge for how much \"fuel\" i.e. \"juice\" you need, pre-authorize enough money but only capture what actually got used. Done. Why do EVs need to be special? reply Daneel_ 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s ubiquitous in Australia as well. I haven’t carried a wallet in almost 5 years. My credit card, driver’s license, and other important cards are all digital. reply barrkel 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m increasingly finding that my phone is detected while I&#x27;m still moving it towards the scanner, and it complains that my phone moved too fast. Then I have to wait like a schmuck until something resets and I can do it again. reply Affric 11 hours agorootparentprevI want to echo this. When contactless is ubiquitous there are pretty much no problems. reply xp84 10 hours agorootparentI don’t know if I agree. It’s exceedingly rare now to find a place which doesn’t accept contactless in America, but we have these problems still.Besides dumb inconsistent terminals, the main thing holding it back is (A) customers don’t use it because they either don’t know it’s much faster than our garbage chip readers, or they have been burned by hunting for the right spot to tap. And (B) even the clerks don’t use it because until about this year there was a significant fraction of cards out there without NFC and who wants to hunt for the logo instead of just always shoving it in the (stupid slow) chip reader. There still might be plenty if you count debit cards which I never use but are very popular. reply harshreality 7 hours agorootparent> It’s exceedingly rare now to find a place which doesn’t accept contactless in America...Lowe&#x27;s and Home Depot? Walmart, still?Companies still hoping to silo people into their own apps or antiquated payment method, which might give them a slight cc processing fee reduction that boosts their margins... at the cost of being a usability nightmare for anyone who doesn&#x27;t shop there frequently. I expect that frequent shoppers will live with whatever a store does, and set up a custom app, if any, or accept using a physical card.It&#x27;s easy to see that their approach is petty, because Costco, which has fanatical customers and is members-only—there are no casual infrequent shoppers—got on board with nfc (card and smartphone) payments years ago. If any business could&#x27;ve gotten away with having their own app and special payment processing deals to save money, it&#x27;s Costco. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s very odd, as this has been working smoothly in the EU for around a decade, depending on the country. It&#x27;s so reliable that you can pay for bus&#x2F;metro&#x2F;train tickets in London (since 2014) and many other cities directly at the ticket barrier [1 for photo], which would cause problems if cards were failing or slow.The only time I&#x27;m confused is when there&#x27;s an unusual card reader, usually a low-budget all-in-one type with a touchscreen, as it&#x27;s not always clear where the NFC reader is. This is maybe 1-2% of transactions.Every so often a machine makes the \"dur dur\" noise and I have to use the chip and my PIN. I&#x27;m not sure if this is every Nth transaction, or after spending ¤X. Either way, it&#x27;s to avoid a lot of contactless payments being made if the card is stolen. (And maybe this is irrelevant in the USA, without PINs?)\"8 out of 10 card payments now contactless in the Nordics\" [2]. 54% in the whole EU [3], only 34% in the USA [4].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intelligenttransport.com&#x2F;transport-articles&#x2F;1153...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nets.eu&#x2F;Media-and-press&#x2F;news&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;8-out-of-10-c...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.ecb.europa.eu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;blog-posts&#x2F;contactless-payme...[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ktvz.com&#x2F;stacker-money&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;01&#x2F;american-consumers... reply recursive 8 hours agorootparentprevSometimes I try to use the tap-to-pay. When I try, more often than not, I cannot get it to work, and then I use the chip anyway.So usually, I just use the chip to save time. replyhighwaylights 12 hours agorootparentprevIt also brings that part of the charging experience to parity with gas, which is really simple for non-tech savvy switchers to understand.The process for EV and gas refuelling is then identical:Lift thingamabob -> tap card -> plug into car -> leaveEasy. reply Sophira 11 hours agorootparentprevOkay, hear me out here. What&#x27;s stopping us from just having payments be out of band, like with petrol?Is being able to ask your car to make a long drive across long distances on its own actually something people want to do? Or is it a solution in search of a problem?(Disclaimer, I live in the UK and not the US. It&#x27;s possible there are cultural reasons I&#x27;ve missed.) reply henrikschroder 7 hours agorootparentprevI saw that Norway is now mandating tap and pay at all new EV charging spots.I agree, that&#x27;s the way to go. Charging an EV has to be just as easy as filling up a gas car. Pull up, tap you card, plug in. There&#x27;s zero reason for having to fiddle with apps and memberships and qr codes and whatever else bullshit. reply spaceywilly 13 hours agorootparentprevIf I may ask what seems like an obvious question… why can’t they just use credit card terminals like gas stations have been using for many decades? reply yurishimo 13 hours agorootparentThey could, and many do, but the difference is that those types of interfaces are mandated&#x2F;regulated while EV charging is not. Guess what&#x27;s slightly cheaper when amortized across tens of thousands of customers in the products lifetime? Not to mention the amount of data that could be mined from those customers by having yet another app on their phone with bullshit location permissions \"for the best user experience.\"Every gas pump has looked&#x2F;functioned largely the same since the widespread adoption of cashless payments around the world. Until governments mandate a standard payment interface, I think it&#x27;s more likely that companies will continue to find ways to mine data from consumers through shitty apps.Oh, and that&#x27;s not even to mention the companies that include some amount of \"free charging\" credits with the purchase of the vehicle. Not only is that cost baked into the cost of the car, you&#x27;re also disincentivized from using the network at all because of how crappy it is. &#x2F;tinfoilhat reply flutas 12 hours agorootparentIIRC the federal infrastructure bill required chargers to accept via CC reader or plug and charge. So I&#x27;m sure we will be seeing more chargers with it shortly. reply btown 7 hours agorootparentYep: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalregister.gov&#x2F;d&#x2F;2023-03500&#x2F;p-48 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalregister.gov&#x2F;d&#x2F;2023-03500&#x2F;p-370> This final rule establishes a requirement that charging stations must provide a contactless payment method that accepts major credit and debit cards and accept payment through either an automated toll-free phone number or a short message&#x2F;messaging system (commonly abbreviated as SMS). Payment methods must be accessible to persons with disabilities, not require a membership, not affect the power flow to vehicles, and provide access for those that are limited English proficient. reply spaceywilly 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah that just seems like a poor decision on the part of these charger owners. I feel like there’s an opportunity for a company called “EZCharge - we take credit cards”. People will seek it out when looking for a charging station because they know they won’t need to download a BS app.Or maybe another solution would be like WeChat Pay in China, something that’s so ubiquitous that all stores just have a QR code you scan to pay for anything nowadays. I’m surprised nothing like that has taken off in the US, it’s crazy convenient. reply seanmcdirmid 13 hours agorootparentThere is no way to communicate when you are charged up that way, maybe via an SMS that you add with your phone number. Also, you have to communicate your charging preference somehow. It’s not like pumping gas, you rarely want it to stop at 100%, although the charging standard might at least be able to control that from the car. reply spaceywilly 12 hours agorootparentTrue I see what you mean, but that would seem to be an easy function to build into the car’s charging controller. I’m not sure how it works today but I would imagine most cars have a “stop charging at x%” function already without depending on the charger for that. reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agorootparentYa, I think they even get status otherwise I’m not sure how electrify America’s app works in the first place.I once charged at an L2 in Canada that involved a QR code, and then payment via a web form. In that case, a POS would make the setup too expensive compared to just putting power out there with a networked microcontroller. reply ska 12 hours agorootparentprev> There is no way to communicate when you are charged up that wayCant&#x27; the car do it? reply staplers 11 hours agorootparentOr ya know.. the pump, like has existed for decades.. reply ska 11 hours agorootparentI thought the problem was that it takes long enough that you aren&#x27;t by the \"pump\" during process. Also that the chargepoints are likely less infrastructure than a pump. So something has to contact you (SMS&#x2F;email&#x2F;whatever) reply RulerOf 8 hours agorootparentYeah... cars come with internet connections these days, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the car&#x27;s job. replyal_borland 12 hours agorootparentprevSo solving this problem would be as simple as mandating&#x2F;regulating it? Sounds like a no-brainer to end this debate, standardize things, and allow the build out to happen in a quick and standard way across companies.With all the EV goals that various countries are making, this seems like a foundational part of it. Consumers aren&#x27;t going to buy into EVs in mass until charging in a solved problem. reply mensetmanusman 11 hours agorootparentThe epic solution is free charging financed by gasoline taxes. reply xp84 10 hours agorootparentThat would be quite effective IF it were tenable, but this is a solution in search of a revolution, lol (speaking strictly for the US). I wish I were joking, but politically you would have an easier time abolishing Christmas than something like this. Pitchforks would be wielded by 2 groups:1. numbskulls who hate EVs because they believe that being able to add 400 miles of range in their F150 in 5 minutes (ie gasoline) is the only okay way to do energy for every vehicle.2. People with a good point that EVs are very expensive and why should poorer people subsidize the rich when the poors can’t even afford an EV. reply Tostino 10 hours agorootparentThat second point is personally the sticking point for me. No reason the less-well-off should subsidize those who have the ability to purchase a new vehicle. reply mensetmanusman 9 hours agorootparentMost of the tax revenue does not come from the poor though. They could still be given EVs regardless. replySmoosh 13 hours agorootparentprev> Not to mention the amount of data that could be mined from those customersThat was my cynical take on it. reply dkjaudyeqooe 12 hours agorootparentprevRV charging has much smaller installations than gas. Instead of gas stations, the most common SV charging will eventually be thick poles on the footpath so you can charge wherever you park, or small one or two bay charging facilities at various businesses. That&#x27;s the sort of charging infrastructure you want and seamless payment solutions is an enabling tech. reply belltaco 7 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s RV and SV charging? reply dkjaudyeqooe 1 hour agorootparentS and R are on either side of E, so I&#x27;m guessing I meant EV. reply why_at 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah I agree having a different app for each station sucks, but I don&#x27;t really understand how plug-and-charge would solve this. For anything that does support plug-and-charge, don&#x27;t you still need to register the payment method somewhere in advance?Unless we have some universal payment processor which all the charging networks agree to use I will still need register through an app or something when I encounter a new brand of charger on a road trip.It seems like the real solution is a law which requires the stations to accept a more universal payment system like credit cards. I think there is already a law like this in California IIRC. reply akouri 12 hours agorootparentTap & Pay still requires you to fiddle with a station and slows you down. If you are plugging in at home (which is our target market), the fewer interactions needed the better. Imagine every time you get home you need to take your wallet out, tap the machine, wait for some 3rd party api to talk to the charger in the dimly lit basement, and then and only then you can leave. This is like 30 seconds of your day wasted.Plus, ultimately we want to make charging as cheap as possible and having to pay the $.30 interchange fee each time a user plugs in would add a ton of overhead to our cost model. reply alibarber 11 hours agorootparentIt takes something like half of a second for my Apple Pay Amex&#x2F;Visa to let me through the barrier in the London Underground, and the complexity they have to deal with for fare calculations is quite something too. reply wh0knows 5 hours agorootparentThe fare isn’t calculated on the spot though, a base amount is authorized and then only charged later.

In the UK a lot of fuel pumps have credit&#x2F;debit card readers built in, and if not cards are accepted everywhere for payment already. But yes electric charging companies here are still wierd about accepting such standardised payments, and we did just introduce a new law about it [0] promising \"most\" but not all chargers will accept cards.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-laws-to-make-charging... reply ketralnis 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve done a fair amount of road tripping (~15k mi over 1.5yr) along the WA&#x2F;OR&#x2F;CA&#x2F;NV corridors where Electrify America is dense enough to use solely, which is convenient since my car came with 2 years of free charging from them.Ignoring their pervasive station reliability problems, their app is pretty bad and only barely functions.* I&#x27;ve had to skip a perfectly functioning station because the app thought I was still charging from the previous time and wouldn&#x27;t change its mind about it.* Their Carplay app has literally never worked for me, not once (usually it shows me still charging from a session >1wk ago even when the regular app doesn&#x27;t, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t boot, sometimes it shows me as not logged in. The main screen has never once rendered.).* One of their level 2 stations (which tend even less reliable) existed in the app on about 50% of refreshes.* The app requires a pretty solid signal to work at all since it seems to consult their API to query for stations near where you are and then you guess at which one it is (\"is this the target one or the mall one? it&#x27;s the target that&#x27;s in the mall?\") which is pretty silly when you&#x27;re parked at the station so it&#x27;s in range of your hands and eyes.* I eventually figured out that I can add the EA plan to my Apple Wallet and tap the phone instead of ever opening the app, but that seems to randomly select between the \"free\" plan (rather, included in the purchase price of my car) and the $10 balance that they make me maintain for god-knows-why when at California electricity prices no charge has ever been below $10.* The stations have credit card readers which I&#x27;ve never tried to use but almost always when I see somebody having trouble at a station it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re fighting with that thing. I assume EA&#x27;s response would be \"just use the app, it&#x27;s so much better\"That&#x27;s all just one app, not a slew of them for every charging network in my area (which also includes at least evgo & chargepoint just to cover the big ones). The sooner this app bullshit can die the better. reply progman32 11 hours agorootparentEvery time I use the app I have to force quit it at least once to get it to stop doing whatever backend query it&#x27;s doing. Doesn&#x27;t help that their chargers are barely compatible with my car (2014 i3) so the charging fails to start about half the time. The machine itself rejects the charge in about ten seconds so no big deal, but the app isn&#x27;t built to handle this case and takes multiple minutes to realize something is wrong. So my charging cycle is to initiate via app, plug in, see a failed charge, force quit the app, find the station again, and repeat probably twice. Probably isn&#x27;t this bad with newer cars, but I love my car otherwise.

I guess people also do give out tons of personal details just because some form asks them. It goes against any and all security advice even regular people are now given. I guess it&#x27;s true: the brosephs ook over...So having an electric car requires an smartphone, one on which you can install random software, where you want to install random software, and have internet (cause I suppose there&#x27;s no WiFi at those bornes) and you have a CC (also not true for many).Good to know that this isn&#x27;t for me. replyjdsully 14 hours agorootparentprevSome chargers have tap&pay on the machine like a gas pump.

One issue is that the vendors for these keyfobs are super fragmented -- even more so than Plug & Charge adoption. reply g_p 11 hours agorootparentWorth being aware that, as well as keyfobs being super fragmented, many are woefully insecure. Think \"they just say their ID number when you put them in a reader field\".That means you can trivially clone them. Not hugely exciting for access to a (common) hallway in a large building. If cloning someone else&#x27;s fob gets you free car charging, the incentive is there to clone them. Also, not all buildings will use unique fobs per \"unit\" (and you&#x27;d likely need to support per-resident&#x2F;tenant fob uniqueness... And something for guests!) -- sometimes it&#x27;s a single hardcoded value for the whole block or door zone that the fob opens...You can, of course, build something proper using NFC (and a smartcard running a smartcard applet), which is effectively like your own custom mini \"chip and PIN\" EMV system -- you would have to design and implement the wire protocol to authenticate the card etc etc, and all the security design around that, but it could be done.

Regular petrol stations figured out pay at the pump decades ago. Why is this such a problem for EV charging? reply KennyBlanken 14 hours agorootparentCompanies don&#x27;t want want the hassle and expense of PCI compliance across their charger network. If it&#x27;s just session auth shit going across the wire, they only need to worry about PCI compliance on the back end.By collecting lots of info about you, they get a lower processing rate because the transaction is lower risk vs a swipe&#x2F;tap.They can save on transaction fees if they consolidate charging sessions; say you do 2-3 charging sessions in one day.They want all the personal data they can collect on you constantly if you have the app installed, and to spam you with marketing notifications.They want resistance to using a different charging network. Charger Company A&#x27;s charger is $1&#x2F;minute and Charger Company B&#x27;s charger is $1.10, and they&#x27;re on the same block?

TBH, a combination of GPS (or just smart defaulting) and entering a short code would work pretty easily as well.They could also put the QR on a small screen to make it harder to fake. A little epaper display wouldn&#x27;t add much to the cost. reply g_p 11 hours agorootparentThe problem with fancy variants on trying to \"better protect\" a QR code is that users don&#x27;t know what to expect, and the lowest common denomenator of social compliance means they&#x27;ll (have to, if they want to not be stranded) eventually scan whatever QR code is there, in an attempt to charge.It feels like this whole \"scan the QR code\" is a reverse of the ideal paradigm that is (obviously) very easily exploited by scammers and opportunists, especially if payment information is requested! We spent long enough trying to train users to not enter usernames, passwords, and payment details into random web pages when asked... Now they&#x27;re being asked to do it!I don&#x27;t think a QR on a small screen is the answer - people will just cover it with their sticker. If that&#x27;s not good enough, they&#x27;ll make a sticker that looks like a small screen with some frame around it.We need to treat the charger itself as an untrusted piece of infrastructure, and do discovery the other way around. If a user knows they are going to an \"ABC Corp\" charger, there is presumably a route for them to use a relatively trustworthy discovery platform (i.e. an app store, their EV charging map already knowing where they are headed) to navigate the user to the genuine interface.For the issue of \"which charger to activate\", I&#x27;m not an EV user, but this feels like if the car communicates any form of usable information to the charger, this could be used to help the user. Easy (and private) paradigms like unlocking a given charger by a map view wouldn&#x27;t be intuitive for people with reduced spatial awareness (or at night when nobody has a clue where they are in relation to things on a map), but at a small enough charging station you could just ask the user to confirm if they are using \"charger 3\" (like gas station pump numbers), since that&#x27;s the only port with a car not yet enabled to charge. For larger places, surely it&#x27;s easier to use \"pump numbers\".(Which is effectively what you are suggesting with a short code, but I think the QR part is a potentially bad paradigm we should try to kill off before it sticks around!) reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentprevalso, who plugs in daily? do you fuel your ICE car daily? other than professional drivers, i&#x27;m doubting this is the normal routine for normal drivers. the irrational idea that EVs need to be plugged in at any and every opportunity is something that should be rationalized away. i don&#x27;t own an EV, so maybe my preconceived ideas of only charging when necessary may be what needs updating??? however, regular battery maintenance routines suggests daily charging might not be the best for the battery. reply progman32 10 hours agorootparentWhen my car is home, it&#x27;s plugged in always. That way I can pre warm or cool the cabin before I leave, and the car dumps a few more percent into the battery (usually it internally charges to about 80% to save the battery, but if it knows you&#x27;re leaving soon it bumps it up). Then again my car is 2014 and has a much smaller battery than modern cars. reply jsight 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d guess that most EV owners with home charging do plug in daily, but also limit charge based on the type of pack. For most of us, that means ~80% as a daily limit, if not less.In practice, I don&#x27;t think EV owners are seeing a meaningful difference between repeatedly doing charges from 70 to 80% vs periodically doing bigger charges (eg, 20-80%).So why not have a full-enough pack every morning?

Option 3 seems hard if you are trying to cost optimize the charger hardware.I am bearish on universal PnC being practical to implement. Every EV manufacturer has to make agreements with every EVSE operator to use the same root CAs and same billing system.

The cable should have been tested in a dirt tumbler. There is no way a cable should have 32 pins without some kind of built in self test of connectivity on all the pins every time you plug it in. Pins should be reassignable so that when 6 of the 32 pins are dirty&#x2F;broken the cable still works at a slightly reduced speed.All the Comms should have been done via an OFDM-like scheme rather than just a binary sequence over a twisted pair, giving far more throughput and allowing for compensating for conductive dirt in the plug causing crosstalk.Overall, I believe such a design would have reduced costs, since there is no longer a need for such precision on cable and plug manufacture, which more than compensates for a tiny OFDM &#x27;modem&#x27; inside the USB phy. reply newZWhoDis 9 hours agorootparentprevTIL, one more terrible design I can thank Google for!Maybe in another 30 years we’ll get a properly symmetrical design with something approaching lighting’s durability. reply Eduard 7 hours agorootparentThe properly symmetrical design already exists and it is the phone connector, e.g. TRS reply bsder 12 hours agorootparentprevCitation, please.

Here&#x27;s my diagram for a new connector -> .Connector design like this is a delicate balance between signal integrity (wants biggger) and mechanical integrity (wants bigger) and size (always smaller).As for signal integrity: A lot of the signal integrity was papered over by having complex interface chips. This is why there is so much training and negotiation in USB-C.As for mechanicals: The whole point of USB-C was to take failure-mode data from the previous generations and design a connector that avoided those. USB-C, in spite of how many people bitch about it, was designed so that the the most probable failure modes (which they learned from prior things like mini and micro USB) occur in the cable--ie the replaceable part.None of this design expertise is inside Google. reply newZWhoDis 9 hours agorootparentIn practice none of that is true, the cables hold up fine and the ports wear out.

Now that risk is gone, and they also own the dominant charging network in North America and billions in subsidies. reply mdasen 15 hours agorootparentprevTimes change and companies need to adapt with the times. 2015-2022, exclusivity would be a huge positive for Tesla. Their vehicles would have lots of charging stations while other vehicles wouldn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s great for Tesla.When the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure plan, it became clear that CCS would become the dominant charging standard in the US - unless Tesla acted fast. Tesla&#x27;s port would go from an advantage to a disadvantage. Tesla has 12,000 US chargers today. Maybe the company would make that 25,000 by 2030. The NEVI pushes for 500,000 chargers by 2030 with the CCS port. Toward the end of the 2020s, Tesla would feel pressure to switch to CCS because the majority of chargers in the US would be CCS. Tesla owners would complain that their Tesla vehicles used a different port from 95% of the public chargers.By pushing the industry to adopt the Tesla charger, they ensure that chargers built using the NEVI money will most likely have Tesla ports. They could even argue that the administration should drop the CCS requirement given that the industry has moved to the Tesla port.Tesla&#x27;s port would have gone from an advantage to a hinderance. If Tesla didn&#x27;t move the industry to the Tesla port, they&#x27;d eventually have to move to CCS. People would want their cars to be compatible with 95% of the chargers out there. When Tesla announced a switch to CCS, sales of current vehicles would likely crater. With Tesla abandoning their port, people would want to wait for the new model. Tesla might need to offer steep discounts to get people to take the \"old\" port. Instead, by moving the industry to their port, they put the uncertainty on competing vehicles; they make potential punchers of competing vehicles more likely to buy a Tesla or delay their competing purchase. That either adds to Tesla sales or makes competing companies question their EV commitment.It&#x27;s not that Tesla wanted to give up their moat. It&#x27;s not that Tesla wants a bit of charging revenue. It&#x27;s that if 95% of the chargers in the US become CCS, that moat is trapping Tesla in rather than keeping competitors out. Yes, having Supercharger exclusivity would still be an advantage for a few more years - and it will still be given that it&#x27;ll be a couple years before competitors have Tesla&#x27;s port on their vehicles. However, Tesla doesn&#x27;t want the situation where their port becomes the odd one out where Tesla owners need to fumble with CCS adaptors. Maybe Tesla gives up a year or two of Supercharger advantage, but they ensure that it doesn&#x27;t become a disadvantage. reply matthewdgreen 1 hour agorootparentI think a more pleasant way to put this is that NEVI created circumstances where Tesla could capture more value from an open standard than from a closed one. And did so at a relatively modest cost to the taxpayer, compared to the public benefits it will produce.PS Did NEVI (or IRA) actually mandate CCS, or did it simply mandate an open standard, which CCS was the only option to satisfy at the time? reply conjecTech 14 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, I think its much fairer to say they snatched a stalemate out of the jaws of defeat rather than just \"this is good for Tesla\". reply steveoscaro 9 hours agorootparentprevGood take, I think that’s accurate. Part of me still wants to believe that Tesla as a company also just wants to help speed up the global transition to EVs (more than they already have). Maybe that’s naive though. reply mahastore 13 hours agorootparentprevWhere is the FTC? reply tempestn 12 hours agorootparentprevI think the idea is that so far, and for now, the chargers have indeed helped them keep a significant lead in EV sales. Eventually though, many other companies will also be selling very good EVs, and if Tesla doesn&#x27;t open their chargers, the rest of the industry will standardize on something else, and it will eventually get good (or at least good enough) out of necessity. So instead of being the only decent option, Teslas will be the odd one out that have their own weird charging setup. As long as that setup is good it might not be too much of a detriment for them, but eventually it would stop being a major benefit either. So, better to use their current position to become the dominant charging solution for all brands.They were never going to corner the EV market long term. But they actually do have a chance of being the dominant charging supplier for every car on the road. reply joshl32532 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I was holding out on buying Ionic5 because of the lack of good charging network, even though I will only use it for occasional roadtrip.

I don&#x27;t think the financial details of these deals have been disclosed. Adding lots of revenue but with no margin doesn&#x27;t really add value to Tesla.(Of course, to the extent they get funding from the government or other manufacturers to offset the capex required for building out more stations and chargers, that&#x27;s great for Tesla & anyone.) reply shiftpgdn 15 hours agorootparentIn states where they are registered as an energy provider?

So, a gross profit of $129M on revenue of $2,166M or ~6% gross margin. This is in line with their previous statements that they run the Supercharging network at breakeven - although they don&#x27;t seem to publicly break out SC-specific numbers from the Services & Other totals.There may be outlier locations, but overall Supercharging is not a big profit center for them. Maybe it&#x27;ll improve with scale. reply grecy 7 hours agorootparentSure, that&#x27;s supercharging Tesla vehicles. They are of course going to charge more for non-Teslas. reply akouri 12 hours agorootparentprevI think you mean it will _gross_ Tesla $20. From my research, Tesla is (currently) not making much on energy delivered. That _will_ certainly change in the future though. reply shiftpgdn 11 hours agorootparentUsing Texas as an example:10-80% on a Model S&#x2F;X is 70kwh.

This is a beautiful API at exactly the right level of abstraction.I’ll give this a try on my next project. reply rdedev 14 hours agoparentprevNice. I will definitely be taking a look at this. Have you looked at the xformers library ? They are looking at the same problem as you but their focus is more on providing performant transformer modules using triton. Using specific components from the library though is not as simple. I kept running into runtime errors so I&#x27;ve kept it aside for now. I am building something based on the Bert architecture so I will give this a look. Thanks for all the work! reply danieldk 14 hours agorootparentI would&#x27;ve loved to look at xFormers, but I avoided looking at other implementations to make sure that ours is a clean room implementation.Curated Transformers started as a very small library just for spaCy (spaCy 3.7 transformer pipelines use Curated Transformers) with just the older encoder models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.). spaCy used Hugging Face Transformers prior for the provided transformer models, but we wanted something where we could easily hook into different parts of the model (e.g. for distillation).After the functionality needed for spaCy was done, Matt @ Explosion encouraged us to extend it into a more general PyTorch library that would also support decoder architectures, generation, etc. reply andy99 19 hours agoprevThe original mamba code has a lot of speed optimizations and other stuff that make it difficult to immediately get so this will help with learning.I can&#x27;t help but also plug my own Mamba inference implementation. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rbitr&#x2F;llm.f90&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;ssmFor inference one token at a time everything simplifies considerably. reply cs702 13 hours agoparentFortran! If you don&#x27;t mind me asking, why Fortran?I know it underpins a lot of time-tested scientific code, often wrapped by libraries like PyTorch and Numpy, but Fortran isn&#x27;t exactly a popular language nowadays. What&#x27;s your rationale for using it? reply andy99 13 hours agorootparentTdlr, Fortran is low level-ish, compiled, but otherwise almost identical to numpy syntax wise.It supports all the common array and matrix operations and it doesn&#x27;t need memory and pointer management the way C does. But it still compiles down to something very fast, you can link in BLAS and GPU libraries, supports easy parallelism...When I compare with e.g. Karpathy&#x27;s llama2.c, I think Fortran is easy to work with implementing basic transformer inference because of how it handles arrays.The downside is that while there are efforts to modernize it, I find it more cumbersome for non-numerical stuff, particularly strings. But I think for the actual linear algebra implementation, it can&#x27;t be beat.I should add, I know it&#x27;s a bit of an uphill battle, I expect fewer people will use code that I write in Fortran vs basically anything else. But I&#x27;m hoping to pull some people in and get a critical mass of interest because I think it has a lot of promise. That&#x27;s actually one of the reasons I wanted to get a Mamba implementation quickly (though now that there&#x27;s a basic python one I think I&#x27;ll have lost some potential users to it :) reply cs702 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the thoughtful response.Unfortunately, I too think it will be a bit of an uphill battle for you.If you haven&#x27;t already, take a look at Mojo and Julia.

(i know this is somewhat covered in the paper but still a bit inaccessible)2. what was the incremental innovation&#x2F;result that is making Mamba more successful&#x2F;interesting than its predecessors? (S4, H3, Monarch etc)3. what are the implications beyond subquadratic scaling of context? say if i don&#x27;t really care about context length > 100k tokens. what other benefits are there - for example, is Mamba potentially more compute-efficient to train for a similar size of model&#x2F;dataset?just offering 3 prompts for knowledgeable people to drop some alpha reply cztomsik 54 minutes agoparentAFAIK mamba is continuation of the SSM research, which is basically something called long-convolution.Instead of doing quadratic attention (computing how much each token attends to every other token) you just \"somehow\" compute a long (same length as input) convolution kernel, and then you apply the conv1d.Again, from my limited understanding, it&#x27;s bit related to applying FFT, doing some matmul and then IFFT back. We know that this works but it&#x27;s slow. But there are many ways to compute FFT and one of them is with something called butterfly matrices. I think it&#x27;s just approximation but it&#x27;s good enough and it&#x27;s very fast&#x2F;efficient on current hardware.To put this in context, quadratic sounds bad, but in practice, subquadratic algos are often slower because of hw limitations. So while there was a lot of excitement about SSM it&#x27;s not so easy to say that llama is over now. Also, we don&#x27;t know if mamba will scale up, and the only way to know that is to actually pay few millions for training. But I am optimistic.Another interesting model from subquadratic family is RWKV. Worth checking, but I think you had a podcast about it :)BTW: I am self-thought and I&#x27;ve only skimmed the paper some time ago so I might be very wrong.BTW2: Another thing with attention is that there&#x27;s usually KV-cache, which helps a lot with performance, and I think you cannot do that with mamba. reply ttul 14 hours agoparentprevMy IQ is orders of magnitude lower than the authors of the paper, but I did my best to work through it anyway. I studied CE and have the basic control theory background and undergrad level discrete time systems intuition. It would take much additional studying to understand state space models enough to really parse this paper. But I tried anyway. Take my comment here with a big grain of salt.The overall insight of Mamba is to solve a longstanding problem with state space models. They are good at compressing the input context, but the compression of input into a hidden state erases information needed to make use of the context effectively as Transformers do.Their solution to this problem is to create what they call a selection mechanism. The mechanism is input-dependent, allowing the model to adjust its output at each step as the input changes. How they do this is by making a few of the state space variables input-dependent instead of input-invariant. They choose a few of the state space variables and attach linear layers and such to project the input onto the state space variable at each time step. The linear layers (etc) are obviously trained so that they know how to transform the input appropriately so that the model spits out useful output.But making the state space variables input dependent creates a problem in terms of computation overhead. They fix the computation problem by designing a machine architecture-aware algorithm that makes the most of modern GPU memory architecture, avoiding moving things in and out of HBM as much as possible.Tri Dao came up with Flash Attention, which is basically a way to use hardware more efficiently in a Transformer. So this is his jam 100%.I know this doesn’t add much to understanding the paper, but hopefully it’s better than nothing. reply SpaceManNabs 12 hours agorootparentIs this similar to subset selection with the concrete distribution? reply pama 9 hours agoparentprev1. Attention is quadratic with context length; RNN with gating (LSTM, GRU, etc) are linear, as are all these new architectures. Early RNN used gating to avoid exploding gradients, these new ideas use theory from dynamical systems that guarantees stability so the gating can focus on memory, rather than solving two problems at once.2. The models released in the last couple of weeks running up to neurIPS23 (Mamba and Based) included a multi-query associative recall (MQAR) and data-dependence in the gating&#x2F;selection inspired by multi-headed attention. It turned out these were the main missing ingredients compared to earlier state-space (Hyena and earlier) architectures and made these new models as good as attention in associative recall tasks, and potentially even slightly better than attention in other non-lookup tasks. Of course the huge detail in mamba is the efficient implementation on CUDA; without it the architecture may not make much sense for tasks where transformers are already appropriate.3. If one does not have to worry too much about context length, a lot of new domains open up: DNA-sequence analysis is a linear task with long dependence; think of analyzing images, videos, or higher dimensional info in terms of streams of tokens (scan the pixels in the way of an old CRT monitor). The early dreams of AI included a continuously evolving single learning trajectory of an agent interacting with an environment continuously, so maybe such dreams will be easier to realize with these infinite-context-length models.bonus: you didn&#x27;t ask for it, but as of today the downstream applications of these models for important&#x2F;practical tasks are largely untested&#x2F;untuned compared to the rather mature applications of attention, so there may be a little delay before people figure out all the tricks for how to use large pre-trained models of these types. The analogy to the old RNN helps to a degree, but people had super specialized to attention and transformers the last 5 years, so there is a lot of momentum in favor of transformers. reply adhi01 4 hours agorootparentCan you cite what&#x27;s the \"Based\" paper in here. reply pk-protect-ai 16 hours agoparentprev> is Mamba potentially more compute-efficient to train for a similar size of model&#x2F;dataset?I would like to understand it too as well ...Here is the citation from original paper:\"Computation. After the parameters have been transformed from (∆, A, B, C) ↦ (A, B, C), the model can be computed in two ways, either as a linear recurrence (2) or a global convolution (3). Commonly, the model uses the convolutional mode (3) for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (2) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one timestep at a time).\"So the training is parallelizable, like in RetNet with parallel forward mode. By default inference is done in the recurrent mode, to have a longest possible context. No chunking available, so it is difficult for me to say how much RAM and VRAM it will consume during the inference ... reply pk-protect-ai 9 hours agorootparentI did some minimal testing, mamba uses about 60% of VRAM in comparison to RetNet (parallel forward mode) with the model of the same size and the vocabulary of same size during inference. reply WhitneyLand 13 hours agoparentprevI think this video is exactly what you’re looking for.He explains the paper but also gives a lot of context, how it fits into the big picture, etc.It’s actual kind of exciting hearing the plot unfold.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ouF-H35atOY?si=y2Ckp9MCFd7ulLL3 reply opprobium 10 hours agoparentprevRe 3) Even if you don&#x27;t care about long context length, Mamba is much cheaper per token of auto-regressive output.

I&#x27;d like to hope that some of my previous work (hlb-CIFAR10 and related projects, along with other influences before it like minGPT, DawnBench, etc.) has been able to help push the &#x27;simple, single-file, reduced-complexity&#x27; format forward a bit. I personally think that this kind of work is critical to efficient ML research, and that is possibly one of the most important things that we can do for the field today.Research progresses at the speed of innovation, which progresses with the inverse of experiment runtime, which is definitely and absolutely related to the underlying Kolmogorov Complexity of the code w.r.t. a research&#x2F;simple-hackery-focused objective.I really cannot stress enough how important to research tools like this are and how much they&#x27;ve sped up the knowledge discovery process for me personally. Being able to quickly sketch out ideas, often in minutes, and get immediate, high-snr results back has become an indispensable part of my research progress. While we seem to really good at some of the specifics of some of the detailsresearch, and somehow have extremely information-efficient training processes, we have not applied the same logic seemingly on the whole to the entire research field!Knowledge distillation and&#x2F;or the MDL (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Minimum_description_length) are excessively important I think to reversing a lot of the constant fluff, cruft, and overly dense thrash-and-hope-you-don&#x27;t-get-scooped-by-other-researchers-on-marginal-value-topics trend that I think has largely been encouraged by the current paper submission&#x2F;review&#x2F;etc process.I&#x27;ve been wanting to try to get around this and move a bit more towards a slightly better scaling solution recently. One of these things is that I&#x27;ve started distributing my code in 1-file, self-contained, short rough gists as &#x27;code sketches&#x27;, which shortens dev time and gets rough, unpolished, working code for a concept in people&#x27;s hands.

    "originBody": "PowerInfer: Fast Large Language Model Serving with a Consumer-grade GPU TL;DR PowerInfer is a CPU/GPU LLM inference engine leveraging activation locality for your device. Demo 🔥 powerinfer-live-demo.mp4 PowerInfer v.s. llama.cpp on a single RTX 4090(24G) running Falcon(ReLU)-40B-FP16 with a 11x speedup! Both PowerInfer and llama.cpp were running on the same hardware and fully utilized VRAM on RTX 4090. Abstract We introduce PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs. PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity. Evaluation shows that PowerInfer attains an average token generation rate of 13.20 tokens/s, with a peak of 29.08 tokens/s, across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, only 18% lower than that achieved by a top-tier server-grade A100 GPU. This significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy. Features PowerInfer is a high-speed and easy-to-use inference engine for deploying LLMs locally. PowerInfer is fast with: Locality-centric design: Utilizes sparse activation and 'hot'/'cold' neuron concept for efficient LLM inference, ensuring high speed with lower resource demands. Hybrid CPU/GPU Utilization: Seamlessly integrates memory/computation capabilities of CPU and GPU for a balanced workload and faster processing. PowerInfer is flexible and easy to use with: Easy Integration: Compatible with popular ReLU-sparse models. Local Deployment Ease: Designed and deeply optimized for local deployment on consumer-grade hardware, enabling low-latency LLM inference and serving on a single GPU. Backward Compatibility: While distinct from llama.cpp, you can make use of most of examples/ the same way as llama.cpp such as server and batched generation. PowerInfer also supports inference with llama.cpp's model weights for compatibility purposes, but there will be no performance gain. You can use these models with PowerInfer today: Falcon-40B Llama2 family We have tested PowerInfer on the following platforms: x86-64 CPU (with AVX2 instructions) on Linux x86-64 CPU and NVIDIA GPU on Linux Apple M Chips on macOS (As we do not optimize for Mac, the performance improvement is not significant now.) And new features coming soon: Mistral-7B model Metal backend for sparse inference on macOS Getting Started Installation Model Weights Setup and Installation Get the Code git clone https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/PowerInfer cd PowerInfer pip install -r requirements.txt # install Python helpers' dependencies Build In order to build PowerInfer you have two different options. These commands are supposed to be run from the root directory of the project. Using CMake(3.13+) on Linux or macOS: If you have an NVIDIA GPU: cmake -S . -B build -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON cmake --build build --config Release If you just CPU: cmake -S . -B build cmake --build build --config Release Model Weights PowerInfer models are stored in a special format called PowerInfer GGUF based on GGUF format, consisting of both LLM weights and predictor weights. Download PowerInfer GGUF via Hugging Face You can obtain PowerInfer GGUF weights at *.powerinfer.gguf as well as profiled model activation statistics for 'hot'-neuron offloading from each Hugging Face repo below. Base Model PowerInfer GGUF LLaMA(ReLU)-2-7B PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-7B-PowerInfer-GGUF LLaMA(ReLU)-2-13B PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-13B-PowerInfer-GGUF Falcon(ReLU)-40B PowerInfer/ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF LLaMA(ReLU)-2-70B PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-PowerInfer-GGUF We suggest downloading/cloning the whole repo so PowerInfer can automatically make use of such directory structure for feature-complete model offloading: . ├── *.powerinfer.gguf (Unquantized PowerInfer model) ├── *.q4.powerinfer.gguf (INT4 quantized PowerInfer model, if available) ├── activation (Profiled activation statistics for fine-grained FFN offloading) │ ├── activation_x.pt (Profiled activation statistics for layer x) │ └── ... ├── *.[q4].powerinfer.gguf.generated.gpuidx (Generated GPU index at runtime for corresponding model) Convert from Original Model Weights + Predictor Weights Hugging Face limits single model weight to 50GiB. For unquantized models >= 40B, you can convert PowerInfer GGUF from the original model weights and predictor weights obtained from Hugging Face. Base Model Original Model Predictor LLaMA(ReLU)-2-7B SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-7B PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-7B-Predictor LLaMA(ReLU)-2-13B SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-13B PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-13B-Predictor Falcon(ReLU)-40B SparseLLM/ReluFalcon-40B PowerInfer/ReluFalcon-40B-Predictor LLaMA(ReLU)-2-70B SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-70B PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-Predictor You can use the following command to convert the original model weights and predictor weights to PowerInfer GGUF: # make sure that you have done `pip install -r requirements.txt` python convert.py --outfile /PATH/TO/POWERINFER/GGUF/REPO/MODELNAME.powerinfer.gguf /PATH/TO/ORIGINAL/MODEL /PATH/TO/PREDICTOR # python convert.py --outfile ./ReluLLaMA-70B-PowerInfer-GGUF/llama-70b-relu.powerinfer.gguf ./SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-70B ./PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-Predictor For the same reason, we suggest keeping the same directory structure as PowerInfer GGUF repos after conversion. Inference For CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid inference with all available VRAM, you can use the following instructions to run PowerInfer: ./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $output_token_count -t $thread_num -p $prompt # ./build/bin/main -m ./ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF/falcon-40b-relu.q4.powerinfer.gguf -n 128 -t 8 -p \"Once upon a time\" If you want to limit the VRAM usage of GPU: ./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $output_token_count -t $thread_num -p $prompt --vram-budget $vram_gb # ./build/bin/main -m ./ReluLLaMA-7B-PowerInfer-GGUF/llama-7b-relu.powerinfer.gguf -n 128 -t 8 -p \"Once upon a time\" --vram-budget 8 Under CPU-GPU hybrid inference, PowerInfer will automatically offload all dense activation blocks to GPU and split FFN on GPU if possible. Quantization PowerInfer has optimized quantization support for INT4(Q4_0) models. You can use the following instructions to quantize PowerInfer GGUF model: ./build/bin/quantize /PATH/TO/MODEL /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/QUANTIZED/MODEL Q4_0 # ./build/bin/quantize ./ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF/falcon-40b-relu.powerinfer.gguf ./ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF/falcon-40b-relu.q4.powerinfer.gguf Q4_0 Then you can use the quantized model for inference with PowerInfer with the same instructions as above. Evaluation PowerInfer achieves up to 11x and 8x speedup for FP16 and INT4 models! FAQs What if I encountered CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY? You can try to run with --reset-gpu-index argument to rebuild the GPU index for this model to avoid any stale cache. Due to our current implementation, model offloading might not be as accurate as expected. You can try with --vram-budget with a slightly lower value or --disable-gpu-index to disable FFN offloading.

And their paper doesn&#x27;t directly define it (or I missed it)After some thoughts, in ReLU it does make sense, because half of the function is constant, so you can say that you&#x27;re \"cold\" if that neuron&#x27;s ReLU-ed output is often 0 . So I checked whether ReLU was common in LLMs, original llama doesn&#x27;t use ReLU. But after (re-)reading the github, it actually only works on ReLU models. Turns out that there is a group of people \"fine-tuning\" (I would rather call that re-training, since you start by breaking the model?) models to use ReLU to allow for that sparsity: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;SparseLLMSo this is sadly not applicable to any model you can find on the internet, but that sounds like a great progress anyway. Possibly this might shift the compromises back to bigger models but with \"less ideal\" activations. Also I&#x27;m curious what would be the legal impacts on it (since USA and EU refers to a model&#x27;s FLOPs&#x2F;number of parameters... How do you compute it with sparsity? Do you average?)I think that a possible avenue for future research in that area is keeping original activation (like llama keeping SwiGLU), but using quantification to define \"hot\" and \"cold\" neurons to be saturation areas. (For example, saying that this activation function, below -1. at 8 bit, is equivalent to -infinity, and thus this is a cold neuron) reply boredumb 16 hours agoparent> Also I&#x27;m curious what would be the legal impacts on it (since USA and EU refers to a model&#x27;s FLOPs&#x2F;number of parameters...

But its interesting that there even is so much \"activation sparsity\" to take advantage of. The traditional thinking in ML is that memory access is very random.Hopefully the \"cold\" neurons eventually get offloaded to the IGP instead?Also, its curious that they are considering a Metal kernel. I thought the performance advantage came from the hybrid memory pool... seems like that would only help old AMD Macs, unless I am missing something? reply sroussey 16 hours agoparentThe only thing I could think of on the question of Apple Silicon and Metal is that they think they could still split out the cold neurons to the CPU&#x2F;Accelerate and the hot ones on the GPU and utilize both. The speedup is likely less if there is already no copying of data between GPU&#x2F;CPU and using the unified memory. Still, it would be great if you could use even more of the capabilities of the chip simultaneously. In order to avoid thermal throttling they should use the efficiency cores only (I think this is what game mode does). reply brucethemoose2 1 hour agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me. The GPU&#x27;s task energy is so much lower than even the e cores, and AFIAK the GPU&#x27;s compute isn&#x27;t even fully utilized for local inference. reply Const-me 10 hours agoprevSince they mentioned they’re working on Mistral-7B, I’d like to note that my GPU-only implementation of Mistral uses slightly over 5GB of VRAM: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Const-me&#x2F;CgmlRuns pretty good on most consumer-grade GPUs, but so far it only supports Windows OS. reply m1sta_ 4 hours agoparentThis looks really really interesting.

Can this ideally be computed automatically or will future models have some sort of interface for placement algorithms like this to help automate this? If the algorithm needs to be adopted for each model architecture, it&#x27;s going to be a lot of work to maintain this project. reply loudmax 17 hours agoparentThat sounds about right. They provide a script to combine their \"Predictor\" weights to the original models, but I don&#x27;t see anything obvious in the front page of the Github repo about how to create those weights.A 10x speed improvement is really impressive. If this kind of improvement is reproducible across other models, then presumably identifying hot and cold neurons for inference optimization should go on to become a normal part of model development process. reply thelastparadise 13 hours agorootparentLike JVM \"hot spots,\" or JIT optimization. reply jupp0r 12 hours agorootparentOr profile guided optimization. reply EwanG 18 hours agoprevThe important stuff from the readme (if you&#x27;re not looking to tinker with it directly):We have tested PowerInfer on the following platforms:x86-64 CPU (with AVX2 instructions) on Linuxx86-64 CPU and NVIDIA GPU on LinuxApple M Chips on macOS (As we do not optimize for Mac, the performance improvement is not significant now.)And new features coming soon:Mistral-7B modelMetal backend for sparse inference on macOS reply rahimnathwani 11 hours agoparentAlso worth mentioning the downloadable llama2 models, and the convert.py file. reply modeless 17 hours agoprevEveryone compares against llama.cpp because it&#x27;s easy mode.

    "originLink": "https://news.stanford.edu/2023/12/20/breast-cancer-metastasis-off-switch-revealed/",
    "originBody": "December 20, 2023 Researchers uncover on/off switch for breast cancer metastasis New research from Stanford and the Arc Institute could lead to a new and more effective immunotherapy and help clinicians better predict patient response to existing medicines. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email By Rebecca McClellan Songnan Wang (left) and Lingyin Li (right) found that a protein called ENPP1 acts as an on/off switch for breast cancer metastases. High protein levels lead to a high chance of metastasis (as seen by cells growing in the dish on the left), while low levels lead to no metastasis (as seen by no cells growing in the dish on the right). (Image credit: Lingyin Li and Songnan Wang) Despite their promise, immunotherapies fail to treat many cancers, including over 80% of some of the most advanced breast cancers. And many of those patients who do respond still experience metastases eventually. New research from Stanford University and the Arc Institute has revealed a better way to predict and improve patient responses. A team led by Lingyin Li, associate professor of biochemistry at Stanford and Arc Core Investigator, found that a protein called ENPP1 acts as an on/off switch that controls breast cancer’s ability to both resist immunotherapy and metastasize. The study, published on Dec. 20 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that ENPP1 is produced by cancer cells and by healthy cells in and around the tumor, and that high patient ENPP1 levels are linked to immunotherapy resistance and subsequent metastases. The research could lead to new, more effective immunotherapies and help clinicians better predict patient response to existing medicines. “Our study should offer hope for everyone,” said Li, who is also an institute scholar at Sarafan ChEM-H. Thawing cold tumors Immunotherapies, like pembrolizumab (Keytruda), work by blocking an immune-dampening interaction between a cancer cell and a T cell, a kind of immune cell. For this to be effective, though, T cells need to permeate the tumor. So-called “hot” tumors, like those in melanoma and a subset of lung cancer, are treatable through immunotherapies, but many others, like breast and pancreatic cancers, are “cold,” devoid of T cell infiltration. In her quest to turn cold tumors hot, Li started with cGAMP, a molecule that cells produce when their DNA is damaged, which happens when a cell becomes cancerous. If left intact, cGAMP activates an immune response through what is known as the STING pathway, which can help make a tumor hot. Li previously discovered that cGAMP is exported outside the cells but often, before it can trigger a response, a protein called ENPP1 chews up these molecular “danger” signals. ENPP1, she proposed, helped keep cold tumors cold. High levels of ENPP1 correlate with poor prognosis in many cancers, but the protein can perform many actions in the body, so Li set out to determine if its cGAMP-chewing ability is behind its clinical significance. An on/off switch Li began collaborating with two professors at the University of California, San Francisco: Hani Goodarzi, also an incoming Arc Institute Core Investigator, and Laura Van’t Veer, a clinician who leads the I-SPY 2 Trial, a groundbreaking breast cancer trial. ENPP1 levels naturally vary across individuals, so the team looked at data from patients in the I-SPY 2 Trial to see how responses to pembrolizumab varied with ENPP1 levels at the time of diagnosis. The results were astounding. Patients with high ENPP1 levels had low response to pembrolizumab and high chance of metastases. Those with low ENPP1 levels had a high response to pembrolizumab and no metastases. ENPP1 predicted both response to immunotherapy and likelihood of relapse. Two things were suddenly clear: that ENPP1 was critical in metastases, not just in primary tumors; and that they should be looking at ENPP1 in healthy cells, not only in cancer cells. “Using the finest molecular scalpels developed in our lab, I was excited to dig deeper and figure out exactly how ENPP1 has such a dramatic influence on clinical outcomes,“ said Songnan Wang, an MD-PhD student in biochemistry, Arc researcher, and first author on the paper. In a series of mouse studies, Wang proved that removing ENPP1 entirely or eliminating only its cGAMP-chewing ability in normal and cancer cells yielded exactly the same result: decreased tumor growth and decreased metastases. And the team proved that it resulted directly from suppressing the STING pathway. They found an on/off switch. On top of the waterfall Immune pathways are often described as “cascades” with a series of signals that trigger downstream actions that eventually lead to a response. “For cancers to stop the immune system from detecting them, they need to build dams that block the signal from flowing,” said Li. “We have shown that ENPP1 acts like a big dam at the top of the waterfall.” This means that clinicians can use ENPP1 levels to better determine appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients. It also means that drugs that destroy the ENPP1 dam could make existing therapies more effective – and several ENPP1 inhibitors are already in clinical development. While this work focused on breast cancer, Li believes that ENPP1 plays a critical role in other kinds of “cold” tumors. “I hope to inspire clinicians who treat cancers – including lung cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer – to investigate ENPP1’s role in patient outcomes,” said Li. Li is also a member of Stanford Bio-X and the Stanford Cancer Institute.

UCSF is really a leader in breast cancer the world over, far more influential than Stanford&#x27;s much smaller amount of faculty on the topic. So it&#x27;s a bit weird to see such a basic mistake. reply pfisherman 8 hours agoparentFor those who are not familiar, the I-SPY 2 trial is quite remarkable. It is an adaptive trial design - in essence reinforcement learning with human experiments.[1]For all the criticism FDA gets, they should also get credit for leaning into new approaches to testing drugs like adaptive trials. Part of why the US remains one of the most innovative countries.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7731787&#x2F; reply hervature 6 hours agorootparentIt should be clarified that adaptive trial design was studied for several decades before being applied to games and called reinforcement learning by computer scientists.

Thanks! reply oooyay 7 hours agoparentprevidk why I see so many comments like this on the medical threads of HN lately. Laboratory mice are close enough to us to do testing on and have provided reliable results throughout their use. A basic Wikipedia search shows references for all of those claims and more: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laboratory_mouse reply mbreese 7 hours agorootparentIt’s a common trope in the field that we’ve already cured cancer in mice. They are similar enough to be a useful model for study. However, they are still quite different to the point where you never quite know how treatments will react… especially in cancer.The biggest issue is that the mice we use for research typically have no or a highly depleted immune system. One of the biggest breakthroughs in the cancer field (IMO) is the development of humanized mice. These are mice that have had their immune system genes replaced with the human versions of these genes.This is incredibly important for work like this where you’re studying cancer cell-immune cell interactions. reply glenstein 30 minutes agorootparentHave we actually cured cancer in mice? reply cyberax 6 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s because mouse models suck for many diseases. Cancer very much included, for two reasons:1. Mice _love_ to get cancer naturally. If you have 100 mice, it&#x27;s quite likely that around 20 of them will die within one year of cancer. This makes it difficult to extract useful signals. BTW, that&#x27;s why if you see a study that a \"chemical X results in cancer in mice\", you should take that with a grain of salt.2. Mice are small, so tumors are necessarily small too, with several orders of magnitude fewer cells than typical human tumors. So many drugs can just cure mice of cancer entirely, by killing cancerous cells too quickly to allow them to evolve resistance. reply maratc 4 minutes agorootparent> If you have 100 mice, it&#x27;s quite likely that around 20 of them will die within one year of cancer.If you have 100 people, about 40 of them will be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetime (39&#x2F;100 females and 41&#x2F;100 males). Note \"diagnosed with\" is very different from \"die\" and \"over lifetime\" is not the same as \"within one year\", but the probability of people getting cancer naturally is high as well. reply glenstein 20 minutes agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure it follows that high incidences of cancer means that it&#x27;s unhelpful to use them for research to understand the mechanisms of cancer. And I&#x27;m not sure that either of your observations one or two are pertinent in this case as it applies to the on&#x2F;off protein switch, as it is not about guaging the statistical frequency of cancers or about killing cancer cells. reply lossolo 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat I&#x27;m really curious about is how many of these experiments and trials didn&#x27;t work in mice but would work in humans. reply wombatpm 5 hours agorootparentOne would hope that in vitro studies with human cell lines would identify those possibilities. reply mjfl 6 hours agoparentprev\"In mice\" is really hard to achieve. reply adamredwoods 6 hours agoparentprevYou can order mice with specific cancer mutations: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jax.org&#x2F;strain&#x2F;017835 reply SV_BubbleTime 7 hours agoparentprevIf we just experimented on and killed lots of humans we would be both further ahead and behind. reply ugh123 9 hours agoprevnext [2 more] [flagged] pavel_lishin 8 hours agoparent> I like to get GPT-4 output for certain things like this to understand certain aspects of it (and not assuming everything it tells me is fact).

Lots of theoretical “in mice” treatments I recall reading about 5-10 years ago are now actively being deployed clinically. By some measures we’ve had more than a 25% drop in age+health standardised cancer mortality over the last decade.It’s easy to feel cynical when so many things seem like they get stuck for ages in trials and never make it to an actual treatment, but modern medicine is truly amazing.

Cancer deaths overall are also improving due to fewer smokers, but that should be accounted for by \"health standardized\" measurements.I think this paper explains it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;27175568&#x2F; \"the major factors that accounted for these favorable trends were progress in tobacco control and improvements in early detection and treatment\"I feel like the treatment progress for most metastatic solid cancers have not significantly improved. A significant improvement wouldn&#x27;t be just improving overall survival by a year or so. What seems possible to achieve (someday soon perhaps) is making cancer either a manageable condition, like HIV now is, or curable. reply flandish 7 hours agorootparentprevMy wife died from metastatic breast cancer, in 2011.

In iMessage conversations with people who have also turned on iMessage Contact Key Verification, you’ll receive an alert if there’s an error in this verification process. These alerts help ensure even a very sophisticated attacker can’t impersonate anyone in the conversation. Additionally, you can verify contacts manually by comparing verification codes. When you verify a contact manually, iMessage Contact Key Verification will verify that the code you have saved matches the one provided by the iMessage servers for that contact, and will notify you if the verification code changes. Find out more about alerts from iMessage Contact Key Verification iMessage Contact Key Verification isn’t designed to prevent fraud such as phishing or other text message-based scams. iMessage Contact Key Verification requirements To use iMessage Contact Key Verification, you’ll need: iOS 17.2, watchOS 9.2 and macOS 14.2 on all devices where you’ve signed in to iMessage with your Apple ID To be signed in to iCloud and iMessage with the same Apple ID iCloud Keychain turned on for all devices Two-factor authentication turned on for your Apple ID A passcode or password for all of your devices iMessage Contact Key Verification doesn’t support Managed Apple IDs. Turn on iMessage Contact Key Verification When you turn on iMessage Contact Key Verification on one of your Apple devices, it will be turned on for all devices where you’ve signed in with your Apple ID. When you turn on iMessage Contact Key Verification, you may be prompted to update all of your devices to a compatible software version. If you have a device that can’t be updated, you’ll need to sign out of iMessage on that device before you can turn on iMessage Contact Key Verification. How to turn on iMessage Contact Key Verification Open the Settings app (or System Settings on Mac), then select your name. Scroll down and tap Contact Key Verification. Turn on Verification in iMessage and tap Continue. Verify contacts manually with iMessage Contact Key Verification For additional assurance that you’re messaging the person you intend to, you can verify contacts manually. To verify manually, you’ll need to have that person saved in your Contacts. On-device comparison – From Conversation Details, you can choose to verify a contact. Both you and that contact will generate a code at the same time to share and compare. Public Verification Code – You can share your Public Verification Code, so the people you’re messaging can verify you. Your Public Verification Code doesn’t contain any private information, so you can post it to social media or another account where the people you’re messaging can find and use it. You can also use other people’s Public Verification Codes to verify them. Compare verification codes on your device Both you and the person you’re messaging need to be connected to mobile data or Wi-Fi. You both need to follow the process to have the “Verify Contact” screen open on your devices at the same time. Open Messages, then tap the message thread. Tap the contact’s name to view Conversation Details. Scroll down and tap Verify Contact... When the other person also taps Verify Contact, a code will appear. Verify the code in person, via FaceTime or through another secure call. If the codes match, tap Mark as Verified to add the verification code to that person’s Contact Card. If the codes don’t match, you may not be messaging the person you intend to. You may want to stop messaging until you can make sure you’re messaging the correct person. Share your Public Verification Code Open the Settings app (or System Settings), then tap your name. Scroll down and tap Contact Key Verification. Tap Show Public Verification Code. To share, tap Copy Verification Code. Then you can share your code directly with another person or post it online for others to use. Mark a contact as verified with a Public Verification Code To mark a contact as verified, you can copy and paste their Public Verification Code into their Contact Card to mark them as verified. At the top of the iMessage conversation, select their name. You can also select a contact from the Contacts app. Select Info, then select Edit. In the “verification code” field, type or paste the Public Verification Code that your contact has shared. If you can’t see the “verification code” field, you may need to select the Add (+) button, select More Fields, then select “verification code”. If their Public Verification Code matches and is verified by iMessage Contact Key Verification, a tick will be displayed in their Contact Card and next to their name in iMessage conversations. If their Public Verification Code doesn’t match the code stored on Apple servers or isn’t verified, a tick won’t be displayed. Before you continue messaging, you may want to check that you’ve entered the code correctly or make sure you’re messaging the correct person. Check verification status in Conversation Details The iMessage Conversation Details page shows the iMessage Contact Key Verification status for your contacts. To find this status, open a message with your contact, tap their name (on iPhone) or click the More Info button (on Mac), then scroll down to Contact Key Verification. If you don’t have iMessage Contact Key Verification turned on, you’ll see Turn On Contact Key Verification. If you have iMessage Contact Key Verification turned on but your contact doesn’t, you’ll see their name and “Verification Off”. To use iMessage Contact Key Verification, ask them to turn it on. If you and your contact both have iMessage Contact Key Verification turned on but you haven’t verified that contact, you’ll see “Verify Contact...” If you’ve already verified the contact, you’ll see a tick by the contact’s name. You’ll also see a tick by their name at the top of the Messages thread, when you send them a new message and in your Contacts. If there’s a validation error, you’ll see an alert by the contact’s name.

I guess the idea here is that once you verify a contact that syncs to their other devices, but in theory Matrix also does that, and in practice I still see some friction.It&#x27;s possible Apple&#x27;s implementation will just be better, or that they&#x27;ll rely on attestation to such a degree that they&#x27;ll be able to skip some other friction points. But even with the public verification setup (which gets rid of the problem of needing to verify devices at the same time as the person you&#x27;re talking to), I&#x27;m still slightly skeptical that users are going to copy and paste a code into their messaging app to verify contacts. My experience is that even popping up a button and saying, \"do your friend and you see the same emoticons\" is too much work for a lot of users.Maybe I&#x27;ll be wrong. And I guess ideally if iOS users get used to doing this, they might be more tolerant of doing the same thing in other messengers too. reply seanieb 10 hours agoparentTrevor Perrin, who co-designed the Signal Protocol, made the point that most people don’t have to do this.

There were constant consequences for the spying. For domestic I think we can point to Watergate, Contra Affair, Snowden Leaks. I have some more recent examples but I think mentioning them will result in arguing and move from the topic at hand. You may not agree that the consequences were severe enough, but there were consequences. I think there&#x27;s also a strong bias in that consequences take place after (often months or years) and there&#x27;s less attention given to them so we often aren&#x27;t even aware. But if consequences do happen, it does mean the rage machine was effective even if far from optimal. Worth noting that there is a danger in lack of attention to consequences, since it can lead to apathy and thus actually enable consequent-less actions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. reply p-e-w 5 hours agorootparentWhat consequences did the Snowden Leaks have?I mean for the intelligence agencies – not for Edward Snowden. I&#x27;m of course aware his life has been destroyed. But what consequences were there for the people and institutions responsible? reply godelski 4 hours agorootparentThis contains a decent summary, including some laws: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;10-years-after-snowden...I&#x27;d mention there are two big but abstract consequences.1) The leaks significantly harmed international relationships and the result of this game much more ammunition to political adversaries like China and Russia. People argue that this is a consequence of Snowden&#x27;s leak but that&#x27;s like arguing that a mass shooting was only problematic because the news informed everyone. In a way yes, but it&#x27;s not like those people would be alive if the news didn&#x27;t report... It&#x27;s not the real problem even if you wanted to argue over-sensationalism.2) It seriously galvanized the battle for encryption and laid the pathway for the subsequent rapid rise in usage of tools like Signal and more funding and energy for building tools like Matrix and many others. Google&#x27;s Project Zero certainly was influenced by this event.While I get that these are more abstract, they are certainly consequences and certainly nothing to be scoffed at. This is another problem with the perception of consequences, is that often they are more subtle or abstract. But subtle or abstract doesn&#x27;t mean any less impactful, just more difficult to trace. More opaque. We don&#x27;t have a counterfactual to prove that these things wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the leaks, but I&#x27;m certain the timing and degree would have been different. Do you think the world would be different had he not released them? I don&#x27;t think this is an easy question to answer because it requires being exceptionally detailed and paying very close attention to a lot of events. reply kahnclusions 7 hours agorootparentprevIt might still be an acceptable risk. Most governments around the world probably don’t care that much if it’s discovered they are surveiling a journalist or lawyer.In most of the world everyone knows that journalists and lawyers are being monitored. reply xoa 7 hours agorootparentI think you and notpushkin are perhaps missing some of the \"economic\" angles on this. It&#x27;s not just about the what, it&#x27;s about the how. High value targets are highly likely to be following decent practices and at least staying up to date on software. Which implies that cracking iMessage would require use of a 0-day, of which there are not an infinite number at any given time, and which Apple will immediately eliminate forever if they discover it. Part of the point of highly targeted careful attacks is to stretch those out, it&#x27;s not just about keeping the target from knowing (though that&#x27;s not irrelevant), it&#x27;s also about future targets.So as with a lot of matters in intelligence work it&#x27;s subject to cost benefit calcs. If using it against a given target means they are incredibly unlikely to notice and it can then be used again and again, it doesn&#x27;t take much target value for a government to deploy it which pushes towards more mass use. On the opposite end if using it means it will immediately become useless ever again, then the expected target value has to at least exceed the market cost (which itself will rise more quickly if 0-days are being consumed more quickly vs production), every time. In between is a spectrum of less or more use. Apple wants it as far towards \"use it and lose it\" as possible, but Trevor Perrin&#x27;s argument makes sense here: even a relatively small increase in percentage of \"use it and lose it\" amongst the population could significantly change the mean weighted cost for threat actors.If they could know for sure whether a given counter measure was deployed that&#x27;d reduce the cost again, but if they can&#x27;t there is indeed a population benefit. It&#x27;s like a mine field, there don&#x27;t have to be that many mines scattered around to really hurt people&#x27;s willingness to cross it! reply p-e-w 6 hours agorootparent> High value targets are highly likely to be following decent practices and at least staying up to date on software.Not even close. The vast majority of journalists, lawyers, activists, even public figures, don&#x27;t have the knowledge to secure their digital lives, don&#x27;t have access to an expert to do it for them, and in many cases aren&#x27;t even fully aware of the nature of the threat (beyond some vague idea along the lines of \"I&#x27;m probably being monitored\").On top of that, it has been my experience that people who don&#x27;t understand threat mechanics on a deeper level (such as active MITM attacks) quickly stop following whatever best practices they have been trained to adhere to (in this case, peer key verification), because those practices have no observable effect to them and without actually understanding what&#x27;s going on, it&#x27;s hard for them to see what the point is. reply xoa 6 hours agorootparent>Not even close.

Seriously, look at adoption each time over the last 5 years on a site like statista [0] or wherever, or various ones aimed at developers. If you want to claim that people at higher risk aren&#x27;t part of the 60-85% I&#x27;d honestly be curious to see your numbers. Note I said \"decent\" not \"best\" practices. Whatever its flaws, mixed incentives, and issues (which are real), Apple has expended significant effort in making the normal default paths provide an ok baseline security for regular people and discouraging leaving them. Which isn&#x27;t even something a lot of HNers like! If anything, I&#x27;d be unsurprised if HN types to lag in some respects because we want more control and to do things outside the well trod path. I&#x27;ve jailbroken a lot, is that something most people do? No.In this specific case, the minimum needed to avoid a zero-day exploit is (by definition) merely to always have the OS updated and all security patches applied while staying firmly within the walled garden. Which it&#x27;s objectively clear the super majority of regular people do. If you just go with the default and let Apple update your device whenever Apple wants, then it&#x27;s a truism that anything you get hit by is something Apple hasn&#x27;t yet patched. And in turn anything that raises the population probability that the 0-day actually gets noticed and potentially reported raises the risk of using the 0-day. The whole point of this feature is that it&#x27;d let a normal person who doesn&#x27;t necessarily understand threat mechanics go \"huh, that&#x27;s funny\" and then maybe say so on their social media&#x2F;blog&#x2F;wherever, at which point if even one person who follows them (and we&#x27;re talking journalists or other types with enough influence to get targeted by major threat actors right?) recognizes what&#x27;s going on and says \"quick call Apple&#x2F;security researcher&#x2F;tell HN\" now it&#x27;s out there.>because those practices have no observable effect to themLiterally the entire point of this new feature is to create an observable effect of tampering.

The fact that everyone is already on the latest version (they’re not, because of phased rollout, but it’s not too relevant here) means that an exploit that has value targets latest iOS by default.Opt-in additional protections, such as Lockdown Mode, which aren’t perfect but help are rarely enabled by those who need it, despite being marketed to people who are targeted. Part of this is that it’s opt-in, but part of it is that a lot of the people targeted aren’t journalists: they’re the spouses of political leaders, or random government leaders, who don’t have a good security posture nor do they have people managing their devices for them to create one.Also, do note that just because someone appears to have tampered with a conversation doesn’t mean you’ve burned your 0-day: it provides no indication of how they did so. reply p-e-w 5 hours agorootparentprev> Because everything I have ever seen is that iOS users almost all leave on autoupdate and the move to the latest version is the overwhelming majority, very rapidly.Outside of the US, Android&#x27;s market share dwarfs iOS&#x27;s.

Key verification isn&#x27;t for most people and can even create more noise as normal people frequently change phones. But the average threat environment isn&#x27;t the only threat environment. In higher risk settings (politicians, journalists, etc) verification rates are expected to be higher than 0.1% because these people frequently are also more knowledgeable of security practices and&#x2F;or have better advisors than the general public. While the context isn&#x27;t explicitly stated I think it is fair to assume that most can infer this and that if not someone can explain it.

This is exactly my concern, I agree that Matrix&#x27;s setup can be difficult for new users, but I&#x27;m not sure what a good UX for this even is. Apple&#x27;s non-public verification method seems to be (at least at first glance) almost identical to what Matrix is doing.If Apple rolls out a similar system and it works or they&#x27;re able to identify pain points and make it easier to use, then cool. Maybe Matrix can take pointers from the UI if that&#x27;s the case.

This describes the process, and the process (at least for on-device comparison) sounds almost identical to what Matrix does today. I&#x27;m not sure what code is going to be compared, Matrix uses emoji which I&#x27;ve found helps a lot, neither article for Apple specifies what they&#x27;ll use.But :shrug: unless I&#x27;m not seeing a broader picture or there are details here that I don&#x27;t understand, it does kind of sound like this is going to have the same problems that Matrix has. Although, to be fair, I&#x27;ve run into validation errors and syncing problems with Matrix before that theoretically Apple won&#x27;t have? So maybe it&#x27;ll be the same UX, but slightly more stable? Although also to be fair, Matrix doesn&#x27;t require me to update all of my computers in order to verify an identity and Apple seems to be saying that users will need to do that, so I&#x27;m not necessarily taking it as a given that Apple&#x27;s system system won&#x27;t have its own share of annoying caveats.It&#x27;s a tiny bit disappointing, my takeaway from Matrix is that this all needs to be easier to do, and I was mildly hopeful that there would be some UI takeaways from Apple&#x27;s implementation.Or maybe people will just be more tolerant if it&#x27;s Apple asking them to jump through the hoops instead of an Open Source messenger? If that&#x27;s the case, and if the UX really is basically the same as Matrix&#x27;s, maybe some of that tolerance will bleed over to Matrix as well. reply aspenmayer 6 hours agorootparentHere’s my verification key, so you know what they look like, since you were wondering what would be shown&#x2F;compared:APKTIDJ_J3S3UhVqZKCX5EgKYnh9ez4pO9Hsr5YWv_5pXF5GUcLA reply danShumway 6 hours agorootparentOw.

    "originLink": "https://openpipe.ai/blog/mistral-7b-fine-tune-optimized",
    "originBody": "Home Pricing Blog Docs GitHub Sign Up How we built “Mistral 7B Fine-Tune Optimized,” the best 7B model for fine-tuning Kyle Corbitt Dec 18, 2023 Hey there! I’m Kyle, the founder of OpenPipe. OpenPipe is the fully-managed fine-tuning platform for developers. Our users have already saved over $2M in inference costs by switching to our fine-tuned models, and it only takes a few minutes to get started. Since its release in September, Mistral 7B has been the model we’ve recommended to most of our customers. Today, we’re excited to announce an even stronger variant: Mistral 7B Fine-Tune Optimized. Let’s start with the punchline: averaged across 4 diverse customer tasks, fine-tunes based on our new model are slightly stronger than GPT-4, as measured by GPT-4 itself. Read on for the details! FAQs GPT-4 is ~100x larger than Mistral. How is this possible? The intuition here is actually quite straightforward. A general-purpose model like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 has to be good at everything. It doesn’t know ahead of time what prompt it’ll need to respond to, and so it has to try to encode all of human knowledge. Additionally, every time it gets a new prompt it it has to figure out the right way to respond on the fly—it can’t think deeply about the problem and figure out a repeatable strategy to solve it. It can’t remember the times it has solved the same problem before. The process of fine-tuning, on the other hand, lets a model spend hours of training time learning about a specific task and developing strategies to reliably solve it. Even if it’s a less capable model overall, those hours of GPU time can help a fine-tuned model learn the right tricks to efficiently and successfully solve a specific problem.[1] There are lots of Mistral fine-tunes. Why another one? A very healthy ecosystem of Mistral fine-tunes already exists, but they’re typically optimized for direct use. We wanted something different — a model optimized to be the strongest base model for further fine-tunes to be built on. This involves carefully optimizing for instruction understanding and reasoning ability while avoiding “catastrophic forgetting,” the tendency for fine-tuned models to get worse at out-of-domain tasks when you fine-tune them for a specific purpose. Ok, let’s get the details! You can’t hit a target you can’t see (Metrics) We started by creating a “test set” of 3 different real OpenPipe customer tasks (with permission). These spanned our most common categories of information extraction, classification, and summarization. The goal was to find or create a new model that, when fine-tuned on these customer tasks, could outperform Mistral-based models on our evals, and become our new default base model. Choose your hero We started by evaluating existing Mistral variants to see how they’d perform as a base model. After playing around with a number of models we selected six that seemed promising: OpenHermes 2.5, Zephyr, Cybertron, Intel Neural Chat, Hermes Neural, and Metamath Cybertron Starling. We created a fine-tuned version of each of these models on each of the 3 evaluation datasets, using a development build of OpenPipe that supports custom base models. This gave us 18 new models in total. This dropdown ended up getting really long by the end of this project. 😂 Beauty in the eye of GPT-4 (Evals) To test each model’s performance, we used our recently released automated LLM-as-judge evals scored by GPT-4, which allowed us to quickly compare our fine-tunes to each other and gauge their strength. The top model wasn’t consistent from task to task, but we did notice something interesting—two of the best-performing models overall were Hermes Neural and Metamath Cybertron Starling, which were both created not by fine-tuning directly but rather through model merging. Magical thinking and model merging 🪄🤯 Model merging is, to me, one of the most counterintuitive empirical results in modern deep learning. It turns out that you can actually more-or-less naively merge the weights of two different models and produce a new one that captures some or all of the abilities of its parents! Since we had a candidate set of already-strong models, we decided to merge a few of the best ones and see if we could make one even stronger. We ended up testing 4 models created by merging our candidates and fine-tuning each of them on our 3 datasets, for a total of 12 additional fine-tuned models. At this stage, evaluating every fine-tune against every other one across our large test sets felt pretty wasteful, since some models were clearly stronger than others. Instead, we ran 9,000 comparisons between our models’ outputs and those of GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-3.5, and ranked them using a Bradley-Terry ranking system, which is conceptually similar to an Elo rating. (You can see our ugly rating calculation code here). Finally, we got our model rankings, which showed one merge in particular was especially strong: Check yo’self (Validation) This was a really exciting result—averaged over our three example tasks, one of our merges slightly edged out GPT-4 as the strongest model! But there’s a problem. We’d been testing all our models, including the merges, on the same 3 datasets—was it possible that we’d overfit to those specific tasks? To address this concern we selected a new customer dataset we hadn’t used at all thus far (a structured data extraction task). We trained our new merge model as well as a base Mistral model on the new dataset, to verify whether its strong performance generalized to new tasks. Excitingly, the same results held! We’re just getting started We’re excited to announce that as of today we’re freely releasing Mistral Fine-Tune Optimized on Hugging Face and as our new default base model within OpenPipe. We’re excited to see what our users do with it, but this is just the beginning. Over time we’ll continue releasing more base models that are stronger, faster and cheaper. We’re looking forward to continue growing alongside the small-model community! ———— [1]: As an aside, there’s an even stronger result that we’ve found through working with our customers: a student model trained on data generated by a teacher model can exceed the performance of the teacher model on its task. We’ve had several customers train a model on GPT-4 outputs, and found that their new model was actually better than GPT-4 at its task. This is likely due to a kind of regularization—the fine-tuned model is more likely to give the “average” answer that GPT-4 would give if prompted many times. This result is different but related to OpenAI’s recently-published research on weak-to-strong generalization.",

It turns out that you can actually more-or-less naively merge the weights of two different models and produce a new one that captures some or all of the abilities of its parents!I would hope the article give some more details on model merging. Is it merging two different fine-tuned models, one fine-tuned on dogs, another fine-tuned on cats, and the merging of the two different models is good on cats and dogs as if by magic?Like fine-tune one model just on Python and test it thoroughly, fine-tune one on Java and test it thoroughly, and then if the need arises for a project that uses both Java and Python, merge the two together and use that. If there is no need for Java, use the one fine-tuned just on Python.Pretty magical indeed! Let alone the fact, that a separate smaller model of half a billion parameters could figure out how to merge the two together. If the cost of LMs could be reduced by a factor of 100, why not reduce it by a factor of 1000? reply airgapstopgap 7 hours agoparentThis is not so surprising if you consider the fact that finetuning is extremely sparse and barely imparts any new knowledge to the model. The paper \"Language Models are Super Mario: Absorbing Abilities from Homologous Models as a Free Lunch\"[1] made this clear:> We initially demonstrate that SFT LM (either encoder- or decoder-based) always tends to acquire excessively redundant delta parameters. To be specific, we present DARE, which randomly resets some delta parameters to zeros based on a drop rate p and subsequently scales the remaining parameters by a factor of 1&#x2F;(1 − p). Despite its simplicity, with the assistance of DARE, when the LM model parameters reach 70 billion, we can eliminate up to 99% delta parameters with minimal impact on model performance (see Figure 1(a)). The more parameters the LM has, the larger p it can tolerate. This discovery suggests that SFT LM indeed learns a multitude of low-rank structures akin to LoRA [25]Insofar as those adaptations are mostly distinct, you can just preserve both sets and that&#x27;s what explains successes of merging, I guess.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2311.03099 reply refulgentis 6 hours agoparentprevFunnily enough, and not so concidentally, this has been well known in practice by...drumroll please...America&#x27;s greatest innovators, the Adult Entertainment Hobbyists.It doesn&#x27;t have order-of-magnitude, or I&#x27;d even wager 50%, benefits in enabling smaller models. But you nailed it exactly. Fine tune on dogs, fine tune on cats, then...just...average the weights. And you have something better than the original with minimal loss from finetuning.LoRA&#x27;s end up being more popular for that use case because they&#x27;re easier to combine and mix, match, and scale.

A customer is going to have an even worse time.No one will ever get fired for buying OpenAI (now that IBM is dead, and probably sad Watson never made a dent).I do use Mistral for all my personal projects but I&#x27;m not sure that is going to have the same effect on the industry as open source software did in the past. reply oceanplexian 12 hours agoparent> I think the adage about \"a solution needs to be 10x other solutions to make someone switch\" applies here.It&#x27;s already superior to OpenAI because it doesn&#x27;t require an API. You can run the model on your own hardware, in your own datacenter, and your data is guaranteed to remain confidential. Creating a one-off fine-tune is a different story than permanently joining your company at the hip to OpenAI.I know in our bubble, in the era of Cloud, it&#x27;s easy to send confidential company data to some random API on the Internet and not worry about it, but that&#x27;s absolutely not the case for anyone in Healthcare, Government, or even normal companies that are security conscious. For them, OpenAI was never a valid consideration in the first place. reply wenc 3 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s already superior to OpenAI because it doesn&#x27;t require an API.But the quality is not superior to OpenAI however.

There&#x27;s a reason OpenAI is adding all sorts of add-on features like assistants and file upload, because they know models themselves are going to be a commodity and they need something to lock developers on their platform reply visarga 4 hours agorootparentCode execution and RAG are not going to lock people in. They are 1000x easier to replicate than the model, which as you say, is already becoming a commodity.My pet theory is that OpenAI are cooking high quality user data by empowering GPT with all these toys + human-in-the-loop. The purpose is to use this data as a sort of continual evaluation sifting for weak points and enhancing their fine-tuning datasets.Every human response can carry positive or negative connotation. The model can use that as a reward signal. They claimed to have 100M users, times let&#x27;s say 10K tokens per month makes 1T synthetic tokens. In a whole year they generate about as much text as the original dataset, 13T. And we know that LLMs can benefit a lot from synthetic data when it is filtered&#x2F;engineered for quality.So I think OpenAI&#x27;s moat is the data they generate. reply turnsout 12 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of truth to this, but I have seen clients get really interested in local models—mostly due to cost and&#x2F;or confidentiality. For example, some healthcare clients will never upload medical records to OpenAI, regardless of the enterprise agreement. reply xrd 10 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve read all the comments here, many of which contradict my points. I used to agree with those ideas but then tried to sell LLMs to customers. My takeaway is that customers will pretend they care about privacy and needs for on prem installations, but they will, at least right now, go with a vendor that tells them their data is protected and not investigate the truth of that.Zoom got away with it and still does and no one got fired for using zoom.I&#x27;m happy to have a debate with someone that has successfully sold those ideas to a customer, but I&#x27;m skeptical until then. reply mmcwilliams 11 hours agoparentprevI think at this point the \"10x other solutions\" should be measured for the cost.

We wanted something different — a model optimized to be the strongest base model for further fine-tunes to be built on.\" reply m3kw9 8 hours agorootparentThen how come the base model can somewhat follow instructions but not very well, or why is it that the base model won’t follow instructions well? reply coder543 8 hours agorootparentBase models are just trying to autocomplete the input text. The most logical completion for an instruction is something approximately like what you asked, but base models are raw. They have not been taught to follow instructions, so they generally do a poor job. They&#x27;re especially bad at knowing when to stop, and they will often generate their own questions to answer, which they will then answer, followed by more questions and more answers.When chat models are trained, they are first pre-trained (the \"PT\" in \"GPT\"), which creates a base model, then they are \"fine tuned\" (RLHF, aligned, whatever you want to call it).A base model can be fine tuned with an instruction dataset (like OpenOrca[0]) to learn how to follow instructions or how to chat. It can also be fine-tuned with a collection of any inputs and the expected outputs, and learn how to do that specific task.OpenPipe appears to specialize in fine-tuning base models for specific applications. They wanted a better base model. If you want it instruction-tuned, I&#x27;m sure they would be happy to help with that, or you can wait for someone in the community to make one of those from their base model... but I believe the whole point of the article is that a small, specialized model can outperform a large, general model. Their goal does not seem to be to build a tiny, general, chat-tuned model that outperforms GPT-4 in everything. They want you to train the base model on a very specific task, with the expectation that it will outperform GPT-4 and be tremendously cheaper to run at the same time. Many LLM tasks are centered around summarization, extraction, or classification, which have nothing to do with chatting.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;Open-Orca&#x2F;OpenOrca reply TuringNYC 8 hours agoparentprev>> Doesn’t really follow instructions too well,This is the biggest problem we&#x27;re having swapping LLMs. While Langchain allows easy swap, and while we dont care as much about quality during integration testing, etc...the bigger problem is following directions. OpenAI does well at outputting a JSON if I ask for one. Unfortunately now our software has come to expect JSON output in such cases. Swap it to, say, llama2 and you dont get JSON even if asking for one. This makes swapping not just a quality decision but an integration challenge. reply coder543 8 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t used the llama2 models much in quite awhile, because they just aren&#x27;t very good compared to other options that exist at this point. The instruction-tuned variants of Mistral and Mixtral seem to have very little trouble responding in JSON when I ask for it. However, with LLMs that you run yourself, you can also enforce a grammar for the response if you want to, guaranteeing that it will respond with valid JSON (that matches your schema!) and no extraneous text.Something potentially helpful here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;2494If you fine-tuned a base model (like the one in the article) on various inputs and the expected JSON output for each input, it would probably do even better. reply jay-barronville 5 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, Llama 2 (70B) can semi-reliably provide JSON output when provided with clear instructions and various distinct but similarly structured examples. It goes from “semi-reliably” to “consistently” when fine-tuned.The primary issue I’ve run into is exhausting the context window much sooner than I’d like.

I mean obviously a finetuned 7B LLM could perform, let&#x27;s say, text summarization well. The question is what happens if that text contains code, domain-specific knowledge where some facts are less relevant than the other, etc., and that isn&#x27;t going to be answered by any metric alone. Fundamentally, with enough diverse metrics, each based on a different dataset, the one with the biggest overlap of the dataset for finetuning will perform really well, and the rest, well, not so well.Bsically, the statistic means that there&#x27;s a set of data for which that particular (finetuned) network performs slightly better than GPT-4, and everywhere else, pretty bad. It&#x27;s just not generalizable to everything while GPT-4 is. It&#x27;s just as good as saying \"calculators outperform GPT-4 at counting\".

Honestly, I would prefer some sort of derivative of this without Windows&#x2F;MS logos or trademark, that does not necessarily adhere super-closely to Windows 7, but just does what makes most sense; taking the best parts of Aero and combining with the best aspects of other DEs and themes (including KDE Plasma&#x27;s Breeze and&#x2F;or the older Oxygen). reply notRobot 15 hours agoparentYou should check out ZorinOS: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zorin.com&#x2F;It does something very similar to your ask. I use it as a daily driver OS and it works really well and I love the UI. reply winter_blue 6 hours agorootparentI’m pretty attached (perhaps irrationally) to Arch Linux and KDE Plasma — but they’ve been my main driver for many years now. So, in general, I’d prefer just something that can just be installed as a theme, over installing a new distro (or a new DE) for a new UX.Even a new DE might be something I’ll install on Arch and try out once in a while, but the thought of switching from a rolling-release distro (Arch, in my case) to a point-release distro (e.g. Ubuntu) just to try out a new desktop UX is a bit too much for me. reply OliveMate 13 hours agorootparentprevGod, I hate how every time I see a new Linux Distro I want to ditch what I have and try it out.At some point I&#x27;m going to become like the rest of you and buy a few hundred extra ThinkPads to satiate my curiosity. reply jraph 9 hours agorootparentYou could consider installing them in separate btrfs subvolumes :-) reply j1elo 15 hours agoprevI never got over Windows 2000.

And while I&#x27;m not the Apple fanboy I used to be, I still like Apple&#x27;s products for the most part.Hot dang this theme looks awesome.As much as I detest Windows and everything non-UNIXy about it, Windows 7 looked great. That&#x27;s the version of Windows that my high school ran; none of the computers were fast by any means (IIRC it took all night to render the weekly video the press team put out on Fridays) so the animations all were a little… stiff… but I appreciated that MS actually made an OS that looked good. I mean, look at that shine! Look at those lighting effects! And the OS is still useable!Anyway… it&#x27;s also a testament that you can make KDE do this kind of trick. Nutso. reply pxc 13 hours agoprevI was already running KDE&#x2F;Plasma for years by the time Windows 7 came out, so for me Aero&#x27;s emotional associations are negative. It was the user interface of the janky, annoying side of my computer that I would occasionally boot in college in order to play trendy Windows games with my friends, and eventually abandoned because I hated having to deal with it. I can&#x27;t help but be a bit repulsed looking at that UI (or the original Aero theme for Windows).It&#x27;s funny how those associations can color perception in such an immediate way. The &#x27;pure&#x27; aesthetics are harder, if not impossible, to access. reply shiroiuma 7 hours agoparentInteresting. I was running KDE too, but I never was forced to use Windows 7&#x2F;Aero until later. Personally I feel like Aero was by far the best-looking Windows ever, even though I never liked using Windows due to non-aesthetic problems. reply pxc 3 hours agorootparentWhen I think about individual features of the UI in isolation, it&#x27;s easy to appreciate many small touches that I can see are quite nice. Transparency with blur, the glow effects on mouseover, the way it flattened a little bit compared to Vista but still returned some skeuomorphic sheen&#x2F;gradients&#x2F;animations, etc.Other things, I think I enjoyed at the time, but resent in retrospect— the oversized window titlebars, for example, which proved to be a step towards Windows contemporary profligate wastefulness with screen space.In some cases, evolutionary advances in Windows 7 UI were a step in the right direction (by me), but that of course means that I think later Windowses did it better. A good example here is the search-driven aspects of the start menu, which were introduced (IIRC) when Vista succeeded XP, and gradually increased with each release since. I think menus suck and search is awesome, so imo the way contemporary GNOME or Windows 11 display search results more centrally (and using more of the screen) is more appealing.Anyhow, I do understand what you mean, I think, about the aesthetic of Windows 7 being exceptionally good among Windows aesthetics. Certain visual elements definitely seem to have hit a sweet spot in that release. reply narag 14 hours agoprevNice. But (unpopular opinion) my favourite is Expose that clones Windows XP&#x27;s Luna.The included analog clock is from Windows 7 though.They say Luna is plasticky and teletubbies land.

Dolphin has this dir&#x2F;files mixed tree in the right pane, but it&#x27;s just not the same.Still very satisfied with my recent switch to Linux&#x2F;KDE. Almost everything worked out of the box, with very minor annoyances. Refreshing compared with my recent Windows experience. reply AdmiralAsshat 16 hours agoprevHonestly, I find that as long as the DE keeps the \"desktop\" metaphor, it&#x27;s not too difficult to jump ship. Windows 7 was the last version of Windows I used in anger, and I had no trouble switching to Cinnamon DE. Mate would&#x27;ve worked just fine, too. It&#x27;s GNOME 3 and its ilk that I find frustrating, and keep having to apply tweaks to make it usable for me.The couple of times I tried Plasma, I loved all the customisability of it; it&#x27;s awesome that I can apply one theme and now it feels like Windows 7, or a different theme and now it&#x27;s Unity. But the \"default\" feel of Plasma just feels overwhelming, and even though I could drill down into fifty levels of settings to get what I want, it still turned me off because what I really wanted was just better defaults... reply _benj 15 hours agoparentI hear you there. After getting frustrated enough with gnome 3 to jump to plasma I quickly came to discover that tweaking whatever you want on the desktop is way easier than what I thought. Literally just right click on the thing and disable stuff away!The settings for plasma are certainly overwhelming, but if there are too many tools on the file browser, right clink on the icons and hide what you don’t want. Taskbar too crowded? Right click it and get rid of stuff. Konsole is showing the menu bar and wrong fonts?

    "originBody": "Ten years from Snowden revelations – what’s next for Tor and privacy online? by isabelaDecember 19, 2023 A decade ago, in June of 2013, Edward Snowden risked his freedom to share documents with the press that exposed the extent of the U.S. government’s mass surveillance program. His process required expert operational security and strong assurances of anonymity at every step. That’s why, in part, Snowden turned to the Tor network and Tails, an operating system that routes your computer’s traffic through Tor, in order to communicate with trusted journalists. If you look at the way post-2013 whistleblowers have been caught, it is clear the absolute most important thing you can do to maintain your anonymity is reduce the number of places in your operational activity where you can make mistakes. Tor and Tails still do precisely that. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) August 24, 2019 Snowden’s leaks revealed that the NSA was engaged in widespread surveillance of the American public through the internet. This knowledge sparked many public debates about the place of surveillance in society and whether or not online privacy protections were important. Did people have a right to be private on the internet? In these debates, it was common for people to react by saying they “had nothing to hide,” when they used the internet, so why would they need privacy? In the years since Snowden blew the whistle, we have seen many concrete examples of how government and corporate privacy violations online affect the social context of a society and the lives of everyone in it. As individuals, we’ve also gained more insight into the tech industry and its abusive business model focused on harvesting information about our online behavior as if it were the new natural resource to exploit. We’ve seen that with massive data sets collected through online surveillance, governments and corporations can use their knowledge about us to manipulate public opinion. Highly targeted campaigns using this data, especially those using fake news or hate speech, have driven nations towards decisions that affect global society. The campaign for the Brexit referendum in the UK, Trump's election campaign in the U.S., and Bolsonaro’s election campaigns in Brazil all explicitly used these tactics. Witnessing the real-world impact of this data manipulation has helped many of us understand that privacy has nothing to do with having something to hide. Instead, privacy means protecting the human being that you are, all the personal details that make you, you. What you care about, what you love, what you hate, what you are curious about, what makes you laugh, what you fear. And most importantly, choosing when you decide to share that information and who you share it with. The argument about privacy has shifted from having something to hide to being able to exercise our agency. This shift in perception has generated a rise in customer demand for better privacy protection from the tech industry and the passage of legislation (like GDPR and CCPA) that tries to help consumers exercise some rights over the data we generate while using a service or app. The tech industry has morphed itself to prioritize privacy in response, at least in their marketing campaigns, in order to avoid the rejection by their customers and the risk of millions of dollars in fines due to new legislation. I say “morph” because even the thin veil of privacy-focused messaging does nothing to change business models built on harvesting data about you or to limit the way this data is used. Tech corporations are changing just enough to meet the requirements without losing profit, like how Google is phasing out the use of third-party cookies in Google Chrome in order to replace them with their own data tracking and ad serving technology--and trying to sell it as a benefit for user privacy. At the Tor Project, we offer an example of how technology can be made differently. That it is possible to build technology used by millions of people with privacy at the heart. We build technology to advance that right in order to help users reclaim their agency in digital spaces. We want to be a point of reference for what is possible regarding privacy-preserving technology developing in a changing world. Change is possible. We’re seeing it take shape. We are proud to see the rest of the industry pick up the innovations we’ve developed as part of Tor Browser and the Tor network. Web browsers are now shipping protections against third party cookies or fingerprinting, features we’ve offered for over a decade, and players like Apple are piloting features like Private Relay, a beta feature that emulates the Tor network’s model. But grasping this sea change opportunity is not only about pressuring Big Tech to change. It’s about replacing these options with tools that are built with privacy by design from the start. Tools like Mullvad Browser, OnionShare, Tails, Quiet, and Ricochet Refresh, are all part of this new kind of ecosystem. In 2024, our important work for better privacy online will continue – and we’re facing challenges on a global scale. Next year, 41% of the world’s population will take part in a national election. Political events and elections are increasingly marred with disruptions to internet freedom, from abusive data collection and manipulative ad technology to total network shutdowns and site censorship. Simultaneously, legislation around the world threatens the legality of encryption. Governments also push to increase their surveillance both with new technology and by expanding their legal powers, like we are seeing in the U.S. with the Intelligence Committee’s proposed bill, H.R.6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023, a bill that would introduce superficial reforms and extreme expansion of surveillance power. Tor will be here in 2024 to meet these challenges. We will be here expanding global access to Tor with live user support channels, localization, training with community partners, and tracking the development of internet freedom around the world. We will be advancing onion service adoption by continuing our development of administration tools for onion service operators and support of organizations that want to release onion sites. We will be strengthening the Tor network against attacks in our multi-year focus on reducing malicious relay activity on the network. We will be entering our third year of investment in re-writing Tor in Rust, a safer, more modern language that makes Tor easier to integrate in a variety of applications and services. We will be here in the fight for human rights online. The demand for strong privacy online is mounting. As a small organization, every donation makes a difference.

Maybe that is the next area of improvement.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38543155 reply Syonyk 15 hours agorootparent> so things like DNSSEC took off.DNSSEC doesn&#x27;t encrypt anything - it&#x27;s all plaintext on the wire. There are some DNS extensions that encrypt the query&#x2F;response (DNS over HTTPS does this), but DNSSEC is not that.DNSSEC is simply a way to verify that the response you get has not been meddled with in transit - it&#x27;s the domain owner signing the DNS records so that you can verify that your DNS responses aren&#x27;t being modified by a malicious entity (that may very well be your ISP). reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentYes, they&#x27;re probably thinking of DoH, which is much, much more widely deployed than DNSSEC. reply belorn 11 hours agorootparentHow are you calculating that?The number of users of recursive resolvers that support DNSSEC vs users of browsers that use DoH? Number of companies that has infrastructure that supporting DoH compared to number of companies that has infrastructure that supporting DNSSEC? Daily users? reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentThe right figure of merit should be \"lookups protected by DoH&#x2F;DNSSEC\" (stipulating that DoH and DNSSEC have different definitions of \"protected\" and just assuming arguendo they&#x27;re the same). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d even be close; I would assume DoH exceeds DNSSEC by several orders of magnitude.Note that this isn&#x27;t lookups that happen to run through a resolver with DNSSEC enabled; to count, you&#x27;d be talking about such a lookup to a zone that had DNSSEC signatures. You can see the advantage DoH has here, since it works with all zones. reply belorn 9 hours agorootparentThat would be the volume of traffic being sent over DoH compared to the volume of traffic from every recursive and authoritative dns servers that support dnssec.It would interesting to see statistics. I wouldn&#x27;t assume anything in that race. Some TLD&#x27;s which are signed has quite a lot of traffic going through them on any given day, and most resolvers connecting to those have dnssec enabled by default. There are published statistics for this, but I can&#x27;t find anything similar from either google or cloudflare. reply tptacek 4 hours agorootparentAll traffic sent over DoH is protected. Most traffic --- the overwhelming majority of traffic --- sent through a DNSSEC-verifying resolver isn&#x27;t signed by DNSSEC, because the overwhelming majority of zones --- and an even higher proportion of popular zones, by any reasonable metric of popularity you choose (I use the Moz 500) --- aren&#x27;t signed. reply127361 13 hours agorootparentprevHowever so many sites are using CloudFlare and other DDoS prevention and CDN services. I&#x27;m sure the NSA has fiber taps (beam splitters) at the point where the data travels unencrypted on the internal datacenter network.CloudFlare itself might not even be aware of the taps. Or maybe only a few select employees know about it.I think the solution to these problems is to reduce dependence on the Internet. It&#x27;s now possible to torrent an entire library worth of books and have it all on your personal computer at home. 20TB HDDs are readily available, and constantly getting cheaper.

Communications can&#x27;t be replaced with some static archives.I doubt any TLA cares if I read Python or Rust documentation, or if I watched Oppenheimer, or Barbie, or both. If they do - well, it&#x27;s their loss, because such data is absolutely worthless at scale, as repeatedly demonstrated by the ad industry failing to extract any meaning from all the Big Data(tm) they hoard. And if they would somehow get interested in me personally - I don&#x27;t think having an offline Wikipedia copy would help me any much.The solution is to encrypt and authenticate every single byte transferred, end-to-end, with strongest known algorithms.

You can chain the two together, set I2P to use an outproxy and set the Tor browser to connect through I2P.I have no clue as to what security this provides nowadays. I predict the NSA or FBI have large scale packet timing correlation in operation now. Or the random number generator has been compromised, or there are a series of bugs in the Tor or I2P implementation itself? I also think there was a human compromise of the Tor Project itself 8-9 years ago as well, it has been significantly weakened.Personally I tend to like one-way data broadcasting systems, that way the receivers cannot be traced if they are air-gapped, e.g. satellite or radio data broadcasting. However nobody operates any useful service nowadays. Twenty years ago you could receive the whole worldwide Usenet feed with a DVB-S PCI card, unencrypted in the clear from a service called Cidera[1]. It was just UDP multicast packets containing Usenet messages, split into fragments with sequence numbers, trivial to reverse engineer.I had this at service home, we had dial-up and with a 55cm satellite dish in my bedroom window, I had a 45Mb&#x2F;s data feed. I wrote my own software including a device driver for the DVB-S card running under FreeBSD (4.2-RELEASE I believe). Nearly 1000x faster than dial up, which was mind-blowing back then.Also archiving Nostr text messages is interesting, you can get the entire worldwide feed of messages from the relays, and then search for whatever topic of interest you want in the messages. Nobody can tell what you are searching for, unless your computer is compromised. I&#x27;m thinking about broadcasting these by satellite somehow, but satellite bandwidth is very expensive. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting the funds for it.Reception should be possible using a RTL-SDR or AD9364+USB3.0 microcontroller[2], and a satellite TV dish. The AD9364 chip can be had from AliExpress[3] for $6 now.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20020806064624&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cidera...2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;amungo-navigation&#x2F;stixrf3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;33017832196.html reply mdip 9 hours agorootparentI thought I was a veteran of the early internet&#x2F;Usenet enough to know most of the ins and outs but this DVB-S Usenet is new to me.That sounds like a pretty unique approach to Usenet content delivery.

They can only deanonymize you if all three nodes in one cascade collude.Running a non-exit node carries very little to no risk. reply throwaway89201 12 hours agorootparentNo, you only need to compromise the first node – named the entry guard for that reason [1] – and either the exit node or ideally the endpoint (hidden) service. Deanonymization is then possible by correlating the timing of traffic between those two points, as Tor wants to be low-latency, without randomly delaying traffic.For this reason not all nodes may be guard nodes, as decided by the directory authorities, and guard nodes are maintained for a longer time by the client to reduce the chance that you pick a compromised guard node because you switch often. This is balanced against the risk that you are unlucky and pick a compromised guard at first (which you then maintain for a longer time).The exit node is pretty much assumed to be compromised, as it&#x27;s a role not available to many entities – it requires high bandwidth and much teeth-gritting – and the public internet is intercepted at large anyway.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.torproject.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;entry-guards&#x2F; reply joe_the_user 12 hours agoparentprevThe reason Tor exists is because of intelligence agencies - they literally created it[1]. It makes perfect sense. Agencies certainly want to be able to surveil the population at large but they want to be able to act anonymously themselves. I mean, any fixed entry-point an agency chooses to the Internet is going to get a lot of attention. Agencies could mix it up in various ways - change entry points, mix their traffic, etc ... and the final result looks a lot like Tor. And so yeah, I&#x27;m sure you have idealistic operators who take heat for running nodes but I&#x27;d expect the agencies put some resources into making sure one way or another that the exit nodes exist.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tor_(network)#History reply sdsd 14 hours agoparentprevI know that Chaos Computer Club used to run a bunch of them.

But metadata regarding one-on-one conversations using something like Signal could be effectively obscured. reply 127361 12 hours agorootparentTrouble is it&#x27;s so difficult to know what your adversary is doing, it&#x27;s better to switch to a different medium i.e. reduce dependence on the Internet (as I detailed in another post).The fundamental nature of the Internet itself permits this behavior to go unchecked, there is no way for a user to know what is happening behind the scenes with certainty. We send out our private information (search queries, etc.) into this giant black box we have no control over. That&#x27;s the crux of it.That was not the case with radio or satellite TV, the ability to determine what people were listening to or watching on a mass scale was nearly impossible due to the laws of physics. As the system was completely receive-only. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentprev> Tor is considered as good as anything.By who?

It&#x27;s virtually guaranteed that the US intelligence agencies own the majority of the network between them. If they were in an arms race with foreign intelligence agencies, the number of Tor nodes would be exploding.It&#x27;s just that the NSA won&#x27;t lend its shiniest toys to the FBI just to bust some CP websites. The lives of children aren&#x27;t worth the risk of exposing and losing a zero-day exploit. reply rockskon 14 hours agorootparentIs it a major legal risk for volunteers? In most jurisdictions I&#x27;ve only heard of awkward conversations with police not familiar with what Tor is, but beyond that? Not much outside of jurisdictions that already aren&#x27;t friendly to Tor. reply Syonyk 15 hours agoparentprev> Is Tor still considered secure?Define \"secure.\" Secure from what attackers, in what threat model, with what resources devoted to the attack, etc.There are several categories of attack against Tor, and several ways to mitigate them, depending on who you are and what you use Tor for.For a typical end user of Tor, the main one to worry about is \"browser beaconing\" style attacks - where a compromised onion website causes the browser to beacon out, on the clearnet, with something that links the browser&#x27;s request on the clearnet to the browser&#x27;s activity on the onion network. If you just use a regular browser proxied to Tor, this is a rather high risk, as browsers leak all sorts of things (I believe WebRTC was a common way of doing it for a while). The solution here is Whonix - a multi-VM setup in which your workstation (with a stripped down browser) is only connected to a Torification VM that routes all inbound traffic over Tor. So, if the browser tries to beacon out, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Pop open a command shell and use ping, it still goes out through Tor. Etc. I consider this a reasonable way to use Tor, and any lesser construct is probably a dumb idea unless you&#x27;re using it for things like sysadmin where beaconing out doesn&#x27;t matter. Of note, Qubes supports the Whonix configuration as a first party sort of setup, and can route all your traffic through Tor, should you care.There&#x27;s also the risk of traffic correlation for end users, but I don&#x27;t have a sense for the scale of this risk - I wouldn&#x27;t leave long running connections over Tor, but I don&#x27;t know if it matters for \"casual use.\"If you&#x27;re hosting hidden services, the \"guardian nodes\" that know your identity are a risk, and given how many nodes seem to be run by three letter agencies, you&#x27;ll want to deeply understand Tor and how to protect your services if you&#x27;re going to host something - I believe you can limit guardian nodes to those you trust (and run yourself, perhaps?), but that changes some of the risk equations in ways I don&#x27;t fully understand how to reason about (not running hidden services that matter - my blog has an .onion address, but it&#x27;s literally just the same content as the clearnet version).And then, we get into the problem that \"computers in general\" could be argued very convincingly to be \"not in the slightest bit secure against a high level adversary,\" which is another can of worms... reply jstanley 15 hours agoparentprevWhat are you going to do? Not use Tor? That&#x27;s hardly better. reply ravenstine 15 hours agorootparentThere are alternatives to Tor that have different anonymity and routing protocols.For example, take a look at I2P, which has been around almost as long as Tor. It has a lot in common with Tor, but has some key differences that may be appealing to some people. I2P nodes are capable of implementing something like an exit node (often called an \"outproxy\"), but there&#x27;s no distinction between peers in I2P that designates one as an exit node. The project is more oriented towards hidden services, implementing its internal network, than it is in anonymizing connections to the clearweb. I think it&#x27;s great that Tor exists, but I wish more people would consider I2P or at least simultaneously hosting their hidden services on both Tor and I2P. And if you really don&#x27;t like running a Java runtime, Purple I2P exists and is written in C++.There are also other networks like GNUnet, which slightly predates Tor, which is mostly file-sharing oriented, but with the goal of anonymity. It can do other things too but, from what I can tell, the project never gained much favor anywhere. Nevertheless, it still exists and is being worked on.And I can&#x27;t forget Freenet, or what&#x27;s not referred to as \"Hyphanet\". I&#x27;ll just call it Freenet for now because a lot of people still remember it. Freenet&#x27;s focus is not only on anonymity but providing a distributed data store that is censorship resistant. This at least in part solves the issue of having to be online all the time in order to host a hidden service. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used Freenet, but supposedly the community is very good at discouraging crime and other unsavory elements. I haven&#x27;t used the new iteration called Hyphanet.All of these projects have significant differences from Tor, and some of these differences are seen by some as fixing significant flaws present in the Tor protocol that Tor can&#x27;t reconcile. I2P&#x27;s design of having no peer distinctions, in my opinion, is a vastly superior model for both security and plausible deniability. Its routing protocol also makes DDoS attacks a greater challenge. Having a primitive yet effective implementation of human-readable hostnames is also nice.All of these projects are available for people to use today.Tor does have two upsides. The first is that it has a larger community. The second is that it has the Tor Browser, which I2P does not have an equivalent to, although the Tor Browser can be adapted to use I2P. reply pphysch 16 hours agoparentprevThe Tor Project is primarily funded by the US State Department and DARPA [1], so it is a forgivable error if someone mistook TOR for FBI surveillance software.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.torproject.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;reports&#x2F; reply nacs 15 hours agorootparentTor seem pretty open about where that money is coming from and have DARPA and US goverment funds listed here with explanations: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.torproject.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;\"U.S. Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor leads the U.S. efforts to promote democracy, protect human rights and international religious freedom, and advance labor rights globally.\"\"DARPA&#x27;s Resilient Anonymous Communication for Everyone (RACE) program researches technologies for a distributed messaging system that can: a) exist completely within a given network, b) provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability of messaging\"Both of those seem to align with Tor&#x27;s goals of privacy and confidentiality. reply nerdbert 13 hours agorootparentEven if they aren&#x27;t spying on people&#x27;s TOR traffic, it&#x27;s still useful for spies. The more people are using TOR, the easier it is for them to hide their own traffic alongside it. reply pphysch 15 hours agorootparentprevHow does that square with the GP&#x27;s linked articles that allege the FBI \"cracked\" TOR on multiple occasions?It strikes me as cognitive dissonance that someone would simultaneously distrust the USG for obvious reasons (TFA is about Snowden), yet also think they are a perfectly noble arbiter of \"secure communications\", and look the other way when copious evidence suggests that the USG has means to compromise said \"secure communications\".It&#x27;s a very roundabout way of arguing \"if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear\". TOR is a fine product if you aren&#x27;t doing anything that the USG would realistically prosecute you for. reply kube-system 14 hours agorootparentThe USG is not a monolith and doesn&#x27;t operate like one. It is composed of many entirely different organizations doing different things with different goals. reply pphysch 12 hours agorootparentIf it were just one agency, sure, but we have evidence that State, DARPA, and FBI all have their hands in the TOR cookie jar. It would be naive to assume that CIA and NSA aren&#x27;t there too.Occam&#x27;s Razor says that TOR is primarily a tool of the USG for enabling intelligence & influence operations, particularly those involving low-level assets without clearances (e.g. color revolutions), and the stuff about \"consumer privacy\" is an unreliable side effect. replyjoe_the_user 16 hours agoprevIt seems like there are multiple reactions one can have to Snowden type revelations:1) \"I have nothing to hide\" (which isn&#x27;t quite as bad as it sounds - \"my security is being a nobody\")2) \"The government shouldn&#x27;t be spying on people\"3) \"The government shouldn&#x27;t be spying on people but of course they are and you should expect that. Your online privacy is essentially your jobs and you shouldn&#x27;t use services and expect them to protect your privacy\"4) \"Even if the state is always actually going to spy on people in various fashions, we still don&#x27;t want to accept and normalize this. Forcing the state to &#x27;parallel construction&#x27; is better than letting the just publicly exhibit all its surveillance since normalized surveillance has more of a chilling effect. Moreover, institutions have a limited ability to keep their own secrets so surveillance is itself going to periodically come into the open and when it does, attacking it is useful, again, even if we know it will always be an element of modern society\".5) And you can go on and on...

I think many of the J6 crowd thought the same thing when posts they made online were used in evidence against them. You may have nothing to hide, but like Snowden said: \"Saying you have nothing to hide is like saying you don&#x27;t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say\"*In both situations there is a loss of privacy and autonomy. At some point people just shut down, for the same reasons people behave differently when they know they are under surveillance verses when they think they&#x27;re not.*paraphrasing reply kube-system 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not so much that digital security isn&#x27;t important -- it&#x27;s that if you are not a \"nobody\", and you have something to hide, digital security is further down your list of your worries.I think too many people think about \"digital security\" in isolation, without any human context or considerations of threat profile. Digital security without holistic human security is simply a math exercise. reply nufonewhodis 13 hours agoprev [–] Hi,is it possible to mark the packages that leave your house and flow into the street using your router or some small device in the box that connects the cables from outside going into your house?And could these boxes on the street do a job like that?I mean, even if I have a DIY network, hard- and software, at home, wouldn&#x27;t it be futile because my encrypted packages, while not easily opened, could still be \"marked\" at any point outside my house?! With a prefix or in between the packets? That&#x27;s what someone on the internet means, when they say, the more of us use Tor, the better protected the few are and the fewer users surf via tor, the less protected whistleblowers and journalists are.Also: when our packages are encrypted, wouldn&#x27;t it be possible for specific software, say, MS Windows, to pack huge amounts of very specific data into some of these packages, that would get encrypted in \"reengineerable\" ways, that are easier to break?I have a surface-level understanding of the basics of these things.

The framework needs a revenue stream to enable continued investment. Rails has basecamp. Bootstrap had twitter. React has meta. Tailwind has Tailwind UI.I find it great value. It&#x27;s a one-off cost comparable to hiring a designer or front-end developer for a day, and you get a bunch of usable components + future upgrades.Usually HN isn&#x27;t as negative about revenue streams for open-source developers. reply sarathyweb 1 hour agoparentThe developers are very generous too. 4 years back when I was in college I reached out to them and asked for a student discount.

You receive a Figma design, and you tweak the components.But yeah, it is clearly not yet finished, the dark mode has a too low color ratio. Good thing is that this UI library comes bundled with the previously existing Tailwind UI. reply boundlessdreamz 6 hours agoprevHaven&#x27;t checked out Catalyst but I have used TailwindUI. The components are really good but if you are not using a JS framework, it&#x27;s a lot of work to integrate. The regular JS version of TailwindUI uses Alpine which doesn&#x27;t have a CSP compatible version so you will have to write the Javascript from scratch.Partially due to these and frustrated by lack of component libraries in Rails, I built and recently released a UI kit for Rails - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zestui.comBuilt with Phlex, styled with Tailwind with custom built Stimulus controllers.It&#x27;s got- 25 themes- Dark Mode- Form Builder- Icons- Built in Flash Toast- The components are responsive or have specific mobile views- All the JS needed (Stimulus controllers) is wired up automaticallyPhlex is a game changer. It is simple, powerful, intuitive and performant.

Those two are very powerful and also lightweight&#x2F;minimal. reply norman784 1 hour agorootparentFor most apps&#x2F;sites something like Stimulus, htmlx, etc are good enough, also all JS frameworks comes with complexity, now you need a bundler, eslint, prettier, postcss, etc. I can appreciate the simplicity of relying purely on Rails ecosystem or at least very minimum JS that does not require a bundler. reply boundlessdreamz 3 hours agorootparentprevPrecisely because it can be used to sprinkle JS functionality :)Vue and Svelte are great but adopting them means that you are using Rails as just a backend. For the vast majority of apps, the Rails default stack works really well. reply Kiro 1 hour agoparentprev> which doesn&#x27;t have a CSP compatible versionWhat do you mean? reply boundlessdreamz 1 hour agorootparentThis comment has the details.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34366454 reply __float 6 hours agoparentprevThis is neat!It&#x27;d be nice if clicking the blurred background area on a Sheet closed the sheet like the x button does. reply boundlessdreamz 6 hours agorootparentThat is planned as an option.i.e the developer decides whether to offer that. Some don&#x27;t like it because accidental clicks close the sheet&#x2F;modal which can confuse non tech savvy users. reply reactordev 5 hours agorootparentI think we are well past the curve on the diffusion of innovation chart on this feature. It’s expected behavior that if a modal is focused and the background is blurred that clicking on the background will close the modal (or initiate close).You can see this for yourself by using a heat-map of your users mouse movement and positioning. Note how many try to close with clicking the background. reply boundlessdreamz 5 hours agorootparentMaybe and it will be the default. But since this is a UI kit, I will expose an option to turn it off if the developer prefers that in general or in a specific context. replyJasonSage 23 minutes agoprevThere&#x27;s something I genuinely don&#x27;t understand in discussions of price, which is that folks seem to want to ignore basic economics.Something is either worth it to you or it&#x27;s not. If it is worth it, and you want it, you may buy it. If it&#x27;s not, then you don&#x27;t buy it. The world keeps spinning.The Tailwind folks seem to think this may be worth $150 to some people. Those people might buy it. If you think it&#x27;s not worth that, it doesn&#x27;t mean that those people are wrong, it means that you 1) don&#x27;t understand the value or 2) the value just doesn&#x27;t exist for you, and it&#x27;s not for you.Or maybe people do understand the economics of it, but there&#x27;s something psychological that&#x27;s more pressing: because one person doesn&#x27;t find value, and sees another person that does find value, they must defend or justify their own value assessment and confront the opposition. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a name for this, but I don&#x27;t know it off-hand. reply atonse 7 hours agoprevI bought tailwind UI more than a year ago. The lifetime&#x2F;unlimited product or whatever it was.It’s generally fine but feels incomplete. Many of the components don’t have any alpine or JS code documented even though the team has clearly built those aspects when building the previews and demos.I’m not sure what the rationale was there but I hope they’ve fixed it here. reply 7sidedmarble 7 hours agoparentCause that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for? It&#x27;s like the opposite of headless components. It&#x27;s all head and no component. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re buying. I think that&#x27;s pretty clear cause that is what Tailwind is. It&#x27;s CSS, not a component library.

I’m weaker on the design side so having a consistent and decent look and feel is great.

As part of the original TailwindUI product you get UI component templates where you can choose between React, Vue or plain HTML (= framework agnostic!) versions of the source.However the React version is essentially a big monolithic template, which is what they are trying to address with Catalyst, where those templates are being split up into components (+ other improvements). reply wokwokwok 6 hours agoparentprevYes… but that isn’t possible in a meaningful way.Many other UI frameworks such as kendo have tried this and failed, and gone back to variants for each UI framework.Really, if you want meaningful integration with a ui library it has to natively support that library.I mean certainly I would be delighted if they’d figured out a way to do this, but it’s unsurprising they didn’t: it’s just a very very difficult problem to solve, and the only really decent effort at it (web components) has had extremely limited support and enthusiasm from the community, and has some reasonably unsolvable technical limitations.Someone needs to invent a way of doing that that works before you could reasonably expect people to start building frameworks with it. reply mock-possum 5 hours agoparentprevLike say plain old web components? reply lucasyvas 4 hours agoprevUnfortunately, I&#x27;m going to have to dunk on the irony of developing a CSS-first toolkit then only releasing headless React components. At least if you used Svelte or WebComponents directly you could compile them down to bind to other frameworks.I&#x27;m not a React hater, but it&#x27;s time for React-only support for UI toolkits to end. There are other compelling frameworks that are also worth using that are better choices in many cases. reply jwr 1 hour agoprevI would gladly pay this price as a monthly subscription, if only I could get a maintained CSS library that lets me build applications on a level similar to Semantic UI, with the ability to customize or theme components.I don&#x27;t want JavaScript, I don&#x27;t want a \"framework\", I don&#x27;t want an npm-installable-monster, I want something that produces CSS that I can use for business. Semantic UI was close, but it got abandoned, and the forks do not go in the right direction.Also, I need information-dense design, not whitespace-dominated design. Some of us build complex apps that display a lot of information and need tightly packed UI.This is not hypothetical: I really do need to replace Semantic UI with something that is maintained and will work better on mobile screens. At a quick glance, my code has several thousand places where Semantic UI tags are used.

    "originLink": "https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-20/california-workers-say-herbicide-is-giving-them-parkinsons",
    "originBody": "BY HAYLEY SMITHSTAFF WRITER DEC. 20, 2023 3 AM PT Facebook Twitter Show more sharing options It was the late 1980s when Gary Mund felt his pinky tremble. At first it seemed like a random occurrence, but pretty quickly he realized something was seriously wrong. Within two years, Mund — a crew worker with the Eastern Municipal Water District in Riverside County — was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The illness would eventually consume much of his life, clouding his speech, zapping most of his motor skills and taking away his ability to work and drive. “It sucks,” said Mund, 69. He speaks tersely, because every word is a hard-won battle. “I was told the herbicide wouldn’t hurt you.” The herbicide is paraquat, an extremely powerful weed killer that Mund sprayed on vegetation as part of his job from about 1980 to 1985. Mund contends the product is responsible for his disease, but the manufacturer denies there is a causal link between the chemical and Parkinson’s. Gary Mund recently lost his wedding band, and his wife Tammie has to help him trim his fingernails. (Monique Sady / For The Times) Paraquat is manufactured by Syngenta, a Swiss-based company owned by the Chinese government. The chemical is banned in at least 58 countries — including China and Switzerland — due to its toxicity, yet it continues to be a popular herbicide in California and other parts of the United States. But research suggests the chemical may cross the blood-brain barrier in a manner that triggers Parkinson’s disease, a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Now, Mund is among thousands of workers suing Syngenta seeking damages and hoping to see the chemical banned. Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science. Explore our new section Since 2017, more than 3,600 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking damages from exposure to paraquat products, according to Syngenta’s 2022 financial report. ADVERTISEMENT “Despite decades of investigation and myriad epidemiological and laboratory studies, no scientist or doctor — whether or not affiliated with Syngenta — has ever concluded in a peer-reviewed scientific analysis that paraquat causes Parkinson’s,” the company’s chief communications officer, Saswato Das, wrote in an email. Some scientists contend they commonly use paraquat to induce Parkinson’s disease in mice as part of research studies, according to Ray Dorsey, a professor of neurology at the University of Rochester in New York and the author of “Ending Parkinson’s Disease.” Tammie Mund helps her husband, Gary, get dressed in their home in Sparks, Nev. (Monique Sady / For The Times) “There have been numerous academic researchers over the last 20-plus years — and multiple different investigators in multiple different locations — that have found that paraquat, when fed to laboratory animals, reproduces the features of Parkinson’s disease,” Dorsey said. He said that paraquat has been shown to damage mitochondria — the energy-producing components of cells — and damaged mitochondria have been implicated in the likely environmental and genetic causes of Parkinson’s. He referenced an oft-cited 2011 study funded by the National Institutes of Health that found a strong association between Parkinson’s and paraquat. It found that workers exposed to paraquat had a 250% greater risk of getting Parkinson’s disease than people not exposed to the chemical. “Because paraquat remains one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide, this finding potentially has great public health significance,” the study concluded. CALIFORNIA California workers who cut countertops are dying of an incurable disease Sept. 24, 2023 Currently, an estimated 1 million people in the United States are living with Parkinson’s disease, which has no known cure. California is home to a high incidence of cases, with large clusters found in agricultural regions where herbicides are heavily used, including Kern, Kings, Merced and San Joaquin counties, according to a 2022 geographic study. ADVERTISEMENT Dorsey and other researchers ceded that, as with cancer and other diseases, it can be difficult to isolate the precise cause of a patient’s Parkinson’s. Outdoor workers may have been exposed to several chemicals and environmental toxins over the course of their careers. Surrounded by family photos, Gary Mund checks his email in Sparks, Nev. (Monique Sady / For The Times) “Yes, people are exposed to several different chemicals, but we try to control for that in epidemiology studies as best we can,” said Jeff Bronstein, director of the Movement Disorders Program at UCLA who has studied the link between paraquat and Parkinson’s in California’s Central Valley. That the animal studies are done by different labs “adds to what we call biological plausibility. It all supports that paraquat increases the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.” CALIFORNIA Jury awards $332 million to Carlsbad man who blamed his cancer on Roundup weedkiller Nov. 3, 2023 Groups such as Earthjustice and the Michael J. Fox Foundation have been pushing for years to ban paraquat, with the latter noting on its website that the herbicide is “thought to increase Parkinson’s risk by 100 to 500 percent, depending on overall exposure.” Paraquat is 28 times more toxic than another controversial herbicide, Roundup, according to a report from the Pesticide Action Network. (Roundup has been banned in several parts of California, including a 2019 moratorium by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors forbidding its use by county departments.) Paraquat also has other known health effects. It is listed as “highly toxic” on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s website, which says that “one small sip can be fatal and there is no antidote.” The EPA is currently reviewing paraquat’s approval status. Gary Mund, who has Parkinson’s disease, rides and his wife, Tammie Mund, walks through their neighborhood in Sparks, Nev. (Monique Sady / For The Times) However, both the EPA and Syngenta cited a 2020 U.S. government Agricultural Health Study that found there is no clear link between paraquat exposure and Parkinson’s disease. A 2021 review of reviews similarly found that there is no causal relationship. Dale Sandler, senior author of the 2020 study, said the researchers observed licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses from Iowa and North Carolina over the course of several years. The study found a 9% increase in the relative risk of Parkinson’s disease incidence associated with using paraquat, which she said was “not statistically significant.” However, paraquat was significantly associated with the disease among those who reported a history of head injuries, with a more than threefold increase in risk based on a small number of cases with both exposures, said Sandler, who is also head of the epidemiology branch at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Multiple sources said the dizzying array of competing research is a reflection of industry pushback, political lobbying groups and deep-pocketed agribusiness. Syngenta reported a record $33 billion in sales in 2022. One leading researcher on the matter said she has been retained as a witness in pending lawsuits and so was not comfortable commenting publicly for this report. Gary and Tammie Mund watch TV at their Sparks, Nev., home. (Monique Sady / For The Times) But the overall findings point in one direction, said Michael Okun, director of the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida. “The collective evidence really points to a serious problem and an emerging association with paraquat that just keeps getting stronger and stronger over time,” said Okun, who is also a medical advisor with the Parkinson’s Foundation, a national nonprofit organization. For the record: 12:46 p.m. Dec. 20, 2023An earlier version of this article said documents were unveiled as part of ongoing court proceedings in Illinois. The proceedings are in California. Documents unveiled as part of ongoing court proceedings in California show that Syngenta has spent decades investigating the potential side effects of its product. This research has sometimes contradicted public statements issued by the company, a difference first reported by the Guardian. This includes the 2011 study that showed a 250% increase in disease incidence among workers exposed to paraquat. In a 2022 deposition, Syngenta’s principal science advisor, Philip Botham, acknowledged that the company made a considerable effort to obtain the data used in that study and conducted its own analysis, which reached the same conclusion about the incidence of the disease, according to a transcript of his testimony. However, the finding was not publicized and Botham did not divulge it in a subsequent interview with the New York Times. Another transcript indicates that Syngenta attempted to downplay studies showing that paraquat administered to mice caused a reduction in the number of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra, the part of the brain that produces dopamine, which is another hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. In 2003, a Syngenta scientist, Louise Marks, attempted to replicate those mice studies but found no such reduction in dopamine. However, she expressed concerns about potential shortcomings in her methodology, according to Botham’s testimony. Marks then traveled to California, where a Syngenta consultant taught her an improved methodology, after which she repeated the study multiple times and did indeed find a reduction in dopamine cells. Despite Marks’ concerns, Syngenta publicized her original findings at an annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in 2004, Botham testified. Syngenta did not publish all of her updated studies or report her reservations to the EPA, he said. Das, of Syngenta, dismissed the 2011 study as an “interim study that looked at only part of the data,” and said the findings were later expanded upon and improved in the 2020 study that found no clear link. Regarding dopamine loss in mice, he said the animals in those studies were given doses “as much as 22,000 times higher than the highest amount of exposure found in U.S. farmers” and that animal studies cannot be used to prove causation. He said the majority of Marks’ findings were not reported to the EPA because they were materially similar to what was already in the public literature. ADVERTISEMENT “In short, the hypothesis that paraquat causes Parkinson’s is not accepted in the medical community or peer-reviewed science, nor has it been accepted at any time in the past,” he said. CLIMATE & ENVIRONMENT Here’s what we know about the legacy of DDT dumping off L.A.’s coast May 18, 2022 Still, Syngenta has paid at least $187.5 million into its settlement fund as of 2021, according to its financial report. One attorney involved in California litigation estimated that there are at least 300 active plaintiffs in the state and at least 4,500 in the country. Chevron is also named as a defendant in many cases, because the company distributed paraquat in the U.S. from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s before abandoning the product. In Mund’s legal complaint, attorneys ague that the companies “failed to warn that paraquat was likely to cause neurological damage that was both permanent and cumulative, and repeated exposures were likely to cause clinically significant neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson’s disease.” Officials with Syngenta, however, said the endless stream of litigation is the product of a “mass tort machine” generated by law firms with profit motives. At one time, they said, there were commercials airing on television every six minutes seeking plaintiffs or people who may have a claim to injury. ADVERTISEMENT In California, at least, the debate rages on. Last year, half a dozen researchers, including Okun and Dorsey, signed a letter to the California Department of Pesticide Registration urging it to reconsider use of the chemical. The letter warned that “paraquat presents a public health hazard to residents and workers in the state of California.” The letter was among more than 4,600 comments submitted to the agency last year related to the use of paraquat in the state — including some that cited more than 70 news articles and 40 scientific studies regarding potential human health and ecological toxicity, according to department officials. “DPR continues to evaluate the data associated with the public comments on paraquat dichloride renewal and plans to issue a response after considering the comments and available information,” wrote Tulio Macedo, chief of the pesticide registration branch, in the agency’s most recent semiannual report in September. At the same time, federal legislation has been introduced that seeks to ban paraquat in the United States. That includes the proposed Protect America’s Children from Toxic Pesticides Act of 2023, introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Tammie Mund helps her husband, Gary, to his feet at their home in Sparks, Nev. Gary Mund has Parkinson’s disease and he’s suing the maker of the herbicide paraquat, which he blames for his ailment. (Monique Sady / For The Times) For people such as Mund, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 1990, such decisions can’t come soon enough. He and his wife, Tammie, recently moved to Sparks, Nev., to be closer to their kids and grandkids. ADVERTISEMENT The couple has been married for 50 years — not all of which have been easy, as the disease has taken a financial toll on the family as well as a physical and emotional one, Tammie said. Among other treatments, Mund has had two brain surgeries and now has a deep brain stimulation implant in his head to help him control his symptoms. “It’s been a long-term process,” Tammie said as she pointed to a fresh scab on her husband’s scalp from a recent fall. Mund said he has no relatives with Parkinson’s and that a medical test confirmed his case was not genetic. But he did have a co-worker who was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s and later died, he said. “They banned DDT back in the ’60s,” Mund said, asking why the same hasn’t happened for paraquat. He said he experienced a lot of anger in the early years after his diagnosis, but he’s mostly come to terms with it. However, he still wishes he could ride his motorcycle one last time, he said. His wife has a different wish. “We’d like to see it banned,” she said.",

I remember him telling me that herbicide is harmless: \"you can drink a spoon of it and you&#x27;d be fine, unlike pesticide\".Well... he got Parkinson&#x27;s.He also told us: \"sugar is harmless\". My parents would prepare house made syrup with a lot of sugar and he liked drinking it with soda. Quite a lot of it. Eventually when he started feeling not so good, he&#x27;d fight off the feeling by downing some additional glasses or sugary drink.Well ... he got diabetes.Eventually it was Parkinson&#x27;s what finished him. In a way it&#x27;s effect is similar to Stephen Hawking&#x27;s disease, loss of motor function, only much slowly, albeit inevitably. Problem is you lose not just voluntary but also vegetative muscle function, including gut movements. Which is what eventually kills you: even though you can&#x27;t swallow food anymore (not that you&#x27;re feeling hungry, you feel sick and miserable) and it&#x27;s fed to you by a tube, there&#x27;s no point when your gut can&#x27;t move it out of your body eventually.
