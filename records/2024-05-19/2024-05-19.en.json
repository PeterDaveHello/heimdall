However, I will say that 'classified' has often become a way to hide actions that governments and individuals don't want the public to see instead of hiding things in order to protect the public. I think countries need laws on the duration of classification that get to the heart of national security vs public interest. I think a core issue is that classified information should come out within the lifetime of people involved with very few exceptions. Additionally, crimes found after declassification should have automatic statute of limitation renewals. One system that may work could be automatic mandatory release unless renewed at a higher level of classification. Every time material is elevated it should require the highest level of administration to approve renewal. Additionally, when things are declassified they should be publicly advertised in some way so that records requests can find them. There is a need for classified materials, but there should be a high bar to make them and a low bar to release them in order to avoid the government using them as a shield to hid activities they don't want the public to see. reply xg15 19 hours agoparent> I will say that 'classified' has often become a way to hide actions that governments and individuals don't want the public to see instead of hiding things in order to protect the public. You can probably rationalize anything as \"protecting the public\" with the magic phrases \"national security\" (no exposing shady government operations), \"ensuring order and stability\" (no political protests) and \"ensuring innovation and prosperity\" (no resisting anything the private sector wants to do). reply jmward01 19 hours agorootparentYes, you can, but that doesn't mean there isn't a real need in some, if not many, cases. The big questions are how do we balance the real need to protect national security with the actual harm to public interest and how do we eventually address the actual harm to public interest that occurred when something was classified. reply hedora 18 hours agorootparentOne possibility would be to criminalize over classification. reply flappyeagle 17 hours agorootparentThat would have its own unintended consequences reply blackeyeblitzar 19 hours agorootparentprevDon’t forget about the “safety of children”. reply skeeter2020 18 hours agorootparentor justification with just \"9-11\" - is that still the ultimate rejoinder? reply throwaway290 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is pretty much how they call these laws in China... reply withinboredom 19 hours agoparentprevAt least in the US government, whomever creates the document classifies the document.

The rest is “derivative” of an OCA’s decisions. reply withinboredom 12 hours agorootparentWell, that happened in 2009, I was in back in 2007… so, if we want to get super-pedantic, only the President can classify and unclassify documents and he/she delegates the fuck out of it. reply martinflack 18 hours agorootparentprev> It basically requires an act of congress or the President to change it once done. Isn't the mere passage of time also a remover of classification? Like isn't there a default time from the creation date?

I don't think there is anything automated about it. reply eynsham 15 hours agoparentprevHave you read Division 3 of the Archives Act 1983? Something along these lines is fairly widespread, although of course the Sir Humphreys of the world have had some success in limiting the damage done to their interests. https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A02796/latest/text reply grayhatter 16 hours agoparentprev> One system that may work could be automatic mandatory release unless renewed at a higher level of classification.

Additionally, when things are declassified they should be publicly advertised in some way so that records requests can find them. Never worked with any TS/SCI huh? I agree with your base idea, but the devil is in the details here. We do need better policy around classified material, given it's supposed to serve the population. But automatic outcome based on some unconnected rules or judgement, uh... doesn't have a great track record for success. We likely do need more accountability to make sure secrets from society serve that society. But I don't think an edict about expiration dates is that. reply jmward01 5 hours agorootparentI understand that the idea is far from perfect, but I am willing to risk some harm to national security in order to avoid actual harm to the interests of citizens. We need to start understanding that hiding things from citizens equals actual harm and, in general, actual harm outweighs theoretical harm in my book. I will also add that the fact that so many people in this forum understand the basics of US classification shows how many people actually have had a clearance in their lives. How much are we actually protecting national security when so many people know the secrets already? reply eynsham 15 hours agorootparentprev>an edict about expiration dates is exactly what Division 3 of the Archives Act 1983 (Australia) and section 3(4) of the Public Records Act 1958 (UK) provide for, so this is hardly as unworkable an idea as you make it out to be. reply monkeyfun 11 hours agoparentprev[10-20 years after the proposed laws and regulations pass] [female newscaster]: Today, the president signed the superbill package preventing government shutdown, while funding all national military, education, and healthcare spending, in a move widely lauded.

Ben Roberts-Smith has been shown to have committed war crimes on the balance of probabilities, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.

The definition needs a list of proper list of requirements otherwise you have countries with very varying levels of individual rights reply schappim 21 hours agorootparentA third of the country is literally called \"Western Australia.\" Jokes aside, a Western country is typically defined as a nation with cultural, political, and economic ties to Europe.

Central/Eastern Europe wasn't included, especially countries that were part of the soviet bloc. One can talk about them becoming westernized now, but that just emphasizes how they aren't a part of the group, just becoming like it. Also, the US is epitome of western countries. All of it. The good, the bad and the ugly. reply medo-bear 17 hours agorootparentprevI actually think \"West\" and \"East\" should go out of vocabulary.

I find it hard to blame the judge here, it is their duty to discharge the law as written. However Australia's laws are inherently anti-whistle-blower and IMO therefore anti-democratic. How are the people expected to hold their leaders accountable if their leaders are legally allowed to deceive them and punish any who would expose that deceit? Claiming that \"national security\" should somehow trump what are meant to be the most core tenets of our society is just simply more proof that the ruling class considers themselves above criticism, even if it costs the truth to snuff it out. Why is it we can have a government that is so consistently anti-Australian? The politics of it don't seem to matter because swapping parties in and out hasn't had any impact. Both sides of the ruling class still believe they are above us while still preaching tall-poppy syndrome for the rest of us. reply gopher_space 16 hours agoparentIt's interesting to look at the shelf-life of actual, logistical national security issues and compare that to the \"peeling an onion\" rhetoric around information release.

How are the people expected to hold their leaders accountable if their leaders are legally allowed to deceive them and punish any who would expose that deceit? The law doesn't exist to enable democracy in any capacity. Democracy is a system by which the ruling class permits a certain amount of ineffectual governance on their populace while designing every system to inherently favor the wealthy, property/business owners, and capital. Can you make decisions in a democracy? Sure, but nothing actually important. You want to use democracy to decide on a different style of roadway or another day for trash pickup? Yeah sure, go for it. You want to use democracy to hold leaders accountable? Good luck. The chief functions of the law itself are to maintain regulated and as-free-as-possible trade, to prevent theft (inter-business, not theft from the workers, they love that shit), and to maintain the social hierarchy overall. \"Keep the poors in line\" and all that. This is actually really easy to see in real-time too: in the parlance of our political class and talking heads, \"spreading freedom\" really just means \"opening new markets.\" People are considered \"more free\" the more useless shit they can buy, irrespective of being able to do anything a working class person would call freedom. Like, you know, fix your own tractor. reply zaphar 19 hours agorootparentThis is a deliberate mischaracterization of democracy. If the system meets these criteria then it by definition isn't democracy. Allowing people to claim that it is democracy just let's them hide behind the idea without having to meet any of the obligations that idea puts on them. reply ToucanLoucan 19 hours agorootparentI mean, I fully agree with you. But this is the demonstrable reality of modern democracy. They all meet these criteria, and yes, they all hide behind the term democracy while not actually meeting any of it's obligations. If pressed they would say, \"What are you going to do about it?\" because they designed a system in which you are powerless, and so they know you can do nothing about it.

Any officer who gives you an order to execute civilians is giving you an unlawful order. This is so fundamental it is covered in basic training. The reporting around this has indicated that basically there was a culture within the SAS that you needed to be \"blooded\" and serving SAS personnel were isolated, harassed or threatened by other personnel if they didn't participate by those who were in it. The people being investigated may or may not have been acting under orders from higher officers...but the accusations are that they also directly threatened other soldiers if they objected to, or directly facilitated, those unlawful orders.

Someone elsewhere in this thread linked me to a video where McBride explained that the top brass knew about actual war crimes (e.g. Ben Roberts-Smith,) and wanted to appear to be doing something, so they tasked McBride with prosecuting a scapegoat (whom McBride believed innocent) and that was what caused him to to start gathering and leaking documents. reply KyleOneill 21 hours agoprevWhat a weird time, when it's safer to be a war crime whistle blower than an airliner whistleblower. reply Affric 21 hours agoparentWeird but pretty much the entirety of human history reply krisoft 20 hours agorootparentAre you sure about that?

    "originBody": "By Nathan Brown in Games — May 17, 2024 I hosted a spectacular 20-acre game of Capture the Flag [#61] Many players said afterward: \"This was the best game of Capture the Flag, like... EVER.\" This is the story of how I hosted the most epic game of Capture the Flag ever. I've broken it into parts so it's easier to read. I: Inception “Listen, there's something you should know about me... about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.” – Dom Cobb, Inception (2010) I was eating steak and potatoes with my family & another family on a lovely evening in late March. Since I would graduate high school in May, their family's father (who is named Taylor) gave me some life advice. He suggested I do more (good-natured) shenanigans in my life. I think that advice should be required advice for everyone. Life is too short to always \"go with the flow\" — because when you're older, you'll wish for good memories of your youth. The best memories come from doing silly/fun shenanigans with your friends.¹ Because of Taylor's advice, for the next few weeks, I had this nagging voice in the back of my head. The voice said \"yo Nathan you should really do some shenanigans before you and your friends all graduate and go your separate ways.\" So I thought each day about good-natured shenanigans — you know, the ones that wouldn't get me in trouble. And then one day, I stumbled across a YouTube video of four grown men playing a 96-hour game of Capture the Flag across the entirety of Japan.² I showed the series to my sister, and she and I were both hooked. We watched the entire series (which is ~280 minutes long!) in just three short days. Then I realized exactly what my next shenanigan would be. I couldn't fly to another country and pay for miles and miles of transit like the Jet Lag team did. But I could very well construct a large game of Capture the Flag at a local park and get all my friends to come. Because who doesn't like a great game of Capture the Flag? I was determined to execute on my awesome idea, but I needed to do some planning first. After all, I wanted this Capture the Flag game to be certifiably epic, so I couldn't just whip it all together in one afternoon. II: Planning “A goal without a plan is just a wish.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry My first step was to find a public park to play Capture the Flag in. I quickly identified two candidates: Zilker and Auditorium Shores. Then I used Google MyMaps to quickly sketch a possible playing area. Here's what my first prototype looked like: My first MyMaps prototype. I quickly grew to dislike my first prototype. The playing area: was far too large (almost 50 acres) had almost no interesting terrain (like trees or natural obstacles) was substantially uneven (red team has a clear advantage) So I ditched Zilker and moved my efforts to Auditorium Shores. I made 3-4 more prototype maps, modifying them when the territories were unequal or when the boundaries were unclear. I finally came up with the finished map after about 3 hours of work: The finished map! I also invited 31 of my friends to play Capture the Flag, because I wanted as many people to play as possible. Finally, I had to order $120 worth of equipment on Amazon: 30 flag football belts & 90 accompanying flags (15 blue belts, 15 red belts, 45 blue flags, 45 red flags) 48 orange cones (2 packs of 24) 8 playground balls (4 blue, 4 red) What is that equipment for? I'll tell you about it in the next section. III: Game Design \"To design a game is to imagine the person who will eventually play it.\" – Gabrielle Zevin, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow I keep one 'golden rule' in mind for large games like this: they must be easy to explain in three minutes or less. This is because people invariably forget rules if they are too complicated. I kept many of the classic Capture the Flag rules, because they are intuitive and form the basis of the game. But I made a few key changes: There is a neutral zone (the yellow zone on the finished map) that no one may be tagged in. The neutral zone is important, as you'll see below. Each team has two \"flags\" (aka playground balls) instead of one. To win, you must bring both the \"flags\" from the opposing team's side back to the neutral zone. The \"flags\" are playground balls because it's more fun if you can throw them to your teammates. Everyone wears a flag football belt with their team color. This eliminates all arguments related to \"did this person really tag this other person?\" To tag someone, you have to rip one of the three flags off their belt. If you are tagged (ie. someone pulls one of your belt flags while you're in enemy territory), you cannot participate in the game until you walk back to the neutral zone and wait 1 minute. This is better than having \"jail\", because with \"jail\", some players may be out of the game for a long time. Those are the main changes. Everything else is broadly the same as normal Capture the Flag. IV: Rules \"You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.\" – Dianne Feinstein Here's the whole list of initial rules. Feel free to skip this part and go read about the strategy in the next section, because this section is kind of boring. Play nice & be honest. No full-body contact. Players may not leave the playing area during the game. There is a red team and a blue team, each with an equal number of players. Everyone wears a flag football belt of their team color. The first team to bring back both enemy \"flags\" (balls) from the enemy territory to the neutral zone wins the game. If you are tagged (ie. someone pulls one of your belt flags while you're in enemy territory), you cannot participate in the game whatsoever until you walk back to the neutral zone and wait 1 minute. You cannot be tagged in the neutral zone. Your team must place \"flags\" of your own team's color: on the ground; such that they are clearly visible from two distinct angles; at least 18 feet away from all boundary lines; at least 18 feet away from your team's other flag. You cannot move \"flags\" of your own team's color, except in exceptional circumstances (prevent them from going into the lake, prevent them from rolling into the road, etc). You must always stay 6 feet away from balls of your own team's color, unless you are adjusting them momentarily. If you are tagged while carrying a \"flag\", you must drop the \"flag\" where you stand. You may throw a ball if you have it. But if the ball touches the ground after your throw, you are automatically tagged and the other team may move the ball back to where you stood when the ball touched the ground. V: Strategy \"All warfare is based on deception.\" – Sun Tzu, The Art Of War I invited thirty-one people, and nineteen people showed up by the time I explained all the rules. That made for a solid game of 10v10 Capture the Flag. There was a lot of interesting strategy that emerged throughout the three games we played! Flag Location. In the first game, both teams had the sound strategy to hide their flags near the back of the zone. This makes intuitive sense: it's harder to find & retrieve flags far from the halfway line. But this also made the flag locations easy to predict. So in the second game, both teams placed one of their flags in more unconventional locations. This made them harder to find, but when they were found, they were much easier to bring back to the neutral zone. In the third game, one team even stationed zero defenders around one of their flags, which worked very well (the other team couldn't find it). Offense vs. Defense. I thought the game rules would encourage considerably more offense than defense (because \"respawning\" after being tagged is a pretty easy endeavor). I was wrong — there was a lot more defensive play than I expected. But in the games we played, the team with the more aggressive offense almost always won. Endurance over Speed. I didn't realize how big the playing area was until we actually started playing. After just ~10 minutes, most of the players were exhausted, and the advantage pivoted to players who had more endurance (and could evade being tagged for longer). I thought the game would be dominated by the fastest sprinters, and that was not at all true. VI: Aftermath \"Be prepared.\" – Motto of the Boy Scouts I had the foresight to bring a cooler full of two gallons of water, two bags of apples, and a bunch of individually-wrapped cheddar cheese slices.³ This was an excellent decision. The snacks and the drinks really helped people stay motivated throughout the 90 minutes that we played. I will definitely bring snacks and drinks the next time I host Capture the Flag. I also redid the map. Many of the players (including myself) thought it was too big, so I cut off a large portion of the playing area that most players never ventured into. The new map (which is only ~16 acres large) should encourage faster play & facilitate better team communication. The new map. The halfway line is slightly different, but the team territories are broadly the same. Everyone who came really enjoyed Capture the Flag, and there were no rule disputes or proposed rule changes. I'm really happy that all my planning turned out well, and I'm excited to host more games of Capture the Flag while I'm attending UT Austin. VII: Footnotes ¹ If you don't believe me, ask anyone over the age of 30 this question: \"What are your best memories from your youth?\" I can 90% guarantee you they'll say \"having fun with my friends\" or \"doingthing with my buddies\". ² I want to highlight how awesome the Jet Lag: The Game channel is. They make high-quality, super-fun videos about massive & intriguing games they've dreamt up. Would highly recommend watching a few of their videos. ³ I stored the ice packs (for the cooler), the apples, the cheddar slices, and the waters in the school fridge and freezer. Unfortunately, I mixed the freezer and fridge up somehow (?? silly me) and placed the apples, cheddar slices, and waters in the freezer and the ice packs in the fridge. When I realized my mistake, I was very annoyed. But it ended up working out, because slightly-frozen apples are actually delicious & the water was slightly icy, so it stayed extra cool in the 80 °F heat.",

Easily 40-50 kids. We just rode our bikes to the gathering. Similar rules to what this article had, except no out of bounds. We had kids making huge circuits around a nearby corn field to evade detection. It was indeed someone of my best childhood memories. Unfortunately it was all brought to an end because people kept calling the cops. They’d see kids after dark at the school and just assume we were up to no good. No property was ever damaged, the principal knew what we were up to, etc. Wholesome fun. After the fifth time of coming home with a “the cops showed up” story, our well-meaning parents asked us to please find another game to play. reply tw04 12 hours agoparentWe did this at boyscout camp until one year my buddy shattered his ankle hitting a hole running in the dark. One ambulance ride, several surgeries, major issues with morphine withdrawal, and that was the end of that. reply jvm___ 7 hours agorootparentWe played it in the fall at a campground. Our cadet group had the group camping and we played in the 50-100 campsites that weren't occupied for the season. So lots of running between campsites through the pine trees. The only problem was that the roads were blocked off at the end, with picnic tables, with chains from the picnic tables to the trees beside them. Our fastest guy found a chain in the dark with his waist. Fortunately he just got turned over and not injured. reply leoqa 6 hours agorootparentI did the same thing except it was a barbed wire fence, cut my neck, shoulder and stomach up- had to get stitched up by my friend’s mom but worked out okay. reply IncreasePosts 15 hours agoparentprevWe just told the cops we would be out there on certain nights and they were cool with it. reply sircastor 14 hours agoparentprevOne time in Highschool at a party we played a game of “Fugitive” across a few miles of neighborhood. I don’t think anyone crossed any private property, but the police showed up and told us “You’re scaring the heck out of some people”. We’d basically finished up anyway. It’s tragic that this kind of fun gets quashed. Arguably avoidable with a little community communication. I generally think it’s a product of fear-mongering. People being told that their neighborhoods are under attack from nebulous “others” who don’t look or sound like them. A ghost story. reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentIt’s super sad how much childhood joy and fun is being sucked out if the world purely due to nosy busybodies. And the fact that police even respond to these (when they won’t even show up if you’re actually robbed) is also ridiculous. Mind your own business, people. reply therockspush 10 hours agorootparentSeeing a lot of similar stories here. We used to do a game of hide and seek on our massive dead end street. Wed use peoples bushes and cars to hide. I still remember the sound of crotchety old mr peabody chambering a round in his shotgun behind us one night. Pitch black. Never saw his face, just heard him let us know we were about to die if we didn't leave. Pretty sure he knew it was 2 little kids reply wumbo 10 hours agorootparentSo a pretty good seeker reply dugmartin 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m not sure it is such a new thing. In the 1970’s we had ann old lady across the street that would call the cops when anyone rode their skateboard on the street or the sidewalk. reply coffeebeqn 8 hours agorootparentprevThe suburbs “cities” have their own very bored and well funded police forces. reply s1artibartfast 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm certainly glad to have grown up when I did. Lots of fun memories of fugitive when we weren't cooking up fireworks or something from the Anarchist Cookbook. Most of we thought was fun would probably be in jail time these days. There was a lot of risky Behavior, but it was all non-violent so if anyone got hurt, it was us, or sometimes our parents property. I don't know how kids these days are supposed to learn you need to cook up white phosphorus Outdoors and not in your friend's kitchen reply iamacyborg 2 hours agorootparent> I don't know how kids these days are supposed to learn you need to cook up white phosphorus Outdoors and not in your friend's kitchen That’s what tiktok is for reply beardedetim 12 hours agoparentprevWe played tag or hide and seek at a school one time after dark. We were probably 16 or 17 since at least some of us could drive by then. Cops called all of our parents and said we'd go to jail if it happened again. The funniest thing to me was my parents just straight yelling at me about it as my only rule at that time was \"don't get in trouble with the cops\". I tried explaining it was just tag, the cops were over reacting. They didn't buy it. I told them \"I was with Friend A and Friend B. I'm telling you the cops were being ass holes\". They immediately changed their tone to \"oh, if A and B were there, those cops were ass holes\" reply mtnGoat 10 hours agoparentprevOne time in about 8th grade we had a cap gun fight around a school around dusk. It didn’t end well when a person driving by saw flashes, heard bangs and kids yelling at each other. The local police showed up, sirens blazing and couldn’t figure out what was what, we ended up talking to them and things got sorted. We got a firm warning about how that could have ended poorly and to pick other activities to entertain ourselves. reply leoqa 6 hours agoparentprevI remember playing on the Texas State capitol lawn at night with a bunch of UT students. reply LtWorf 15 hours agoparentprevAnd that's when you started to do armed robbery for fun instead? :D reply emptyfile 15 hours agoparentprev>hey’d see kids after dark at the school and just assume we were up to no good. That sounds totally crazy to me, did these people get into any trouble or fined for just calling the police like that? I assume you're american, in my eastern european country they would NOT be happy about getting called 5 times for this... reply creer 15 hours agorootparentIt's not entirely impossible to get fined or arrested for calling the police in the US but you have to go extremely far out of bounds. Calling the police because there are kids near the school (hehe) is completely acceptable. If anything it's the opposite: if you do anything slightly out of the usual - all the way to walking through a neighborhood that doesn't know you - there is a good chance someone will call the police. And that some patrol car will check it out just for breaking the dullness of the day. Some of the cops who respond (because they might ALL head there, if it sounds fun enough), some will be smiling and relaxed and civil, while others will be very much looking for trouble and aggressive from the start. Such that for example, using plastic pistols in dark or day in public is a serious bad idea in the US. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentCan confirm. As a high schooler, I used to meet up with friends in the middle of the night at an elementary school playground. Mostly we would just swing on the swings and chat. Occasionally we'd share a 6-pack of beer, shame on us. One night, somebody called the cops, who called school district security. When they drove up we left without saying hi because we get it, we're not wanted here. Well they called the cops back, who chased us down (we ran, 'cause we were stupid). I was apprehended and from the back of the cop car I counted six other cop cars and a helicopter all looking for my friends for the crime of being near a school at night (the cops never mentioned the beer). reply creer 15 hours agorootparentSome cop noticed the beer, most likely - and they were one of the good guys. Another one might have taken this opportunity to start an in-depth \"investigation\" (read \"bullying spree\") to figure out who sold the beer and who bought it and passed it on (if anyone in that bunch might plausibly have been underage.) reply __MatrixMan__ 14 hours agorootparentSeems likely. It's still weird to me that it was worth all of that taxpayer money to keep the helicopter in the sky while they searched for my friends (most of whom took to the storm sewer and were not caught). reply Atotalnoob 14 hours agorootparentLarge cities usually have helicopters in the sky 24/7. It’s better (meaning get overhead faster) than trying to scramble when actually needed. The helicopter will go and respond to random calls if it’s not needed for anything in particular. Not defending the practice, just explaining why a helicopter might respond to something that’s overkill reply ricardobeat 10 hours agorootparentDon’t helicopters cost insane hourly amounts to operate? reply __MatrixMan__ 5 hours agorootparentYes but the thing about keeping the little people in their place is that there's always plenty of money to spend on it. reply Atotalnoob 9 hours agorootparentprevIf I’m not mistaken, yes. I believe the flight cost is 300-5k+ Fixed wing planes like Cessna 172s are in the ballpark of 100/hr. reply __MatrixMan__ 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah that makes sense. We weren't large enough to justify it though. They cancelled the program a few years later (2010ish). I haven't seen a police helicopter over this town since. reply 20after4 10 hours agorootparentI live in a town of less than 3000 people and regularly see/hear the local county shariff's military grade helicopter loitering around for no good reason. reply creer 14 hours agorootparentprevOnce when it happened to me and the whole gang responded, the \"lead responder\" was clear that he considered that this was a bullshit call and that WE totally had the right to do what we were doing and HE was sorting out a nuisance call to the police. He may also have been playing \"good cop\" - it's not like I was trusting him. While one of his buddies had parting words for me: \"Do you realize what it looked like ?\" and \"It could have been XXXXX, so of course police has to respond.\" About a helicopter, the problem is compounded because that whole outfit needs some quota of flying hours to remain certified. It might be a boring area, and any opportunity to take it out and fly then counts as training, if nothing else can be written up for that flight. That there is a helicopter guarantees that it will be used. And same for SWAT and such. reply bongodongobob 14 hours agorootparentprevThey need to justify having it in the first place, that's why it'll get dispatched for less than needed situations. Use it or lose it. reply Noumenon72 8 hours agorootparentprevI bought alcohol for some underage people who asked one time, not perceiving it as a risk because who could tell why I was buying it or watch me give it away? Not until today did I understand what could have happened. reply doctorhandshake 9 hours agorootparentprevI like to say that in suburban USA, it’s illegal to be underage in public after dark. Cops will harass you for no reason, detain you for no crime, question you with no motive other than to try to peg you with a crime, on the assumption that you don’t know your rights and won’t assert them. If you try to assert your rights they will work harder to try to put a crime on you. And then we wonder why our kids get addicted to screens and don’t leave the house. It’s insanely fucked up and it stems from bored cops fucking with kids because they have nothing better to do. reply yard2010 2 hours agorootparentIt's funny, where I come from cops behave exactly like you describe towards anyone. Not just children, grown up adults too. reply whimsicalism 5 hours agorootparentprevin the urban city i grew up in, it was quite literally illegal to be in public after 11pm reply Hayvok 10 hours agorootparentprevAmerican, yes. Can’t speak for the whole country, but in the Midwest, rural community I grew up in, people had a “better safe than sorry” attitude, and would call police on mere suspicion that you were up to no good or that something was amiss. Even told them afterward how wrong they were, they’d probably shrug and say it was still good for the police to check. reply whimsicalism 12 hours agorootparentprevoh definitely american. i’ve had the cops called on me frequently for stuff like breaking into my own house?? they’re also really on edge, i’ve had them shout at me to take my hands out of my pockets which… fair i guess? not to stereotype, but America just has lots of SAHM busybody types reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparentTo clarify, you would prefer the cops not be called if someone is breaking into your house? reply whimsicalism 5 hours agorootparenti think i would prefer if people had a little more evidence. i wasn't even entering my house, let alone breaking in, just outside with a flashlight reply rvba 10 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds that the neighboirs doing those calls, did it to cause problems for the poster above, not to be helpful (basically harassment via fake calls to the police). I bet they would NOT call the cops if real thieves showed up. Some people try very hard to be assholes. reply psychlops 15 hours agorootparentprevThe more calls the police get, the more money they are able to justify by pointing to the amount of calls received. And, I think, generally it would be a much more enjoyable call to go talk to some parents about a few kids, than to respond to more demanding complaints. reply pineaux 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I cringe that this mentality is also exported from the US to other countries. I firmly believe that breaking a leg, getting lost in the woods for an hour, being able to play somewhere without any adult supervision, really made me a stronger, more capable, stress-resistant adult. reply WaitWaitWha 10 hours agoprevIf you like this, and want to try individual \"capture the flag\", get into orienteering. Capture the flag on potentially hundreds of acres. (I believe there is a team version too, but I never done that.) And, if you want to up a notch, try radio orienteering aka fox oring aka transmitter hunting. Imagine a national park. Now drop (usually) five radio transmitters (no bigger than a briefcase) where each send out a unique morse code. You build a radio receiver that is light but sturdy that can pick up the signal if you point it at the radio, but the reception gets weaker as you turn it away. Run! Through the woods, swamps, creeks, crevices. You have to find all transmitter, get a stamp and finish before the others. Good luck! reply coffeebeqn 8 hours agoparentWe always did that in school where I’m from. I figured it was quasi military training. Here’s a topographic map and a compass kids, now run a few kilometers to the spots marked on your map and report back reply tern 11 hours agoprevThere's an intensive wilderness school in Washington, and their capstone activity is IIRC a 2 week long game of capture the flag in an even larger area of dense woods It's a great way to test stalking, camouflage, and survival skills. A lot of the game is played in pitch darkness, where moving silently becomes critical. Rather than a fast-paced running game, capturing the flag often means inching into enemy territory over the course of days, and moving back to your side just as slowly without being detected. reply carpdiem 9 hours agoparentThat sounds crazy, and amazing. As I've now got a kid of my own who might eventually be interested, could you point out _which_ intensive wilderness school in Washington that is? I did some googling, but wasn't able to find it. reply jrgoff 7 hours agorootparenthttps://wildernessawareness.org/ - I went there over 15 years ago now and did what is now called The Immersion adult program. The capture the flag type event was around 4 days long, there was another capstone experience that was around 4 days on a survival trip. I think they probably still do these activities but I'm not certain. I thought it was a great program for me. They also have programs for kids and teens including summer camps. I've heard great things about the teen wolf tracking expedition and I imagine their other programs are great too. There are a few other wilderness schools in the area, some of which may have similar activities, so I am not sure if that is the same one the GP was referring to. reply sequoia 13 hours agoprevWe played to play campus-wide capture the flag at the camp I went to as a kid a couple times and I will never forget the experience. The camp spanned an enormous area with all kinds of varied terrain and we had ~170 campers and counsellors playing. I vividly remember patrolling in an out-of-the-way part of our area by myself amongst the rhododendrons and detecting some movement; a counsellor from the other team was hiding amongst leaves. A frenzy chase ensued. One twist to this game on the enormous area was that neither team knew where either flag was, so you had to send groups to scout your own side to figure out where your flag was. I get why the person who posted this article chose not to have jail, but the jail was another fun dynamic. It gave the opportunity to break people out of jail, which was another goal besides the flag. The author is completely correct that these are lifelong memories. reply stephenhuey 10 hours agoparentWe played as a kid and it was always fun but a bit annoying when players would argue about whether they had safely crossed the line when the other team tagged them, so in my 20s, I had the idea to solve that once and for all with 1,000 feet of yellow caution tape! I organized multiple games at Spotts Park in Houston, a city not known for having elevation changes, but Spotts has a bit of hilly landscape to mix things up, plus plenty of trees and other things to hide behind. It wasn't pitch black since we were in the middle of the city, but it was big enough that people could sneak to the other side undetected if they kept looking for routes with no enemy patrols. We actually used glow sticks as the flags and the only particular rule was that they had to be visible from multiple sides if you were several feet away. A lot of adults came out to play--at least a dozen per side but sometimes twice that many! reply ntnbr 13 hours agoparentprevThanks! Was definitely considering implementing \"jail\", but I wasn't sure where to put it for both teams, so I decided against it. reply Kaotique 14 hours agoprevIn my scouts group we used to organize a father and son police, robber and fence game in the woods at night. Robbers had to transport logs to the fence to gain points. Every player had a string round their arm and you could wrestle the players from the other teams to get it. It was very cool to see the boys battle each other and see dads wrestling other dads, older brothers and scout leaders. Or sneaking in the dark with their dad carrying the logs. It was a real father and son bonding experience. Great memories. reply munichpavel 54 minutes agoprev> \"What are your best memories from your youth?\" as an over 30 year old, that's easy, and they fit with this post: 1.

Some 70 teams try to get as many of those as possible without being spotted over the course of Friday evening until Saturday night. Seekers can be any car, horse or bicycle or even also walking essentially, so it's a tense game. And hard to find an empty enough place in NL to do this. Great fun though. reply assimpleaspossi 15 hours agoprevBack in 2001 or so, I organized a 127 acre airsoft game called \"The Art of War\" with over 100 players from all over the midwest.

It was February, so the snow was pretty deep. At one point I stepped through some ice up to my knee. Rather than run straight up elimination, teams accrued points by holding positions at certain times. You've got the bunker at noon? That's a point. 12:05? Nothing. This led to us desperately defending objectives against 6-to-1 odds waiting for the ref to announce that we'd scored the point. reply tern 10 hours agorootparentThis reminded me of a game of capture the flag I played also in deep New England snow, with just a few friends, but over maybe a half-mile schoolyard with various buildings and playing fields. Long periods of silence and slow creeping punctuated by moments of sprinting when you were spotted.

Imagine the same but with soft combat swords, spears and bows!! Players with armor could stand more hits because the stamina needed to run to the respawn compressated it. With scenario variations like capture the flag, keep your fortresses, protect the VIP there was a lot of tactics to do. We called the cops beforehand and asked for a permission because it was a public land but we had no problem (Spain) reply pontifier 5 hours agoprevI organized a huge game of capture the flag for the dorms at the University of Utah back in 1999. We had 3 teams, one for each dorm building. The RAs were given special powers to free people from jail and couldn't be tagged, but weren't allowed to carry a flag. I think most people had a great time. It really helped people get to know their neighbors and the RAs for the year. reply puddingvlaai 12 hours agoprevWe played infinite variations of this game when I was a member or leader at our youth movement in Belgium. (I don't think such a thing exists in the US?) Some examples: A battleship variant: each team first their his ships in a battleship field. Then, when a player can reach the other team's camp without getting tagged, they can shoot one shot into the field of the other team. A Stratego variant: every team gets his own stack of cards which represent the different players of Stratego, the board game. Players take a card before leaving their camp. If they are tagged, or tag someone, they show their card to the other person. The winner according to the Stratego rules wins the card of the other person, and the loser must go back to their camp for another card. Some more games with paint, animal cards, ... Lot of good memories from that time. reply alwaysbeconsing 16 hours agoprevIf you have time, people, resources for such you might also interest in more elaborate variation, my favorite https://killerqueenarcade.com/fieldgame Three different win condition, and one player have special role as \"queen bee\".

I’ve had a lot of fun playing local co-op on the Nintendo Switch version as well. reply pavel_lishin 17 hours agoprevThere used to be a group that organized Capture the Flag games in FiDi, in lower Manhattan. It was a ton of fun, even though I was always worried that some overzealous guy with a flag patch and a machine gun would get antsy about a bunch of people running around. reply ertian 15 hours agoparentDuring orientation week at University of Alberta, way back in the late 90s, there was a huge campus-wide game of capture the flag. All the buildings were fair game, which made it a great way to both meet people (while hiding in a nook or running through the quad) and also explore the campus. It was great. reply rossdavidh 16 hours agoprevI live in Austin, and I find out that this happened via HN! Still, cool effort. I'm wondering what the demographics of the players was, for example age range. reply ntnbr 13 hours agoparentI (the author) am a senior in high school. It was mostly high school kids.

Hell of a fun night, but we only got away with doing it once. reply danielodievich 9 hours agoprevI live on a dead end street with forest park across, very quiet. For when my boys were preteens, we celebrated their birthdays together and one year we had the typical party with probably 30 kids, I blew up bunches of balloons and made them about a hundred icely sharpened spears out of branches from the forest to throw at balloons to see who can pop the most. My wife thought that was a bad dangerous idea that other parents wouldn't like but it was the most fun part of the event that night for kids. Everyone chucking spears,girls, boys, little hunters came out in them all. Nobody got hurt, except the bballoons. Fun!!! reply tazjin 15 hours agoprev> If you don't believe me, ask anyone over the age of 30 this question: \"What are your best memories from your youth?\" Wait, but I am in my youth! reply abeppu 15 hours agoprevI think a giant gap in this is that the list of rules doesn't account for non-players in the game area. This planned over a large public park which presumably other people use. Do you play around people? Do you avoid them with a minimum radius out of respect, or do you weave by them if it helps prevent someone from getting your flag? Participants loved the game, but how did non-participants in the park at the same time feel about it? Did they feel uncomfortable using the park with the game on all sides? If you and your friends play soccer in an open area of the park, probably all agree that other people should avoid setting up their picnic in the area of play. Parents and dog-owners should keep their kids and pets from entering. If you and your friends declare the whole park to be the area of play, including the playground, children's garden, bathroom, splash pad and parking lot as shown in the finished map, I think this ceases to be a reasonable expectation, but what the norms should be is ambiguous. reply MatthiasPortzel 13 hours agoparentThis is why stuff like this doesn’t happen more often. I played a 10-day game of tag in college. (Called Humans vs Zombie, “humans” were able to tagged by zombies any time that they were outside. We would start with ~150 humans, at the beginning, and by the end of the game only ~30 were not zombies.) The amount of work that the core-team put in to run the game was insane: reserving space on campus, marketing it to students, defining and refining rules, communicating with campus security, negotiating with campus administration, dealing with rule violations, and more. I think it’s a shame that it’s so much work to put together and play what is ultimately a very simple game with very little potential to harm anyone. But there are a lot of people who are scared and uncomfortable when other people start running around. reply giantrobot 13 hours agorootparent> But there are a lot of people who are scared and uncomfortable when other people start running around.

Can you elaborate why that is? reply ntnbr 13 hours agoparentprevTrue. I got lucky: when we played, there were maybe 20-25 non-players in the entire playing area, so avoiding them was no problem. I didn't hear any complaints about our game. It could have definitely been a bigger problem; thankfully, it wasn't. reply shermantanktop 10 hours agoparentprevI think there’s an analog to individual empathy that happens with groups. Or maybe it is just that group membership tends to suppress understanding of others. When the group is about fun, people say “why can’t they just let us do our fun thing?” —-meanwhile you have grown adults chasing each other through toddler play areas, screaming at the top of their lungs, running across the road, etc. reply jamesgeck0 7 hours agorootparentPer the authors comments, the players were teenagers. reply CDRdude 9 hours agoparentprevI think there is a very good chance this game was played at night when there would be few or no people in the park. They do not mention time of day in the post, but most urban capture the flag games are played at night. reply ledauphin 15 hours agopreva friend of mine organized 40+ player games of CTF at night on campus back in the day. The nighttime element was really key to how much fun it was. I don't think we had many, if any, disputes about whether anyone had been tagged, even without the belt flags. I love the \"ball flag\" idea. reply ntnbr 13 hours agoparentThanks! The \"flags\" (balls) really make it more fun, because you can pass to other people. reply jaredhallen 5 hours agoprevWhen I was a teenager, some of my friends and cousins and I used to play capture the flag out in the field on horses. It was a whole lot of fun until a serious accident put a girl in the hospital for reconstructive facial surgery. Needless to say we didn't do that anymore after that. On the bright side though, she recovered fully and ended up marrying my cousin who was there that day and happened to be a first responder. reply StevenXC 15 hours agoprevthe kids are alright.

Living in the midwest, there were plenty of moderate sized woods one could utilize. While that never happened, we did have a couple games on a large abandoned farm. Stalking each other within the darkness of the huge barns or climbing up to the top of an old grain silo to snipe was damn fun. reply doitLP 10 hours agoprevI started reading this expecting as usual for it to be located in some far flung location like Germany or Denver.

It depends on how well you can judge momentum, people's intentions, and it's all about \"juking\" people. Such a simple game, but because of its physics it's exceptionally skill-based. I'd love an mmorpg that had similar physics that PEOPLE master, so anyone can jump in and play without having to grind. Levelling up your reflexes instead of in-game character stats. reply zoky 15 hours agoparentWeird, I remember that game was all over Reddit about 7-8 years ago, then when I remembered it and looked it up a couple years back it was completely dead.

Camo, tackling, building prison cells, escaping from prison, getting lost for hours. Built character. reply pineaux 15 hours agoprevThere are many variants played by scouts all over the world. The different versions: 1) all players get a wool thread around their arm. If the thread is pulled loose from the arm, you are \"dead\" and need to go back to a \"spawn point\". This is quite a physical version with some nice wrestling and wolfpack elements. I prefer this version because its visceral. 2) A version where every member gets a certain \"rank\" from a spawn point. When a player tags another, the ranks must be revealed. This can be a rock paper scissors system or with some wildcards like \"mines\" that arent allowed to tag, but are deadly for all players except the sapper. You need a card system for this. Many card systems work. 3) a version with paintballs or laser tag. Also fun but you need a lot of gear to do it with a lot of people. Overall these games are best on long stretches of terrain. There is an optimal terrain width for a nice game. It is biased towards a narrow and long playing field with a lot of good cover interspaced with larger open areas that dont expose the whole width of the field. Chokepoints can be nice but can also make the game a bit boring. So there is definitely a strong dropoff on the narrower fields. reply karmanyaahm 15 hours agoprevSo cool to see another person going to UT on HN!

    "title": "Learning Calculus with Julia: Graphical, Numerical, and Algebraic Focus",
    "originLink": "https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/",
    "originBody": "Calculus with Julia Author John Verzani Published April 26, 2024 Preface Calculus with Julia This is a set of notes for learning calculus using the Julia language. Julia is an open-source programming language with an easy to learn syntax that is well suited for this task. Read “Getting started with Julia” to learn how to install and customize Julia for following along with these notes. Read “Julia interfaces to review different ways to interact with a Julia installation. Since the mid 90s there has been a push to teach calculus using many different points of view. The Harvard style rule of four says that as much as possible the conversation should include a graphical, numerical, algebraic, and verbal component. These notes use the programming language Julia to illustrate the graphical, numerical, and, at times, the algebraic aspects of calculus. There are many examples of integrating a computer algebra system (such as Mathematica, Maple, or Sage) into the calculus conversation. Computer algebra systems can be magical. The popular WolframAlpha website calls the full power of Mathematica while allowing an informal syntax that is flexible enough to be used as a backend for Apple’s Siri feature. (“Siri what is the graph of x squared minus 4?”) For learning purposes, computer algebra systems model very well the algebraic/symbolic treatment of the material while providing means to illustrate the numeric aspects. These notes are a bit different in that Julia is primarily used for the numeric style of computing and the algebraic/symbolic treatment is added on. Doing the symbolic treatment by hand can be very beneficial while learning, and computer algebra systems make those exercises seem kind of redundant, as the finished product can be produced much easier. Our real goal is to get at the concepts using technology as much as possible without getting bogged down in the mechanics of the computer language. We feel Julia has a very natural syntax that makes the initial start up not so much more difficult than using a calculator, but with a language that has a tremendous upside. The notes restrict themselves to a reduced set of computational concepts. This set is sufficient for working many of the problems in calculus, but do not cover thoroughly many aspects of programming. (Those who are interested can go off on their own and Julia provides a rich opportunity to do so.) Within this restricted set, are operators that make many of the computations of calculus reduce to a function call of the form action(function, arguments...). With a small collection of actions that can be composed, many of the problems associated with introductory calculus can be attacked. These notes are presented in pages covering a fairly focused concept, in a spirit similar to a section of a book. Just like a book, there are try-it-yourself questions at the end of each page. All have a limited number of self-graded answers. These notes borrow ideas from many sources, for example Strang (n.d.), Knill (n.d.), Schey (1997), Hass, Heil, and Weir (2018), Rogawski, Adams, and Franzosa (2019), several Wikipedia pages, and other sources.. These notes are accompanied by a Julia package CalculusWithJulia that provides some simple functions to streamline some common tasks and loads some useful packages that will be used repeatedly. These notes are presented as a Quarto book. To learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books. These notes may be compiled into a pdf file through Quarto. As the result is rather large, we do not provide that file for download. For the interested reader, downloading the repository, instantiating the environment, and running quarto to render to pdf in the quarto subdirectory should produce that file (after some time).

The programming parts are fine, but on a quick skim, the mathematics is written in a way they will likely find very confusing unless they already know calculus and leave them thinking they are bad at maths whereas actually the author is just not really trying to explain the maths to someone who doesn't already know it. For example look at the diagram on[1]. It has unlabled axes of a shaded L-shaped box with a curve going through it and then it is followed by a bunch of equations where he derives the formula for integration by parts using a set of parametric equations with multiple substitutions etc. I know what integration by parts is and how it works really well. This is possibly the most confusing way you could possibly derive the formula and/or explain it, and this diagram really adds absolutely nothing unless you already know and understand the concept. If you have seen the exceptional diagrams and illustrations and clarity of explanation in a book like \"Calculus\" by James Stewart the contrast is so stark it really jumps out. The normal way of explaining integration by parts starts the way the author does (with the product rule for derivitives) and shows a few examples of taking the derivitive of things using the product rule so you get an intuition for what the form of the resulting antiderivitive looks like. You then go through the derivation of the formula for integration by parts by using the product rule for derivitives, integrating both sides and splitting the resulting integral[2]. Its very clear and easy to follow. And if they want to actually help the student to do this they teach something like the tabular/\"DI\" method so the student isn't tearing their hair out getting the signs mixed up when integrating by parts multiple times.

Try SymPy. reply ssivark 6 hours agorootparentI imagine a language with decent support for macros would be much much more ergonomic for symbolic computation. Even ignoring all the other pros & cons, just this one reason would push one strongly towards Julia, Lisp(s), Mathematica, etc for symbolic computation. reply cfgauss2718 4 hours agorootparentprevSympy is a poor tool to learn because it simply doesn’t scale to problems one most often encounters, even in schooling. Frankly, CAS are so general and unintelligent that problems with well known and elegant closed-form solutions, when presented to a system like sympy, result in an output which is often not even human readable - thousands of algebraic terms for instance to describe the equations of motion for a simple double pendulum. Personally I have found that the best tools are 1) a firm grasp of elementary calculus (differential, series, and integral) and 2) exposure to simple numerical methods that apply to a broad range of problems. Armed with this knowledge, in my opinion, Julia is a far superior language to python and its package ecosystem has a brighter future. Indeed, the language has been built with a focus on mathematical modeling and efficient numerical computation. It is a more natural starting point for those with an interest in mathematical modeling and engineering science, and will serve anyone who learns it better than python+numpy+sympy+scipy. reply ultrasounder 8 hours agorootparentprevGreat.

Why is Julia better suited than any other language? reply staplung 11 hours agoparentJulia has a bunch of little niceties for mathematics: * Prefixing a variable with a scaler will implicitly multiply, as in standard math notation (e.g. 3x would evaluate to 6 if x is 2) * Lots of unicode support. Some feel almost gratuitous (∈ and ∉ are operators that work as you would expect) but it's pretty nice to have π predefined (it's even an irrational datatype) and to use √ as an operator (e.g. √2 is a valid expression and evaluates to a float). It's not just that Julia supports these constructions but provides a convenient way to get them to appear. * This is a little less relevant for calculus but vectors and matrices are fist class types in Julia. Entering and visually parsing matrices is so much easier in Julia than in Python. m = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9] vs. m = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] Transposition is a single character operator ('). Dot product can be done with the dot operator (m ⋅ n). A\\b works as it does in matlab. * Julia supports broadcasting. It also has comprehensions but with broadcasting I personally find much less need for comprehensions. * Rationals are built-in with very simple syntax (1//2)) reply RivieraKid 11 hours agorootparentI quite like and use Julia but wish there was a language mixing the best aspects of Julia and Swift (which I think can be done without many compromises, i.e. it would be a better language overall). Some things I don't like about Julia: - array.mean().round(digits=2) is more readable than round(mean(array), digits=2) - Poor support for OOP (no, pure FP is not the optimal programming approach). reply staplung 10 hours agorootparentWell, Julia also has a pipeline operator built in so: array |> mean |> x->round(x; digits=2) will do what you want and is arguably more readable than dot notation.

Technology should whenever possible adopt already existing conventions, because technology is created to serve the user, and not vice versa. reply adastra22 7 hours agorootparent> is how mathematicians have thought for hundreds of years now. \"Because tradition\" is not a good argument. We can and should strive for better. The modern OOP-derived style of `array.mean().round(digits=2)` is just as exact in its specification, and arguably more semantically precise as well as it organizes the meaningful bits to be together. Also I think you don't account for how much mathematical notation has changed over the years. The `round(mean(array), digits=2)` structure is relatively recent, early 20th century I believe, and the result of active reforms. reply abdullahkhalids 5 hours agorootparent> mathematical notation has changed over the years. I agree. Math notation has changed in response to problems mathematicians have faced, and as their thinking have evolved. It should not change because tool builders for mathematicians - when the tool builders in most cases are not even professional mathematicians - decide some other notation is better. > array.mean().round(digits=2) might be good (it is not) when you are operating on one object. As soon as you have a binary operation (say multiplication), this notation completely breaks down. Because the operation is often symmetric, or \"near\" symmetric, meaning it is not so different as to write something as ridiculous as x.product(y). But more importantly, (common/dominant) mathematics is functional in nature. It's decidedly not object oriented. Given a matrix, M, doing something like M.eigenvalues() is vomit-inducing because eigenvalues is not a property of a matrix M. For matrices, its a map from a set of linear transformations (of which M is merely one item) onto a set of numbers. It is its own thing, separate from M. reply bee_rider 4 hours agorootparentIn programming it is typical to have an “eig” function, or something of the sort, which returns the eigenvalues of a matrix. eig(M) seems no less vomit inducing than M.eigenvaues(). Usually when mathematicians want eigenvalues they write something like “Given a matrix M with eigenvalues \\lambda” and the eigenvalues just show up. reply adastra22 5 hours agorootparentprevNow you're gatekeeping on who is a real mathematician? I don't think this subthread is going to be productive and I'm bowing out. reply nightlyherb 4 hours agorootparentI'm not the GP, but I'm sorry you felt gatekeeped. I don't think GP conveyed \"real mathematicians should do FP\", but rather something else, so I'll try my best to share what I understood from that comment. Hope this makes you feel better. Even though the notation changed over the years, the paradigm of \"numbers as immutable entities and pure functions\" has been the dominant way that math is presented, compared to something like \"encapsulated objects that interact with each other via sending messages\". I don't think this has to be this way, and I do think that \"real math\" can also be laid out assuming principles of OOP. However, I do suspect it's the way it is because the laws of nature are unchanging, in contrast to the logic of a business application. Because Julia is a tool with the target audience of mathematicians and scientists, I think it's a sensible decision to embrace the usual way of thinking, as opposed to presenting a relatively different way of thinking which steepens the learning curve. Not because data and functions are fundamentally better than OOP, but because it's more pragmatic for the target audience. reply adastra22 2 hours agorootparentI understood the other poster correctly. This view of mathematics is as limiting and ignorant as the other poster’s. The entire field of theoretical computer science, to which functional programming and type theory is closely tied, is a branch of mathematics. The Church-Turing thesis which gives both to our field equates the two at a very fundamental level. Questions about type theory, programming language design, and programmer ergonomics are fundamentally about math and applied math. Maybe you and the other poster have in mind specific fields of math, but then you need to make claims for why those fields are sufficiently different as to be exempt from applicability of any of the advances in notation observed in other fields. Your implicit assumption that you can divide computer science into a different bucket from “real math” is incorrect, and gatekeeping. As I said though, I don’t think this is a profitable debate to have here on HN. reply nightlyherb 48 minutes agorootparentI'd like to add another point worth mentioning. When I read the other poster's post, I was thinking about the semantics of OOP, specifically encapsulated objects and messages. I may have misinterpreted the other poster, but I hope it at least makes my other messages a bit clearer. (I think it's a little unwieldy to use Matrices that encapsulate its state for Linear Algebra, for example.) reply nightlyherb 2 hours agorootparentprevOkay, I see what you mean. > Maybe you and the other poster have in mind specific fields of math, Yes, because this is about Julia, I assumed we are talking about the specific fields of math that happen to be commonly used in mathematical and scientific computing, such as the ones learned in university math and science courses. > Your implicit assumption that you can divide computer science into a different bucket from “real math” is incorrect, and gatekeeping. It is regretful that we had a miscommunication. I agree with you that computer science belongs into the same bucket as \"real math\". The thing is, in the context of Julia it is not easy to read \"math\" as \"math, but not only the domains that Julia is concerned in, but really all fields of math, including theoretical computer science\". At least thanks to your comment, I see what you mean more clearly, and I think it'll help some other potential readers as well. > but then you need to make claims for why those fields are sufficiently different as to be exempt from applicability of any of the advances in notation observed in other fields. I'm curious to know specifically about the specific advances of notation observed in other fields. By this you mean dot notation for method application? I'm unsure if `a.method(b).anotherMethod(c)` is more advanced than `a |> method(b) |> anotherMethod(c)` (Edit: or `(anotherMethod(c) . method(b))(a)`) notation-wise. reply FabHK 6 hours agorootparentprevI used to miss \"OOP\" in Julia. The funny thing about the dot notation is that it makes the limitations of single dispatch seem natural. Once you get used to multiple dispatch and its benefits, the dot notation seems limiting. `x.plus(y)` dispatches based on (runtime) type of x (polymorphism) (single dispatch), and might call different functions based on the (compile time) type of y (function overloading). In Julia, it would be `plus(x, y)`, and it can dispatch based on the runtime type of both x and y (or determine the correct method to call at compile time already, if the types of x and y can be determined then). reply adastra22 2 hours agorootparentVirtual method dispatch isn’t always a good thing though. It’s a tradeoff and typically you really want one or the other. C++ makes both available for that reason, although C++’s syntax is horrible. reply jakobnissen 1 hour agorootparentIt's multiple dispatch though, not virtual dispatch. If I understand correctly, virtual dispatch means the method is picked at runtime. In Julia, the compiler is able to pick the correct method at compile time, even when dispatching on all arguments of the function. reply nightlyherb 4 hours agorootparentprevAs a person who respects many programming paradigms including OOP and FP, I beg to disagree. Specifically, I'm assuming you're talking about OOP the paradigm, not only the dot notation, for which the pipe operator is a viable alternative. > The modern OOP-derived style of `array.mean().round(digits=2)` is just as exact in its specification, and arguably more semantically precise as well as it organizes the meaningful bits to be together. I would have agreed with you if I were developing business applications. However, for the domain of math and science, every piece of material that I have seen assumes the paradigm of numbers as immutable entities and functions, not the paradigm of mutable encapsulated objects and interacting messages. To a mathematician or scientist the semantics of a `Vector` (as data) and a `mean` function that takes the `Vector` as input should be more natural than a black-box `Vector` object that can receive a `mean` method. reply abisen 11 hours agorootparentprevIf I am not using named arguments I find myself using the pipe operator a lot.

But Julia doesn't have automatic currying, so that only happens if someone has implemented a special-case version (e.g. (==)(3) returns a partial function that tests for equality with 3.) reply patagurbon 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can overload your own types to get a lot of those things (poor support for OOP is harder but you can sort of emulate it with traits).

Computer algebra systems can be magical. The popular WolframAlpha website calls the full power of Mathematica while allowing an informal syntax that is flexible enough to be used as a backend for Apple’s Siri feature. (“Siri what is the graph of x squared minus 4?”) For learning purposes, computer algebra systems model very well the algebraic/symbolic treatment of the material while providing means to illustrate the numeric aspects. These notes are a bit different in that Julia is primarily used for the numeric style of computing and the algebraic/symbolic treatment is added on. Doing the symbolic treatment by hand can be very beneficial while learning, and computer algebra systems make those exercises seem kind of redundant, as the finished product can be produced much easier. TL;DR: they want the student to actually do some of the work that Mathematic magics away. reply constantcrying 12 hours agoparentprev>Why is Julia better suited than any other language? Because it is a language specifically targeted for doing numerical analysis.

And overloaded operators like block matrix notation or linear solves are much closer. The type system in Julia is perhaps even better than MATLAB for some linear algebra operations (a Vector is always a Vector, a scalar is always a scalar).

This is probably due to legacy of C language which conflates those two, possibly for performance and simplicity reasons. Same goes for case sensitivity in programming languages, again a legacy of C...are Print, print and PRINT really different functions, is that really what you intended??? Anyway, indexing is enumerating elements and it naturally starts at 1 for the first element and goes to Count for the last. Offsets are pointer arithmetic artifact where first element is at offset of 0 for most but not all data structures. Then you get \"modern\" languages like Python where they adopt indexing from 0 (no offsets since there are no pointers) and range where start is inclusive and end is exclusive...very natural behavior there.

If the two could integrate somehow... the key thing about MOOCulus is the writing quality is better (much less verbose), and the integrated exercises means kids follow it closely.

As someone who's written both professionally, I would say Julia is usually the better choice today. But there is a huge array of existing algorithms that are already implemented in languages like matlab or stata that may not have corresponding equivalents. If what you want is one of these, it's often hard to justify using another language (though in practice I've usually found it pretty easy to port matlab/python/stat to Julia.) reply FabHK 6 hours agoparentprevYes. It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell (with apologies to Steve Jobs, who said that about iTunes on Windows, back when iTunes was not the mess it turned into later). Mind you, I have huge respect for Cleve Moler and Matlab and all they have accomplished (making LINPACK and EISPACK and all that easily accessible). And they've worked hard to overcome the limitations of initially having only one datatype: a matrix. But Julia as a modern general purpose language is just so much more pleasant to work with, while retaining nearly all of Matlab's power. reply goerz 12 hours agoparentprevVery much so.

Engineers tend to be more of a practical sort than developers, and just want to apply a known solution to a problem than mess around with newish software languages. reply agucova 10 hours agorootparentThis is true, but even engineers see the advantages of Julia. My engineering school has went from almost pure Matlab usage to many key engineering courses switching to Julia due to its simplicity and friendliness. It's also SOTA for many engineering applications, particularly for acausal modelling and scientific machine learning (see https://sciml.ai), which has led to big companies like Pfizer adopting it [1]. And for engineers writing novel libraries, it clearly has a strong edge. See for example the work by NASA's JPL [2, 3], the FAA [4] or the CliMa project [5].

    "title": "Big Tech Resists EU's Digital Markets Act, Faces Fines",
    "originLink": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/big-tech-eu-drop-dead",
    "originBody": "The European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a complex, many-legged beast, but at root, it is a regulation that aims to make it easier for the public to control the technology they use and rely on. One DMA rule forces the powerful “gatekeeper” tech companies to allow third-party app stores. That means that you, the owner of a device, can decide who you trust to provide you with software for it. Another rule requires those tech gatekeepers to offer interoperable gateways that other platforms can plug into - so you can quit using a chat client, switch to a rival, and still connect with the people you left behind (similar measures may come to social media in the future). There’s a rule banning “self-preferencing.” That’s when platforms push their often inferior, in-house products and hide superior products made by their rivals. And perhaps best of all, there’s a privacy rule, reinforcing the eight-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, a strong, privacy law that has been flouted for too long, especially by the largest tech giants. In other words, the DMA is meant to push us toward a world where you decide which software runs on your devices, where it’s easy to find the best products and services, where you can leave a platform for a better one without forfeiting your social relationships , and where you can do all of this without getting spied on. If it works, this will get dangerously close to better future we’ve spent the past thirty years fighting for. There’s just one wrinkle: the Big Tech companies don’t want that future, and they’re trying their damndest to strangle it in its cradle. Right from the start, it was obvious that the tech giants were going to war against the DMA, and the freedom it promised to their users. Take Apple, whose tight control over which software its customers can install was a major concern of the DMA from its inception. Apple didn’t invent the idea of a “curated computer” that could only run software that was blessed by its manufacturer, but they certainly perfected it. iOS devices will refuse to run software unless it comes from Apple’s App Store, and that control over Apple’s customers means that Apple can exert tremendous control over app vendors, too. Apple charges app vendors a whopping 30 percent commission on most transactions, both the initial price of the app and everything you buy from it thereafter. This is a remarkably high transaction fee —compare it to the credit-card sector, itself the subject of sharp criticism for its high 3-5 percent fees. To maintain those high commissions, Apple also restricts its vendors from informing their customers about the existence of other ways of paying (say, via their website) and at various times has also banned its vendors from offering discounts to customers who complete their purchases without using the app. Apple is adamant that it needs this control to keep its customers safe, but in theory and in practice, Apple has shown that it can protect you without maintaining this degree of control, and that it uses this control to take away your security when it serves the company’s profits to do so. Apple is worth between two and three trillion dollars. Investors prize Apple’s stock in large part due to the tens of billions of dollars it extracts from other businesses that want to reach its customers. The DMA is aimed squarely at these practices. It requires the largest app store companies to grant their customers the freedom to choose other app stores. Companies like Apple were given over a year to prepare for the DMA, and were told to produce compliance plans by March of this year. But Apple’s compliance plan falls very short of the mark: between a blizzard of confusing junk fees (like the €0.50 per use “Core Technology Fee” that the most popular apps will have to pay Apple even if their apps are sold through a rival store) and onerous conditions (app makers who try to sell through a rival app store are have their offerings removed from Apple’s store, and are permanently banned from it), the plan in no way satisfies the EU’s goal of fostering competition in app stores. That’s just scratching the surface of Apple’s absurd proposal: Apple’s customers will have to successfully navigate a maze of deeply buried settings just to try another app store (and there’s some pretty cool-sounding app stores in the wings!), and Apple will disable all your third-party apps if you take your phone out of the EU for 30 days. Apple appears to be playing a high-stakes game of chicken with EU regulators, effectively saying, “Yes, you have 500 million citizens, but we have three trillion dollars, so why should we listen to you?” Apple inaugurated this performance of noncompliance by banning Epic, the company most closely associated with the EU’s decision to require third party app stores, from operating an app store and terminating its developer account (Epic’s account was later reinstated after the EU registered its disapproval). It’s not just Apple, of course. The DMA includes new enforcement tools to finally apply the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) to US tech giants. The GDPR is Europe’s landmark privacy law, but in the eight years since its passage, Europeans have struggled to use it to reform the terrible privacy practices of the largest tech companies. Meta is one of the worst on privacy, and no wonder: its entire business is grounded in the nonconsensual extraction and mining of billions of dollars’ worth of private information from billions of people all over the world. The GDPR should be requiring Meta to actually secure our willing, informed (and revocable) consent to carry on all this surveillance, and there’s good evidence that more than 95 percent of us would block Facebook spying if we could. Meta’s answer to this is a “Pay or Okay” system, in which users who do not consent to Meta’s surveillance will have to pay to use the service, or be blocked from it. Unfortunately for Meta, this is prohibited (privacy is not a luxury good that only the wealthiest should be afforded). Just like Apple, Meta is behaving as though the DMA permits it to carry on its worst behavior, with minor cosmetic tweaks around the margins. Just like Apple, Meta is daring the EU to enforce its democratically enacted laws, implicitly promising to pit its billions against Europe’s institutions to preserve its right to spy on us. These are high-stakes clashes. As the tech sector grew more concentrated, it also grew less accountable, able to substitute lock-in and regulatory capture for making good products and having their users’ backs. Tech has found new ways to compromise our privacy rights, our labor rights, and our consumer rights - at scale. After decades of regulatory indifference to tech monopolization, competition authorities all over the world are taking on Big Tech. The DMA is by far the most muscular and ambitious salvo we’ve seen. Seen in that light, it’s no surprise that Big Tech is refusing to comply with the rules. If the EU successfully forces tech to play fair, it will serve as a starting gun for a global race to the top, in which tech’s ill-gotten gains - of data, power and money - will be returned to the users and workers from whom that treasure came. The architects of the DMA and DSA foresaw this, of course. They’ve announced investigations into Apple, Google and Meta, threatening fines of 10 percent of the companies’ global income, which will double to 20 percent if the companies don’t toe the line. It’s not just Big Tech that’s playing for all the marbles - it’s also the systems of democratic control and accountability. If Apple can sabotage the DMA’s insistence on taking away its veto over its customers’ software choices, that will spill over into the US Department of Justice’s case over the same issue, as well as the cases in Japan and South Korea, and the pending enforcement action in the UK.",

They are also not \"used all the time\", instead used sparingly because of how outrageously expensive they are. Taxis are run by cartels here who have carved up Denmark amongst themselves. Drivers wait in queues, idling, and are paid to idle, sometimes dozens of cabs at a time. As a result, taxis in Denmark are some of the most expensive in the world. Uber was banned here in Denmark because the taxi companies saw a threat to their easy money. Drivers wanted to drive independently and for a brief period where Uber was allowed to operate, competition flourished and prices came way down. I'm not saying Uber is a good thing but pretending or even suggesting that the taxi companies are somehow an ethical or good alternative is absurd. reply omnimus 1 hour agorootparentprevTaxis have apps now too you know.

At this point the GDPR is something you have to consider whether you’re in the EU or not because several non EU countries have similar laws and many more are thinking of implementing them, and to the extent many haven’t already it’s because it’s unnecessary since tech companies are following GDPR already. Essentially GDPR has become a de facto global law at this point. It wouldn’t be surprising if the same would also be true of other legislation coming out of the EU considering that most tech products are global. reply davidgerard 2 hours agoparentprevyep.

The EU single market is an important project, but there is a constant failure to understand the actual reason why the EU exists or also a purposeful misinterpretation. Countries joining the EU are requested not to join because of the single market, but because they want to join the political project of a more peaceful and an improving Europe. At its core the EU is a project to bring Europe together, to cooperate instead of being in wars (... WW1, WW2, Cold War, ...). The EU is even more a political project as it is an economic project. But there are many other projects. The market is not the EU, it's a large and important project, the EU can't be thought without it. But there is more. The main motive behind all that is the will to work together. Even the \"single market\" is at its core a political project. We have seen it with Brexit. The UK never bought into the \"political project\". UK politicians also mislead the public about that. The EU is as much about social standards, political standards, environment, competition, building up the countries, joint research, joint infrastructure, a common law, common currency, being competitive in a larger world, ... and so on. During Brexit it was promised by some UK politicians for a short time that the UK would leave the EU, but not the single market. Misleading the public that this was a topic of economics, while the EU really is a political integration project, not just a project to build a single market. France and Germany at war for many centuries, now have a common integration project (in a larger EU), free movement, no physical border, an EU passport, a single currency, joint projects, ... these are the things which moved us forward. reply mike_hearn 32 minutes agorootparent> UK politicians also mislead the public about that. It's worth noting that they didn't just do that in 2016. They were doing it for the entire history of Britain's membership of the EU. During the referendum campaign I talked to quite a few older people (my mother included) who remembered the original Brexit referendum in the 1970s, one that most people outside the UK aren't aware ever existed. It happened just a couple of years after entering the EU, which was done unilaterally by the Labour government of the time and never subjected to a referendum. Many people of that generation say they voted Remain the first time because they were explicitly promised that the EU (or EEC as it was then known) was merely a free trade zone with no ambitions to be more. In that era, without the internet, it was much harder to fact check these sorts of claims and although there were campaigners telling the truth, the public mostly believed the government. Later it turned out that not only was it untrue but it had never been true, that Labour knew it wasn't true and that the plan right from day one had always been to abolish European governments by merging them together into one superstate. This is often claimed to be a federalist project, but there is no specific philosophy in the EU project as to what rights should remain delegated to the individual states like in the USA. In fact the opening of the EU \"constitution\" equivalent says that the goal is ever closer union - without limits. This feeling of betrayal and deception was a big driver of why the older generation went so conclusively for Leave. Most common feedback I got on talking to these people: I haven't changed my opinion from the 70s, but now I know the truth. reply lispm 13 minutes agorootparent\"abolish European governments by merging them together into one superstate\" That wasn't the goal of the EU.

This isn't how \"responsibility to its shareholders\" works.

US Courts have repeatedly given a large amount of freedom to management to do whatever they want in terms of \"delivering shareholder value\". They allow management so consider long term goals against next quarter (as they should). Additionally there's an excellent precedent for this: Google withdrawing from the Chinese market.

You can't vote for who decides things in the EU. You can vote for MEPs but they don't decide things. The DMA represents the desires and priorities of the European Commission, a body carefully placed well beyond any form of democracy and whose membership isn't even close to representative of the actual continent. If the EU Commission were influenced by voters, their priorities would follow what people say they care about in the EU's own opinion polls: https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/3218 \"Europeans tend to think that the most important issues facing their region at the moment are the cost of living (31%), the economic situation and unemployment (26%), and health (26%).\" No surprises there. People are feeling poor. They want more jobs and more money. A normal democratic government response would be trying to woo companies to Europe to create jobs, train locals and create economic success. It would also be lowering taxes and encouraging the creation of local startups in any way possible. That's a standard recipe that's been used many times throughout the world in response to economic discontent. But the EU isn't a normal democratic government so it spends its time on fiddling with iOS, something that doesn't even show up on polls at all because nobody cares. It's for this kind of reason that French voters are likely to send the RN to the European Parliament in large numbers in the next election, mirroring the same pattern seen all over Europe: https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/ The RN is an explicitly Eurosceptic party whose only specific policy on the EU is to oppose it. Sending it to Brussels will change nothing because the European Parliament doesn't matter, but it does send a strong message of discontentment and a desire to use whatever meagre powers the Parliament has to slow the Commission down. reply wolfendin 1 hour agorootparentprevGood for you, I can’t and now I have to deal with endless pop ups about cookies. reply kristiandupont 58 minutes agorootparentAs a European citizen, I am affected by plenty of American politics even though I can't vote. reply olivierduval 1 hour agorootparentprevThat was not mandated by the GDPR but implemented by companies trying to punish users in the hope of a backlash and cancellation of the law All the GDPR is asking is: \"if you want to use some PII, you have (1) to ask consent (2) to accept user decision\" Others implementations may have included: respecting \"Do Not Track\" signal implemented in browser or just... not using PII at first to sell personal datas to advertiser to make more money than selling untargeted ads (so no popup needed)! reply gschizas 1 hour agorootparentprevThe cookie popups are just the dark pattern that companies decided to use to avoid using those sweet, sweet money from selling your private data.

You don't have to play coy, though: it is also middle school level knowledge that the parliament cannot formally initiate the legislative process. It's also written in the Wikipedia article I linked. > The European Parliament has legislative power in that the adoption of EU legislation normally requires its approval, and that of the Council, in what amounts to a bicameral legislature. However, it does not formally possess the right of initiative (i.e. the right to formally initiate the legislative procedure) in the way that most national parliaments of the member states do, as the right of initiative is a prerogative of the European Commission.[7][8] Nonetheless, the Parliament and the Council each have the right to request the Commission to initiate the legislative procedure and put forward a proposal.[9] What is your conclusion from this?

They all have different problems that require different solutions. Apple - consumers give the company for hardware which is locked into a closed ecosystem. Apple extracts extra revenue by enforcing this closed ecosystem. There can be no competition other than not purchasing their hardware in the first place. Google - consumers sometimes give them money (for both hardware and services) which Google then uses to push their other products to the detriment of their competitors. Due to Google's size, the competition is at a massive disadvantage. Also, given that most consumers don't give them money, Google needs to make money off of their consumers and the most profitable method is to monetize PII. Meta - consumers basically never give them money (excluding Oculus) so Meta needs to make money off of their consumers. The most profitable method is to monetize PII. I have a little more sympathy for Google and Meta's situation as the EU wants them to maintain their free services while simultaneously reducing their ability to monetize their most valuable asset, consumers' PII (note that PII ultimately belongs to the consumer but it's still the thing that the companies use to make money). There needs to be some sort of happy medium here when people want something without paying for it but also don't want what's valuable about them being a user - their PII - to be monetized. To be clear, these multi billion/trillion dollar companies don't need anyone defending them. However, it would be interesting to see what the EU's position would be if Meta started as an EU company. reply Scarblac 2 hours agoparentGoogle and Meta could behave like normal companies and require users to pay them money and not sell PII. If that makes them far less successful that's good news for competitors. reply Cu3PO42 2 hours agorootparentYou actually can pay Meta €9.99/month for ad-free Facebook+Instagram in the EU. I would hope this also causes them to track and use much less PII, but I couldn't find anything substantiating that. reply Kbelicius 1 hour agorootparentAs far as I understand the problem with that scheme is that by not paying you not only agree to see the ads but also to the tracking. reply Cu3PO42 16 minutes agorootparentThat is certainly the case, but seems to be perfectly legal.

However, it would be interesting to see what the EU's position would be if Meta started as an EU company. I absolutely agree on this point. I do have the… bias, that in my formative years Apple was very much the plucky underdog in danger of bankruptcy. This may be why I am less concerned about what Apple does. I am aware that, net, most people here very much disagree with my position that if you don't like Apple's software policies, you can simply not buy their hardware. (Indeed, they are priced such that many people who would actually like to have those things, cannot afford them). Google and Facebook, however, are much harder to avoid — yes, you can in theory replace Gmail with Yahoo, Google.com with DuckDuckGo.com, Google Maps with OpenStreetMap, but people who try this report that it's harder than it seems to totally cut that particular cord. Facebook Messenger is my only way to remain in contact with some people. I've stopped logging into the main site because their feed is, approximately: [real post from an actual connection but 75% chance I've already seen it on a previous visit, advert, list of people it thinks I might know but I don't, then a repeating pattern of {advert, 3 example posts from a group it thinks I might want to join but don't}]. But yeah, Apple aren't the plucky underdog any more. reply nroets 3 hours agoparentprevI, on the other hand, have a lot more sympathy for Apple: Many highly successful people and many businesses have never owned any of there products. They are not a monopoly. Why can't market forces just regulate them ?? reply kvdveer 2 hours agorootparentApple may not have a monopoly, but they have enormous market power. By themselves, monopoly or market power are neither illegal or even undesirable. However, they become undesirable when they are abused to undermine cometition in other markets. For example: Apple has successfully prevented competition to Apple Pay for a long time, by only allowing their own products access to NFC. This meant that parties that were already specialized in handling payments, had no chance to compete, despite them being in an excellent position to do so. If this behaviour is left unchecked, over time we will end up with one single company dominating most markets. I feel that's undesirable. Given the number of dystopian novels on that premise, most of society considers that future to be undesirable. Preventing that future is a major part of DMA. reply Sharlin 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause personal computer market (let’s face it: the primary or only personal computing device of most people today is a phone or a tablet) are a duopoly, with the other actor also being one of the monopolistic tech giants. reply nottorp 2 hours agorootparentJust to emphasise, the mobile device market IS a duopoly because you may have multiple sources for Android phone hardware, but for software you have exactly two options: iOS and Android. reply Sharlin 2 hours agorootparentYes, thanks.

In my view they miss the mark however. Blaming Apple for optimizing their platform model isn’t the problem, it became a problem. Imagine 2007 and the following years already with the EU act in full effect. AppStore would be dead on arrival. In my view Apple’s AppStore went from feature some people have when they buy a smartphone to necessity. 2007 and even 2016 was a perfect time to opt for a live without smartphones. Not so 2024. So EU should change Apple’s and Google’s status from producer to provider of essential service like electricity for example. Some often overlooked fact is, that Apple decides at will who is allowed to publish apps via AppStore and who is not. This is an area where regulation is needed in my opinion. In other areas of life you simply cannot take down businesses at will, while Apple can. reply miken123 3 hours agoparent> Imagine 2007 and the following years already with the EU act in full effect.

You need at least 45 million monthly active users and 7,5 billion of revenue for three years. > So EU should change Apple’s and Google’s status from producer to provider of essential service like electricity for example.

It was only when third party apps installed after jailbreaking got super popular, that Apple opened their own app store (and then made it a huge commercial success). So it actually shows that a third party app store would thrive, even if there is no first party app store. Especially if there were no barriers for using such a third party app store, such as requiring a jailbreak. reply grishka 43 minutes agoparentprevThe problem is not just the app store, it's the lack of sideloading, the fact that as a developer, you HAVE to go through the app store to have an iOS app at all. The fact that Apple forcibly inserts itself between you and your users and acts as if they had a role in you earning this relationship. While in real life, app stores themselves hardly earn apps any users. Most of the time, people install an app thanks to the app developer's own marketing efforts. If you want a real-world example of an app store on a platform where there are alternative methods of app distribution, just look at macOS. Same idea, same rules, but there is sideloading as an alternative. It turns out neither users nor developers are having any of it. reply Someone 3 hours agoparentprev> Imagine 2007 and the following years already with the EU act in full effect. AppStore would be dead on arrivaL. Why do you think so? I think it would be different, but not dead. Giving their users a simple means to discover selected apps would still be win-win for both Apple and their customers, even if users had other means to obtain the apps. Apple could also charge companies for having their apps in that store. reply IanCal 3 hours agoparentprev> Some often overlooked fact is, that Apple decides at will who is allowed to publish apps via AppStore and who is not.

The complaints regarding the AppStore comes from a few tech companies and a small percentage of highly technical users. For everyone else it's fine. The EU mandating alternative stores or side-load won't significantly hurt Apples bottom line. The most valid complaint, and this is something Apple needs to address world view, is the move towards in-app purchases and subscriptions. I believe that is due to a limitation in the AppStore, where Apple isn't allowing upgrade pricing, but allowing subscriptions to enable features. In-app purchases is destroying the AppStore. You could say: Well that would be fixed with an alternative store, but I have serious doubts about other app store operators not being tempted by the recurring revenue as well. reply nelsonic 3 hours agorootparentprevPlease elaborate. reply brg 3 hours agorootparentprevWe have the world without it available for inspection.

Somlo , 2019-07-04 ⎯ 2020-05-08 NEW: latest build process at https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-rocket; Or skip directly to the self-hosting demo. 1. Motivation My goal is to build a Free/OpenSource computer from the ground up, so I may completely trust that the entire hardware+software system's behavior is 100% attributable to its fully available HDL (Hardware Description Language) and Software sources. More importantly, I need all the compilers and associated toolchains involved in building the overall system (from HDL and Software sources) to be Free/OpenSource, and to be themselves buildable and runnable on the computer system being described. In other words, I need a self-hosting Free/OpenSource hardware+software stack! I don't own or otherwise control a silicon foundry, and therefore can't fabricate my own ASICs, so I will build the \"hardware\" component of this computer on an FPGA, ensuring that any programming of (and bitstream generation for) the FPGA happens with Free/OpenSource tools. I consider the tradeoff to be worthwhile and advantageous from a trustworthiness standpoint: The chip foundry wouldn't know what the FPGA will be used for, and where the proverbial \"privilege bit\" will end up being laid out on the chip, which mitigates against Privilege Escalation hardware backdoors. Exposure is limited to DoS attacks being planted into the silicon during FPGA fabrication, which yields a significantly improved level of assurance (i.e., the computer may stop working altogether, but can't betray its owner to an adversary while pretending to operate correctly). The FPGA is a regular grid of identical components, so (destructive) visual inspection (i.e., chemical ablation and TEM imaging) is more feasible than with a dedicated ASIC that has much less visual regularity and repeatability. Having thus constrained the fabrication-stage attack surface, I can cover the remaining hardware attack vectors (malicious sources and/or toolchain) by insisting on buildable sources to everything, resulting in a finished product (i.e., deployed hardware+software computer) that is as trustowrthy as its openly auditable HDL+Software sources.

I suppose in theory the FPGA could contain a hidden CPU that has full read/write access to the FPGA program. Further, if the system becomes popular and more FPGAs need to be produced for the same system or the next generation, then the foundry has additional information and they can make a good guess of where the privilege bit will be. Even simpler, they could program an FPGA with the code and figure it out manually. reply karma_pharmer 5 hours agoparentI suppose in theory the FPGA could contain a hidden CPU that has full read/write access to the FPGA program. All of them do at this point. It isn't hidden. You can't buy a large FPGA without an ARM core in it. The ARM cores all have an opaque signed blob running in EL3 that you can't replace. This isn't a soft core on the fabric; it's dedicated silicon.

Modern DRAM has lots of complicated features (e.g. link training, targeted refresh, on-die ECC). I don't know exactly how it's implemented, but that's plenty of complexity to provide cover for backdoors. It should be possible to add something that watches for specific memory access patterns and provides arbitrary read/write capabilities when the correct pattern is detected. This could be used for privilege escalation from untrusted but sandboxed code, e.g. JavaScript. It could work with any CPU architecture or OS, because the arbitrary memory reads could be used to detect the correct place to write. This would be less effective with DIMMs or other multi-chip memory modules, but RISC-V computers are usually small single-board computers that only have a single DRAM chip. reply ooterness 12 hours agoparentprevThis sort of thing is analogous to the \"Thompson hack\" [1], where a malicious compiler has a self-propagating backdoor. It never shows up in the source code, but self-injects into the binaries. Thompson demonstrated this under controlled conditions. But realistically, the backdoor begins to approach AGI-level cunning to evade attempts at detection. It has to keep functioning and propagating as the hardware and software evolve, while still keeping a profile (size, execution time, etc.) low enough to continue evading detection. Work like this that rebuilds modern computing on a completely different foundation, would seriously disrupt and complicate the use of this type of backdoor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)#Compiler_... reply Taniwha 36 minutes agorootparentFFS - when a smart person designs something clever it \"begins to approach AGI-level cunning\"?

CNE is generally considered to be far more valuable than CNA. First of all keep in mind that all genuinely sensitive systems are air gapped, so you can't effectively broadcast a signal to them. Second, CNA is a one-off; after the attack you will typically lose access. CNE access on the other hand can persist for years or even decades, and will be beneficial in both \"cold\" scenarios for political and economic maneuvers, and closer to a flashpoint. CNA, on the other hand, is usually only relevant when a conflict is turning hot. reply glitchc 12 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's the opposite.

Even if it did, it would be exceptionally difficult for that CPU to identify which registers/gates on the FPGA were being used to implement which components of the soft CPU. The layout isn't fixed; there's no consistent mapping of hardware LUTs/FFs to synthesized functionality. reply amelius 14 hours agorootparentEven if the mapping changes, the network (graph of logic gates) will locally be similar. So a subgraph matching algorithm might be all that is needed. reply rowanG077 11 hours agorootparentThat would you mean you connect your hidden CPU to essentially every wire inside the FPGA. Trivial to detect, and extremely expensive, and probably even impossible considering timing model. reply tredre3 11 hours agorootparentThere's no need for such complexity. FPGAs read their programming from an i2c eeprom/flash when they boot, the hidden CPU just has to sniff that bus to get the entire bitstream and know the mapping. reply rowanG077 10 hours agorootparentAnd then you know that mapping. That still means you will need to connect to arbitrary wires. If you have the mapping but you aren't connected to the wire you want to disrupt or sniff then tough luck you can't do anything. Theoretically what you could do is MITM the bitstream, upload it to a server. Resynthesize, place and route with your sniff wires connected and write that back flash. But now you have to hide a radio, and either force a restart or hope a restart will happen. reply admax88qqq 13 hours agoparentprevWithout having thought it through fully I feel like the classic \"trusting trust\" attack could work at the fpga/bitstream level. reply rowanG077 11 hours agoparentprevIt's certainly non-trivial to put a hidden CPU in a FPGA that has full read/write access.

A lot of these FOSS cores are either outright unoptimized or target ASICs and so end up performing very badly on FPGAs. A well designed core on a modern FPGA (not one of these bottom of the barrel low power Lattice parts) can definitely hit 250+ MHz with a much more powerful microarch. It's neither cheap nor easy which is why we tend not to see it in the hobby space. That, and better FPGAs tend not to have FOSS toolchains and so it doesn't quite meet the libre spirit. But, yes, even at 250MHz trying to run Chipyard on a softcore would certainly be an exercise in patience :) reply shrubble 14 hours agoparentprevPeople used 50Mhz SPARC systems to do real work, and the peripherals were all a lot slower (10mbps Ethernet, slower SCSI drives) with less and slower RAM.

The first computers I used ran around 1MHz. Compilation will take longer on a slower machine, but that really isn't a big deal. If the computer is reliable and the build scripts are correct, you can just let the process run over days or weeks. I've run many tasks in my life that took days or weeks. Cue \"compiling\": https://xkcd.com/303/ The real problem is debugging. Debugging the process on a slow system can be unpleasant due to long turn-arounds. Historically the solution is to work in stages & be able to restart at different points (so you don't have to do the whole process each time). That would work here too. In this case, there's an additional option: you can debug the scripts on a much faster though less trustworthy system.

    "originBody": "What good is AI if you don't have a planet to use it on? Microsoft released its 2024 Sustainability Report on Wednesday, and it's mostly bad news. Last year, Microsoft's emissions went up 29%, and it used 23% more water, primarily due to \"new technologies, including generative AI.\" The report covers numbers for 2023, the first full year of the AI race after ChatGPT's November 2022 debut. Microsoft invested a reported $10 billion in OpenAI in January 2023 and added GPT-4 to the Bing search engine in early 2023. It's now full steam ahead on selling the Copilot AI assistant add-on for Microsoft 365 products while building a new AI model that consumes tons of electricity during the training phase alone. More complex computations mean more data centers, which gobble up water for cooling and require vast amounts of electricity, creating \"new challenges\" for meeting the sustainability goals Microsoft put in place four years ago. \"We have seen major changes both in the technology sector and in our understanding of what it will take to meet our climate goals,\" says Microsoft. \"The world is not on track to meet critical climate goals, and we see many of the world’s challenges reflected in our own situation.\" The report breaks down emissions into three types: Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. The vast majority comes from Scope 3 (96%), which includes the supply chain, data centers, and \"the use of our products across millions of our customers.\" (Credit: Microsoft 2024 Sustainability Report) Water is the cheapest method for tech companies to cool their servers, CNBC reports. In 2023, Microsoft used 23% more water than in 2022, up from 6,399,415 cubic meters in 2022 to 7,843,744 last year. Other big tech companies—Amazon, Google, and Meta—all reported significant spikes in water use last year. Their 2024 sustainability reports are not out yet. \"Our new data centers are designed and optimized to support AI workloads and will consume zero water for cooling,\" says Microsoft. \"This initiative aims to further reduce our global reliance on freshwater resources as AI compute demands increase.\" (Credit: Microsoft 2024 Sustainability Report) Microsoft says it is working on capturing and re-using cooling water as much as possible. Replenishment projects aim to offset the impacts, especially in \"high water stress locations where we operate data centers,\" including the Colorado River Basin, which the LA Times calls a \"dire\" situation. RECOMMENDED BY OUR EDITORS Big Tech Had a Water Problem Long Before ChatGPT Microsoft Is Building a New Energy-Intensive AI Model Energy-Hungry AI Is Eating the Planet. But Is It Also Humanity's Best Hope? On the positive side, Microsoft says it used 23.6 million MWh of renewable energy in 2023, or enough to power Paris for two years, and designated 15,849 acres of land, or the equivalent of 9,000 soccer fields, as \"permanently protected.\" Efforts to reduce waste, make its campuses more efficient, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and much more are ongoing. Yet the data centers remain an issue with no easy answer. The race to secure them is in full swing, and it would take years to switch them to renewable energy, experts tell PCMag. In the meantime, it's unlikely Microsoft will cede AI ground to its rivals. It recently announced plans to spend $3.3 billion to take over a Foxconn site in Wisconsin a build a new data center. \"Last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called climate change 'the defining issue of our generation,'\" the report says. \"With each emerging technology, with each new opportunity, we ask ourselves an important question: how can we advance sustainability?\"",

It's also simply the case that if all Co2 production stopped tomorrow that countries like the United States would have all the stuff, as a consequence of a history of more overall pollution, so the resistance to stopping all coal production is naturally higher in poorer places. Basically the only card one can pull is to decide not to reduce Co2 oneself, which ultimately does nothing directly to solve the problem. reply asabjorn 4 hours agorootparentESG which is used to enforce climate justice is a a cartel environment that creates a total top-down, public-private sector controlled by a Stakeholder Soviet that determines the parameters of doing business.

To put that number into perspective, the US currently has 1160 GW of generation capacity in total [2]. We could almost double our countries generation capacity if we could just hook up the power to the grid. Unfortunately it takes 10 years to build new transmission lines in the US [3].

Those exist. reply al_borland 6 hours agorootparentThose systems should get built out because they make sense to build out. Having a company feeling justified in releasing tons of extra co2 in the process seems like it nullifies some of the good the plant would bring. reply kevindamm 5 hours agorootparentSuppose many of those projects would not be built out without channeling significant capital to it, and carbon credits being an effective means of securing that capital. Would that change the calculus for you? Note that I recognize many (possibly most?) carbon credits programs are bogus or worse, but trying to draw attention to circumstances where it's not always so cut and dry. reply al_borland 4 hours agorootparentI think for renewable energy to win it has to be financially viable on its own. If it requires carbon credits to get started, is it going to be viable without them? reply faeriechangling 4 hours agorootparentprevI think the most cut and dry situations is which they capture concentrated emissions from something like an O&G refinery or a cement plant, since it's an effort which ONLY exists for the sake of reducing emissions. Even some of these, hilariously enough, despite how insanely quantifiable their benefits are, you see phenomenon like phantom credits like where Alberta, Canada gave Shell double credit for each tonne of Co2 they actually reduced. I'm sure subsidies for green energy projects do reduce emissions, I just think the accounting is BS. reply __MatrixMan__ 5 hours agorootparentprevAgreed.

There was definitely a window, maybe fifty years ago, where widespread adoption of nuclear energy would have stopped and reversed climate change. We may have had an increase in Chernobyls with the proliferation of non-modern reactor designs, but in this hypothetical reality maybe people would have been OK with that. The problem today is that renewables are getting too cheap and too good, and the storage problem shrinks every day. Meanwhile, it takes upwards of a decade to license and build a single reactor. France's fancy new reactors won't be online until 2040. Nuclear is just too slow.

I find it truly disturbing how much people are treating LLMs like fact-machines. They are pattern matching machines that match using whatever information they have that matches best. It's closer to improv jazz than to factual authority; still super wonderful, and worthwhile listening to, but not really for the purpose of learning how the original sounded when it was first recorded. Sure, you might get a sense of the original, but that's all it is: an impression. When you ask for facts, you get an impressionist render of facts, which sometimes, maybe even often times, accurately depict the Truth. But sometimes they depict the Truth the way an artist depicts the truth: if it feels right, it's right. reply kolinko 1 hour agorootparentI think the 58MW claim is so blatantly wrong that it’s not LLM that produced that „fact”.

Governments typically assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising\" As there's a huge crowd who seems very convinced of the idea that the solution to handle our resource problems is to be found in various growth and tech oriented solutions. reply caseyy 7 hours agoparentAI isn't the most efficient way to retrieve accurate information or to generate quality content, it's the most efficient way to retrieve plausible information and generate poor quality art and code. And that's really interesting. There is a group of people that trust LLMs for all searches but most tech-literate people know they hallucinate, and understand roughly how an LLM works and that hallucinations are indistinguishable from the truth to the model. And so we still Google things and read books. The same applies to AI-generated art, music, voiceovers, and code. They are technically impressive, but rarely meet client expectations in any industry. And so most artists and programmers still produce the work themselves. AI is fantastic for low-quality content, and this explosion of AI is emblematic of how people often lack a filter for quality of information they put in their brains. This isn't new; YouTube has always had more low-quality content than high-quality pieces, probably 1000:1 if not a higher contrast. However, AI shows the scale like no tech has shown it to us before (and maybe this was known by some people at Google or Bing but not so publicly). Almost everyone consumes AI work — blogs, movie posters, art, music, and code. The market is massive but all AI does is reproduce the existing work it was loss-minimized on and the loss of quality is mathematically necessary unless the model is not a neural net, but a database of literally the entire dataset itself that is being searched. So this is very interesting. When did we become so okay with feeding ourselves a fast food diet of content? Isn't that causing more harm than good? The scale of this phenomenon is truly (and literally) industrial. I myself can hardly imagine what the modern life would look like if people turned to the internet, let's say, only to look up facts and information they already seek. We are so far from that. And AI both illustrates it, and exacerbates it. reply tibbar 6 hours agorootparentI see people frame generative AI this way a lot, as if they're strictly worse than alternatives in all dimensions (inaccurate, low quality). But I think there's several important dimension where they're strictly better, including flexibility, interactivity, and accessibility. I can ask an LLM a very specific question about my specific development environment, codebase, and tools and get a specific answer back that works. If it doesn't work, I can chat with the LLM about what happened to make changes. I don't even reach for LLMs that often compared to most engineers these days (maybe a couple times a month), but when I do, it's basically always the fastest and best way to deal with my particular situation. reply caseyy 5 hours agorootparentI think a lot of people drastically underestimate how much the LLMs mislead the user with plausible-sounding answers. I would say that whatever % of queries you found them not to give you correct answers, the actual percentage is materially higher. In my work niche, which at least 10,000 other software engineers do each day, ChatGPT 4 and 4o almost never give correct answers. Usually, they are misleading. I do find myself trying the LLMs when I'm faced with a challenging problem, but in that scenario they have not been helpful once. Granted, there are areas of work that are much more popular and LLMs will be more helpful there. But these are individual scenarios, and we can find many where LLMs are fantastic and many where LLMs are awful if we wanted to cherry-pick. Overall, the quality of the content is lower than what a human professional would do in their area of work, including flexibility, interactivity, and accessibility. This extends to books written by professionals and lectures given by them, as well as work carried out by them. It applies to home carpentry as much as it does to neurosurgery. The more specific the knowledge has to be, the more this is true. The more generic, the less. But all-in-all, I think it's still very evident humans produce higher quality knowledge and content. And any quantized model of that content and knowledge will be unable to reproduce it at the same fidelity or quality. With that said, I hope I expressed this enough — I do see your point in some circumstances. Just not overall. reply tibbar 59 minutes agorootparentIt feels like you mostly view generative AI as a system that produces finished products, which you don’t like. And for some reason that is how they are marketed, but it’s a terrible use for them. To me the point of generative AI is as a tool for an expert user to use en route to achieving some larger goal. I can personally attest that it works really well for me in this regard, as can many others. I think if I tried to use LLMs as surrogate experts I would be very frustrated, since they are totally unready for that purpose. reply bruce511 6 hours agorootparentprevI concur. I'm notca huge user of AI, but it does make a good search tool when my search term is verbose. For example I was looking for the name of a windows API command. I \"knew\" the command must exist, but didn't gave a clue what it was called. Asked Cgpt for an example program, and there's the name of the API. (Which I can then Google for docs.) I also had a complicated-to-ask question about sun movement which it explained to me, along with site links to actual data. I'm not using it as a Google replacement, but more of a Google supplement when the question is long-winded to write. reply ip26 7 hours agoparentprevThe positive side is supercomputers help us analyze the climate, the Atlantic current, and so forth. The negative side is they also help locate oil. Is it a win or loss on net? Hard to know. Thinking of entertainment, it probably IS a climate win if you spend an hour at home watching Netflix or chatting with GPT, as opposed to driving around town or jetting across the world. Supposedly a GPT-4 query costs 0.01kWh - meanwhile, a Tesla consumes 0.35kWh a minute at freeway speed. reply Syonyk 7 hours agorootparentI would be very interested in the breakdown of how they conclude it's 0.01kWh (10Wh) per request, and what that does and doesn't include. I expect that if you were to calculate \"incremental energy per request\" - how much \"extra CPU compute\" each request adds, you could probably get to that sort of value. But odds are good that figure ignored all the training data collection, all the processing on that, storage of that digested information, retrieval of it, etc, and that sort of number tends to also skip things like \"storage systems running to have the information available.\" If I've got an entire datacenter running to provide services, and the request consumes, say, 3 GPU-minutes of time across all the nodes, sure. This is a sane value. It just ignores a lot of the other resources dedicated to the task at various points. Microsoft isn't using 30% more energy than their current footprint on 10Wh/request AI answers. Math like this is very much a \"Tell me what answer you'd like, and I'll make it work out!\" sort of scenario. An increase in data center use by 30% is harder to fudge. reply bruce511 6 hours agorootparentTo put your follow upquestion differently, 'Is 10w/h per request the marginal cost of a request? Or does it factor in the fixed energy cost of the whole facility? Does it include training costs' I'm inclined to lean towards it including at least some fixed costs. It seems rather high to be marginal cost. I have no gut feel for training costs though. So, assuming it does include at least some fixed cost, using it more will reduce 'cost per use' while at the same time driving up actual consumption. reply defrost 7 hours agorootparentprev> it probably IS a climate win if you spend an hour at home watching Netflix or chatting with GPT, as opposed to driving around town or jetting across the world. Nope. Look back to the GP's paradox and the energy consumed watching even just the single most popular youtube video . . .

Again: 2024 was the mos polluting year in history. A lot of feel-good articles and tweets will often talk about the plummeting costs of solar, or how the share of renewables is higher than ever, or stuff like that, which is, from a global warming point of view, absolutely irrelevant. The only thing that matters as far as warming is concerned is how much CO2 is there in the air. The cumulative number. It doesn't matter if the growth is slowing, it doesn't matter if there's more solar than ever, etc etc. So yeah, we're producing more clean energy than ever, but we're also using more carbon than ever.

You don't really care about how much money it spent to get here. But for purposes of global warming, you care about the total amount of carbon in the air. The cumulative sum. The integral. If a company becomes profitable today, it survives. If emissions were to magically stop today...warming continues! reply faeriechangling 6 hours agorootparentprevI saw the point of things of the carbon tax as flattening a plateau more than stopping co2 emission growth.

Whataboutism is when two entities are doing shitty stuff with roughly commensurate negative impact. Versus dinging an endeavor that might have net positive impact (AI might REDUCE environmental impact) against forces that 100x larger and have no positive direction, it's actually just: pointing out when journalism uses a relative value to make a tempest in a teapot and distract from the big picture.

FWIW, while AI might reduce carbon impact, as you have stated, so far it has not. Data centers use a lot of electricity, they are significant, and have a lot of projected growth ahead.

I also hate mixing it. There are many products available to mix peanut butter for you, but I wanted my own design that took no effort to use. I'm looking for a \"set it and forget it\" solution. For those who don't know what I'm talking about, many natural peanut butters are not homogeneous at all times. The oil and the nutty material separate, and thus require mixing to return it to buttery consistency. Here's how I made my own. My very own peanut butter spinner device. First off, why do this? Mixing peanut butter is obnoxious. Further, I am loyal to Adam's Peanut Butter. Adam's is good flavor and simple ingredients. I wish they sold absolutely enormous jars or buckets of it. Alas, the biggest I can find are the plastic container versions from Costco, shown below in the video below. SPONSOR ME ADAMS I NEED MORE PEANUT BUTTER! I wanted a solution that doesn't require anything other than placing the jar on something and hitting a go button. In this case, it ended up being a switch. The rotary switch has a fully off mode, and otherwise is an adjustable potentiometer. I source 5V power from a USB adapter mean to snap into cigarette lighter holes in vehicles. USB power => motor control board => motor. The motor is itty bitty, and has a nice little gearbox for some extra torque. Here's a zoom in: The internals of the mixer on an older model. Here's the BOM: Case, 3D printed CAD, all found here, public on OnShape Please ignore anything with the unused tag. I may upload it to printables one day.

Single Port USB 3.0 Male to Female AUX Car Mount Flush Cable There's probably a better design than using this, but it was really convenient just being able to press fit this USB power source directly into the plastic case.

If I ever figure out what size it is, I'll follow up. How lucky that the first ring I grabbed happened to be a perfect fit, and that I even had one at all. Sorry! Not very helpful for you. I don't know, try searching for \"GPS mount o-ring\" :). This won't work man. Have you SEEN the inside of a concrete mixer? - Jerk, low faith friend Well I got news for you friend, it works well enough! Although I cannot say that it works perfectly, after ~20 minutes of care free rotation, minimally, there is not a layer of oil when the jar is upright and stationary. The oil is perhaps not perfectly distributed into the center of the jar. However, enough mixing has ocurred around the outer radius such that a quick manual mix on first open is much more easily doable with a knife. Perfect? Nah. Good enough? Absolutely! © 2024 cdaringe.

A large jar usually lasts less than a month. Then one day I noticed it says refrigerate after opening on the label. I wonder if that is the reason why, or if it's really prone to spoilage. reply nkrisc 13 hours agorootparentI would guess it’s because it will just last longer in the fridge, so they’re recommending it be refrigerated. I have lots of stuff that say the same that do fine in a cool, dark pantry. Though I’m sure if I left it long enough it would spoil sooner than in the fridge. reply briHass 13 hours agorootparentprevIt will spoil/go rancid. Even the 'non-natural' big brands like Jif/Skippy taste and smell 'off' if they sit out for a few weeks after being opened. There's no winning here, because putting it in the fridge makes it hard to spread. The best approach is to take out a week's worth or so and put it in a small/airtight container. Leave that out but put the main jar in the fridge. reply progbits 13 hours agorootparentI've been buying 100% peanut butter for years, never stored it in a fridge and never had it go bad.

Love the mixer idea! reply majikandy 12 hours agorootparentSame here. Never even thought of the fridge or what cold peanut butter would be like. I just can’t imagine it and have never needed to.

European peanut butter is solid, with the consistency of refrigerated butter, or of fudge. US peanut butter is a thick liquid. Over time, it separates and you get peanut oil on the surface.

The need to stir comes from peanut butter that is literally nothing other than minced peanuts.

    "originBody": "Seven Dyson Sphere Candidates by Paul GilsterMay 18, 2024Astrobiology and SETI7 comments I’m enjoying the conversation about Project Hephaistos engendered by the article on Dyson spheres. In particular, Al Jackson and Alex Tolley have been kicking around the notion of Dyson sphere alternatives, ways of preserving a civilization that are, in Alex’s words, less ‘grabby’ and more accepting of their resource limitations. Or as Al puts it: One would think that a civilization that can build a ‘Dyson Swarm’ for energy and natural resources would have a very advanced technology. Why then does that civilization not deploy an instrumentality more sly? Solving its energy needs in very subtle ways… As pointed out in the article, a number of Dyson sphere searches have been mounted, but we are only now coming around to serious candidates, and at that only seven out of a vast search field. Two of these are shown in the figure below. We’re a long way from knowing what these infrared signatures actually represent, but let’s dig into the Project Hephaistos work from its latest paper in 2024 and also ponder what astronomers can do as they try to learn more. Image: This is Figure 7 from the paper. Caption: SEDs [spectral energy distributions] of two Dyson spheres candidates and their photometric images. The SED panels include the model and data, with the dashed blue lines indicating the model without considering the emission in the infrared from the Dyson sphere and the solid black line indicating the model that includes the infrared flux from the Dyson sphere. Photometric images encompass one arcmin. All images are centered in the position of the candidates, according to Gaia DR3. All sources are clear mid-infrared emitters with no clear contaminators or signatures that indicate an obvious mid-infrared origin. The red circle marks the location of the star according to Gaia DR3. Credit: Suazo et al. We need to consider just how much we can deduce from photometry. Measuring light from astronomical sources across different wavelengths is what photometry is about, allowing us to derive values of distance, temperature and composition. We’re also measuring the object’s luminosity, and this gets complicated in Dyson sphere terms. Just how does the photometry of a particular star change when a Dyson sphere either partially or completely encloses it? We saw previously that the latest paper from this ongoing search for evidence of astroengineering has developed its own models for this. The model draws on earlier work from some of the co-authors of the paper we’re studying now. It relies on two approaches to the effect of a Dyson sphere on a star’s photometry. First, we need to model the obscuration of the star by the sphere itself. Beyond this, it’s essential to account for the re-emission of absorbed radiation at much longer wavelengths, as the megastructure – if we can call it that – gives off heat. “[W]e model the stellar component as an obscured version of its original spectrum and the DS component as a blackbody whose brightness depends on the amount of radiation it collects,” write the authors of the 2022 paper I discussed in the last post. The modeling process is worth a post of its own, but instead I’ll send those interested to an even earlier work, a key 2014 paper from Jason Wright and colleagues, “The Ĝ Infrared Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations with Large Energy Supplies. II. Framework, Strategy, and First Result.” The citation is at the end of the text. The recently released 2024 paper from Hephaistos examined later data from Gaia (Data Release 3) while also incorporating the 2MASS and WISE photometry of some 5 million sources to create a list of stars that could potentially host a Dyson sphere. In the new paper, the authors home in on partial Dyson spheres, which will partially obscure the star’s light and would show varying effects depending on the level of completion. The waste heat generated in the mid-infrared would depend upon the degree to which the structure (or more likely, ‘swarm’) was completed as well as its effective temperature. So we have a primary Dyson sphere signature in the form of excess heat, thermal emission that shows up at mid-infrared wavelengths, and that means we’re in an area of research that also involves other sources of such radiation. The dust in a circumstellar disk is one, heated by the light of the star and re-emitted at longer wavelengths. As we saw yesterday, all kinds of contamination are thus possible, but the data pipeline used by Project Hephaistos aims at screening out the great bulk of these. Seven candidates for Dyson spheres survive the filter. All seven appear to be actual infrared sources that are free of contamination from dust or other sources. The researchers subjected the data to over 6 million models that took in 391 Dyson sphere effective temperatures. They modeled Dyson spheres in temperature ranges from 100 to 700 K, with covering factors (i.e., the extent of completion of the sphere) from 0.1 to 0.9. Among many factors considered here, they’re also wary of Hα (hydrogen alpha) emissions, which could flag the early stage of star growth and might be implicated in observations of infrared radiation. Image: IC 2118, a giant cloud of gas and dust also known as the Witch Head Nebula. H-alpha emissions, which are observed over most of the Orion constellation, are shown in red. This H-alpha image was taken by the MDW Survey, a high-resolution astronomical survey of the entire night sky not affiliated with Project Hephaistos. I’m showing it to illustrate how pervasive and misleading Hα can be in a Dyson sphere search. Credit: Columbia University. I want to be precise about what the authors are saying in this paper: “…we identified seven sources displaying mid-infrared flux excess of uncertain origin.” They are not, contra some sensational reports, saying they found Dyson spheres. These are candidates. But let’s dig in a bit, because the case is intriguing. From the paper: Various processes involving circumstellar material surrounding a star, such as binary interactions, pre-main sequence stars, and warm debris disks, can contribute to the observed mid-infrared excess (e.g. Cotten & Song 2016). Kennedy & Wyatt (2013) estimates the occurrence rate of warm, bright dust. The occurrence rate is 1 over 100 for very young sources, whereas it becomes 1 over 10,000 for old systems (> 1 Gyr). However, the results of our variability check suggest that our sources are not young stars. Are the candidate objects surrounded by warm debris disks? What’s interesting here is that all seven of these are M-class stars, and as the authors note, M-dwarf debris disks are quite rare, with only a few confirmed. Why this should be so is the object of continuing study, but both the temperature and luminosity of the candidate objects differs from typical debris disks. The questions deepen and multiply: Extreme Debris Disks (EDD) (Balog et al. 2009), are examples of mid-infrared sources with high fractional luminosities (f > 0.01) that have higher temperatures compared to that of standard debris disks (Moór et al. 2021). Nevertheless, these sources have never been observed in connection with M dwarfs. Are our candidates’ strange young stars whose flux does not vary with time? Are these stars M-dwarf debris disks with an extreme fractional luminosity? Or something completely different? The authors probe the possibilities. They consider chance alignments with distant infrared sources, and offsets in the astrometry when incorporating the WISE data. There is plenty to investigate here, and the paper suggests optical spectroscopy as a way of refuting false debris disks around M-dwarfs, which could help sort between the seven objects here identified. Stellar rotation, age and magnetic activity may also be factors that will need to be probed. But when all is said and done, we wind up with this: …analyzing the spectral region around Hα can help us ultimately discard or verify the presence of young disks by analyzing the potential Hα emission. Spectroscopy in the MIR [mid-infrared] region would be very valuable when determining whether the emission corresponds to a single blackbody, as we assumed in our models. Additionally, spectroscopy can help us determine the real spectral type of our candidates and ultimately reject the presence of confounders. So the hunt for Dyson spheres proceeds. Various pieces need to fall into place to make the case still more compelling, and we should remember that “The MIR data quality for these objects is typically quite low, and additional data is required to determine their nature.” This layman’s guess – and I am not qualified to do anything more than guess – is that rather than Dyson spheres we are glimpsing interesting astrophysics regarding M-dwarfs that this investigation will advance. In any case, do keep in mind that among some five million sources, only seven show compatibility with the Dyson sphere model. If Dyson spheres are out there, they’re vanishingly rare. But finding just one would change everything. The paper on Dyson sphere modeling is Wright et al., “The Ĝ Infrared Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations with Large Energy Supplies. II.

Reply Edmund K. on May 18, 2024 at 12:41 My sense with these searches is that we are still looking for twentieth-century fantasies of what ET might look like rather than dealing with what is actually out there. The Dyson Sphere seems like a conceptual “scaling-up” of mid-century industrial society—very much a 1950s understanding of what an alien society might do (based on 1950s understandings of energy needs and how they might be satisfied). The failure so far of SETI—the fact that the universe doesn’t appear to resemble 20th-century sci-fi fantasies of an inhabited realm full of humanity analogues—surely calls for some recalibration of our expectations? Reply henry cordova on May 18, 2024 at 19:23 Please forgive me for reprising this comment to a previous thread, but I believe your own remarks are apt, and I wish to reinforce them further. I don’t really expect any of these infrared anomalies will ever be found to be an artifact of an extremely powerful civilization, one operating on a scale involving entire planets, stars and planetary systems. Even if one can conceive of a civilization lasting long enough to develop such near-godlike powers, its difficult to come up with a reason why they would want to. Our desire to speculate about such colossal powers is that we simply haven’t been able to explain away the embarrassing fact that much easier means of interstellar communication have so far failed to turn up. Instead, we fantasize about brooding, almost supernatural, intelligences hammering away at the forges of heaven creating…what? SETI enthusiasts are fascinated by technology, seduced by our own pathetic dabbling in those arts, and think of this sort of aggressive hyper-industrialism MUST be the sign of true intelligence, genuine civilization. I suppose its not impossible, the universe is old enough and big enough to make almost anything possible, somewhere, sometime. But I suspect a truly wise and advanced culture would find less spectacular and disruptive hobbies, such as securing eternal life, security from cosmic catastrophe, true scientific understanding, or even deliberately searching for other species. Making bonfires of planets and harnessing the power of entire suns seems like an awful lot of sturm und drang. It makes sense to us mostly because we’re desperate for some sort justification of our own fantasies. We like to think of ourselves as an aggressive tribe of explorers, entrepreneurs and conquerors, and we can’t imagine anyone worthwhile not being the same. We listened for microwave signals and we didn’t find any (after listening for a whole half century!) So now we fantasize about Marioshka Brains, Dyson megastructures and Kardashev Kultures. Surely, they must have left some imprint on the cosmos. I suspect intelligent civilizations are out there, but they are few and far between for the reasons I have spelled out previously. They are highly separated in space and time, and there is little incentive for any of them to expand indefinitely until they are capable of leaving a footprint that can be detected at galactic distances. Once they have reached a certain level of comfort and security they simply will have no need to continue expanding. and “progressing”. The few crazy enough to follow that psychotic path will eventually kill themselves off or stew in their own poisons. Still, I welcome this interest in sifting through old astronomical catalogs and databases. Something of interest is bound to turn up, even if it isn’t evidence of technological overreach, but just some interesting little astrophysical process we haven’t stumbled onto yet. Reply Montie on May 18, 2024 at 8:46 According to the Bradbury M-Brain page using our own star as an example, a cloud of material could cover a star all the way out to the orbit if Neptune. That much material between star and cloud edge would make it no more visible than background radiation. Was he wrong? Would IR still get through? Can not heat be directed away so as to not point at other stars? –sincerely, Not A Real Scientist. Reply Robert on May 18, 2024 at 11:37 It seems unreasonable to me that a truly advanced civilization would be interest in tapping the last joule of solar energy of it’s star over more exotic but convenient forms of energy such as fusion. Do what stars do but on your own terms. More likely it would be far in advance of fusion to some source we can’t even imagine yet. Yet, Sir Arthur C. Clarke did imagine something exotic in his books with monoliths exponentially multiplying over Jupiter blocking out its light and engineering its properties. Like a local Dyson Sphere but for another purpose. Perhaps as Sir Arthur suggested, it would appear like magic to us. Reply Ron S. on May 18, 2024 at 12:36 “5 million sources” “1 over 10,000 for old systems” “Seven candidates” These number popped out at me. Despite my having eliminated much of the nuances of this data related to those quotes, the rough statistics seem underwhelming to me. If there are Dyson swarms/spheres, they must be very rare. Robert: “It seems unreasonable to me that a truly advanced civilization would be interest in tapping the last joule of solar energy of it’s star over more exotic but convenient forms of energy such as fusion. ” I agree. A civilization isn’t advanced if it must huddle around a campfire. Reply Mark on May 18, 2024 at 12:57 Hi Paul Great and informative article.

While the explanation is likely some unknown natural process, salting a star with an impossible chemical composition might also be a way for a technological species to create a monument, correct?

When two human companies merge, the result is often mistrust, poor communication, poor effectiveness, and sometimes ultimately failure. Sometimes the result of the merger is more effective.

If you are the first one and want to make sure to prevent all future advanced civilizations from evolving, you send out von Neumann probes. You can tell them to build relativistic kill missiles and destroy all planets. No planets = no new civs, probably. reply bufferoverflow 7 hours agorootparent> There are plenty of unclaimed resources. You don't know that. Maybe our planet once had some amazing high-energy isotope/mineral that was completely mined out. reply Intralexical 3 hours agorootparentThere is no such thing. I think physics and economics dictates that you can't really be advanced enough for interstellar industry and yet backwards enough to have the type of resource scarcity which would compel interstellar resource competition. If these aliens can not only travel but do resource extraction at interstellar distances, that implies having highly advanced fusion or annihilation reactors. Minerals are just chemical reaction products, and therefore necessarily cost negligible energy to synthesize compared to interstellar travel. It's easier to just make the minerals you need. Isotopes are finite in number, and we already know and largely understand all the ones are likely to ever be useful. \"Island of Stability\" nuclei may or may not be possible beyond that, but even if they're not only possible but also useful, they will almost certainly have halflives short enough that they will also have to be synthesized rather than mined. So, there's no competing over planets either way. At the lower end of the tech levels where you can have interstellar industry, the only \"amazingly high-energy isotope/mineral\" is hydrogen fusion fuel. There's nothing in the Earth's crust or core that could be useful for them, because terrestrial planets are made out of spent nuclear detritus. Though maybe they can bring a big fusion candle and just run off with Jupiter, if they forget about their own gas giants and stars. At the higher end of the tech scale, even hydrogen stops being a resource. Matter annihilation (e.g. via microscopic black holes) means that it doesn't matter what element or chemical your fuel is made out of when you're converting it directly to energy. I think any resource competition argument for \"dark forest\" exopolitics really undersells how vast space is, and how abundant resources are. A single Jupiter with basic fusion reactors could easily sustain quadrillions of humans in enormously inefficient utopian living conditions for trillions of years.

Yes, but that has nothing to do with the argument we're having. It doesn't disprove that there might have been some rare resource (or maybe it's still here, we just didn't get to it). reply Intralexical 1 hour agorootparentProperties like the binding energies of molecules and nuclei are a direct and well-understood consequence of the laws of physics. Materials in the real world aren't like Star Trek, where dilithium and the omega molecule can be treated as an infinite energy source because the name sounds cool. In order for a material to be an energy source, that energy has to come from somewhere. You can only put so much strain on a chemical bond before the electrons decide to stop sticking together anymore. You can only get as much energy out as the mass change from splitting an atom. You can only store as much energy in a heavy nucleus as was originally put into it by the supernova that created it. Anything else would violate basic laws of physics, to such a degree that everything in our universe would presumably immediately cease to exist. > No, we do not. Google \"island of stability\". I already addressed the hypothetical island of stability in the sentence immediately after the one you quoted. The term is relative. They are expected to have longer halflives than the instantly decaying superheavies like ununoctium, but even the longer predictions of their decay properties have them disappearing far too quickly to be mined as minerals. I'll add now that there's also no reason to believe that island of stability substances, if they even exist, will have any more particularly useful or powerful properties than any other heavy metal. When was the last time you needed to use Mendelevium for something? > Yes, but that has nothing to do with the argument we're having. It doesn't disprove that there might have been some rare resource (or maybe it's still here, we just didn't get to it). It disproves the idea that there might be some useful resource which you would want to go conquering for. The resources available in any star system are already more than any conceivable civilization could ever use. The other side of this is the difficulty of interstellar travel. Reaching relativistic speeds implies turning a significant fraction of your vehicle's mass into energy. With the ability to create and manipulate such power densities, you're better off just synthesizing whatever you need. > No, it doesn't. You don't know what you don't know. > But maybe there was, that's the argument. > Again, you're talking about known science. Not everything. You don't know what you don't know. If the argument for suggesting a complete break from the known laws of physics can be summarized as \"You don't know what you don't know\", then you may as well argue that the universe is secretly controlled by a giant space cat which will reward us with salmon if we all shine laser pointers in our retinas every third Thursday. \"Maybe there was\" is not actually an argument, in the sense that there is neither anything specifically substantiating it which can be examined, nor any falsifiable conditions which may disprove it. reply stouset 8 hours agorootparentprevBy the time you know whether or not another civilization is hostile, it’s probably too late. “Interstellar war” sounds like a long dragged-out set of engagements when it’s more likely that one random day without warning your planet intersects a sizable chunk of tungsten traveling at 0.9c.

If we took all the proven petroleum reserves in the world, and magically converted them into kinetic energy with 100% efficiency— With zero overhead for transportation, launch, agriculture, or obeying conservation of momentum­— That still wouldn't be enough to launch even a single planet killer. At most you could crater a small country, but not kill a civilization: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2+trillion+barrels+of+o... So let's say you do nuclear pulse propulsion like Project Orion. You've still got Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation to deal with. Assuming a speculative fusion bomb ISP of 75,000s, you would need a rocket with… over 50 orders of magnitude more mass than the entire observable universe, in order to accelerate a single proton to 0.9c: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=e%5E%280.9c%2F%2875000s... Light sails will be huge, obvious/visible, and slow. Beamed power will run into issues with diffraction. In fact, reaching 0.9c while you're still in the solar system plainly implies maintaining multiple hundreds of g's of acceleration over many dozen astronomical units of distance. That doesn't seem feasible at all. It's wildly beyond not only our best existing ion drives, but probably also any remotely feasible existing concept for space propulsion. reply perihelions 2 hours agorootparentprevThis probably isn't true: we don't even have enough conventional weapons to destroy our own planet, and we've been optimizing that for centuries. A relativistic missile is a conventional weapon scaled up. reply ordu 4 hours agorootparentprevWe couldn't accomplish this. Theoretically speaking, yes we could, but \"theoretocally\" means \"ignoring the half of the reality\". We can't even travel to Moon now practically. To send a chunk of tungsten at a relativistic velocity would mean an effort for trillions of dollars. Don't forget that it is not enough to just get a chunk of tungsten moving, you want it to hit a moving target, and you'd better add some thrusters to it and a guidance system. Is there anyone willing to pay for that? Any civilization will need to concentrate a lot of efforts to fire a chunk of tungsten, but why might it do it? There are better ways to utilize that effort. Maybe it is a rational thing to go aggressive nevertheless, but the benefits will be in a far future while politicians needs to justify spending now. People and societies are not rational. There is no real examples of rational agents, but people still insist on treating rational agents as something real. Theoretically speaking AGI might become a rational agent, but I doubt it from a practical standpoint: AGI will be limited by a computational power and by its abilities to gather data. So it will use heuristics, and it will be not rational. It can be closer to a platonic ideal of a rational agent then human, but even that is not free of doubt. People surpisingly well do with all their heuristics and when they appear irrational it is mostly due to inability of observers to understand the real motivation of people. You need a much more advanced civilization to be as aggressive. A civilization that can do it by spending maybe 0.1% GDP for 10 years. At least looking at humanity, I'd say that any cost higher than that will not work definitely. Such unprovoked and costly agression having no observable results easily could end a lot of political careers. Theoretically speaking we can ignore all these difficulties and start with the assumption that it is possible to concentrate 100% GDP on a one task for years or even decades. Practically it is impossible. Maybe another civilization will have another structure and will be able to concentrate efforts on a larger scale then humanity? Maybe. But could you imagine such a hypothetical civilization and estimate chances of it to get to a sufficiently advanced level? I cant neither. So while I keep in mind this theoretical dreams of rational civilization purging each other, I do not assign any credibility to them. I keep myself in an uncertain state, the best state to have an open mind, to be ready to absorb any evidence or reasoning. reply stouset 7 hours agorootparentprevPeople seem very confused by this so let me try and spell it out. For the sake of argument let’s say we become aware of another intelligent civilization on a rocky body orbiting Proxima Centauri. They are, virtually by definition, apex predators on their homeworld. We cannot know their intentions should they learn about us. Meanwhile, it is trivial for us to end their civilization. If we decided to, with more or less today’s technology, we could accelerate a chunk of tungsten to comical speeds and obliterate their homeworld. It would cost a fortune and it would take awhile, but we could do it. Certainly it would be orders of magnitude easier than getting humans there, setting up any sort of interstellar trade, or working to understand each other’s language and culture. And nobody at the receiving end would be the wiser until their planet essentially ceased to exist one day. I’m not saying we want to. But we could. And importantly, they could do the same to us. Do we: 1. Loudly announce ourselves, gambling our entire civilization that they aren’t aggressive, paranoid, misunderstand us at some point and take grave offense, realize we have a nicer planet than they do, or find some other reason to become openly hostile. 2. Shut the fuck up and hope they don’t catch our leaked radio signature from before we knew any better. 3. Strike first, just to be safe. Better us than them. If we think that any other civilization might decide to open door number three, the calculus tilts sharply in favor of doing it first ourselves. Or at the very least going with the second option and investing a hell of a lot of money into figuring out how to detect, intercept, and redirect relativistic kill vehicles. It doesn’t even have to be the Centauris in this scenario who are evil or paranoid. They could be just as hopelessly naïve as us and happily engage in a mutually beneficial back-and-forth. Meanwhile the Sirians (who have been quietly observing from the sidelines) one day fire off a pair of surprise care packages to the both of us, before we can get big enough to potentially threaten them and their way of life. reply WhitneyLand 5 hours agorootparentNo, false. More or less today’s technology could not accelerate tungsten to speeds that would obliterate a planet. And you say it’s trivial? Who told you this? Just run some calculations it doesn’t make sense.

Or around 1X the geologically very recent eruption of Mount Toba. The ecosphere will be fine. You'll probably vaporize a small patch of ocean, and they'll get colorful sunsets for a couple days. But that's about it. By contrast, assuming \"more or less today's technology\", we're now out of petroleum reserves because we used them all in our magic instant-acceleration kinetic-energy-converter. reply WhitneyLand 5 hours agorootparentprevNo, also false. And my example was only 99% light speed. At the link below you can see simulations at 99.9% light speed. An entire Egyptian pyramid, hitting Earth at this 10x higher speed, might kill off life, but it’s still not obliterating the planet. We are not capable of accelerating any macroscopic object to .999C. Let alone a huge piece of tungsten, which still wouldn’t be powerful enough. https://youtu.be/DwgMjr-Qu1Y?si=-goF8QResb976kpN reply epidemian 6 hours agorootparentprevIn this hypothetical scenario, we wouldn't know if they have known of our existence for a long time, and maybe even taken precautions like installing some proxy killer probes in case we had a stupid crazy idea like trying to launch a genocidal relativistic missile against them. So, why would we go so blindly for option 3 and risk it all by being the first ones to defect in an interstellar prisoner's dilemma? Especially if we have good reasons to suspect that they've known about us for long and have remained neutral so far. After all, Proxima Centauri is quite close, and our atmosphere gives ample signals of there being life here. And we haven't been particularly quiet either. I haven't delved deep into this, so there might be some much more tight logic to it. But my first impression is that the dark forest hypothesis seems a bit forced; sort of constructed backwards in order to explain a cool idea (that space is full of civilizations but everyone is quiet). For example, one of the assumptions it makes is that obliterating another space-faring civilization is easy. And, at the same time, that we (and everyone) have very little information of other civilizations. I don't see how these two assumptions can hold at the same time. reply TaylorAlexander 6 hours agorootparentThese scenarios are so funny because they’re totally focused on threats and destruction as the key assumptions, and then they invariably conclude “so we should destroy them”. And it’s just like, that’s such a colonizer mentality, trying to game out a completely unknown society and immediately focusing on threats, technology, and destruction. I wonder, what are they like? What could we learn from them? Why are we assuming all beings are violent like us? Does it really make sense to immediately obliterate a culture you’ve never even seen? I seriously doubt it. You could send probes, spies, and try to covertly learn about them. You could send envoys, without revealing your origin, and try to gain knowledge from first contact. You may learn there is no threat, and a great deal to be discovered. What if they had medicine which could cure every disease? Energy generators which could save our planet? What if they were simply peaceful beings with a rich beautiful history, and no desire or capacity to harm us? The threat/destruction paradigm feels so simplistic, impoverished, and brutal. reply stouset 6 hours agorootparent> I wonder, what are they like? What could we learn from them? Of course I wonder these same things. But when the consequences of becoming known to the wrong civilization are inevitable destruction, what are your alternatives? We very nearly killed ourselves (we still might!) with nuclear weapons because we thought the other side might shoot first. This is that taken to an even further extreme: we won’t even know if we’ve been shot at until it’s far too late to do anything about it. We likely wouldn’t ever even know who sent the damn thing in the first place. The balance of things is that silent civilizations with caveman-level technology are more than capable of wiping out noisy and naïve technologically-advanced civilizations. You can wonder all you like about who and what these beings are and what wonders they must know of, and absolutely none of that will matter when a tungsten rod turns the planet into a fireball because you made the mistake of sending up a signal flare without having any idea that it was safe to do so. One in a thousand civilizations could be paranoid enough to sterilize other spacefaring civilizations and it would be reason enough to be very, very quiet. reply TaylorAlexander 3 hours agorootparent> when the consequences of becoming known to the wrong civilization are inevitable destruction This is the presupposition that seems entirely baseless to me. An explanation has been constructed that comes to this as the only conclusion, but the assumptions in the explanation seem themselves to come from nothing. I think this is what often called \"projection\". Human beings are a violent creature that destroys others, so we assume these alien creatures must be. But they are aliens. We presently know nothing about aliens. My view is that we should interrogate the assumptions that lead us to your brutal conclusion. Projection of our own fears is insufficient to make the right choice. Another question to reflect on: Why do you not destroy every person you come in contact with? They could likely kill you if they tried. But more so than legal consequences, you simply feel no desire to do so. There are reasons for your feeling that way. reply perilunar 5 hours agorootparentprev> Meanwhile, it is trivial for us to end their civilization.

I am in the EU, so that was very cheap w/o insurance. I believe in The States they recommend prophylactic Doxycycline, at any concern, instead of testing because testing $. Prophylactic Doxycycline is a couple pills. Since I missed that, Advanced Neuro Lyme was 30 days of 2 high-dose pills a day. In the USA, they require IV antibiotics for Advanced Neuro.

It might be \"easier\" for longevity, to terraform a Mercury type planet with unnatural chemicals, then smash a large off-plane comet into it, to create a band of non-star weird chemicals which would fall into the star and should last for millions of years, giving it a one-in-a-billion spectrograph? edit: Come to think about it a bit more, I would argue that the latter solution is entirely within our technological grasp nearly today, as a pre-Kardashev scale civilization. reply paulddraper 9 hours agorootparentThe typical sci-fi answer is primes Irregular but mathematically significant/recognizable. reply Zigurd 12 hours agoprevNot that I think speculation is bad, but the concept of intelligences expanding by building space structures so immense needs some push-back: Is there enough time in the lifetime of a star to build and use those structures?

Easily. Sci-fi has misconstrued what a Dyson Sphere is to the point where the preferred nomenclature is \"Dyson Swarm\". A Dyson Sphere was never a rigid shell around a star. Such a thing isn't possible with any known or theorized material. And it makes no sense even if you could. So a Dyson Swarm around our Sun would be approximately a billion O'Neil Cylinders (orbitals 2-4 miles in diameter and 10-20 miles long). You don't have to build them all at once. Build them as you need them. The more you build the more industrial capacity you have. They can all be built independently too. I imagine it would take less than 10 years to build one once you have the capability. > Are there intelligent beings with a drive to limitlessly expand their population? Population is only one concern. A more driving force may well be the desire for energy and raw materials. Raw materials, and in fact most problems, can be reduced to being an energy problem. Some things will require a truly mind-boggling amount of energy eg interstellar travel. Our Sun won't live forever. It's estimated to go into a red giant phase in 4-5 billion years, that will end up swallowing the Earth most likely. Long before then, life won't be able to exist on Earth as the Sun's solar output is increasing by about 10% every billion years. Earth as it stands now to us as we are now will be uninhabitable in ~1.6 billion years. So to be truly long-lived we're going to have to do something about that. There are lots of options. Those include reducing the energy that hits the Earth, moving the Earth or moving our species to a different system. The last one is particularly attractive because white or red dwarves will likely exist for trillions of years. Every one of these options requires a vast amount of energy. > ... swarms of space structures, each orders of magnitude more massive than Earth That's not what a Dyswon Swarm is. reply bloopernova 10 hours agorootparentNow I'm wondering what the sky would look like from the inner surface of an O'Neil Habitat.

Also, they are a group of individual beings, and it wasn't some sort of global hivemind with a singular being surrounding the entire planet like some coral or whatever.

There are lots of problems with fusion that are unclear if they will ever be solved, specifically: 1. Energy loss from neutron escape. Stars don't have this issue because they are incredibly large (so your neutron will hit something else more likely than not) and gravity; 2. Vessel destruction from lost neutrons (ie neutron embrittlement); 3. Assuming D-T fusion, you're producing helium atoms. Helium is a pesky substance. It's chemically neutral and a helium atom is (AFAIK) the smallest atom, even smaller than a hydrogen atom. That means it is hard to contain and also has a tendency to damage your container; 4. Fusion reactors are, in a way, somewhat primitive. Why? Because ultimately you generate heat and turn a turbine like we do in every coal and natural gas plant. Moving parts are bad. 5. Fuel. Depending on what fuel you need, this is somewhere between a small problem (eg protium or even deuterium) to a hassle (eg tritium) to a major problem (eg He-3). 6. Waste. This depends on fuel somewhat eg do you need to use fissile materials to create Tritium? Much more detail [1]. We obviously don't know the economics of fusion yet because it doesn't exist, but the economics of nuclear fission are, well, terrible (in both capex and opex terms). Once you put a solar panel in space, it produces ~7 times the power. There's no loss to cloud cover, getting covered in dust/dirt, atmosphereic loss and the day/night cycle. For an orbital, you simply cover the exterior with solar panels and you're done for power generation. No moving parts, no catastrophic failure modes (eg meltdowns in nuclear plants), it's scalable and when panels break down you simply remove them and plug in a new one. I expect other forms of power generation will find a niche use far from the Sun in the same way that submarines have different operating characteristics to a suburb. But I'm skeptical fusion will ever be the preferred method of power generation.

Dyson swarm satellite would be heated up by incoming heat from Sun on one side and heated up by whatever mean you want to transfer that energy on the other side and unable to cool itself down because it is in vacuum of space. So even that power on the paper is eye popping, actual power would be fraction of a fraction of nameplate power because then you would overheated and destroy it. And now question would be, is such constrained satellite able to make more energy than it was invested into making of this satellite? Combine 1 and 2 together and real output from such structure would be close to zero. reply cletus 11 hours agorootparent> You don't have a way how to transfer power from Dyson swarm without absurdly staggering losses. Why do you need to transfer power? The point of an orbital is primarily for people to live on. A single orbital could potentially support a million or more people. Are you referring to the issue of providing power to Earth? That's... a separate issue, with different solutions. The idea of power satellites [1] has had a lot of thought. An alternative approach is to build an orbital ring [2] and hang solar power collectors off of it. You could this power directly to the ground with transmission lines. > Dyson swarm satellite would be heated up by incoming heat from Sun on one side An orbital would be heated on the side facing the Sun and radiate away heat away when not facing the Sun in the exact same way that the Moon is scorching hot when facing the Sun and 200 below zero when not.

In the civilization's planet's surface? It seems to me that it would create serious energy imbalances and soon climate disruption. reply Karellen 20 hours agoparentOne solution to this is the Matrioshka brain, which consists of many nested \"shells\" around the star. Each one absorbs the radiation from the hotter shell inside it (or from the star, if the inner shell), and radiates waste heat to the cooler shell outside it. The temperature differential between the inside and outside of each shell is what allows work to be done. The outer surface of the outermost shell, maybe 5 billion km (~35AU, or a bit further out than Neptune) from the star, will be close to the ambient temperature of the interstellar medium, and will radiate heat at only a few Kelvin into it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain reply micw 13 hours agorootparentSo instead of seing a hot \"small\" spot (the star), we'd see a warm (a bit above absolute zero) but very large sphere? reply javcasas 12 hours agorootparentWell, seeing it may be an exaggeration. It would be barely less black than the space around it. Though it may shadow other stars and distant objects. reply quadragenarian 9 hours agorootparentIsn't the point (and I could be wrong) with a Dyson sphere that it should have a spectrum that approaches that of a perfect blackbody radiator? Or would any radiation that sneaks past the swarm drown out the blackbody spectrum? reply cletus 21 hours agoparentprevSee my comment for a more detailed explanation but the short version is: a Dyson Swarm (preferred term) is merely a cloud of orbitals (ie not a rigid shell; there is no known or even theorized material with the strength to build a shell that large). The orbitals dissipate heat into space. That's what the infrared radiation is that they're looking for. reply VariableStar 21 hours agorootparentI see that. My point is that if the captured energy is used, and thus ultimately dissipated as heat, on the planet's surface, that planet is sooner than later going to have climatic imbalance. reply cletus 20 hours agorootparentThere are several possibilities here. First, the Earth already receives a ton of energy from the Sun that is \"wasted\". We estimate that at about 10^16 Watts of power, compared to humanity's energy usage, estimated at 10^10-10^11 watts. So Earth has a ton of energy dissipiation \"built in\" that we're not \"using\". Second, there is some inefficiency and thus heat dissipation in converting solar output into usable energy. Doing that in space means a bunch of heat dissipation happens in space rather than on your planet. Third, it's relatively straightforwward to counter any increased heat dissipation on your planet by reducing that solar output that hits your planet. How? You build something at the EArth-Sun L1 Lagrange point. Reducing that solar output that hits the EArth by 1% would likely be unnoticeable to us but could cool the Earth significantly. Also, what do you build there? Well, lots of things. More orbitals, solar power collectors, etc. Fourth, how do you get power down to a planet? There are several candidates. One is to beam it down. This adds a conversion cost. But here's another: you build a n orbital ring [1] 100-150km above the EArth's surface. There are a ton of reasons you'd want to do this: interplanetary travel, cheap travel to and from LEO and easier travel across the planet (ie up to the ring, down to another point on Earth on cable cars, basically). But consider this: it gives you a rigid structure to attach solar power collectors to and you can run power transmission cables down from the ring to the planet's surface. [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E reply pests 4 hours agorootparentAre you capitalizing it like EArth for a reason or just a typo? Just wondering as you use it a few times but are flip flopping. reply ericd 18 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how much reaction mass we’d need every year to keep something stationed at a Lagrange point to block 1% of earth’s light, for combatting global warming. 1% of earth’s light would be a heck of a solar sail. Looks like 1% would be 13.3 watts per meter, cross section of earth yields ~5.4x10^14 watts. Assuming perfect reflective, multiplying by 2/c gives 3.6x10^6 N. So like half of the thrust of one of Saturn V’s engines? So… a lot of reaction mass, or some really powerful ion engines and a ton of power. So maybe not the most practical idea. reply cletus 11 hours agorootparentIt's true that the L1 Lagrange point is unstable so would need some station-keeping. It's an issue but it's a solvable issue. For one thying you have a bunch of energy to spend. For another, the solar wind itself can be used to provide momentum going out if what you have there is sufficiently light. But there's another option: statites [1]. Statites are solar power collectors that have an incredibly thin sail to the point that they don't need to orbit the Sun at all. This means you have a bunch more options for positioning. Clearly the Earth will continue to revolve around the Sun but a sufficient swarm of statites on the EArth's orbital plane could have the same net effect as, say, driving beneath a bunch of stationary umbrellas. Or statites can themselves do station-keeping at L1. They can angle themselves to provide momentum in a bunch of directions. Or they can orbit the L1 point similar to how JWST orbits L2. Their ability to use the solar wind for directional momentum could satisfy station keeping needs. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statite reply ericd 8 hours agorootparentOh very cool. Besides the unstable nature of L1, my main concern was actually mitigating the light pressure of the light being blocked, in order to not be blown earthward, but I guess that’s not really considering that these things could manipulate their solar sails/shades like the statites you’re mentioning. reply yreg 8 hours agorootparentprevYou don't redirect all the energy to the home world. You dissipate the heat into space. Which is why you can't hide, anyone who aims their instruments on your system will detect the heat and see that the star is obstructed. reply kobalsky 20 hours agorootparentprevif a civilization needs so much power they build a dyson sphere they probably have terraforming nailed. that kind of technology probably takes hundred of thousands of years of technological development and we have had electricity for how long? reply pests 4 hours agorootparentI think you are overestimating by many orders of magnitude. reply kiba 21 hours agorootparentprevEarth already do this.

It is like a water wheel doing work by water flowing through it, but ultimately amount of water before and behind water wheel is same. Thus the question still stands, what happens to heat in such thing? Does it get recycled by some unknown device? Then it is closed system, you don't need input from outside. It won't get recycled? Then such device needs to get hot from dissipating that heat. reply alchemist1e9 20 hours agorootparentprevIf they can build a sphere or swarm megastructure then obviously they would have build orbiting habitats either from scratch or terraforming planets or astroids. reply exe34 18 hours agorootparentprev> The whole energy of the swarm will be used there that sounds like a made up problem. the Dyson swarm isn't to collect energy to send to the home planet. it's to collect energy. where that is used is going to be wherever it's needed. mining the asteroids, local computing (the cloud is no longer just a computer on earth, it's the cloud of the swarm elements), powering interstellar trips remotely, etc. the only thing that needs to get to earth is the imports of goods and services. reply aurareturn 5 hours agorootparentTerraforming a planet is another use case. reply kjkjadksj 17 hours agoparentprevMy assumption is if you demand the energy needs of a dyson swarm you’ve probably figured out how to convert this energy to work with none of it lost to heat. reply TheLoafOfBread 12 hours agorootparentThen why would you need a Dyson swarm at a first place, when you can just recycle heat energy through your systems with almost 100% efficiency? reply micw 13 hours agoprevI wonder if the material of all the stuff in our sun's orbit would be sufficient to build a dyson sphere.

There's a lot of unknowns for the gas giants, particularly what % of them contains iron, but Jupiter /might/ have as much as 100x earth heavy elements (including iron), but these would be at its core, and its not totally clear how you would extract them. I think the key question is what sort of stresses you expect the sphere to be under, and thereby what materials and tensile strengths are required.

What am I missing? reply jbotz 20 hours agoparent> What am I missing? The scale. The reason to build a Dyson Sphere (or Swarm) is that you want all (or at least a large fraction) of the energy output of a star. To \"build decentralized fusion reactors\" that can provide the same scale of energy is even less practical than building a shell around a star and would require far more materials! Also, fusion is really simple when the ignition energy is provided for free by the gravitational compression of something the size of a star, and not so simple when you're trying to get it started on a small scale using any other form of energy for ignition. The bottom line is we don't really know if small-scale, controlled, net-energy-positive fusion is possible at all, but if it is it has a lot of overhead costs... you then have to deal with ignition energy, containment, etc. You're trying to make a mini-star and keep it tame. The physics are not favorable to this, they are favorable to star-sized stars, where gravity and fusion energy pressure can balance each other for millions of years. reply ianburrell 13 hours agorootparentThe concentrated energy of Dyson Sphere can be very useful. Feed some of it into lasers and then launch starships and then slow them down when they get to destination. Not tiny probes with fusion reactors but full size starships.

Honestly, don't need to expand across the galaxy if have Dyson Sphere, which could be explanation of Fermi Paradox. reply mrtransient 7 hours agorootparentDiffraction limit determines the fundamental beam divergence angle theta = lamda/pi/D, where D is the beam diameter, lamda is wavelegth of elwctromagnetic radiation (eg. light). To minimize theta, we need to either increase D or decrease lamda. Lets assume we would be able to make far infrared high power lasers, at say 10,000 nm = 1e-5 m wavelength. Lets assume we would be able to make D, the diameter of our laser beam, similar to the diameter of a typical planet, for Earth it is ~13,000 km = 13e6 m. Theta = 1e-5 / 3.14 / 13e6 ~= 1e-13 radians. Sun is ~ 25,000 light years from the center of our galaxy, ~= 25e3 y 3e8 m/s 31.5e6 s/year ~= 1e20 m. Laser beam diameter, there far away, would be: 1e-13 *1e20 = 1e7 m, similar to the diameter of Earth, not much further diverged, focused and delivering the wast amount of energy all over the planet thereby evaporating it to a gas.

The only missing piece there is a fully sustainable (i.e. only energy input) life support system, which we have existence proofs for on Earth but haven't built to reliable engineering standards yet. If we have the material, we could start building it today and get designs that worked well quickly, even if we had to ship in life support maintenance alongside computer chips & pharmaceuticals. The part we don't know how to do yet is getting the material. Building structures that large in space, the resources for it have to come from space, we cannot lift it off Earth. So we need to figure out how to mine asteroids, and maybe also how to mine Mercury. Either one would be sufficient at the start. Neither of those are a well-understood problem, let alone solved, so that's where you should invest resources if you're a billionaire looking to start a Dyson sphere and think SpaceX is on track for launch cost reduction. I think in terms of science and engineering difficulty, it's a pretty even race as to which is more difficult between making fusion actually produce net useful energy and being able to mine & refine materials from an asteroid + build a sustainable life support system. The reason fusion \"seems easier\" is because it is economically far more achievable, and there's a lot more political will behind it so it feels more possible. reply throwaway11460 20 hours agorootparentAs a billionaire that wants to start a Dyson sphere, where is the profit / operational revenue? reply eep_social 19 hours agorootparentThe ceiling on asteroid mining is orders of magnitude higher than anything constrained to earth.

Because if we're able to build the sphere itself, we probably would already know some way to cool it down in space so it doesn't burn itself, wasting all the money that went to its construction. reply cletus 21 hours agoprevI love this topic. If and when we detect a technologically-advanced civilization, I truly believe this is how we'll do it. But why? Because the Dyson Swarm (the preferred name; \"sphere\" implies a rigid structure that was never the intent) is seen by many as the most likely path forward for any spacefaring civilization. Why? Several reasons: 1. It can be built incrementally. What you'd probably do is build orbitals and put them in Earth's orbit around the Sun, Then you can keep adding new orbits. Ultimately you end up with a \"cloud\" of orbitals that will block a star's light in the same way that water molecules in a fog block light; 2. A likely candidate for an orbital is waht's called an O'Neil Cylinder: 3-4 miles in diameter, 10-20 miles long, producing Earthlike gravity on the interior by spinning. Smaller than this and it needs to spin too fast. Larger than this and you need stronger materials to stop it ripping itself apart from centrifugal forces. Stainless steel is sufficiently strong to build an O'Neil Cylinder; 3. Solar power is the most likely source for our future energy needs. It's the only known power source that directly creates power and it does so with no moving parts and no waste produced. In space, solar is so ridiculously efficient that it's unlikely fission could ever compete economically and fusion is still a pipe dream. 4. Approximately 1 in 10^9 of the Sun's output hits the EArth. That's an awful lot of \"free\" energy just radiating out into space. The growth potential is huge. What do we need all that energy for? History has shown we'll find a use but here's a big one: the energy cost of interstellar travel is so mind-boggling large that we'd need something like the Sun's energy output to do it. Plus an interstellar generation ship looks an awful lot like an O'Neil Cylinder. Anyway, the article doesn't really explain why the seaerch for infrared radiation that I could see (maybe I missed it?). It's important. A body in space like an O'Neil Cylinder will heat up, even with converting some of that energy to electricity. The only way to cool down in space is to either expel mater, which doesn't really scale, or to radiate it away into space. The wavelength of light from a radiating body is determined entirely by the temperature of that body and for any temperature we're likely to see, that means infrared radiation. So if you look at a star with a near total Dyson Swarm you'll see much less visible light and much more IR radiation and there's really no way to hide that. Some might say you can capture the heat an turn it into energy but you can't do that with perfect efficiency (ie thermodynamics) plus the material of the orbital will just naturally radiate anyway no matter what you do. It's extremely conservative to say that we'll have the technology to build and deploy an O'Neil Cylinder within 1000 years. Give it 10,000 years if you really want. It makes no difference. That's still the blink of an eye in cosmic terms. And that gap between having 1 and a billion is also the blink of an eye. And once you have what's called a K2 (Kardashev-2) civilization (being one that uses the full energy output of a star) where interstellar travel becomes possible, even practical, seeding a new Dyson Swarm around another star becomes trivial and the proces continues to the point where 100 million years from now is a completely realistic time period to have a Dyson Swarm around every star in our galaxy. A galaxy of Dyson Swarms would be so obvious to observers even millions of light years away, even at our current level of technology. The absence of seeing such a thing contributes to the idea that spacefaring life is incredibly rare. reply lucubratory 20 hours agoparent\"A likely candidate for an orbital is waht's called an O'Neil Cylinder: 3-4 miles in diameter, 10-20 miles long, producing Earthlike gravity on the interior by spinning.

That is a lot smaller than an O'Neill cylinder and a lot more feasible to build sometime soon. IMO the best option is to build a 100m diameter testbed now from Earth materials, as the successor to the ISS. Then take the lessons learned there and build a 450m diameter prototype, which we can use space materials for if space mining has developed enough. We could technically throw enough material into orbit for a 450m diameter cylinder but it would be a lot of material. Any of the larger sizes and we'd need real-deal asteroid mining to make that happen. Basically, build a small testbed now to conduct actual experiments on human health at different gravity levels + RPMs, and also start trying to figure out asteroid mining. Build a bigger prototype habitat once we can get materials for it, either from massive launch cost reductions or asteroid mining. After that point we really do need asteroid mining. reply petters 21 hours agoparentprev> and fusion is still a pipe dream Well, so is building Dyson swarms and spheres.

Humans successfully performed nuclear fusion many times since 1950s and there are thousands ready packaged fusion devices around the world. reply cletus 20 hours agorootparentprev> Well, so is building Dyson swarms and spheres Building a Dyson Swarm, which is really just the problem of creating one self-sustaining orbital (since after that it's just a scaling issue) is really just an engineering problem. A huge one of course but we already have teh technology to create a material as strong as stainless steel and to build solar power collectors. Currently, the big cost is getting material into space. LEO payloads are still (AFAIK) >$1000/kg. Getting that to $100/kg or even $10/kg completely changes that equation and yes, there are viable paths to reach that (eg orbital rings). Fusion isn't even an engineering problem yet: it's a science problem. The big problem is energy loss from neutrons (as well as those neutrons destroying your reactor). That's not a problem for stars. They have gravity and are simply so large that the vast majority of neutrons are captured and feed into the overall process. It's not clear we'll ever reasonably solve these problems. A fusion reactor is large and expensive and has many moving parts since, ultimately, we just use heat to turn a turbine in the same way a coal or NG plant does. Plus it needs fuel. Over long timescales that's still a problem. What fuel? Helium-3 (for so-called aneutronic fusion) is a big problem to source. Deuterium is easy to get. Tritium is harder to get. Protium is obviously easy to get. Nuclear power as it currently stands on EArth cannot compete with",

    "originBody": "The Digital Antiquarian May 17, 2024 • 32 comments Riven Share Tweet Pin Mail SMS Robyn and Rand Miller. Sometimes success smacks you right in the face. More often, it sneaks up on you from behind. In September of 1993, the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller and the few other employees of Cyan, Inc., were prototypical starving artists, living on “rice and beans and government cheese.” That month they saw Brøderbund publish their esoteric Apple Macintosh puzzle game Myst, which they and everyone else regarded as a niche product for a niche platform. There would go another year before it became abundantly clear that Myst, now available in a version for Microsoft Windows as well as for the Mac, was a genuine mass-market hit. It would turn into the gift that kept on giving, a game with more legs than your average millipede. It wouldn’t enjoy its best single month until December of 1996, when it would set a record for the most copies one game had ever sold in one month. All of this — not just the sales figures themselves but the dozens of awards, the write-ups in glossy magazines like Rolling Stone and Newsweek, the fawningly overwritten profiles in Wired, the comparisons with Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park and Michael Jackson’s Thriller — happened just gradually enough that it seemed almost natural. Almost natural. “It took a while for it to hit me that millions of people were buying this game,” says Robyn Miller. “The most I could really wrap my head around would be to go to a huge concert and see all of the people there and think, ‘Okay, this is not even a portion of the people who are playing Myst.'” The Miller brothers could have retired and lived very comfortably for the rest of their lives on the fortune they earned from Myst. They didn’t choose this path. “We took salaries that were fairly modest and just put the company’s money back into [a] new project,” says Rand. Brøderbund was more than eager for a sequel to Myst, something that many far smaller hits than it got as a matter of course within a year. But the Miller brothers refused to be hurried, and did not need to be, a rare luxury indeed in their industry. Although they enjoyed a very good relationship with Brøderbund, whose marketing acumen had been essential to getting the Myst ball rolling, they did not wish to be beholden to their publisher in any way. Rather than accepting the traditional publisher advance, they decided that they would fund the sequel entirely on their own out of the royalties of the first game. This meant that, as Myst blew up bigger and bigger, their ambitions for the game they intended to call Riven were inflated in tandem. They refused to give Brøderbund a firm release date; it will be done when it’s done, they said. They took to talking about Myst as their Hobbit, Riven as their Lord of the Rings. It had taken J.R.R. Tolkien seventeen years to bridge the gap between his children’s adventure story and the most important fantasy epic in modern literary history. Surely Brøderbund could accept having to wait just a few years for Riven, especially with the sales figures Myst was still putting up. Cyan’s digs reflected their rising status. They hadn’t even had a proper office when they were making Myst; everybody worked out of their separate homes in and around Spokane, Washington, sharing their output with one another using the “car net”: put it on a disk, get into your car, and drive it over to the other person. In the immediate aftermath of Myst’s release and promising early sales, they all piled into a drafty, unheated garage owned by their sound specialist Chris Brandkamp. Then, as the sales numbers continued to tick upward, they moved into an anonymous-looking former Comfort World Mattress storefront. Finally, in January of 1995, they broke ground on a grandiosely named “Cyan World Headquarters,” whose real-world architecture was to be modeled on the virtual architecture of Myst and Riven. While they were waiting for that building to be completed — the construction would take eighteen months — they junked the consumer-grade Macs which had slowly and laboriously done all of the 3D modeling necessary to create Myst’s environments in favor of Silicon Graphics workstations that cost $40,000 a pop. Cyan breaks ground on their new “world headquarters.” The completed building looked very much apiece with their games, both outside… …and inside. The machines that made Riven. Its imagery was rendered using $1 million worth of Silicon Graphics hardware: a dozen or so workstations connected to these four high-end servers that did the grunt work of the ray-tracing. It was a far cry from Myst, which had been made with ordinary consumer-grade Macs running off-the-shelf software. And the people who made Riven… There were attempts to drum up controversies in the press, especially after Riven missed a tentative Christmas 1996 target date which Brøderbund had (prematurely) announced, a delay that caused the publisher’s stock price to drop by 25 percent. The journalists who always seemed to be hovering around the perimeter of Cyan’s offices claimed to sniff trouble in the air, an aroma of overstretched budgets and creative tensions. But, although there were certainly arguments — what project of this magnitude doesn’t cause arguments? — there was in truth no juicy decadence or discord going on at Cyan. The Miller brothers, sons of a preacher and still devout Christians, never lost their Heartland groundedness. They never let their fluke success go to their heads in the way of, say, the minds behind Trilobyte of The 7th Guest fame, were never even seriously tempted to move their operation to some more glamorous city than Spokane. For them, it was all about the work. And luckily for them, plenty of people were more than willing to move to Spokane for a chance to work at The House That Myst Built, which by the end of 1995 had replaced Trilobyte as the most feted single games studio in the mainstream American press, the necessary contrast to all those other unscrupulous operators who were filling their games and the minds of the nation’s youth with indiscriminate sex and violence. The most important of all the people who were suddenly willing to come to Spokane would prove to be Richard Vander Wende, a former Disney production designer — his fingerprints were all over the recent film Aladdin — who first bumped into the Miller brothers at a Digital World Expo in Los Angeles. Wende’s conceptual contribution to Riven would be as massive as that of either of the Miller brothers, such that he would be given a richly deserved co-equal billing with them at the very top of the credits listing. Richard Vander Wende. Needless to say, though, there were many others who contributed as well. By the time Cyan moved into their new world headquarters in the summer of 1996, more than twenty people were actively working on Riven every day. The sequel would wind up costing ten times to fifteen times as much to make as its predecessor, filling five CDs to Myst’s lone silver platter. Given the Millers’ artistic temperament and given the rare privilege they enjoyed of being able to make exactly the game they wished to make, one might be tempted to assume that Riven was to be some radical departure from what had come before. In reality, though, this was not the case at all. Riven was to be Myst, only more so; call it Myst perfected. Once again you would be left to wander around inside a beautiful pre-rendered 3D environment, which you would view from a first-person perspective. And once again you would be expected to solve intricate puzzles there — or not, as you chose. Cyan had long since realized that players of Myst broke down into two broad categories. There were those they called the gamers, who engaged seriously with it as a series of logical challenges to be overcome through research, experimentation, and deduction. And then there was the other group of players — a far, far larger one, if we’re being honest — whom Cyan called the tourists, who just wanted to poke around a little inside the virtual world and take in some of the sights and sounds. These were folks like the residents of a retirement home who wrote to Cyan to say that they had been playing and enjoying Myst for two years and two months, and wanted to hear if the rumors that there were locations to explore beyond the first island — an island which constitutes about 20 percent of the full game — were in fact true. Riven was meant to cater to both groups, by giving the gamers a much deeper, richer, more complex tapestry of puzzles to unravel, whilst simultaneously being kept as deliberately “open” as possible in terms of its geography, so that you could see most of its locations without ever having to solve a single conundrum. “The two complaints about Myst,” said Rand Miller, “were that it was too hard and too easy. We’re trying to make Riven better for both kinds of players.” Whereas Myst allowed you to visit four separate “ages” — basically, alternative dimensions — after solving those early puzzles which had so stymied the retirees, Riven was to take place all in the same dimension, on a single archipelago of five islands. You would be able to travel between the islands right from the start, using vehicles whose operation should be quite straightforward even for the most puzzle-averse players. If all you wanted to do was wander around the world of Riven, it would give you a lot more spaces in which to do so than Myst. Of course, while the world of Riven was slowly coming together, the real world wasn’t sitting still. Myst had been followed by an inevitable flood of “Myst clones” from other publishers and studios, which, in lieu of a proper sequel from Cyan, did their best to pick up the slack by offering up their own deserted, 3D-rendered environments to explore. Few of them were more than modestly successful; Activision’s Zork Nemesis, which may have done the best of them all, sold about 450,000 copies, an order of magnitude and a half less than the final numbers that Myst would put up. Meanwhile the genre of adventure games in general had peaked in the immediate aftermath of Myst and would be well into an increasingly precipitous decline by the time Riven shipped in October of 1997. The Last Express, the only other adventure that Brøderbund published that year, stiffed badly in the spring, despite sporting prominently on its box the name of Jordan Mechner, one of the few videogame auteurs with a reputation to rival that of the Miller brothers. Yet Cyan’s own games still seemed weirdly proof against the marketplace pressures that were driving so many other game makers in the direction of real-time strategy and first-person shooters. In June of 1997, the nearly four-year-old Myst was propelled back to the top of the sales charts by the excitement over the approaching debut of Riven. And when it did appear, Riven didn’t disappoint the bean counters. It and Myst tag-teamed one another in the top two chart positions right through the Christmas buying season. Myst would return to number one a few more times in the course of 1998, while an entire industry continued to scratch its collective head, wondering why this particular game — a game that was now approaching its fifth birthday, making it roughly as aged as the plays of Shakespeare as the industry reckoned time — should continue to sell in such numbers. Even today, it’s hard to say precisely why Myst just kept selling and selling, defying all the usual gravities of its market. It seems that non-violent, non-hardcore gaming simply needed a standard bearer, and so it found one for itself. Riven wasn’t quite as successful as Myst, but this doesn’t mean it didn’t do very well indeed by all of the standard metrics. Its biggest failing in comparison to its older sibling was ironically its very cutting-edge nature; whereas just about any computer that was capable of running other everyday software could run Myst by 1997, you needed a fairly recent, powerful machine to run Riven. Despite this, and despite the usual skepticism from the hardcore-gaming press — “With its familiar, lever-yanking gameplay, Riven emerges as the ultimate Myst clone,” scoffed Computer Gaming World magazine — Riven’s sales surpassed 1 million units in its first year, numbers of which any other adventure game could scarcely have dreamed.[1]An article in the May 17 2001 edition of the Los Angeles Times claimed that Riven had sold 4.5 million copies by that point, three and a half years after its release. This number has since been repeated in numerous places, including Wikipedia. I’ll eat my hat if it’s correct; this game would have left a much wider vapor trail behind it if it was. Read in context in the original article, the figure actually comes across as a typo. Riven was a huge hit by any conventional standard, but it didn’t have the legs of Myst. Already for long stretches during 1998, it was once again being comfortably outsold by Myst. Lifetime retail sales of around 1.5 million strike me as the most likely figure — still more than enough to place Riven in the upper echelon of late 1990s computer games. Fans and boosters of the genre naturally wanted to see a broader trend in Riven’s sales, a proof that adventures in general could still bring home the bacon with the best of them. The hard truth that the games of Cyan were always uniquely uncoupled from what was going on around them was never harder to accept than in this case. In the end, though, Riven would have no impact whatsoever on the overall trajectory of the adventure genre. Because Riven is a sequel in such a pure sense — a game that aims to do exactly what its predecessor did, only bigger and better — your reaction to it is doomed to be dictated to a large extent by your reaction to said predecessor. It’s almost impossible for me to imagine anyone liking or loving Riven who didn’t at least like Myst. The defining quality of both games is their thoroughgoing sense of restraint. When Myst first started to attract sales and attention, naysayers saw its minimalism through the lens of technical affordance, or rather the Miller brothers’ lack thereof: having only off-the-shelf middleware like HyperCard to work with, lacking the skill set that might have let them create better tools of their own, they just had to do the best they could with what they had. In this reading, Myst‘s static world, its almost nonexistent user interface, its lack of even such niceties as a player inventory, stemmed not so much from aesthetic intent as from the fact that it had been created with a hypertext editor that had never been meant for making games. The alternative reading is that the Miller brothers were among the few game developers who knew the value of restraint from the start, that they were by nature and inclination minimalists in an industry inclined to maximalism in all things, and this quality was their greatest strength rather than a weakness. The truth probably lies somewhere between the two extremes, as it usually does. Regardless, there’s no denying that the brothers leaned hard into the same spirit of minimalism that had defined Myst when the time came to make Riven, even though they were now no longer technologically constrained into doing so. One camp reads this as a colossal failure of vision; the other reads it as merely staying true to the unique vision that had gotten them this far. While I don’t want to plant myself too firmly in either corner, I must say that I am surprised by some of the things that Cyan didn’t do with twice the time and ten or fifteen times the budget. The fact that Riven still relies on static, pre-rendered scenery and node-based movement isn’t the source of my surprise; that compromise was necessary in order to achieve the visual fidelity that Cyan demanded. I’m rather surprised by how little Cyan innovated even within that basic framework. Well before Riven appeared, the makers of other Myst successors had begun to experiment with ways of creating a slightly more fluid, natural-feeling experience. Zork Nemesis, for example, stores each of its nodes as a 360-degree panorama instead of a set of fixed views, letting you smoothly turn in place through a complete circle. Riven, by contrast, confines its innovations in this area to displaying a little transition animation as you rotate between its rigidly fixed views. As a result, switching from view to view does become a little less jarring than it is in Myst, but the approach is far from even the Myst-clone state of the art. Cyan was likewise disinterested in pursuing other solutions that would have been even easier to implement than panning rotation, but that could have made their game less awkward to play. The extent of your rotation when you click on the left or right side of the screen remains inconsistent, just as it was in Myst; sometimes it’s 90 degrees, sometimes it’s less or more. This can make simple navigation much more confusing than it needs to be, introducing a layer of fake difficulty — i.e., difficulties that you would not have if you were really in this world — which seems at odd with Cyan’s stated determination to create as immersive an experience as possible. Even a compass with which to tell which way you’re facing at any given time would have helped enormously, but no such concessions to player convenience are to hand. Again, these are solutions that the other makers of Myst clones — not a group overly celebrated for its spirit of innovation — had long since deployed. Cyan was always a strangely self-contained entity, showing little awareness of what others were doing around them, making a virtue of their complete ignorance of the competition. In cases like these, it was perhaps not so much a virtue as a failure of simple due diligence. Building upon the work of others is the way that gaming as a whole progresses. When it comes to storytelling as well, Riven’s differences from Myst are more a matter of execution than kind. As in Myst, there is very little story at all here, if by that we mean a foreground plot driving things along. A brief bit of exposition at the beginning picks up right where Myst ended, providing an excuse for dumping you into another open-ended environment. Whereas Myst took place entirely in deserted ages, here you’re ostensibly surrounded by the Rivenese, the vaguely Native-American-like inhabitants of the archipelago. Rather conveniently for Cyan, however, the Rivenese are terrified of strangers, and scurry away into hiding whenever you enter a scene. The few named characters you meet, including the principal villain, are likewise forever just leaving when you come upon them, or showing up, giving speeches, and then going away again before you can interact with them. By 1997, this sort of thing was feeling more tired than clever. Rand Miller, returning in the role of the patriarch Atrus from Myst, gives you your marching orders and sends you on your way in the introductory movie. Riven makes more extensive use of such scenes involving real actors than Myst, but it’s done well, and never overdone. The end result is about as un-cheesy as these techniques can possibly look to modern eyes. The real story, in both Myst and Riven, is the backstory that caused these spaces to become the places they are, a backstory which you uncover as you explore them. And in this area, I’m happy to say, Riven actually does outdo its predecessor. Almost everything there is to find out about how the ages of Myst became as they are is conveyed in one astonishingly clumsy infodump, a set of books which you find in a library on that first island after solving the first couple of puzzles. These stop your progress dead for an hour or so as you read through them, after which you’re back to exploring, never to be troubled by much of any exposition again. By the time of Riven, however, the Miller brothers had learned about the existence of something called dramatic pacing. Here, too, most of the real story comes in the form of books and journals, but these are scattered around the islands, providing an enticement to solve puzzles in order to acquire and read them. The Myst “universe” grew considerably in depth and coherency between Myst and Riven, thanks to a trilogy of novels written by the British science-fiction author David Wingrove in close collaboration with the Miller brothers during that interim. In Riven, then, you get some of the same sense that you get in The Lord of the Rings, that you are only scraping the surface of a world that goes much deeper than its foreground sights and sounds. “The Lord of the Rings is so satisfying because of the details,” said Rand Miller at the time. “You get the feeling that the world you’re reading about is real. Different but real. That’s how we go about designing.” Like Tolkien, the Miller brothers went so far as to make up the beginnings at least of a coherent language for their land’s inhabitants. This sense of established lore, combined with the improved pacing and better writing, makes Riven’s backstory more compelling than that of Myst, makes uncovering more of it feel like a worthwhile goal in itself. Instead of providing a mere excuse for the gameplay, as in Myst, Riven’s backstory comes to fuel its gameplay to a large extent. And this starts to take us into the territory of the first of the two things that Riven does really, really well, does so well in fact that you might just be willing to discount all of the failings I’ve been belaboring up to this point. The archipelago is a truly intriguing, even awe-inspiring place to explore, thank not just to the cutting-edge 3D-rendering technology that was used to bring it to life, but — and even more so — the thought that went into the place. Riven makes its priorities clear from the beginning, when it asks you to set up your screen and your speakers to provide the immersive audiovisual experience it intends for you to have. The adjective “surreal” seems unavoidable when discussing Myst, so much so that Brøderbund built it right into their advertising tagline. (“The Surrealistic Adventure That Will Become Your World.”) Looking back on it now, though, I realize that the surrealism of Myst was as much a product of process as intention. The 3D-modeling software that was used to create the scenery of Myst couldn’t render genuinely realistic scenes; everything it churned out was too geometrical, too stiff, too uniform in color to look in any sense real. The result was surrealism, that forlorn, otherworldly, even vaguely disturbing stripe of beauty that became the hallmark of Myst and its many imitators. But I would not call Riven surreal. The improved technology that enabled it, on both the rendering side — meaning all those Silicon Graphics servers and workstations, with their complex ray-tracing algorithms — and the consumer-facing side — meaning the latest home computers, with their capability of displaying millions of nuanced shades of color onscreen at once — led to a more believable world. The key to it all is in the textures, the patterns that are overlaid onto the frame of a 3D model in lieu of blocks of solid color to make it look like a real object made out of wood, metal, or dirt. Cyan traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to capture thousands of textures. The same visual qualities that led to that state being dubbed the “Land of Enchantment” and drew artists like Georgia O’Keeffe to its high deserts suffuses the game, from the pueblo walls of the Rivenese homes to the pebbly cliff-side paths, from an old iron tower rusting in the sun to the ragged vegetation huddling around it. You can almost feel the sun on your back and the sweat on your skin. My wife and I are inveterate hikers these days, planning most of our holidays around where we can get out and walk. Riven made me want to climb through the screen and roam its landscapes for myself. Myst has its charms, but they are nothing like this. When I compare the two games, I think about what a revelation the battered, weathered world of Tatooine was when Star Wars hit cinemas in 1977, how at odds it was with the antiseptic sleekness of the science-fiction films that preceded it. Riven is almost as much of a revelation when set beside Myst and its many clones. The visuals both feed and are fed by the backstory and the world-building. The islands are replete with little details that have nothing to do with solving the game, that exist simply as natural, necessary parts of this place you’re exploring. In a perceptive video essay, YouTube creator VZedshows notes how “the lived-in world of Riven lets us look at a house and say, ‘Okay, that’s a house.’ And that’s it. A totally different thought than seeing a log cabin on Myst Island and saying, ‘Okay, that’s a house. But what is it for?’ The puzzles in Riven melt into the world around them.” Which brings us neatly to the other thing that Riven does remarkably well, the one aimed at the gamers rather than the tourists. Quite simply, Riven is one of the most elegantly sophisticated puzzle games ever created. This facet of it is not for everyone. (I’m not even sure it’s for me, about which more in a moment.) But it does what it sets out to do uncompromisingly well. Riven is a puzzle game that doesn’t feel like a puzzle game. It rather feels like you really have been dropped onto this archipelago, with its foreign civilization and all of its foreign artifacts, and then left to your own devices to make sense of it all. Many of Riven’s puzzles are as much anthropological as mechanical. For example, you have to learn to translate the different symbols of a foreign number system. This is undoubtedly more realistic than the ages of Myst, whose puzzles stand out from their environs so plainly that they might as well be circled with a bright red Sharpie. But does it lead to a better game? As usual, the answer is in the eye of the beholder. Ironically, almost everything that can be said about Riven’s puzzles can be cast as either a positive or a negative. If you’re looking for an adventure game that’s nails-hard and yet scrupulously fair — a combination that’s rarer than it ought to be — Riven will not disappoint you. If not, however, it will put you right off just as soon as you grow bored with idle wandering and begin to ask yourself what the game expects you to actually be doing. Myst was widely perceived in the 1990s as being more difficult than it really was; Riven, by contrast, well and truly earns its reputation. Each of Myst’s ages is a little game unto itself when it comes to its puzzles; you never need to use tools or information from one age to overcome a problem in another one. For better or for worse, Riven is not like that — not at all. Puzzles and clues are scattered willy-nilly all over the five islands; you might be expected to connect a symbol you’re looking at now to a gadget you last poked at hours and hours ago. Careful, copious note-taking is the only practical way to proceed. I daresay you might end up spending more time poring over your real-world journal, looking for ways to combine and thereby to make sense of the data therein, than you do looking at the monitor screen. Because most of the geography is open to you from the very beginning — this is arguably Riven’s one real concession to the needs of the marketplace, being the one that allows it to cater to the tourists as well as the gamers — there isn’t the gated progress you get in so many other puzzly adventure games, with new areas and new problems being introduced gradually as you solve the earlier ones. No, Riven throws it all at you from the start, in one big lump. You just have to keep plugging away at it when even your apparently successful deductions don’t seem to be yielding much in the way of concrete rewards, trusting that it will all come together in one big whoosh at the end. All of which is to say that Riven is a slow game, the polar opposite of the instant gratification that defines the videogame medium in the eyes of so many. There are few shortcuts for moving through its sprawling, fragmented geography — something you’ll need to do a lot of, thanks to its refusal to contain its puzzles within smaller areas as Myst does. Just double-checking some observation you think you made earlier or confirming that some effect took place as expected represents a significant investment in time. Back in the day, when everyone was playing directly from CD, Riven was even slower than it is today, requiring you to swap discs every time you traveled to a different island.[2]Some months after its original release, Riven became one of the first games ever to be made available on DVD-ROM. No game benefited more from the switch in storage technology; not only were DVD drives faster than CD drives, but a single DVD disc was capacious enough to contain the whole of Riven. In his vintage 1997 review, Andrew Plotkin — a fellow who is without a doubt much, much smarter than I am, at least when it comes to stuff like this — said that he was able to solve Riven in about twenty hours, using just one hint. It will probably take more mortal intelligences some multiple of one or both of those figures. Your reaction to Riven when approached in “gamer” mode will depend on whether you think this kind of intensive intellectual challenge is fun or not, as well as whether you have the excess intellectual and temporal bandwidth in your current life to go all-in on such a major undertaking. I must sheepishly confess that my answer to the first question is more prevaricating than definitive, while my answer to the second one is a pretty solid no. In the abstract, I do understand the appeal of what Riven is offering, understand how awesome it must feel to put all of these disparate pieces together without help. Nevertheless, when I approached the game for this article, I couldn’t quite find the motivation to persevere down that road. Riven wants you to work a little harder for your fun than the current version of myself is willing to do. I don’t futz around with my notebook too long before I start looking out the window and thinking about how nice it would be to take a walk in real nature. I take enough notes doing research for the articles I write; I’m not sure I want to do so much research inside a game. Prompted partially by my experience with Riven, I’ve been musing a fair amount lately about the way we receive games, and especially how the commentary you read on this site and others similar to it can be out of step with the way the games in question existed for their players in their heyday. I’m subject to the tyranny of my editorial calendar, to the need to just finish things, one way or another, and move on. Riven is not well-suited to such a mindset. In my travels around the Internet, I’ve noticed that those who remember the game most fondly often took months or years to finish it, or never finished it at all. It existed for them as a tempting curiosity, to be picked up from time to time and poked at, just to see if a little more progress was possible here or there, or whether the brainstorm that came to them unbidden while driving home from work that day might bear some sort of fruit. It’s an open question whether even folks who don’t have an editorial schedule to keep can recapture that mindset here and now, in the third decade (!) of the 21st century, when more entertainment of every conceivable type than any of us could possibly consume in a lifetime is constantly luring us away from any such hard nut as Riven. As of this writing, Cyan is preparing a remake of Riven. It will be interesting to see what concessions, if any, they chose to make to our new reality. Even in the late 1990s, there was the palpable sense that Riven represented the end of an era, that even Cyan would not be able to catch lightning in a bottle a third time with yet another cerebral, contemplative, zeitgeist-stamping single-player puzzle game. Both Richard Vander Wende and Robyn Miller quit the company as soon as the obligatory rounds of promotional interviews had been completed, leaving the Myst franchise’s future solely in the hands of Rand Miller. Robyn’s stated reason for departing brings to the fore some of the frustrations I have with Cyan’s work. He said that he was most interested in telling stories, and had concluded that computer games just weren’t any good at that: “I felt like, you know what? It’s not working. This whole story thing is not happening, and one of the reasons it’s not happening is because of the medium. It’s not what this medium is good at.” So, he said, he wanted to work in film instead. The obvious response is that Cyan had never actually tried to tell an engaging foreground story, had rather been content to leave you always picking up the breadcrumbs of backstory. Cyan’s stubborn conservatism in terms of form and their slightly snooty insistence on living in their own hermetically sealed bubble, blissfully unaware of the innovations going on around them in their industry in both storytelling and other aspects of game making, strike me as this unquestionably talented group’s least attractive qualities by far. When asked once what his favorite games were, Richard Vander Wende said he didn’t have any: “Robyn and I are not really interested in games of any kind. We’re more interested in building worlds. To us, Myst and Riven are not ‘games’ at all.” Such scare-quoted condescension does no one any favors. Then again, that’s only one way of looking at it. Another way is to recognize that Riven is exactly the game — okay, if you like, the world — that its creators wanted to make. It’s worth acknowledging, even celebrating, as the brave artistic statement it is. Love it or hate it, Riven knows what it wants to be, and succeeds in being exactly that — no more, no less. Rather than The Lord of the Rings, call it the Ulysses of gaming: a daunting creation by any standard, but one that can be very rewarding to those willing and able to meet it where it lives. That a game like this outsold dozens of its more visceral, immediate rivals on the store shelves of the late 1990s is surely one of the wonders of the age. Did you enjoy this article? If so, please think about pitching in to help me make many more like it. You can pledge any amount you like.

Online sources include GameSpot’s old preview of Riven, Salon’s profile of the Miller brothers on the occasion of Robyn’s departure from Cyan, VZedshows’s video essay on Myst and Riven, and Andrew Plotkin’s old review of Riven. The original version of Riven is currently available as a digital purchase on GOG.com. As noted in the article above, a remake is in the works at Cyan. Footnotes Footnotes ↑1 An article in the May 17 2001 edition of the Los Angeles Times claimed that Riven had sold 4.5 million copies by that point, three and a half years after its release. This number has since been repeated in numerous places, including Wikipedia. I’ll eat my hat if it’s correct; this game would have left a much wider vapor trail behind it if it was. Read in context in the original article, the figure actually comes across as a typo. Riven was a huge hit by any conventional standard, but it didn’t have the legs of Myst. Already for long stretches during 1998, it was once again being comfortably outsold by Myst. Lifetime retail sales of around 1.5 million strike me as the most likely figure — still more than enough to place Riven in the upper echelon of late 1990s computer games. ↑2 Some months after its original release, Riven became one of the first games ever to be made available on DVD-ROM. No game benefited more from the switch in storage technology; not only were DVD drives faster than CD drives, but a single DVD disc was capacious enough to contain the whole of Riven. previous post This Week on The Analog Antiquarian 32 responses LeeH May 17, 2024 I was lucky enough to be able to visit the Cyan offices a few years back for work, and they’re still in that same building tucked away in the forest. It’s an absolutely stunning location, and once you step back from the parking lot and the pine trees close in, it really does look like you’re lost on the island.

They’re the Rivenese, the indigenous inhabitants of Riven. The D’ni are the mysterious, mostly off-stage book-wizards. The only D’ni left at this point in the story are Gehn and Atrus. (Atrus’s wife Catherine is Rivenese; it’s a mixed marriage.) Reply Jimmy Maher May 17, 2024 Oops, indeed. ;) Thanks! Reply Andrew Plotkin May 17, 2024 …Similarly, those are Rivenese huts, Rivenese children, etc. The D’ni technology in the world is all Gehn’s imports, meant to contrast with the pastoral Rivenese culture. Gehn’s position in the narrative is as a one-man colonial power. And now that I’ve finished reading… (yes, I had to fast-comment just to point out the terminology error! Sorry.) I appreciate the compliments! Mind you, I have no idea how much of my Riven experience was powered by brains and how much by sheer cussed stubbornness. I guess when this year’s remake comes out, we’ll find out. I haven’t revisited Riven since 1997, beyond an occasional brief stroll through the introduction. I _sort of_ remember the puzzles, but I bet not as well as I think I do. I too visited the Cyan office (in 2019), and it really is an experience and a half. > It will be interesting to see what concessions, if any, they chose to make to our new reality. Cyan’s strategy for the 2020 Myst remake was pretty simple: keep the layout, pacing, and puzzles exactly the same. The world was slightly modified to make VR support easier — some objects on the floor were moved up to a more convenient height, for example. But the intent was to change as little as possible of the game experience. I am sure that the Riven remake will be the same deal. You’ll probably be able to peer around some new corners. But rethinking the overall design to be faster or more accessible? Not gonna happen. Reply PS_Garak May 17, 2024 One of the big pieces of the Riven remaster announcement is that they’re making a VR version of it (similar to Myst, which also got one). That sounds extremely cool – it will be neat to wander around those gorgeous vistas in full VR – but at the same time I wonder (and maybe they solved this with the Myst release, I didn’t play it) how the absolutely necessary notetaking will be possible with a bulky headset on. Reply Andrew Plotkin May 17, 2024 Sorry, this comment got long enough that I’ve split it up… > [Rand Miller] would manage it in a more cautious, budget-conscious way going forward, with one eye perpetually looking back to what had been rather than forward to what was still to come. Here I must correct you on a deeper matter. Cyan’s post-Riven plan was *anything but* cautious and budget-conscious! They looked at the traditional adventure-game market — which as you said, was on the downturn — and decided to swing for the fences. Thus the plan originally called DIRT, for “D’ni In Real Time”: a fully 3D, online, *multiplayer* Myst game. The release of RealMyst was meant to keep the money flowing for DIRT, but it was also a technology test of Cyan’s newly-acquired 3D engine. It was never meant to be an end in itself. DIRT (later MUDPIE, later Uru or Myst Online) wound up consuming all of Riven’s profits and was hungry for more. To keep the lights on, Cyan had to go to a publisher after all. They also franchised out their world to other studios (Myst 3 to Presto and Myst 4 to Ubisoft). Unfortunately, that left Cyan in exactly the position they didn’t want: with an investor (Ubisoft) pulling the strings. It worked out poorly. You can read plenty of accounts of Myst Online’s sputtering launch. But the upshot is that Rand Miller’s post-Riven vision was enormously ambitious; it flopped; it very nearly took the company down with it. At one point in 2005 Cyan was down to zero employees and an empty (albeit fully paid-off) fancy office. Reply Jimmy Maher May 17, 2024 Thanks again! I decided to excise that part entirely. We can leave that for the next chapter in the story. Reply Keith May 17, 2024 > I’m note sure I want to do so much research inside a game. not sure I really like the surprises of what subjects you choose to drive your history forward. While I played and enjoyed Riven back in the day, I never finished it or thought much about it thereafter. I never thought I’d find myself reading such an interesting article about its role in the history of video games and IF. Reply Jimmy Maher May 17, 2024 Thanks! Reply Taras May 17, 2024 At last, my favorite adventure game! I did stop reading halfway through to come and comment on the D’ni error and saw that Andrew Plotkin was already way ahead of me. I do think that, for all of the nice things that you had to say about the world of Riven, you’re still somewhat underselling it and I think the error is telling, as it erases the central conflict of the game. Riven is a landscape shaped by colonialism and every little detail speaks to the way Ghen projects his power. [Spoilers follow.] One of my favorite examples is the toy in the schoolhouse which teaches you some of the D’ni letters; not only is it a teaching tool intended to teach the colonizer’s numbering system to the colonial subjects, but it’s also a tool of subjugation in another way, as it’s themed after a Whark– a species of giant predatory fish found in the lake below the Rivenese village. The Whark seems to have had a significant, possibly religious role in Rivenese culture before Ghen’s arrival and he’s taken advantage of it, creating an association between himself and the fish. Once presumably more plentiful, Ghen has hunted these creatures to near-extinction and uses their tusks decoratively as symbols of his power throughout the island. He’s also constructed a strange structure above the lake where the Whark lives and through careful attention to the world you come to realize that it’s a sacrificial platform that Ghen uses to execute Rivenese who get out of line, lowering them into the water to get eaten by the Whark. The educational toy in the schoolhouse is a representation of this brutal execution method, reminding the Rivenese children what fate awaits them and their fellow villagers if they disobey Ghen’s authority. [Spoilers end.] None of this information is in the journals and can only be gleaned from various environmental details in disparate parts of Riven. It’s this sort of detail that you begin to notice while spending time wandering around, not making any direct progress in solving Riven’s two big puzzles. Certainly environmental storytelling is nothing new at this point in video game history, but this seems like some particularly sophisticated stuff to me, certainly an advance in state of the art of this (admittedly static) branch of video game storytelling. What you say about Riven being a demanding game is certainly true, and I definitely recognize it as not being for everyone. However, as I hope my example illustrates, Riven offers a lot of richness in return for its demands. I think the reason I have such a love for this game is that it really inspired me to start paying more attention to the world, to look at it with the same eye that Riven requires of its players. It’s one of the games that has most enriched my time spent away from the computer. Reply Derek May 17, 2024 I endorse everything Taras has said. For more about the incredible depth of worldbuilding in Riven, I highly recommend Ivy Allie’s essay about it (one of a series of posts called Myst in Retrospect): http://ivyallie.com/myst/riven/ Reply Mark Williams May 17, 2024 “It’s almost impossible for me to imagine anyone liking or loving Riven who didn’t at least like Myst.” Well, I beg to differ. I adore Riven, played it late into the night with headphones on and was equally beguiled by its ambience and it’s puzzles. I was utterly indifferent to Myst, finding it tedious and cold. Reply James Schend May 17, 2024 Just a quick note, the original purpose of HyperCard wasn’t to do presentations of any stripe, but it was virtual card file database application– think of uses like address books, recipe cards, basically any application where you’d use a physical Rolodex before you bought your expensive Macintosh. Believe it or not, it’s actually closer to something like Microsoft Access or FileMaker than to, for example, Macromedia Flash or even PowerPoint. Reply Jimmy Maher May 17, 2024 Yeah, that probably wasn’t a great way to describe it, although it was used to create presentations on occasion. Thanks! Reply Andrew Pam May 17, 2024 “I’m note sure I want to do so much research” – you wrote “note” so many times in the preceding sentences that your “not” picked up an extra “e” here. :) Reply Andrew Pam May 17, 2024 I see I should have reloaded the comments before posting! Keith beat me to it. Reply John May 17, 2024 The thing that amuses me about Riven is that it almost always called Riven: the Sequel to Myst. How very awkward, yet how very sensible! How many of the people who bought Myst, most of whom probably did not follow the gaming press, would have been able to identify Riven as the sequel to Myst if it weren’t explicitly called that? I don’t know why they didn’t just call it Myst II or Myst II: Riven though. Perhaps they thought that The Sequel to Myst was more elegant. Reply Jimmy Maher May 17, 2024 I think you hit the nail on the head. Brøderbund always marketed Myst as something a bit more high-brow than you typical computer game, more like an art film than a blockbuster (albeit an art film that sold like a blockbuster in this case). A Roman numeral just didn’t fit that image. Reply Martin May 17, 2024 My wife and I played Myst many years ago and got through it quite quickly. We have Riven, along with the three titles that succeeded it sitting up on the shelf waiting to be played. It looks like it is the 5 CD version. Is there any hack that will allow me to load them onto the computer and avoid all the disk swapping? In your opinion, are all the puzzles fair? Is it realistic to compete it without hints? My wife and I think very differently so maybe there’s hope if the puzzles are fair. Reply Marco May 17, 2024 There are two big puzzles – the animals puzzle and the domes puzzles – then a handful of small ones. With the two big ones, they are relatively straightforward once you understand what you’re meant to be doing. Though I’d say that while the domes puzzle is very fair, the animals puzzle has some annoying fake difficulty, with the symbols being too similar to each other and some pixel-hunt hidden. The truly difficult part is getting on the right track for what you’re meant to be doing in the first place, which is pretty unlikely unless you have a really good feel for how the designers were thinking. Reply dusoft May 17, 2024 You can make images from the CDs to be stored on a harddrive and then have a virtual CD-ROM that can switch images easily. Reply Torbjörn Andersson May 18, 2024 I used ScummVM to play it, using the instructions from here: https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Riven:_The_Sequel_to_Myst Since that’s a re-implementation (rather than an exact emulation) of the original, I don’t know how faithful it is. But the only issue I noticed was a minor stutter in some looping movies when using the data files from the DVD version of the game, so it was certainly good enough for me. Reply Mark Williams May 18, 2024 There is also an iOS version. I replayed it on my iPad. Reply Petter Sjölund May 19, 2024 >But the only issue I noticed was a minor stutter in some looping movies when using the data files from the DVD version of the game, That glitch is actually faithful to the original. I clearly remember some movies stuttering when I played the CD version on my Mac back in the day. Reply Jimmy Maher May 18, 2024 As noted, ScummVM is your best bet for making use of your original CDs. But note as well that the Steam version is well under $10. I of course don’t know your economic situation, but it may be worth it to you just to buy that and have something guaranteed to Just Work with no futzing about. Reply Krsto May 18, 2024 There is also a GOG version which is now on sale (currently 2,39 €) and DRM-free. Btw, Jimmy, I’m little puzzled that you also didn’t mention that version in the links under the article? Anyway, thanks for another great article, while Myst and Myst-clones were never my cup of tea, but after reading this, I’m little tempted to risk it and try Riven. Reply Jimmy Maher May 18, 2024 Ah, I didn’t see that. It was buried under a bunch of iterations of something called Vagrus: The Riven Realm. I do usually favor GOG.com because they’re a bit less intrusive than Steam. I switched the link. Thanks! And yeah, for anyone reading who is Riven-curious… it’s available there for just a few bucks right now. Reply Marco May 17, 2024 You rightly pick up about the photorealism. Quite astonishingly for a game from 1997, it still stands out today, whereas the graphics in most later games, including the later Myst games, have a plasticky quality. The depth of the aesthetics is worth dwelling on. Everything that’s there has a story behind it, whether it’s to do with the tyrant and his vain attempts to prevent the world from collapsing on itself, or to do with the rebels trying to unlock his power, or the indigenous history of these people who have built up their own language, numbering system, religion and way of life. Whereas in every other game, objects are just plonked down to create an artificial puzzle (what, another pile of crates, Broken Sword 3?) or because they look atmospheric. All that said, I think there’s just a bit too much frustration in the game, where you get the gist of the puzzle but can’t sift the clues from things that look like clues but aren’t, meaning you either have to go to a walkthrough or find yourself walking round and round to the point of losing interest. One other note: the child in the forest is, however unintentionally, probably the biggest jump scare in all adventure gaming. Reply Gnoman May 17, 2024 “Needless to say, though, were many others who contributed as well. By the time Cyan moved into their new world headquarters in the summer of 1996, more than twenty people were actively working on Riven every day.” The first sentence here looks as if it were garbled in editing. Maybe remove “were” and “who”? Myst and Riven are long-standing entries on my “I should get around to playing this” list. When I tried the first game long ago, I couldn’t even find the puzzles on the island. Reply Jimmy Maher May 18, 2024 Thanks! Reply Phil May 18, 2024 You wrote of Atrud as the “good brother”, but if I recall correctly, wasn’t Atrus the father of the two brothers?

They still thought it was cool as hell and hung it up on the wall. It was only after MythBusters started airing that they found out it was Adam's work, because he mentioned it in an interview.

There's a period of time between the nineties and mid 2000s when ubiquitous and fast internet access wasn't easily accessible, and so games like Myst and Riven had the space and time to be digested and savoured.

I've been to their offices a few times, just to nerd out with some of the devs and play random open source FPS games (the name escapes me). Their offices are really cool, they've got a lot of physical stuff from the games in various display cases around the entrance. It's... weird to visit, though, because they're like the high school quarterbacks we all know. They had some great years when they were younger, but they're continuously trying to relive those glory days while yelling from the bar stool about that one time they threw the game winning pass. Most of their cash comes from remakes or ports of Myst/Riven, and half the time they aren't even the ones making the damn ports (third parties have paid them for the rights to do it, if you buy Myst on GoG then you got a version that was ported by GoG themselves). They recently put out Obduction, which on paper seems to be a commercial failure (though I haven't sold seven figures worth of games so who am I to say), raking in like $5M total. Saving the fact that there are just a handful of dudes left at the studio... I don't know, it feels like the oft referenced online version of Cyan (which again, is 30 years old now) and their current reality are completely divergent. I have some nostalgia for getting trapped in a book in Myst and feeling that fury, but I also struggle to see how they're relevant in today's gaming landscape. It feels like if Super Mario Bros was a one hit wonder, would we still be getting this pumped about crushing turtles three decades later? reply pavlov 2 hours agoparentTo me, it sounds similar to a once popular band who still make records together. Maybe their style is progressive rock and they had one hit that still plays enough to keep the royalties flowing [1]. Decades later, audiences have mostly forgotten about prog rock, but does that mean the band should abandon what they know and enjoy, just to maybe try making a Rihanna-inspired album instead? Nobody wants that either. It sounds like a chill lifestyle to be honest, doing what you love on your own pace, sometimes delivering something new to a dwindling but dedicated audience. Degrowth is anathema to start-up culture but it might be good for the aging human mind. - - [1] A lot of people who have never actively listened to prog rock could hum “Eye in the Sky…” reply SheepSlapper 2 hours agorootparentYou're completely right, and if the shoe was on the other foot I'd probably do the same. I'd be happy to be a one hit wonder if it paid the bills and let me keep on rocking in the free world. But at the same time, Norman Greenbaum doesn't release a new version of Spirit in the Sky every few years expecting to get a pat on the head. In fact, that'd be an insane choice to make. Cyan is making their new albums, but they're also releasing Myst[club-remix].mp3 and Riven[feat-shiny-bs].mp3 on a regular schedule, and part of you has to wonder when it's ok to embrace the one hit and maybe quit beating the dead horse (apparently there's money in the horse, instead of organs and horse meat, so they CAN beat it but why?) reply pavlov 1 hour agorootparentOld artists certainly do that kind of thing. Let’s take somebody I actually really respect, the Pet Shop Boys. (They’re practically a one-hit wonder in America but had numerous hit records in Europe.) Within the past month, PSB has released a new album “Nonetheless” to favorable reviews, but they also released an EP called “Furthermore” with completely new recordings of some of their best-known hits. Recently they also collaborated with British post-punk group Sleaford Mods on a cover and remix of “West End Girls.” There’s an audience who enjoys all this. Why shouldn’t they both put out new material and work with others to rejuvenate the old? For someone who never liked their brand of melancholy synthpop, it’s beating a dead horse.

I'll call you out as a hack for doing it, but if someone out there enjoys it then more power to them. Personally I think that if Nintendo eschewed new games, and kept releasing the original Super Mario Brothers (a beloved game from almost four decades ago) bit-for-bit on other devices, maybe with better graphics, they'd be irrelevant idiots today. Sure, there's SOME market for that, but what's much cooler is making new stuff that holds up in the current year. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, but porting code from 30 years ago to my smart fridge with upgraded graphics is a poor use of it (this is barely hyperbole for the franchise, which says a lot). That all being said, I know the Cyan offices haven't collapsed into rubble so they're still doing OK (though their workforce is TINY now, compared to 'back when'). And if that's what floats their boat, great. I'd rather suck start my shotgun than release the same software for 30 years (same as in verbatim, no less, someone else is porting it to modern stacks) but to each their own... reply pavlov 43 minutes agorootparentBut Cyan does release new games with no connection to the Myst IP. And Nintendo has re-released the original Super Mario Bros on different platforms over the years. reply ido 3 hours agoparentprevThe sad truth is that capturing lightning in a bottle is exceedingly rare, let alone twice or more. Cyan made at least 2 massive hits, which is 2 more than almost all game studios manage. Even their contemporaries Id Software didn't make that many more hits (Quake 3 was their last outright hit, releasing only 2 years after Riven). There are almost no Bethesdas/Blizzards/etc that continue releasing hits for decades at a time. reply SheepSlapper 2 hours agorootparentFair point, and I sort of understand the nostalgia that's involved. A large part of my disappointment probably comes from the fact that the endless remakes never quite live up to the hype. I was a big Diablo 2 fiend, it was one of my formative online games. So a few years ago there are rumblings about D2 Remastered, and I'm obviously pumped. Come launch day, Blizzard has my money and I'm deep into the thing I used to love, but it's just... meh. There was a time and place that made the original D2 fantastic, but it turns out that's not here and now. I feel the same thing for Myst/Riven, they were SO GOOD but who actually gives a shit about doing the same thing again with better graphics? I can't write off the fact that those dudes made a few great games, and that's a crazy accomplishment. I think Myst is the first \"real\" PC game my family ever bought, and I still remember my mom staying up late at night to click around the world and figure out what the hell was happening. She wrote notes on those yellow legal pads, reminding her of lore and other important shit. But the lightning in a bottle thing works both ways, and that lightning is basically static electricity in todays world :P To borrow your example, id software didn't release the same version of DOOM 30 years later, we got DOOM Eternal. It's not a reskin of their (by today's standards) shitty game, it's a whole new experience that's a damned (hah) blast to play. That's not what's happening with Myst/Riven, unfortunately, but I'd love to see that level of innovation come out of the studio that was once great. reply ido 2 hours agorootparentThey did make new games tho, most recently Obduction and Firmament (the latter released in 2023). I think their style of games just fell off the zeitgeist. Anyway I do empathise - my favorite games are fallout and fallout 2 and I was looking forward to Bethesda’s sequels but I never manage to stick to any of them for more than a couple hours, it just doesn’t feel like fallout to me - and I think a big part of it is because I’m not longer 14 years old playing a new game (with very little other commitments on my time and attention). reply SheepSlapper 1 hour agorootparentI know they made newer games, I played Obduction in person in their offices before it was released :) But you're on the same page as me, there was a time and place for these FANTASTIC games, but that's in the past. And it feels kind of silly to watch them push the same games onto new platforms in a futile attempt to stay relevant (and cash the nostalgia checks, even when players end up NOT feeling the same things as the OG release). Part of why I didn't like D2 again is exactly what you said, I'm not a teenager with endless time to spend online gaming. But another huge part is that I've been there and done that, and a nicer, newer version of that fun just doesn't hold a candle to the fun I had years ago when it was fresh. I'm saying the same holds true for Myst/Riven, release it on my smart fridge for all I care, it's not the same :D reply ido 47 minutes agorootparentYeah I agree we actually agree! Another complicating factor is that there’s a significant subjective component to it - I have an acquaintance that works at Cyan (after growing up with Myst and Riven) and is extremely happy working on their newer games. Ultimately they’re getting money from players (not investors), so the test of “is there a reason to remake the old games” is ultimately if people are buying them (and I wonder how many of them haven’t played the originals? Considering they came out almost 30 years ago). reply pavlov 1 hour agorootparentprevI had the same experience with the Fallouts. These were the last PC games I played obsessively. (In my late teens I decided I wanted to be an artist, while gaming was moving in the opposite direction with always more guns and 3D and less story and less art. So for a long time I never played another game after Fallout 2.) In 2016 I was very impressed by the advances in VR, and so I spent thousands on a gaming PC and HTC Vive and the VR edition of Fallout 4. But one hour into the game it was clear that the magic just wasn’t there. I had this expensive setup to put me directly inside the world I enjoyed as a teen, but it was totally “uncanny valley.” The overwrought game design had lost the mystery, and the 3D VR rendering just made everything look cheap and fake. Engaging the player’s imagination is a delicate balance. reply Sharlin 43 minutes agorootparentprevIt's not just you. Bethesda's Fallouts are like cargo cult versions of the classics. Oblivion set in a retrofuturistic postapocalyptic world just isn't the same thing. reply amatecha 2 hours agoparentprevopen source FPS, maybe sauerbraten or openarena? or perhaps nexuiz… those three are the ones I've encountered the most - all fun! reply SheepSlapper 2 hours agorootparentI looked it up: Xonotic was the answer! It was actually quite fun, even though I had to compile from source to play on an outdated office server :) https://xonotic.org/ reply red_admiral 50 minutes agoprevThat was an amazing game (along with the rest of the series, there's 5 canonical games in total). When they did try something more \"normal\" - the multiplayer online URU, a kind of Myst meets second life meets early social network, it wasn't a commercial success. reply tempodox 4 hours agoprev> As of this writing, Cyan is preparing a remake of Riven. As someone who regularly despaired over the original, I'm very interested and curious. reply chaostheory 2 hours agoparenthttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/ It has VR support reply xyse53 4 hours agoprevFun read. I loved these games as a pre-teen/teen. Since I'm a cynic in general: > Cyan was likewise disinterested in pursuing other solutions that would have been even easier to implement than panning rotation, but that could have made their game less awkward to play... I disagree with this paragraph. I think back then, I thought this was intentionally helpful. Thinking on it now, I also think it was part of the character of Myst that would be too risky to lose for Riven. reply jimjimjim 1 hour agoprevRivan was an insta-buy for me and at that point I hadn't even played Myst. The scenes, the music, the environment, the feeling of exploration were amazing. and there were no walkthrough videos to help back then. reply nikodunk 5 hours agoprevIncredible game and atmosphere to this day. I would love to see the original models and maybe even try to render them in real time on today’s technology. Or maybe that would ruin the magic. reply cammikebrown 5 hours agoparentThere’s a remake coming.

If you want to play Myst, get the 2020 version. *not to be confused with the 2000 Masterpiece Edition, the 2000 remake RealMyst or the 2014 remake realMyst: Masterpiece Edition. reply beretguy 36 minutes agorootparentOr 2018 Super realMyst: Masterpiece Deluxe Premium++ Edition. reply RangerScience 5 hours agoparentprevMy understanding is that it would, to some level - I remember reading about how they put effort into every pixel, which child-me took to mean that after the rendering, they went in and modified it to exactly match what they wanted. That can only work with a fixed perspective, which I think was proven out in the later full 3D Myst games. PS - Ever read the books? :) reply amatecha 2 hours agorootparentI've got all three books but only got the hardcover of the Book of Atrus (and a recent anniversary edition reprint of it, just for fun). Wish I got hardcovers of Ti'ana and D'ni! reply VohuMana 5 hours agorootparentprevI remember the books existed as a kid but never ended up reading them. Are they worth the read? I’m in between books at the moment reply lll-o-lll 4 hours agorootparentThere were three books in total, and I loved the first two. Particularly if you can get hold of the hard-covers, as they are beautiful. As for the stories themselves, the world building and atmosphere are fantastic. As a teenager/young adult, they captivated me in a way that very few books could. I continued to read them about once a year up into my early thirties. And I never played the game! Worth a read in my opinion. reply beretguy 33 minutes agorootparent> And I never played the game! I keep seeing comments like this on this thread: people who like the game or what it produced (it whatever) without even playing. It’s like me liking all things Alice in Wonderland without ever reading the books. Even though I have them in hot pink hardcover. reply saratogacx 3 hours agorootparentprevThe paperback also had a texture to them as well. It was hard to find them a decade ago and I don't regret the hunt. I'd agree that the first two books are great, the third is nice in rounding out the world but the story doesn't captivate as much. reply Dove 3 hours agorootparentprevI thought the books matched the atmosphere and quality of the games very well. They didn't read to me at all like merchandising, but rather as an expression of the same artistic vision in another medium. I remember reading one as a teenager, and was deeply taken with the message that as an artist and an engineer (and those are deeply related), a commitment to beauty and proper function, indeed the integrity of honoring what you are and what your creations properly ought to be, demands doing things right, which in turn demands deep study and doing the homework. It is a philosophy that was formative for me, and which still heavily influences me today. I hadn't thought about that in years...! reply ajmurmann 4 hours agorootparentprevI loved reading then when I was a teenager. I remember enjoying how the books were used as portals to be worlds. The world building in general was great and I remember the story as quite clever. However, this just have been 25 years ago at least. So it might have been terrible lol reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparentprevBeen a while, but I loved them The author is David Wingrove, whose incredible world building is on display in his Chung Kuo series. Also highly recommended: a future where China has dominated all the continents. Originally 8 books, now 20 due to books splits and additional writing. Only complaint is he could have used an editor. Sometimes his writing could have used some corrections or better wording. But the stories are great. reply paul_funyun 4 hours agorootparentprevI only read the Book of Atrus and it's worth a read. Can't vouch for any others tho reply parpfish 4 hours agoparentprevI believe that the versus for sale on steam now allows for a modern 3d first person mode and a VR mode reply teraflop 3 hours agorootparentI think you're confusing Riven with the original Myst. There have been full 3D versions of Myst since way back in 2000, but a real-time 3D remake of Riven has been a long-awaited pipe dream. There was a long-running fan project called \"Starry Expanse\", aiming to recreate Riven in 3D. They got acquired(?) by Cyan a couple years back and their work got incorporated into the official Riven remake, which is supposed to come out sometime later this year. reply prerok 3 hours agorootparentThey didn't get acquired but did hire one member of the team as per this post: https://cyan.com/2022/10/31/olttfor/ reply kingkawn 1 hour agoprevTo my young self Myst felt utterly brilliant, and when it finally arrived Riven self-indulgent, a cautionary tale that even the artist does not always grasp what made their work good. reply chaostheory 2 hours agoprev [–] > My wife and I are inveterate hikers these days, planning most of our holidays around where we can get out and walk.

With a few improvements it could have taken the place of Facebook (not the original connecting with friends version Facebook) and Reddit. It could have been a great option for local business promotion and news distribution, and the same segmentation into groups would map almost perfectly into subreddits. It is decentralized, multiple clients where available and you could segment into as narrow topics as you'd like. reply kseistrup 1 hour agoparent@asjo over at koldfront.dk is still using NNTP for all sorts of things (RSS aggregator, blog engine, ActivityPub server): https://koldfront.dk/just_call_me_mr_nntp_1871 Indeed, it was a lost opportunity. The protocol os easy to understand, and it plays well with decentralization as you say, and with self hosting. With Python 3.12 out, its nntplib module is scheduled for deletion/removal in v3.13. What a pity. The NNTP protocol surely deserves a revival. reply abc123abc123 7 minutes agoparentprevWhy? It works great. Since google dropped usenet access through the web, spam is down, discussions are great, and if there is no discussion start one. I'm enjoying usenet immensely! reply mr_mitm 24 minutes agoparentprevUsenet has a few hard problems, no? Mostly related to moderation. You want to be able to edit or delete content, either your own, or, if you are a moderator, other content which turned out to be illegal later (which already implies content moderation before allowing content to be published). Spam is another big problem. To avoid impersonation, you'd have to sign everything, which I guess is possible, but experience shows crypto done properly is a huge pain. We already see how unsatisfactory this works with email. Plus, does usenet scale as well as, say, reddit? Sometimes heated threads are more like comment streams with probably dozens of comments per second. How can these be solved with a few improvements? reply ThinkBeat 11 minutes agorootparentImpersonation and spam are things you find on other ways of running a forum. On Usenet you can easily stop following a group or person. reply mr_mitm 4 minutes agorootparentIsn't spoofing an email sender address much easier than taking over an account on a forum?

Many small comments in a short time frame will have a huge overhead. reply ktosobcy 29 minutes agoparentprevThis! I still hands on a couple of groups though the traffic there is getting thinner with each day... It was simple. I wasn't forced with account (though would be nice/useful nowadays I guess with all the impersonation and whatnot), threading was awesome. Scoring+plonk was even more amazing. There was a problem with syncing what was read and not but that could be easily improved now... I think I mostly miss scoring - it was such an amazing tool to manage/filter out desired content... reply immibis 28 minutes agoparentprevThere was some minor discussion in this direction in the thread about email 2.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40392709 Bad service drives out good service just like bad money, for some reason. Centralized beats decentralized because convenience. The convenience is what they're paying to entice you to come into their home and let them eat your brains, and every single person falls for it, probably including you and me.

When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\" The post, from Theodore Ts'o, argues that software sandboxing is, if not quite impossible, rather difficult: in his post, he argues that either the user or the sandboxed program has to configure a sandbox. The user won't know what to do, and the executable can't be trusted. The author neglects to consider a third possibility: the OS dictates the shape of all sandboxes and software conforms to fit. This is model we use in Android and iOS and increasingly even on conventional Linux (via snap and flatpak). Sandboxing is not only possible, but essential. Anyway, being wrong is no great crime. Everyone's wrong sometimes. The author went on to do great things with the Linux kernel. It's interesting to think of why smart people are wrong and to be skeptical of claims of impossibly. reply Veserv 3 hours agoparentIt is not even that. All you need is the program to present a “understandable” manifest of its requirements and you can choose to accept or deny. Standardized sandboxs just facilitate ease of use and analysis, and enable application developers to target easy-to-understand security models. The problem with the post is that it assumes that the most important thing is making sure that all non-malicious programs run no matter how convoluted. It is the same thought process that makes people say nonsense like formal methods are impossible due to the halting problem. No, we can just reject unless you make it easy to analyze; halting problem averted. reply immibis 26 minutes agorootparentOkay, then every program demands every permission. Your choice is to let the program use your camera or to not use the program. And some of these programs are probably very important for your livelihood, so we know what the outcome is going to be. reply quotemstr 2 hours agorootparentprev> It is not even that. All you need is the program to present a “understandable” manifest of its requirements and you can choose to accept or deny. Sure. And if these understandable manifests contain requests only from a predefined set that the system provides, we call these requests \"permissions\" in the iOS and Android sense. You don't get to request arbitrary things and ask the user to approve them. > The problem with the post is that it assumes that the most important thing is making sure that all non-malicious programs run no matter how convoluted Agreed. > No, we can just reject unless you make it easy to analyze; halting problem averted Yes, and it's this idea that makes minimalism essential in OS design. The narrower your contract, the more flexibility you have to change your implementation. reply Veserv 2 hours agorootparentAgreed. It was unclear from your original post if you were talking about coarse-grained sandboxs or more fine-grained systems. To clarify, a system that defines coarse classes of sandboxs could declare a class of sandbox for non-networked applications, a sandbox for games, a sandbox for applications with storage exclusively for configuration data, etc. Such a system is different in many respects from a system that defines relatively fine-grained composable requirements. Obviously, a fine-grained system could be composed to present a model at the coarse abstraction level, but the way you target a application differs based on what abstraction level you are targeting. reply contingencies 1 hour agoparentprevYou can also profile the execution in a less trusted environment and use that to define the sandbox, like running Linux in NSA SEL learning mode. This allows a black box approach to systems monitoring which works well with secret, forgotten and proprietary systems and is good engineering practice for most systems anyway, whether hardware or software, as anomalies are often highly detectable. reply immibis 24 minutes agorootparentYou can, but it doesn't work very well. reply DonHopkins 3 hours agoprev [10 more] [flagged] tomalbrc 3 hours agoparentCan we not use ChatGPT to write garbage HN comments please reply DonHopkins 3 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by garbage? Is it incorrect in any way? As I stated, I used ChatGPT because I tried and failed to find the original sources. I checked all the information myself, and searched google groups and the wayback machine for the original sources, and linked to what I could find (like the suck.com Net.Mogul cards), but I don't have all the usenet and email archives any more. Can you please constructively suggest some better citations that have the same information instead of just complaining? Or should I just leave out all that relevant information, even though I checked ChatGPT's results against what I know from being there at the time? Or would you rather I just not disclose that I used ChatGPT to write the comment, so as not to trigger you? Edit: Gumby: then that's what he should have said.

The big issue with commercialising the internet was really that originally internet connected companies were prohibited from routing packets to 3rd parties, what really changed things was the change of that policy - after that anyone could join reply DonHopkins 2 hours agorootparent [–] Of course uucp and the internet are different, but seismo, later uunet, run by the same person, were central hubs where they connected, and ftp.uu.net was one of the main software distribution points. Before seismo became the most popular, it was Bell Labs ihnp4 (Indian Hill), decvax, ucbvax, mcvax in Europe, etc. That's why email addresses in signatures and mailing lists were usually expressed relative to seismo like \"...!seismo!foo!bar!baz!user\" (pure uucp routing), or \"foo!bar!baz!user@seismo\" (mixed internet/usenet routing), or later \"user%foo%bar%baz@uunet.uu.net\" (uunet gateway with fully qualified domain name), because everybody knew how to get to seismo (later uunet). reply Taniwha 30 minutes agorootparent [–] only if you happened to live in that geographical area (and seismo was a close routing) - I still have business cards with a ucbvax relative address, never used seismo reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Scientists finally found a way to thaw frozen human brain tissue without damaging it. In a groundbreaking development, scientists have discovered a new technique that allows human brain tissue to be frozen and thawed while maintaining its normal function. This breakthrough, achieved by a team led by Zhicheng Shao at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, could potentially revolutionize the study of neurological conditions. The researchers detailed their findings in Cell Reports Methods. The team says it grew self-organizing brain samples, known as organoids, from human embryonic stem cells for three weeks, allowing the development of neurons and neural stem cells. They then tested various chemical compounds to determine which combinations could help keep the frozen human brain tissue alive and enable growth after thawing. The most successful combination consisted of methylcellulose, ethylene glycol, DMSO, and Y27632. The researchers call it MEDY, and they suspect it somehow interferes with a pathway that would otherwise initiate cell death, allowing for the tissue to freeze and be thawed without incident. Tech.

The X-ray of the human brain closeup image Image source: merydolla / Adobe To test the effectiveness of MEDY, the team conducted a series of experiments on brain organoids of different ages, ranging from 28 to over 100 days old. They found that the thawed organoids closely resembled their unfrozen counterparts’ appearance, growth, and function, even after being frozen in MEDY for 18 months. Similar results were observed across frozen human brain tissue representing different brain regions. The researchers also applied their technique to three-millimeter cubes of brain tissue from a 9-month-old girl with epilepsy. The tissue maintained its pre-freezing structure and remained active in a laboratory culture for at least two weeks after being thawed. According to researchers from the University of Surrey and the University of Birmingham in the UK, this breakthrough in freezing human brain tissue could lead to improved investigations of brain development in the lab for health research. While significantly more research and the use of larger tissues are needed, some suggest that this work could eventually lead to the freezing of entire brains. Some scientists envision a future where patients with terminal conditions or astronauts traveling to distant star systems could be cryopreserved, with MEDY representing “one small step” towards that goal.

I think being embedded in an environment is necessary for consciousness. My argument is that there is no such thing as unqualified consciousness -- you have to be conscious of something. You're not born aware of yourself, you spend the first few years of your life figuring out that you are embedded in this thing called a human body that, with considerable practice, you can exercise more-or-less direct control over. After more years you figure out that your body is further embedded in a world full of other things that you have only indirect (at best) control over, or no control at all. Only after all that can you draw a line between you and not-you and become aware of \"your\" existence. reply strogonoff 6 hours agorootparentI would not equate self-awareness with the feeling of being enclosed in some distinct thing called a human body that you can exercise control over. With the latter you are not just self-aware, you are also deconstructing experience into parts according to a particular dualistic approach (“that is my body, this is me”). Such deconstruction may not be required, and whether it is the only or even the best approach to qualifying own being is dubious (some might say you and your body are the same and implicitly treating “you” as “contained in your brain” is a fallacy—from the perspective of natural sciences a good illustration is probably how gut flora changes, non-brain organ transplantation, and such correlate with shifts in your personality). reply Byamarro 2 hours agorootparentprevYet you can remain conscious in deprivation chamber. I feel that this approach is too high level to technical details how brain may really work. reply lucubratory 2 hours agorootparentBut sensory deprivation chambers are both known to make people unconscious, don't completely remove all sensation, and still induce hallucinations reliably. The conscious entity has to be conscious of something, and if there's nothing it will create something to be conscious of. reply thaumasiotes 5 hours agorootparentprev> You're not born aware of yourself, you spend the first few years of your life figuring out that you are embedded in this thing called a human body This is Piaget-level garbage. reply osigurdson 12 hours agorootparentprevThe brain is not constant during this process however.

Medically this could be great for preventing brain damage. reply zamalek 12 hours agorootparentANNs can't represent everything involved with a functioning brain, never mind a highly specific ANN architecture. Any consciousness or similar would need to arise via an independent mechanism. reply ben_w 12 hours agorootparent> Any consciousness or similar would need to arise via an independent mechanism. Probably, but even then only due to there being a lot mechanisms and we don't know which of them is related to the subjective experience of existing that is the meaning of conscious I assume you're using here (there's something like 40 definitions of \"consciousness\"). But because we don't really know where the capacity for an inner experience even is, it's not impossible that even an LLM, which totally isn't designed with the goal of having it, might nevertheless have it. (I really hope they don't, I statistically suspect they don't, I just can't rule it out). reply DennisP 9 hours agorootparentIt's not impossible that rocks have consciousness. Some modern philosophers advocating pantheism think they just might. Meanwhile, according to Sabine Hossenfelder, a recent paper shows evidence that Penrose was right about quantum effects happening in the brain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6G1D2UQ3gg reply Nevermark 3 hours agorootparent> Some modern philosophers advocating pantheism think they just might. This is a terribly low bar. The map of “ Some modern philosophers” “think [something] just might” [something] is an incoherent patchwork. I think that theorizing about things without hard evidence has value. What-if’s teach us a lot, by raising important questions, and keep our ideas flexible, preparing us for the next crazy insight that nature reveals. But that isn’t the same as attributing any reliability to the as yet unproven enthusiasms of philosophers. There is a clear case for a survival benefit for creatures whose awareness and control extends into their own thinking. Thus a reason consciousness would be one of many strategies evolution may produce. What natural phenomena is explained by a conscious rock hypothesis? What would cause a rock to organize in such a way? Where is this information about itself encoded and experienced in a rock? It’s not a coherent conjecture. reply wonderwonder 13 hours agorootparentprevI think OP means how do we know that the brain tissue that is being used in the experiment is not conscious.

Rather than 90 percent of this man's brain being missing, it's more likely that it's simply been compressed into the thin layer you can see in the images above. We've corrected the story to reflect this. reply wonderwonder 6 hours agorootparentI did not see that actually, thank you. The fact our brain can be compressed to that level is pretty crazy too, although not as impressive as the original missing 90% :) reply ben_w 21 minutes agorootparentYou're welcome :) I very nearly missed it on that page, despite already being aware of the detail from other sources. reply scarmig 13 hours agorootparentprevNetwork pruning. In ANNs, pruning 90% of the weights without substantial loss isn't unheard of. I guess this may be analogous: continuous pruning and fine tuning over a lifetime. Though, is removing 90% of the brain more analogous to 90% of weights, or 90% of the rank? reply Waterluvian 14 hours agorootparentprevAt this point it feels like we’d required the resources of an entire planet to run a single full-fidelity virtual brain. Which leads to interesting science fiction premises. reply hateful 13 hours agorootparentOr one entire actual brain - if it can be done once by natural selection, it can be done more efficiently again by a designer.

So while the same thing working on small samples of human tissue is completely expected it’s still useful research for organ transplants etc. All that cryogenic preservation that showed in science fiction is somewhat realistic even if we can’t do it yet and it’s probably going to require extensive surgery beforehand to enable rapid cooling. reply lisper 13 hours agorootparent> Small mammals up to the size of hamsters can successfully be cryogenically frozen and revived significantly later.

The frozen piece of brain from an epilepsy patient doesn’t retain ”normal function”. There is no evidence in the paper that it integrates into neuronal circuits (this was not even tested), or supports anything like normal neuronal firing. The cells are alive, yes, and likely highly abnormally perturbed. reply FireInsight 14 hours agoprevI just imagined dying and then noticing myself thinking again but without any sensory inputs; freaky stuff. reply baxtr 14 hours agoparentI recommend you google sleep paralysis. I experienced it a couple of times when I was younger. Really scary. reply stevenwoo 8 hours agorootparentThis was super freaky before one could read about it on the internet, I remember it happening to me in the 1970-1980s and thinking it was something really wrong with me or supernatural in nature at the time, which as another commenter notes was what people in medieval times thought. It was such a relief to read that other people had similar experiences by 1990s. reply nuancebydefault 13 hours agorootparentprevI remember that when I was around 8 or so, it happened several times in the morning while waking up, that I saw someone entering the bedroom while I was not able to speak or move. It was terrifying. It must have been imagination, since nobody appeared to have noticed anything unusual. Is there a name for such event? reply luxpir 12 hours agorootparentThere are (creepy) reports from the middle ages of figures sitting on sleepers' chests, legs, moving towards them etc. It's clearly a biological phenomenon of some description. I've never really looked into it, despite experiencing it often. Related my general take on it below. reply krapp 12 hours agorootparentThese are common symptoms of sleep paralysis - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis reply ineedaj0b 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you get this often, I've noticed it's tied to sleeping position. I'm often at an angle where I'm getting poor oxygenation, sorta like sleep apnea. For me this is on my back with no pillow (angle of neck/throat) but I'm fine on my side or stomach. reply cjbgkagh 9 hours agorootparentSleep paralysis is consciousness when you are supposed to be knocked out, AFAIK unrelated to oxygen levels. There is possibly a correlation to sleep apnea but I think that is more likely due to hEDS being a common cause for both. hEDS not rare, it is pretty common, far more than doctors think. People with hEDS have very weird drug interactions, many often have a genetic resistance to local and general anesthesia. I think a reasonable explanation is they are also resistant to whatever the chemical the brain uses that causes sleep induced loss of consciousness to the point they are more prone to sleep paralysis. The N of 1 with changing positions is interesting though. reply ordu 7 hours agorootparent> I think a reasonable explanation is they are also resistant to whatever the chemical the brain uses that causes sleep induced loss of consciousness to the point they are more prone to sleep paralysis. I cant rule out your explanation, but I personally in favor of another one. It is not a supression of consciousness doesn't work, it is the clearing blood from whatever the chemical that stops propagating signals to muscles. When everything works good you are relieved of paralisys at the same time your consciousness wakes up. I never experienced sleep paralisys, but when I wake up suddenly and try to move instantly I can sometime feel a fleeting sensation of it. I never gave it a second thought before I learned about sleep paralysis. reply ordu 7 hours agorootparentprevIt may be linked to a sleeping position, but I'd bet not on poor oxigenation, but on obstructed blood stream that makes it hard to spread that chemical that turns sleep paralysis off. I do not remember details of phisiology of sleep paralysis, what is the paralysing chemical, and which one is stopping it, and where from they come, but it seems plausible that sometimes a sleeping position can make it hard for chemicals to reach muscles and free them from paralysis. reply intelVISA 9 hours agorootparentprevFirst time it hit me I was like \"am I dead?\" creepy stuff, subsequent times are more annoying than scary. reply Waterluvian 14 hours agorootparentprevI had it once and it was the most terrifying experience of my life. reply throwaway5557c 11 hours agorootparentI have had similar experiences a few times. One time it was extremely scary. I could not move, and I experienced someone whispering something unintelligible in my ear. reply deadbabe 13 hours agorootparentprevCan you guys elaborate? Do you feel like you’re some brain in a vat somewhere when this happens? reply luxpir 12 hours agorootparentThis has happened often enough to me that I am sometimes now aware of it when it's happening, occasionally, and can ride it out. I've literally \"invited\" more terror to try to end it quicker before. As in, \"yeah yeah , get it over with, bring it on\". I haven't questioned the normality of this until now, amusingly. It normally happens when I sleep on my back. I have been known to make an attempt at a scream during the event. I'm normally being attacked at speed, by people or things that don't really have boundaries. And of course I can't fight back, hence the paralysis. For the scream, I think I have heard it, but because of the paralysis it ends up like a loud exhale with some high notes in it. I couldn't describe it as a roar. More of a pitiful gurgle. It is sometimes made worse by my sleeping partner trying to wake me clumsily, which momentarily heightens the terror, especially if my face is being nudged or jabs to the ribs. So not particularly fun, literally facing my demons, but also probably some of the best VR you're likely to experience. For background, I'm a generally positive and optimistic person, rational with zero belief in the supernatural, despite being raised with it. Oh god I'm cursed... I kid, but who knows from where these intrusive dreams originate. I do practice martial arts, but this predates that. I have had an interest in light combat since childhood, despite pacifism and fear being more of a reflection of my personality. It was probably more of an 80s thing, expecting violence and quicksand at any moment. That's about it really, totally normal to me at this point. It's probably nothing. EDIT: For the record, it feels like the paralysis triggers the dream, not the dream triggering the paralysis. Something to do with approaching a waking state in the brain but not the body. Cue the terror and internal screams for help. reply blegr 12 hours agorootparentprevSome people feel some kind of person/presence close to them, that's how it happened to me. This [1] weirdly makes sense. It felt kind of like those dreams where you can't move. Except you've woken up, I could see the correct room and position I was in. It tends to come with fear and doesn't last long. Never happened when I slept on my side or front. I almost never sleep on my back now. Also, chronic stress could have been a trigger. [1] https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Henry_Fuseli_(1741–1... reply Waterluvian 13 hours agorootparentprevI could see but I couldn’t move any muscles. It felt like five minutes but was probably less. It happened in an afternoon nap which is something I never did. I was screaming internally for my girlfriend to notice me. I thought I was suddenly a quadriplegic or something and was panicking. Eventually my girlfriend noticed (she later said she noticed my deep, heavy breathing) and shook me and being shaken pulled me immediately out of it. reply zuminator 9 hours agorootparentThis is almost exactly how it is for me as well. I've experienced this 50+ times, the feeling of complete or almost complete paralysis. I make a great effort to move and can feel my heart racing and heat in my face from panic and exertion. I can see my immediate surroundings; if the sun is up I can tell it's daytime. Although my eyes are open and aware, I'm not quite fully alert. Sometimes there are hints of hallucinations like the feeling that a shadowy figure is approaching my bed, and it's scary, but most often I'm just aware that I'm paralyzed. As a child I learned that if I can force a limb to move slowly, I will usually jerk myself fully awake. About 25% of the time I can calm myself down and fall back to sleep. reply lisper 13 hours agorootparentprev> I could see How do you know that you weren't simply dreaming? reply chrisnight 12 hours agorootparentREM atonia, which is the paralysis that sleep paralysis comes from/uses, paralyzes the majority of your body. However, one organ it doesn’t paralyze is your eyes, hence people experiencing it generally open their eyes as they try to escape it. However, even with your eyes open, you can experience dream-like hallucinations overlayed ontop your view of reality, hence people thinking they see other entities in their bedrooms, etc. It’s possible that it was a dream, but it’s completely possible it wasn’t, so if a person claims they were awake, then in all likelyhood they were. reply lisper 12 hours agorootparentWell, there's an objective test: did they see something that actually happened out in the world during the episode that could be verified later? reply Waterluvian 12 hours agorootparentWhen it happened the Monorail episode of the Simpsons was on. And it continued to be on when I was shaken out of it because my girlfriend suggested we just watch the rest to get my mind off it. It was also just a very vivid experience. I felt completely awake. Just unable to do a thing. reply lisper 11 hours agorootparentThanks. reply intelVISA 9 hours agoprevGives me hope we can reverse the damage wrought by Js and return to Lisp reply Teever 14 hours agoprevA few years ago I became interested in the cryonics movement. What I find most interesting about it aren't the kooks and weirdos that are into cryonics, but the visceral reaction that your average Joe has to the idea. The average opinion about cryonics seems to range from 'That is impossible' to 'why would you want that?'. But if you ask that same average Joe about a cure for cancer they're likely to say that it's been done and the rich just horde it for themselves. It's weird that they don't see things like cures for cancer, regrowing organs, age slowing drugs etc... as all part of a pathway to the same thing which is a technological solution to many causes of aging and death. Unlocking the ability to grow and store organs or even just store donated organs cryogenically is highly desirable from an economic standpoint has it frees up so many resources (1pc of US GDP is spent on dialysis alone) so if there's a technological means to do it we're going to find a way sooner or later.

We will never give away any of your information. For starters, they're leaking this information to Google. After that, they're presumably subject to subpoenas. And they or an acquirer altering the agreement. And there's interpretations of \"give away\". And the inevitable data breaches. I see no identification of who runs it, which doesn't seem consistent with their stated philosophy of \"transparency and accountability\", and might affect users' ability to hold them to their privacy assurances. reply ZhadruOmjar 3 hours agoparentHow anonymous can it be? Sure, if you were dealing with a city-wide management company they can keep it somewhat anonymous but saying \"John Smith, landlord at 123 Fake St\" with the review on a set date is a pretty good indication of who left the review. Even for management companies it would not take a lot of investigation to find the reviewer. reply bsza 7 minutes agorootparentFor starters, they could hash every address with bcrypt and only show reviews to people who search for that exact address. Then they could hide the review pages from search engines (which they are currently not [0] doing). None of this would make the site lose its primary function, which is by their own admission to do a background check on the landlord you’re about to sign an agreement with.

I would never review a workplace on something like Glassdoor for the same reason; \"worked in x department and wasn't happy\" is easy to narrow down. reply surfingdino 1 hour agoparentprevThere is no anonymity. You can only make it more expensive to obtain one's identity. reply bsza 18 minutes agorootparentThis site isn’t even trying, they just shove random reviews with the exact address in your face on the front page. reply 20240519 3 hours agoparentprevEven if there is no information given away there is an address published so the landlord and probably government can guess who you are. reply throwaway290 2 hours agoparentprev\"We will never give away\" could be read as \"we will sell for the right price\". reply EGreg 4 hours agoparentprev“I see no identification of who runs it” Sounds like it’s anonymous to me :) That’s how governments like to run things: https://community.qbix.com/t/transparency-in-government/234 reply bredren 5 hours agoprevIn the United States, the power is almost entirely in the hands of the landlord. Maybe not for things that reach criminal levels of malfeasance but for your average renter with a crappy landlord there is zero leverage, it is particularly bad now because housing is so incredibly broken at the moment. For a long time, you have needed references from prior landlords to rent another place. This was especially challenging for mediocre landlords. Where there was nothing worth a court date but they may have ignored real problems and garnished the deposit with no reason. Rental management companies are practically incentivized to deliver the worst service for the highest price. It’s like the taxi industry before ratings from Uber and Lyft came to provide some recourse for riders. Ridesharing’s present outcome isn’t to strive for but neither is the taxi industry of yore. Most folks who talk up the benefits of renting haven’t done it in a very long time. reply devjab 52 minutes agoparentLandlords have a lot of power, even in Scandinavia where we highly regulate the renter-landlord “relationship”. One example of how the regulation isn’t really working as well as intended is in average renting prices. Which despite there being 10.000 empty apartments in my city isn’t coming down. (10.000 is a lot in Denmark). The sister company of my place of work is a landlord, and part of the reason they don’t lower rental prices is because it’s hard to increase it later. So for a period of years it’s better for them to “bet” on the market changing enough to solve our empty apartment challenge. It looked bleak for a couple of years, but thanks to things turning around the strategy has worked out. You can’t protect the rental market from this sort of thing unless you start limiting how many houses private equity are allowed to build and own. Which isn’t something cities are really interested in currently. It used to be such that co-ownership rental-groups or whatever you call “beboerforeninger” in English, if there is even an English term for it. But they are basically non-profit landlords which are owned collectively by every renter. Anyway it used to be that these organisations could compete with private landlords because private landlords were smaller. They have no chance of competing with the kind of deals we can cut a city now, or the speed at which we can buyout and replace old buildings. Simply because we, and companies like us, represent a literal fuckton of money. This is made worse by international investors, but it’s not exclusively caused by them. Our sister company has 0 foreign capital, and we’re still capable of competing with international capital on an equal level. Leaving almost no room for the non-profit organisations and absolutely no room for small investors on any serious level. I don’t know about the US, but here in Denmark there is almost zero chance of it changing. There just won’t be enough political interest in it. In fact there is a huge political interest against it. Both from the cities themselves, but also for basically every home owner in our country. Because our high rental prices keep the housing market high as well, as people give up a lot sooner than we do. As seen with how the housing market is now again increasing here in Denmark after a period of almost dying. It’s not just because no cheap rentals became available, but it’s part of it. reply saithound 5 hours agoparentprev> In the United States, the power is almost entirely in the hands of the landlord. Very much this. The current outcome of any tenant complaint is a private warning not to make a fuss, with an auto-served eviction notice if the tenant makes a fuss anyway. This situation can only be improved by legislating away at-will evictions (no, less demand would not help fix this, see pandemic). No chance of that in most of the U.S., though. Uber/Lyft improved upon taxis because there were a lot of people who wanted to supply the service, but it was illegal for them to do so until Uber/Lyft punched a hole on the legal system. The rental market does not have this problem, in some sense the opposite. reply joe_the_user 4 hours agorootparentBelieve it or not, California no longer allows blanket at-will evictions as part of it's recent rent control law. Landlords still have more leverage than tenants but it's a bit better. reply whimsicalism 5 hours agorootparentprevyou can only legislate away at-will evictions if you have rent control and rent control exacerbates the housing crisis reply chii 5 hours agoparentprev> Ridesharing’s present outcome isn’t to strive for it's much better than the taxi of yore. It's not the perfect outcome, but it's an improvement nevertheless. reply schmidt_fifty 5 hours agorootparentI disagree, i think it's worse in every way except that you can hail one with an app now. It's certainly more expensive and the driver makes less than ever, but now there's a kafkaesque middleman that doesn't appear to provide any value but can fuck with both of you at will with little recourse available for either party. Pricing is only reliable in the sense of feeling gouged by a party that has provided no value. But yea, slick app. I hear the drivers are sometimes less racist, too. reply Kalium 2 hours agorootparentSan Francisco is an instructive example. Prior to Uber, calling a taxi in SF gave you a 50% chance of one showing up in some functionally unknowable amount of time. 50% is not an exaggeration, it was sometimes below that, and you would have no idea if you should expect your cab in five minutes or fifty. Then you would be charged some amount of money you could in theory anticipate but in practice could not. Should the driver misbehave in some manner, there was theoretical but in practice missing accountability. The drivers were then exploited ruthlessly by medallion-owners. Uber became very popular very quickly because it addressed a number of those consumer pain points up front. You could know for sure if a car was going to come, have a quite good idea of how long it would be, and get a price in advance. Sure, your complaints would likely be ignored, but nothing new there. reply jabroni_salad 2 hours agorootparentprevIn midsize cities it's an improvement that you can get a ride at all. Last time I tried to use the legacy service they told me they don't do pickup requests on Friday evenings and to try again tomorrow. Lyft got me to my flight and I never called that dispatcher again. reply anyfoo 3 hours agorootparentprevNobody who ever took a taxi in Germany would say that. reply User23 4 hours agoparentprev> In the United States, the power is almost entirely in the hands of the landlord. Maybe not for things that reach criminal levels of malfeasance but for your average renter with a crappy landlord there is zero leverage, it is particularly bad now because housing is so incredibly broken at the moment. In the USA renting is largely a state law matter. Some states are very landlord friendly, but others, such as California, are considerably more tenant friendly. For example late fees are illegal in California and you can basically get a pro se judgment easy peasy if a landlord even attempts to get you to sign a lease with a late fee clause, let alone collect one. You can also withhold rent to pay for services the landlord should have provided, and so on. Anyhow I'm not a lawyer and this isn't legal advice, but if you're in California learn your rights. reply YokoZar 3 hours agorootparent> For example late fees are illegal in California and you can basically get a pro se judgment easy peasy if a landlord even attempts to get you to sign a lease with a late fee clause, let alone collect one. Having actually gone through this process in small claims court in California, I will say that your miles may vary. I completely won my case except for recovering the fifty dollar late fee (written into the lease) that I paid because rent was once a day late. The judge said it seemed \"reasonable\" and didn't listen to me talk about California \"liquidated damages\" language on the subject, which is the supposed law that makes late fees illegal. Fact is, most places I've rented from have had late fees, and recovering them sounds like a huge crapshoot at best. reply favorited 3 hours agorootparentprev> late fees are illegal in California and you can basically get a pro se judgment easy peasy if a landlord even attempts to get you to sign a lease with a late fee clause That's how laws are supposed to work. If a landlord is foolish enough to put an illegal punitive clause in a lease, they should be punished. reply goodpoint 2 hours agoparentprev> housing is so incredibly broken at the moment It's not just \"broken\". It's designed that way to benefit large financial groups. reply aurareturn 4 hours agoparentprev>In the United States, the power is almost entirely in the hands of the landlord.

And in Texas, apartments don't charge much of a deposit because they can bill residents moving out for everything and anything. reply lxe 6 hours agoprevIs there a technical or product novelty here? Some other curious context I'm missing? It looks just like any other landlord/renter review site with the same challenges of privacy, defamation, discoverability, etc... reply ozim 2 hours agoparentI think novelty is for the creators. They think it is a good idea and that people are nice. I give it 3-6 months until they realize how many downsides that idea has and close down. reply sjtrny 6 hours agoprevIn Australia we have https://www.shitrentals.org/ reply saithound 5 hours agoparentWith how poorly this site is designed, you'd think REAs intentionally made it to poison the well and preempt the people who'd fill the market gap by setting up a competent agency review website. reply technion 5 hours agorootparentThe guy who made it has a legal background, I won't fault him on design. He has been immensely popular in Australia over calling out illegal rental actions. reply system2 5 hours agoparentprevA fitting name. reply aurareturn 6 hours agoprevHow do you verify this? For example, if I really like an apartment and want to stay longer in it, I might be inclined to write a fake review about how about the apartment or my landlord is to steer competition away. reply saithound 6 hours agoparentIf there's a negative review about 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and the same guy lived there for the last four years, the landlord will have a pretty good idea about who's writing the bad reviews. They can evict the tenant in a retaliatory manner, or if what they wrote qualifies as libelous, take them to court easily. So the incentive to write fake reviews to steer competition away is just not there. This doesn't mean that there won't be fake reviews, just that worrying about fake reviews of this particular sort doesn't make much sense. reply newsclues 5 minutes agorootparenthttps://www.michelleslist.com/properties/1600%20Pennsylvania... reply aurareturn 4 hours agorootparentprevOk, how about if I'm a tenant applying for an attractive apartment. I would be incentivized to write a fake negative review about the apartment to steer competition away. The landlord would have no idea that it was me. Might even blame the existing tenant. Or how about a neighbor who values quietness and doesn't want the landlord to be able to rent out the apartment? Since it's \"anonymous\" multiple parties could have incentives to write negative reviews. reply bunabhucan 6 hours agoparentprevThey did say it was like glassdoor. Not all the $CommonPosition at $BigCorp ctrl-c ctrl-v there is real. reply bsmithers 6 hours agorootparentOne big difference is that there are lots of reviews for $CommonPosition. With this, you'd have to expect that most reviews are the only one for a given property/landlord reply taesu 6 hours agoparentprevGlassdoor doesnt either reply michaelmrose 5 hours agoparentprevGiven the relative paucity of housing choice and the fact that no singular site is liable to be universal in usage the expect result of such an action is to slightly increase time to rent with no reasonable expectation that it would effect price of unit. EG say they on average interview 3 tenants before they pick one and take 4 days to get one inquiry after listing a property convincing fully 1/3 of tenants to give them a big miss would result in the property being vacant for an extra 4 days every 3 years. Meanwhile they will be pricing their property based on prevailing prices for units like theirs. This strategy would not be expected to work so few people are going to make unfairly negative reviews about places they already live. I would actually expect to see 1) Fake positive reviews by management/owners 2) Unfair negative reviews by people who were themselves problematic 3) Apartments trying to force people not to review them as a condition of tenancy and trying to unmask reviewers to sue them 4) People trying to get negative reviews removed with hallow or real legal threats 5) Fake negative reviews by competition reply robertclaus 6 hours agoprevWhat is the incentive for someone to leave a review? Given that each person only has a handful of places they can review, you won't have serial reviewers like on other review sites. reply dools 5 hours agoparentI don’t know about where you live or what it’s like in the states where this site is presumably targeted but in Australia people would have ample opportunity to be serial reviewers. reply globular-toast 47 minutes agoparentprevThe incentive is having some power over the landlord: treat me badly, you get a bad review. No idea why someone would write a good review, though. But bad reviews are more important. Landlords already have the benefit of the doubt. reply xbmcuser 3 hours agoprevUnless the landlord has 100s or 1000s of tenants I don't think people can stay anonymous usually people rent for multiple years the churn is not high enough for deducing who wrote the review reply jarofgreen 3 hours agoparentTotally this! In the UK many landlords only have one or a few properties and it would be obvious which tenant is bad mouthing you. In some cases there are laws against \"revenge evictions\" but I don't know how much people would be willing to get into a shitty situation and trust arguing about those laws just to leave a review. reply vinnyglennon 3 hours agoprevIn Ireland, always https://www.HowMuchRent.com for tenant reviews, viewing landlord/tenant court cases and tracking advertised rental prices reply iamacyborg 3 hours agoprevI wonder if Craigslist will force this one to rebrand like they did with Jameslist. Maybe not as this one isn’t a marketplace reply o999 1 hour agoprev\"Anonymous\", but you can only sign in with Google or Linkedin! reply globular-toast 54 minutes agoprevIt's almost unbelievable that something like this doesn't already exist. People will read reviews of some 10 credit piece of shit from Amazon but not a person who has the power to ruin the next year or more of their lives. I had a bad experience with a landlord recently. The washing machine broke and they just wouldn't replace it. They didn't refuse, the washing machine was simply \"on order\" for 6 months. I tried to have a conversation with the letting agent, human to human. I asked what they would do in my situation. They said they didn't know but whatever I do, don't stop paying rent because I'll get a bad reference. I realised two things: a) there is a naughty list for tenants but not for landlords and b) I'm nothing but a source of money in their eyes. A human to human conversation was never going to happen. The agents don't care about the tenants because why would they? It's lose/lose for a tenant. You either cough up or go on the naughty list. The landlord has all the power. They are literally called landlords! And we just accept this power imbalance as if it's normal! On another note I find the trend of naming things with feminine sounding names interesting. Of course there is no \"Michelle\" really. reply 8f2ab37a-ed6c 5 hours agoprevI've had a couple of spectacularly underwhelming (well, flat out hostile) apartment complexes throughout my career as a renter, but I've always hesitated to leave negative Yelp reviews about the building fearing either retribution or not being able to get referrals in the future in case I need it for my next landlord. Wish I could somehow hold these companies accountable though, other renters would probably benefit from it. Sure, I could move, but the process of finding a new place and moving all of your belongings and address (at least in a desirable US city) is such a hassle that often as renters we'll just stay put and suck it up. reply noah32 2 hours agoprev\"Hyperlinking to our Content If you are one of the organizations listed in paragraph 2 above and are interested in linking to our website, you must inform us by sending an e-mail to Michelle's List.

That’s the entire reason for stratospheric rent increases: property is increasingly mass owned by corporations, that collude on pricing. As a result fewer people can buy homes, and ever more end up being owned by rental corporations.
