Splitting If I have a file called diary.txt in my current directory I can call horcrux split diary.txt and it will prompt me for how many horcruxes I want, and how many will be needed to resurrect the original file. For example I might want 5 horcruxes with the ability to resurrect the file if I have any 3. The horcrux files will be created like so: diary_1_of_5.horcrux diary_2_of_5.horcrux ... Now you just need to disperse the horcruxes around the house on various USBs or online locations and hope you can recall where they all are! Binding To bind the horcruxes back into the original file just call horcrux bind in the directory containing the horcruxes (or pass the directory as an argument). Installation via homebrew: brew install jesseduffield/horcrux/horcrux via binary release Who this is for: People who need to encrypt a big sensitive file like a diary and don't expect to remember any passwords years from now (but who paradoxically will be capable of remembering where they've hidden their horcruxes) People who want to transmit files across multiple channels to substantially reduce the ability for an attacker to intercept People named Tom Riddle FAQ Q) This isn't really in line with how horcruxes work in the harry potter universe! A) It's pretty close! You can't allow any one horcrux to be used to resurrect the original file (and why would you that would be useless) but you can allow two horcruxes to do it (so only off by one). Checkmate HP fans. Q) How does this work? A) This uses the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme to break an encryption key into parts that can be recombined to create the original key, but only requiring a certain threshold to do so. I've adapted Hashicorp's implementation from their vault repo Alternatives ssss. Works for keys but (as far as I know) not files themselves. horcrux. Looks like somebody beat me to both the name and concept, however this repo doesn't support thresholds of horcruxes Haystack. Implements another file sharding and reassembly algorithm inspired by SSSS, but requires a password for reassembly and does not support thresholds of horcruxes.

We could just generate 3 random files, and make the fourth one be a bitwise XOR of the 3 files plus the original one. Then, doing a bitwise XOR of the 4 encrypted shards will return the original file.Assuming the PRNGs are unbiased, how would this method not be safe enough? reply d-z-m 15 hours agoprevCaution, this tool uses AES in OFB mode[0] to encrypt&#x2F;decrypt the file, without any guarantee of the ciphertext integrity(no MAC).[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Block_cipher_mode_of_operation... reply byteknight 14 hours agoparentThat wiki went over my (fairly) technical head. Care to ELI5? reply msm_ 8 hours agorootparentMy attempt of explanation with a (hopefully) relatable example: imagine that you store all your backup files encrypted, then restore the backup on your machine. The backup is stored on untrusted NAS but it&#x27;s OK since it&#x27;s encrypted, right?With OFB (and CTR, and any other unauthenticated cipher basically), no. Ciphers guarantee confidentiality, but nothing else. This means that the attacker can alter one of your encrypted backed-up files. It&#x27;s not a hypothetical attack. For example your backed up &#x2F;bin&#x2F;ls file likely starts with something like (hexencoded): 7f454c4602010100000000000000000002003e000100 .ELF..............>...Let&#x27;s assume attacker wants to trick you into running \"echo hacked\" on your system. They may achieve this by altering your backed up &#x2F;bin&#x2F;ls such that it decrypts to something like this: 23212f62696e2f73680a6563686f206861636b65640a #!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\\necho hacked\\nAnd it&#x27;s really easy! Stream ciphers work by XORing input plaintext with keystream: ciphertext = plaintext ^ generate_keystream(key) plaintext = ciphertext ^ generate_keystream(key)If you look closely at the equations, it&#x27;s apparent that one can flip a byte in decrypted plaintext by flipping a byte in the ciphertext. To drive the point home, a small demonstration in Python (I&#x27;ll use CTR instead of OFB but it&#x27;s the same): >>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES >>> def xor(a, b): return bytes([ac ^ bc for ac, bc in zip(a, b)]) >>> aes_enc = AES.new(b\"mysupersecretkey\", AES.MODE_CTR) >>> plaintext = open(\"&#x2F;bin&#x2F;ls\", \"rb\").read(32) >>> ciphertext = aes_enc.encrypt(plaintext) >>> known_plaintext = bytes.fromhex(\"7f454c4602010100000000000000000002003e000100\") >>> wanted_plaintext =bytes.fromhex(\"23212f62696e2f73680a6563686f206861636b65640a\") >>> flip = xor(known_plaintext, wanted_plaintext) >>> flipped_ciphertext = xor(flip, ciphertext) >>> aes_dec = AES.new(b\"mysupersecretkey\", AES.MODE_CTR, nonce=aes_enc.nonce) >>> aes_dec.decrypt(flipped_ciphertext) b&#x27;#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\\necho hacked\\n\\\\d\\xc3\\xd9\\*o.sh\\n&#x27;In this example attacker can change the first 22 bytes of file to arbitrary payload by abusing the predictable header of the ELF file. No knowledge of the key is necessary. reply d-z-m 13 hours agorootparentprevModes like OFB effectively produce a keystream(not unlike a stream cipher) which is then XOR&#x27;d with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.To decrypt, the same keystream is XOR&#x27;d with the ciphertext to produce the plaintext.If there is no integrity on the ciphertext, you can simply start flipping bits in the ciphertext, and arbitrarily change what the resulting XOR with the keystream will be. reply zamadatix 13 hours agorootparentprevMy blind stab at it is this encryption always produces an output that&#x27;s not validated to be what was originally encrypted and it does so in a way you could even intentionally damage a specific portion of the data without needing to know how to decrypt it.Curious to see how wrong I am :). reply Polycryptus 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s right, there&#x27;s no guarantee the data hasn&#x27;t been tampered with after encryption. The mechanics of the tampering you could do depend on the cipher mode you use.To give a simplified example (which doesn&#x27;t match what this program does but is useful to demonstrate), ECB is the simplest mode (which really shouldn&#x27;t be used for anything). Your input is split into fixed-length blocks (16 bytes for AES) and each block is encrypted separately, producing a deterministic ciphertext for each block. (e.g. a block of all \"A\" will always encrypt to the same thing).So if an attacker is able to figure out what plaintext a block of encrypted data corresponds to, they could use that knowledge to build a \"fake\" encrypted message. They could also remove blocks from a message, or shuffle them around.If you&#x27;re interested in playing around more practically with this kind of thing, I highly recommend the https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com&#x2F; challenge sets. reply SV_BubbleTime 13 hours agorootparentprevIt’s this.A cipher with a MAC or authentication (like an AEAD) will return “TRUE” and the data that was definitely decrypted properly. A normal cipher just returns data and it has no idea if it was decrypted correctly, so if you decrypt ABC and it should be XYZ, the wrong key will still “work” but the data will be X@9 which means nothing to you.Normally, you would validate your data after encryption. Like using something “Here is my result, and it has to start with the ascii characters of a valid date.” An authenticated cipher allows you to not care or have to know anything about the data at all, they’re nice. With the downside that you also need to supply the MAC or TAG or SIG along with the data package. reply mmastrac 18 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s a cool paper-based backup tool that also uses Shamir Secret Sharing to let you distribute a bunch of paper copies to your friends to restore a file optically:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cyphar&#x2F;paperback reply cyphar 15 hours agoparentI really need to set aside some time to work on some kind of usable interface, graphical stuff has never been my strong suit.

Feels a bit too early to rely on it, but could be very cool for lots of people if it was a bit more mature and easy to use. reply fartfeatures 17 hours agoparentprevIs this different or do they do the exact same thing?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paritytech&#x2F;banana_split reply cyphar 9 hours agorootparentPaperback predates that tool (though to be fair, it still has to have a nice GUI interface made for it, and to be honest I have been working on it off more than on). Also, I suspect they don&#x27;t support reconstructing lost shards or adding new shards after sharing (this is trivial to do from the maths but very few tools seem to have this pretty important feature). I talk about this in the LCA talk I did on paperback[1]. There are also some attacks against SSS that require workarounds and it seems to me they don&#x27;t have any protections against them (in paperback&#x27;s case, there are several measures to defend against forged shards -- one of which is that all shards are signed with an Ed25519 key whose private half is in the sharded secret).That being said, the underlying cryptography is quite old and there aren&#x27;t too many new ways you can spin it -- the goal of paperback was to make it possible for paper backups to be done in a way that non-technical folks can understand the properties. How well it currently lives up to that goal is a different question, of course.I mainly wrote paperback because the existing SSS systems I could find at the time were all either very primitive, had serious security issues (I found two or three serious cryptographic vulnerabilities in the handful of existing tools at the time -- and I&#x27;m not a cryptographer by any stretch of the imagination), or were not usable as a paper backups system. There are more around now and it&#x27;s possible I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with paperback if they&#x27;d existed back then.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GI9rKdM9rB8&t=1368 reply elliotec 16 hours agorootparentprevIt’s the same but with a framework to share between people rather than just hiding pieces of paper around the world. reply tomasreimers 17 hours agoprevThere was a post about shamir secret sharing recently by levchin (and chaos that it caused at paypal): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;max.levch.in&#x2F;post&#x2F;724289457144070144&#x2F;shamir-secret-s...This is 100% one of my favorite algorithms, but I have to say I&#x27;ve started to wonder if I just have an academic fascination with it and the practical use cases are more limited (limiting?) than I think reply scubbo 15 hours agoparentGreat story, thank you!> I&#x27;ve started to wonder if I just have an academic fascination with it and the practical use cases are more limited (limiting?) than I thinkI don&#x27;t think the linked post should prompt such wondering? (It&#x27;s not clear if you are drawing a causal link between the two) It was an issue with the interface _to_ the algorithm, not with the algorithm itself. reply j2kun 12 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;ve started to wonder if I just have an academic fascination with it and the practical use cases are more limited (limiting?) than I thinkI&#x27;m currently writing an entire book based on this concern: pmfpbook.org reply obeavs 10 hours agorootparentAnd the answer is... reply coppsilgold 8 hours agoprevAccording to the FAQ it uses a Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme to split an encryption key. But you can actually use a Reed-Solomon scheme[1] and have no encryption key to achieve this objective.First, you process the input data with an all-or-nothing transform (AONT)[2]. Then you split it into Reed-Solomon shares. AONT is required due to Reed-Solomon being vulnerable to a distinguisher[3] and it will most likely leak information about its input.[1] [2] [3]reply cyphar 8 hours agoparentIs that approach information-theoretically secure? Shamir Secret Sharing is, and the mathematics is very simple.Note that the encryption step is, strictly speaking, not necessary for Shamir either. But there are benefits to encrypting the secret and only using SSS for the key (I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how Horcrux works, but that&#x27;s how my fairly-similar tool Paperback[1] works).[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cyphar&#x2F;paperback reply coppsilgold 8 hours agorootparent> Is that approach information-theoretically secure?No. But neither is SSS if an encryption key is involved - because the symmetric encryption step is not information-theoretically secure.Using SSS directly on the input will be information-theoretically secure but also multiply the size of the input.> and the mathematics is very simple.The mathematics of SSS and Reed-Solomon are virtually identical. reply coppsilgold 6 hours agoparentprevI was able to find a project which appears to do exactly this: Paper:reply dang 14 hours agoprevRelated (at least by name - I think there is more than one project here).

I can see digging into the source code&#x2F;reading about the techniques involved because I want to know how it was done. But I am struggling to figure out where something like this would be useful -- is there a threat model where this would be useful as a \"layer in the onion\" of things protecting sensitive data or a way in which this would be superior for a use case that isn&#x27;t already solved better by something else?Even the author kind of jokes about an old diary password vs remembering enough hiding places. I think the latter would be a much bigger problem from personal experience and would require having fewer parts and more hiding places, eroding the provided security in the process[0]. :)Multi-sig comes to mind, but my only exposure to that is \"having to participate in it\" by \"putting a USB key in and running a program along with two of my coworkers\" in order to push the one update we ever pushed with that tooling. I remember we all had to provide our keys and \"if I was out sick, no update was going out\" but I&#x27;m not sure if that was a limitation of what we were using or if we just set them up that way because it was \"alpha\" at the time.None-the-less, very interesting![0] I can imagine, though, that \"under the mattress\" would be the equivalent security to setting your password to \"password\". reply hmottestad 16 hours agoparentWhat about using it to share information with people for them to use in an emergency. Data is stored in multiple locations, but only someone with access to 3 of them would be able to read the data. The existing physical access controls would be the actual safety mechanism. A thief would have to break into 3 locations in order to get the data.We could just encrypt the data and then split the password into three pieces and store those in different locations, but then you would have to store both the data and the password. reply crazygringo 13 hours agorootparentExcept that there are problems with the emergency scenario on both sides:- In an actual urgent emergency, getting in touch with the 3 people and getting the data might be difficult and take days&#x2F;weeks. One is on vacation, another is going to take a couple of days to try to remember where they stored the USB key...- And nothing limits it to emergencies. The 3 people can just get together immediately and examine the valuable information inside, whether it&#x27;s account numbers, crypto keys, a will, etc.So the only value here is in not having to remember a separate password. But I expect it&#x27;s just as likely for people to lose the files entirely as much as it is for them to lose passwords. If you share a password-encrypted file with 5 friends, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if 10 years later, only 1 of them still had it. In that case, better to store file+password per-person, rather than require 3 of them to keep it. reply mjevans 14 hours agorootparentprevStep 1 : Create a compressed (must not &#x27;store&#x27;) archive split into small-ish sections of size N&#x2F;K.Step 2 : Run par2 against the archive sections and create as much parity as possible.Step 3 : Distribute any middle (not the start of the archive, and not the incomplete end piece) segments of the archive and a &#x27;correct&#x27; number of parity &#x2F; recovery packets.If a complete count of the archive and parity pieces are brought together, par2 can recover the remaining pieces of the archive and extraction will be possible.The hashes only (no recovery data) par2 file should be distributed with all copies. reply hgomersall 13 hours agorootparentThis is what Shamir&#x27;s secret sharing algorithm does, just that that has the benefit of being information-theoretically secure. reply Luc 17 hours agoprevThis brings to mind parity files on Usenet.

You could encrypt the file, but encrypting a file requires a key or password, which you could forget or lose.The idea here is: split the file into three parts. Give one part to the bank deposit box, one to a friend, and put one in a safe at home. Now, if you want to restore the original, nobody can restore without getting (for example) two of the three pieces.This is nice because your friend and the bank can’t do anything with their copies alone, and won’t trust each other with their copy normally. But if you lose your piece, you can still ask the friend and the bank for theirs. reply usea 17 hours agoparentprevHiding the fragments is like hiding your password.

You need all the shards of the key to decrypt the text instead of just reaching a threshold.2.

Albeit for slightly different purpose? reply k__ 16 hours agoprevDoes this use a mix of striping with oarity and public key cryptography? reply derefr 17 hours agoprevI was just thinking about something like this problem.At $work, we use multi-signature signing to move cryptocurrency around, so that at least N of M officers of the company need to sign, to prove that \"the company\" actually intends a movement of funds to happen. This ensures that no single officer can embezzle funds; and it also ensures that an attacker would have to do some kind of multi-target simultaneous coordinated rubber-hose attack (rather than just waiting to kidnap one of us when we go on vacation) to get access to the funds.I was trying to think of a way to extend that kind of security to the encryption of data — specifically the encryption of low-level root-account passwords (like an AWS account&#x27;s root password). Shamir&#x27;s Secret Sharing is the obvious first step... but you&#x27;d also then want two additional properties:1. the decrypted secret should not be held even temporarily by any of the parties, but rather should be held by — and used \"through\" — a neutral system, so that the secret is reusable rather than needing to be burned the first time it&#x27;s revealed2. the neutral system — despite being likely owned by a third party! — should have no ability to exfiltrate the password into the hands of the third party.I think this can be workable in the specific case of wanting to use the root password as an HMAC, by doing SSS decryption inside a single-shot non-durable abstract machine with homomorphically-encrypted memory, wrapped in a network daemon: the network daemon spins up a copy of the abstract machine; receives each SSS key split from its owner, feeding each as it receives it directly into the abstract machine; the abstract machine, after receiving sufficient key splits, signals to the daemon that it is now \"empowered\" to sign; and the daemon can then use the abstract machine to HMAC arbitrary plaintexts sent to it, until it exits, and the abstract machine&#x27;s state is lost.The real trick, though, would be making this work for HTTP Basic Auth over TLS, by delegating the generation of exactly one TLS frame — the one containing the Authorization header — to the abstract machine; where the network daemon would then act as an HTTP proxy, inserting this Authentication header into requests made through it. Having something like this could really improve security around the use of a lot of sensitive control-plane APIs!---Of course, in a corporate context, you probably have a third party you can trust with the plaintext — e.g. an Enterprise Password Manager service — so you can relax property 2. In such a case, you don&#x27;t need a fancy abstract machine; you can just ask said service to build a feature allowing secrets to be configured to require N-of-M confirmations by ACLed team-members to unlock them; and to build another feature for \"opaque secrets\" that are never revealed to anyone, but instead are injected into an HTTP Authorization Proxy that the Enterprise Password Manager service spin up themselves on their backend.But it&#x27;s still fun to think about the case where your secret is so secret that you need to hide the plaintext from literally everyone but your co-conspiriators. :) reply muixoozie 16 hours agoparentIf x officers died in a freak accident where there&#x27;s not enough for N to sign, is there a way to recover? reply fbdab103 16 hours agorootparentSeems no different than if all N parties with the key were lost. Is there a backup strategy in case the key people are all wiped out simultaneously? How does ICANN handle it?There was a recent story[0] about a crypto company where everyone \"lost\" the keys (I assume inside job).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37268750 reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, if you plan for it. There are several mitigation strategies for this.The simple approach, if you have enough people you fully trust, is to just have a larger number of participating signers &#x2F; distributed key-splits than you need, such that you don&#x27;t actually need a majority of the key-splits to be used, to achieve a signing quorum. (E.g., instead of 2-of-3 signing, you&#x27;d use 2-of-4 or 2-of-5 signing.)In this setup, usually there&#x27;s a \"core\" of signers who are active participants in the system, where the required quorum size does constitute a majority of the \"core\" of signers; and then there are other \"backup\" signers, who aren&#x27;t normally participants in signing as part of their job duties, but who can be called upon to act as additional signers in an emergency — usually just to participate in a \"handover of power\" (activation of new keys) for new signers (e.g. if the CIO and COO die, and you hire a new CIO and COO.)These signers should not be anyone who any of the \"core\" signers has power over — not any of their reports, not anyone they can fire, and not their own friends or family. (Personal acquaintances from outside the company do make good \"backup\" signers, though — an officer&#x27;s personal accountant is a frequent choice.)Also, ideally, there should not be enough such \"backup\" signers that a single \"active\" signer could collude with the \"backup\" signers to embezzle funds. The signing configuration should still always imply the need for at least two \"active\" signers. (So 2-of-4 &#x2F; 2-of-5 are actually bad configurations; a minimal ideal configuration would be more like 3-of-5 (with one backup signer), or 4-of-7 (with two backup signers); and you don&#x27;t get both \"not a majority\" + \"at least two active\" together until 4-of-9 (2 backup) signing.)A more expensive version of this approach, but one which could be considered more secure and with less required trust, is to give the extra signing key splits needed to achieve a signing quorum to one or more law firms, under contract to only release those key-splits upon a legal notice of demand from all still-living members of the signing group. The law firm must then verify for itself that 1. enough people are dead that the signing quorum condition can indeed no longer be met without first activating one of the offline&#x27;d keys; and 2. exactly all remaining living members of the signing quorum really want the keys released (probably this would be done through in-person individual interviews and notarizations.)Also, to prevent this arrangement from acting as a https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tontine (in the sense that it incentivizes murdering your co-officers), usually there would be a line in this contract stipulating that the keys won&#x27;t be handed over while the still-living signers are under suspicion of directly or indirectly murdering the dead signers; and that the keys will only be handed over after a 60–90-day delay (which gives time for such a suspicion to arise, if relevant.)Another mitigation strategy, that works well in combination with either of the above, is for officers with signing keys to leave their password-locked hardware signing device (smart card, crypto wallet, etc.) with a trusted coworker whenever they&#x27;re going somewhere potentially dangerous; and to leave the password to unlocking said signing device with the executor of their will, only to be released upon their death. In this setup, people who travel are temporarily unable to sign (the person they&#x27;ve entrusted their signing device to doesn&#x27;t have its password, and so cannot sign for them); so travel scheduling + signing configuration must be planned together to ensure that a signing quorum is always possible to achieve. reply cassonmars 13 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t need FHE to do this – what you&#x27;re describing is generically a multi-party compute scheme that can be solved by other means.Since you have familiarity with signatures, I&#x27;ll plant the seed of how this particular MPC scheme works, in parts: Distributed Key Generation, and Circuit Creation and ExecutionThe first step is securely generating a key – but how do you know it was done correctly with SSS? SSS follows what is called a \"trusted dealer\" model, where you assume what generates the Shamir splits has operated correctly, but can we do better than that? Thankfully, yes! Feldman Verifiable Secret Sharing is an enhancement over SSS, where the splits generated are committed to by raising the coefficients of the SSS polynomial to a public generator of an additively-homomorphic group, or in other words, treating the coefficients like private keys, and producing the public keys (as in elliptic curve cryptography, the private key is just a large scalar number, the public key is produced by performing scalar multiplication of the private key against a known public point – the generator, part of the public parameters of a particular curve). By having the public points (A_0, A_1, ..., A_n) corresponding to the coefficients (a_0, a_1, ..., a_n, where a_0 = secret), you can calculate the secret&#x27;s commitment by using x=0, as P(x)=A_nx^n+...+A_1x+A_0 where x=0 cancels out all terms besides the secret&#x27;s commitment. Similarly, you can verify your share split by using x=(your share identifier), then raise your share to the same generator. And finally, to prove that all shares are valid, each person of course must verify their share matches their commitment, but then you can do Lagrange interpolation in the exponent (because the only operations you do over the commitments are multiplying by publicly available scalars (the share identifiers), and adding public points together) across any threshold combination of commitments, they should all resolve to P(0). That&#x27;s FVSS in a nutshell.But this still requires a trusted dealer! You have to trust that the dealer itself is not corrupted and exfiltrating secrets. How can we remove the trust component? By having all share holders perform FVSS – each party creates a random polynomial, samples shares accordingly, sends the shares (securely, of course) to each corresponding party, then everyone individually adds their provided (and self-sampled) polynomial samples. Because polynomials can be added together, you have effectively combined the random polynomials of all parties, without any one party knowing the real coefficients. Then verification involves each party raising their shares to a generator like in FVSS, and publishing their public commitments. The same Lagrange interpolation process is performed to verify all threshold combinations of public points resolve to the same public point – essentially confirming the secret was generated correctly without having to reveal the secret.Now, to use the secret – execution. The technique for this is called Oblivious Transfer – it essentially leverages the same intractability problem of a given cryptosystem (discrete log for elliptic curves) to bootstrap a circuit garbling technique. There&#x27;s many ways to do this, I&#x27;ll explain the simplest form, for two parties:Party 1 generates a public key, private key pair (a, A), and has two choices for messages (m_0, m_1), and sends A to Party 2.Party 2 generates a private key (b), and a choice bit (c), and depending on c: c == 0: Party 2 generates B = b \\* A c == 1: Party 2 generates B = b \\* G + A, where G is the generator of the curve.Party 2 sends B to Party 1Party 1 calculates: e_0 = Hash(a \\* B) e_1 = Hash(a \\* (B - A))Party 1 encrypts m_0 with e_0, m_1 with e_1, and sends both encrypted messages.Party 2 calculates: e_c = Hash(b \\* A)Party 2 decrypts m_c with e_c.Because Party 2 does not know a, they cannot calculate the encryption key for the message they did not choose, as the encryption keys calculated by Party 1 are contingent on an operation on B that cancels out the respective values produced when creating B from the choice, multiplied by the private scalar a.Additionally, because Party 1 does not know b, they cannot determine which choice Party 2 actually made.Now, for a simple choice between messages this seems silly, but this is actually sufficient to bootstrap a logical circuit – any computable circuit can be evaluated through this process of oblivious transfer. What does that give us? The ability to jointly compute operations over data required to be kept private by each side, such as an HMAC. Since HMACs are generally used in idempotent operations, generating the HMAC for a request using an OT circuit is sufficient to do what you&#x27;re wanting.For basic authentication, you&#x27;d need to extend the OT circuit evaluation all the way out to TLS frame construction itself, but is still possible.NB: I am creating a decentralized network, Quilibrium, to make it easy to build and deploy applications that evaluate as OT circuits – MPC TLS is on the roadmap. reply IndigoIncognito 15 hours agoprevSomeone check this mans hard drive reply pottermoreXprt6 9 hours agoprevBoo that&#x27;s not what a Horcrux is! reply owenpalmer 9 hours agoprevClever name reply Mistletoe 13 hours agoprevThe name alone guarantees this program will live on.

Zeeya Merali Twitter Facebook Email Paul Negulescu, Sabine Hadida and Fredrick Van Goor (left to right) developed a combination treatment that targets a malformed protein in people with cystic fibrosis.Credit: Vertex Pharmaceuticals The triple-drug combination Trikafta has given a new lease of life to 90% of people with cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder that affects the lungs and other organs. Now, the trio of researchers who spearheaded its development has won one of this year’s US$3-million Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science. Sabine Hadida, Paul Negulescu and Fredrick Van Goor at Vertex Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, California, developed the treatment by combining different drugs that help a faulty protein to function. “The development of Trikafta has been one of the most phenomenal and outstanding achievements of biomedical research in the last 30 years,” says geneticist and physician Francis Collins at the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in Bethesda, Maryland, who co-discovered the gene for cystic fibrosis in 19891. The award was one of five Breakthrough prizes — awarded for achievements in life sciences, physics and mathematics — announced on 14 September. Life-changing treatment Cystic fibrosis affects around 100,000 people worldwide, and for many years was considered a life-limiting condition. However, a study this year projected that treatment with drugs such as Trikafta (comprising elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) — approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019 — can increase life expectancy from around 30 to more than 80 years2. “I hear almost every day from people who were really in trouble, with cystic fibrosis severely beginning to affect their chance of survival,” says Collins. “Now, after going on Trikafta, they are back at work and thinking about what they might want to do for retirement.” Cystic fibrosis drugs target the malformed proteins at the root of the disease The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which ordinarily spans the membrane of cells that line several organs and is involved in the production of mucus, sweat and other fluids. In people with cystic fibrosis, these proteins are misfolded and don’t function correctly. This causes a build-up of unusually thick secretions, including mucus in the lungs, leading to serious health issues. Once the CFTR gene had been identified, most efforts focused on ways to modify the gene to treat the disease, with little success. The team led by Hadida, Negulescu and Van Goor instead searched for a drug combination to coax the misfolded proteins into functioning correctly. The three drugs in Trikafta work together: two help to deliver more CFTR to the cell surface and the third enables the protein to work better once it is there3. “There was a lot of scepticism that this could be done,” Hadida recalls. “But the patient community was cheering for us.” The drug-discovery process required a marathon effort, testing the effects of more than one million compounds on isolated human lung cells to identify candidate drugs for clinical trials. Hadida says she feels “very excited, honoured and surprised” by the award, adding that credit should be shared by the company, people with cystic fibrosis and their families. Genetic links A second life-sciences prize was awarded for the independent discovery of two genes associated with the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease: GBA14, identified by geneticist Ellen Sidransky at the NHGRI, and LRRK25,6 by neurogeneticist Andrew Singleton at the US National Institute on Aging in Bethesda and neuroscientist Thomas Gasser at the University of Tübingen, Germany. Sidransky describes being “blown away” after learning of her award, especially because she didn’t set out to study Parkinson’s disease. Originally a paediatrician, she moved to researching the rare hereditary disorder Gaucher disease, in which fatty substances build up in various organs because of a mutation in the GBA1 gene. When talking to people with the condition, she realized that many had relatives with Parkinson’s disease, allowing her to connect the dots. “I want to be a cheerleader for research into rare diseases,” Sidransky says. “This is a good example where a study can lead to insights for the wider population.” Last-resort cancer therapy holds back disease for more than a decade Njideka Okubadejo, a neurologist at the University of Lagos in Nigeria, welcomes the award announcement. Okubadejo, Singleton — who leads the Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program — and others have identified a new genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease in the GBA1 gene in people with African ancestry that is rarely seen in those of European descent7. “The next step is to find a biological mechanism by which the gene causes the disease,” Okubadejo says. “Then you can build upon that to reduce the likelihood of the disease occurring.” A third life-sciences prize was awarded to immunologists Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and Michel Sadelain at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City for developing a CAR-T-cell immunotherapy treatment for leukaemia that stimulates patients’ own immune T cells to target and kill cancer cells8,9. This therapy can lead to long-lasting remission of some cancers10. Theories of everything Other Breakthrough winners include John Cardy at the University of Oxford, UK, and Alexander Zamolodchikov at Stony Brook University in New York, who share the physics prize for a body of work on ‘conformal field theories’ — a family of mathematical theories that applies to a huge range of physical phenomena, from boiling water to the surface of black holes. In most situations, the equations are extremely tough to solve exactly, but Zamolodchikov discovered a solution in 2D in the 1980s11, and Cardy built on these results by proposing that the result could be generalized to 4D12 and by applying conformal field theories to better understand phase transitions in materials. Cardy, who was “over the moon” to learn about the prize, recalls learning about Zamolodchikov’s work from two Russian scientists at a conference. “Hardly anybody in the West understood what they were talking about,” Cardy says. “But I came away convinced I had to start working on it.” AlphaFold developers win US$3-million Breakthrough Prize “Cardy and Zamolodchikov truly are giants of conformal field theories,” says David Tong, a physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “There are physicists around the world who are working on extraordinarily different problems, and yet they have a common language through the work of Cardy, Zamolodchikov and others.” Simon Brendle at Columbia University in New York City has won the mathematics Breakthrough prize for his contributions to differential geometry — the study of curves, surfaces and spaces. Among other achievements, Brendle proved ‘Lawson’s conjecture’ concerning the minimal surface of a ‘3-sphere’, which is the surface of a hypothetical 4D sphere13. The Breakthrough prizes were founded in 2012 and are sponsored by Yuri Milner, a Russian-Israeli billionaire, and other Internet entrepreneurs, including Meta’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02890-1 References Riordan, J.

I was mentally preparing myself for inevitable decline and eventual death.Trikafta changed my situation dramatically. I&#x27;ve had no hospitalizations, and most the classic CF symptoms are either gone or extremely diminished. It can&#x27;t undo a life of damage to things like my pancreas, vas deferens, etc, and I still take medicine to digest my food, but overall, it&#x27;s as close to \"normal\" as I could hope for at this point.The only real downside: weight gain. With CF the pancreas is blocked, so you lack in digestive enzymes, and it&#x27;s a struggle to maintain a healthy enough weight to battle respiratory infections. After Trikafta, I gained some 30 pounds, and have a big belly on my small frame, and went up some 6 inches in the waist. To add insult to injury, it happened during the spring and summer of 2020, when buying clothes was a challenge due to the pandemic.Speaking of the pandemic, the timing of Trikafta was amazing: it kept the normally full \"CF floors\" of hospitals empty, opening up those beds for those with COVID and keeping CF patients less exposed.One side effect I should mention: many report extreme anxiety. However, I was starting an anxiety medication for the first time (something I should have done 20 years ago, but alas ...) and so those effects were muted or hidden to me. reply matthewtse 6 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s utterly amazing to hear of another group of sufferers who are the beneficiaries of modern miracle medicine.Personally, I suffered from an extreme case of eczema my whole life, which left me effectively a disabled person. Although eczema doesn&#x27;t have a significant effect on life-expectancy, there wasn&#x27;t all that much to live for, and I had basically given up on being able to do normal things like exercise or travel.So it was very surprising to \"hear the good news\" that Dupixent(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dupilumab) was being released in 2017 (also fast tracked as a breakthrough therapy), I got on it, and it&#x27;s made me 98% a normal person.Here&#x27;s to continued funding for new miracle medicines to help more groups of sufferers. reply maccard 1 hour agorootparentI suffer from allergies&#x2F;hay fever for 3-4 months of the year. When I was a teen I used to take cetrizine which would sort of help, but it left me feeling groggy and tired a lot, which was in some cases worse than the allergies.Fexofenadine became available OTC available in the UK in 2020 and the pharmacist suggested I try it. I don&#x27;t even carry tissues anymore during the summer months. If I ever miss a day though, it&#x27;s immediately obvious.It&#x27;s not life or death, or anything like it, but it&#x27;s a wild improvement in my qualify of life. reply steve_adams_86 6 hours agorootparentprevI know someone with relatively bad eczema and I believe you when you say you believed you had nothing to live for. I’m genuinely glad you were relieved of that. It seems like it can be terrible to live with. reply matthewtse 6 hours agorootparentA sincere thank you :)Yes, the worst was a period of months when I was effectively a burn victim (>70% of body with severe bleeding sores, and fully bedridden). The worst part was that, unlike with a burn victim, it wasn&#x27;t clear to me if I would ever heal out of it.Luckily it got a bit better to at least get out of bed, and then Dupixent came along a few years later. reply konschubert 3 hours agorootparentprevI find it incredibly inspiring and encouraging to see medicine advance.Every new cure discovered also frees up resources to perform more research on the remaining deadly diseases.Cancer, of course, being the big one. reply spondylosaurus 6 hours agorootparentprevDupixent rocks! If you ever get sick of infections, it sounds like JAK inhibitors have opened the door to daily-pill eczema treatments too. reply matthewtse 6 hours agorootparent> If you ever get sick of infectionsI assume you meant \"injections\" :)For the value that Dupixent provides for me (effectively infinite), I&#x27;d do just about anything. So the injections don&#x27;t bother me at all.Though injections do make international travel a bit more complicated. Daily-pill eczema treatments would definitely be more convenient in that respect! reply spondylosaurus 5 hours agorootparentHa! Autocorrect got me, I did mean to say injections ^_^;;Although tbh I have had several nasty infections from then-untreated eczema... reply jxf 6 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t have CF, but I am inspired by the pace of scientific advancement when I hear stories like this one. Thank you for sharing, and I hope every one of your years brings further boosts to your health. reply car 7 hours agoparentprevThank you for sharing this with us, I&#x27;m so glad for you! I can hardly express how amazing this development is to me! I had not heard about it before today. reply trollian 7 hours agoparentprevMy 8yr old daughter has been on Kalydeco (one of the active compounds in Trikafta) since it was approved and it means she&#x27;ll live a fairly similar life to her twin sister, health wise. We only have to do airway clearance treatment when she&#x27;s sick. It&#x27;s crazy for me to think what a different life shed have had even being born a decade before. reply az226 4 hours agoparentprevWhat medicine do you take to digest your food? Can you tolerate onions, garlic, and wheat? reply dclowd9901 4 hours agoparentprevMy brother 12 years ago could have been you, as I read your comment. A double lung transplant and myriad complications later, and he passed on from this world.Reading your experience makes me so happy that people with CF are finally seeing a light of hope in their experiences. You do all the walks, donate the money, remind people this disease exists and it’s so destructive but it always kind of felt like science wasn’t throwing a lot of energy into CF, so I’m so glad to see this development. I’m so happy for you. I wish my brother could have had that chance, but I imagine, given his incredibly generous nature, he’d be just as happy for all the CF survivors today who now have a fighting chance. reply DoreenMichele 7 hours agoparentprevWell, my understanding is you are simply born without a vas deferens (for most men with CF). But some of the other stuff may heal at least partially. reply bdcravens 7 hours agorootparentI believe that the thick mucus present in the body more or less destroys the vas deferens, so we are born with it, but quickly lose it.The scarring of the lungs and pancreas really can&#x27;t be reversed. reply DoreenMichele 7 hours agorootparentWell, I no longer have a hole in my left lung, so I am unable to entirely agree with you. But I also don&#x27;t care to discuss this further on HN. reply bdcravens 7 hours agorootparentHoles != scarring reply Scoundreller 7 hours agorootparentprevok, now you got me wondering... could a pregnant mother take this drug if they&#x27;re at high risk of their fetus having CF (or confirmed via pre-testing) to prevent this?(Or possibly will continue taking it if they have CF as we can expect more CF patients to have children) reply DoreenMichele 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a homozygous recessive disorder. If two carriers reproduce, there is a 25 percent chance the child has CF. If a woman with CF has children with a carrier, there is a 50 percent chance the child has CF and a 50 percent chance the child is a carrier.Ninety-five percent of men with CF lack a vas deferens, leaving them effectively sterile. The medical community is understandably reluctant to assist two people with CF in reproducing together as their child is guaranteed to have CF.If you are at risk of having a child with CF and know it, a best practice is to try to not conceive a child with CF.I doubt taking a drug during pregnancy would prevent a male child from being born without a vas deferens and see no reason to care. Just try to not have a baby with CF. It&#x27;s called a Dread Disease for a reason. reply _ihaque 5 hours agorootparentprevSurprisingly, sort of.It won&#x27;t alter the underlying genetic condition, but there has been at least one case report that taking these CFTR modulators during pregnancy can improve the condition of the fetus&#x2F;newborn:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S156919932...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;med.stanford.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;all-news&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;cystic-fibros... reply DoreenMichele 5 hours agorootparentBoth of these babies are female. I am not at all surprised that the drug helped in the way described in the articles, but it doesn&#x27;t actually indicate whether or not it could impact the vas deferens since that&#x27;s a defect in the male reproductive tract.According to the CF Foundation, the cause of the lack of the vas deferens is not conclusively known.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cff.org&#x2F;managing-cf&#x2F;fertility-men-cf reply trollian 7 hours agorootparentprevNo. reply gustavus 8 hours agoprevMy wife has several family members with CF. They have started on trifekta and it has changed their lives radically to the point the disease barely effects them day to day.It truly is a miracle and a breakthrough, and the only shame is that these brave pioneers are only getting $3 million for their heroic efforts.Meanwhile the actual cost of the medicine is $10k a dose. reply bdcravens 8 hours agoparentThe pricing is more like $25-30K&#x2F;month. It&#x27;s taken twice a day, in pill form. (I have CF and take Trikafta) reply squeaky-clean 7 hours agorootparentPlease tell me insurance pays for most of that? reply Aurornis 5 hours agorootparentNobody actually pays those sky-high drug prices themselves. It’s a scheme to extract as much money as possible from insurers.Companies often have programs that provide the drug free of charge (or at a nominal price) to people without insurance. They might also have “copay assistance” programs where they reimburse patients for their copay to bring the out of pocket costs down.The goal is to maximize the amount billed to insurance companies. They’ll go out of their way to reduce the amount billed to the patient directly, because that results in more patients signing up and enabling them to bill more insurance companies.It’s not a good system, but it’s how things work right now. Nobody pays that $100-300K price themselves. Well, we all do through higher insurance costs. reply masklinn 40 minutes agorootparent> It’s a scheme to extract as much money as possible from insurers. [...] The goal is to maximize the amount billed to insurance companies.A big part of the goal is being able to bill a profit, insurers generally require significant drug rebates for coverage. So you triple the sticker price of the drug, offer a 66% drug rebate which the insurer can advertise to their client under the guise of fighting for their access, and they cover your drug at essentially the price you wanted for it in the first place (modulo nonsense like prior authorization, and insurance kickbacks). reply koolba 4 hours agorootparentprev> Nobody actually pays those sky-high drug prices themselves. It’s a scheme to extract as much money as possible from insurers.Alternatively, we all pay those sky high prices. It’s baked into our premiums. reply hackernewds 3 hours agorootparentwhile employed Premiums = $0. while unemployed, premiums = $3600&#x2F;year for $0 deductibles for private insurance. would you rather pay 10% of your income in higher taxes like so-called universal healthcare providing countries maintain? reply viciousvoxel 34 minutes agorootparentYes, personally. Instead of my employer paying for my healthcare (and that being factored into base salary), I would rather receive that money as salary and pay higher taxes. The idea of employers paying for health insurance in the US only came about in the first half of the last century as a way for companies to attract employees without having to raise&#x2F;compete on salary. reply bdcravens 7 hours agorootparentprevOf course :-)Vertex&#x27;s copay assistance is also very generous, even for those with high income. I have a good developer income, and pay essentially nothing. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentI personally consider copay assistance to be essentially fraudulent as a concept. The drug company is literally paying the patient to invoke an insurance benefit that kicks a bunch of money to the drug company.I imagine that when an auto body shop pays their customers’ deductibles, it is fraud, legally and ethically. reply trollian 7 hours agorootparentprevNot having to deal with insurance & copay shenanigans for my daughter&#x27;s CF meds is one of the things that keeps me at the large tech company I work at... replyBlueskytech 10 hours agoprevI have a friend who has been saved by this and I have two funny points.CF makes you not process food correctly so you can eat a ton of food and not gain weight. After taking this medicine he was upset because his body started processing food correctly and he put on a bunch of weight initially.This really is a life saving cure for most general genetic versions of CF but he also remarked that it’s great they found a cure now because it’s basically a white people disease and the amount of funding it got for a cure was likely going to come under scrutiny. reply spondylosaurus 10 hours agoparentRe.\"white people disease,\" I thought this was a neat excerpt from later in the article (about Parkinson&#x27;s, to be fair, not CF):> Njideka Okubadejo, a neurologist at the University of Lagos in Nigeria, welcomes the award announcement. Okubadejo, Singleton — who leads the Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program — and others have identified a new genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease in the GBA1 gene in people with African ancestry that is rarely seen in those of European descent7. “The next step is to find a biological mechanism by which the gene causes the disease,” Okubadejo says. “Then you can build upon that to reduce the likelihood of the disease occurring.”The distribution of random genes among ethnic subgroups is always an interesting glimpse into the situational tradeoffs that certain genes bring. Like how the gene that causes sickle cell anemia is really good for malaria resistance... but it also gives you sickle cell anemia. Which might actually be a decent tradeoff when malaria is a constant threat, so you can imagine why it&#x27;s prevalent in areas where malaria-carrying mosquitos flourish.Or you hear about different HLA subtypes where like, one variation offers some kind of useful trait or immunity, but it also brings an increased risk of skin cancer, but the people who carry that gene generally lived in an area without much sun and so it was still a net advantage. Until modern times, when those people have descendants across the globe...Also, very glad to hear your friend&#x27;s doing well :) reply pcchristie 9 hours agorootparentAnother interesting link is that between mental health issues (schizophrenia, bipolar) and \"elite\" creativity and the risk of losing the latter if we can ever gene edit the former out of our genome.Siddhartha Mukherjee talks about this in The Gene. reply trollian 7 hours agorootparentWe were just talking about Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death from suicide with my daughter with CF.

My local university or more precisely certain students wanted to drop CF as a cause to support due to those factors. Pretty disgusting and it was quickly dismissed for what it was.

When ebola came to America, we didn’t find a vaccine because it was infecting white people. We funded it because it was impacting Americans. reply DoreenMichele 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not going to stop some people from saying \"The white people are throwing money at this because it&#x27;s a Caucasian condition.\"Historically, male diseases got studied more than female diseases, probably having nothing to do with sexism per se. Most physicians and researchers were male, so they were interested in things relevant to their lives.But that doesn&#x27;t stop people from crying \"Sexism!\" about it. reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparent> not going to stop some people from saying \"The white people are throwing money at this because it&#x27;s a Caucasian condition.\"Some people will always say wrong things. I’ve found it helpful to focus on those who are speaking truthfully, and seeing if I can amplify or even help them. reply DoreenMichele 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not necessarily entirely wrong. Celine Dion is an advocate for the condition because one or more of her relatives had the condition (and died young from it).\"Coincidentally,\" she&#x27;s white.Celebrities somewhat often advocate for a condition they or a relative have. If it has a genetic component associated with a particular ethnicity, well, you are going to find people of that ethnicity advocating for it.So it&#x27;s not outright crazy talk to say the condition gets the amount of funding it gets because it&#x27;s a Caucasian disorder.It&#x27;s unfortunate that it can potentially be spun as some form of racism.

Sales of $180M is not profit, it&#x27;s revenue.Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are making a profit, but pharma company profit margins are usually in the 20-30% range and that&#x27;s for the successful ones, not including all the companies that spend $100M and fail with nothing to show for it.Then add on top the remaining patent life which is usually less than 10 years, after which the cost of the drug will plummet and the originator company will stop making money. reply Scoundreller 6 hours agorootparentprevTens of thousands of patients in USA, and given the massive longevity improvements, that count will go up.

My friends brother was a severe case. It was not easy to raise him and he requires life long care. When the parent die I assume he will have to live in a home. He was non verbal and not self sufficient in most anything. Yet, he was always happy and kind, gentle, and loving. Even when things frustrated him he handled it better than I do now. But I will always remember his parents would discuss openly how blessed they felt that he had been born, and he seemed happy to be alive when I knew him. In some ways I think his parents also liked that when their other kids grew up and moved away Jeff was still there with them.

If you study this further or have already studied this subject, there may be mistakes, or terms I’ve used incorrectly. Please point out such mistakes in the comments, and I will update the article ASAP. Also, note that I’m borrowing the type theory notation from Wikipedia. Java 21 will be released on September 19, 2023, supporting record patterns in switch blocks and expressions. Such syntax is monumental (At least, in Java land). It marks the point where Java could be considered to properly support functional programming patterns in ways similar to Kotlin, Rust, or C#. And it marks the first point where I can say, as a Kotlin developer, that I feel jealous. A brief history of recent Java versions. Java has evolved rapidly in the past 10 years (As of 2023). Java 9 was the last “slow” release, as all subsequent releases happened 6 months apart. Below is a table showing Java updates over the past decade and the major syntactic changes/additions made in each version (Most changes are omitted to stay on topic).

Java 14 stabilised switch expressions, 16 records and instanceof pattern matching, 17 sealed classes, and now, 21 will stabilise record patterns and switch pattern matching. This set of changes allows Java to express one of the foundations of functional programming that the language never could before - Algebraic data types, along with idiomatic ways of using them. Algebraic data types are a concept born from Type theory, which is a branch of Set theory that focuses specifically on questions like “Is an Apple a Fruit?” and other such whimsical conundrums math teachers like to pose to hapless students the world over. A very minimal introduction to some terms from type theory Type theory has quite a lot of meat to it, and most of it isn’t relevant to this article. So, instead of explaining type theory, I will talk about a few specific kinds of types that it would be useful to know about. The Bottom, or Empty Type (⊥) This type describes the set of all values which can’t be computed1. This set is usually empty for any normal programming language (Ø). No object can be cast to bottom since it is an empty set. An example of such a type is Kotlin’s Nothing. It is considered an error for an instance of Nothing to exist. The way Kotlin prevents Nothing from being instantiated is by setting its constructor to be private. The Java version of this type is Void, the wrapper class for the void primitive type. It is, again, impossible to construct a Void instance because its constructor is private. However, Void cannot be considered a true bottom type because a Void variable can still hold null, which means it is technically a unit type2 (more on that below). In that sense, the primitive void does better. There’s absolutely no way to use it as a variable type, so you can’t even have an empty void variable. The Top Type (⊤) This type represents every value of every type - the universal set of values, U. In Kotlin, this type is named Any. And it may be tempting to think Object (the Java equivalent of Any) is a top type, except for the fact that primitives exist. Primitives are wholly separate from Java’s object model, and interact with objects in rather non-standard ways. Because of this, Java technically does not have a top type the way other languages do. Meanwhile, C does as it do and overloads void by using void * to represent a pointer that can refer to a value of any type instead. How droll! Every object can be cast to top since U contains every value that exists. There isn’t much to say about top other than that a variable of this type can hold anything. Including a value of the bottom type. Good luck finding that value, though. The Unit Type (()) This type has only one value. There is only one instance of that one value, and it is impossible to create more of it. Java’s void primitive technically works like this. When a method returns void, you can treat it as if it implicitly returns the sole instance of the void type under the hood (This is not how the JVM handles void). Java deviates from the theoretical norm in that void can never be passed into a method as a parameter. Note The truth is, Java just mashes the bottom and the unit types together to give us void. You can technically simulate the unit type in Java by declaring a new class that is final and has no fields other than a static instance value. You would then be able to treat that instance as the sole unit type value. In fact, this is precisely how Kotlin defines its own Unit. If you navigate to the definition of Unit, you’ll see how simply it is defined; it’s just an object! Unlike Java, Kotlin allows you to use Unit anywhere, including as a parameter to a method. The following snippet is thus legal: fun identity(param1: Unit): Unit = param1 val result = identity(param1 = Unit) // just returns the Unit instance again. The Boolean Type We’re now in familiar territory. The boolean type has two valid values, true and false (Or whatever other names you want to use). Indeed, you don’t even need to use your language’s native boolean type to represent this type; you can do just as well by using a nullable instance of a unit type. If the variable is non-null, it’s true, and if it is null, false. This is of course, a useless waste of time fit only for those interested in obfuscating their source code. So far, we’ve looked at some basic examples of “rules” used to define types in type theory. Let’s move onto the heart of the matter and discuss sum and product types, and how Java 21 allows us to represent them via records and sealed classes. The Product type Product types are composed of two or more constituent types. In general, a product type is a list of two or more types grouped together. A product type’s arity, or degree, is the number of constituent types within it. If you’d like a nice, concrete example of a product type, look no further than the humble C struct: struct some_type { int val1; // Type 1 char *val2; // Type 2 double val3; // Type 3 int val4; // Type 4 }; In the struct above, some_type is a product type composed of four different types: int, char *, double, and int again. Notice that we’re repeating int here. How do we figure out which int is which when we perform operations on some_type? This may seem obvious, but it’s a problem in math, because you have to construct all the building blocks and concepts you use from scratch! In this case, we already have the tools to make this work. We associate each type with the name given to it in the struct (Duh). Mathematically speaking, a product type is not merely a list of types but a list of ordered pairs, where each ordered pair consists of a type and a name associated with that type. For example, we can represent the first value of some_type as the ordered pair (int, \"val1\"). That way, it’s impossible to mix up the two int components; they’ve got different names! But what about tuples like in Python or Rust? You can just think of those as product types where the “name” is the index of the component type in the tuple. some_tuple = (1, '2', True, 5) int_1 = some_tuple[0] # (int, 0) str_2 = some_tuple[1] # (str, 1) ... Why do we call them product types anyway? In set theory, the word product usually refers to the Cartesian product of two sets. Note The Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs made from every possible combination of every element from both sets. You can use set theory notation to express the product of two types A and B as C = A × B. This product operation is not commutative; A × B is not the same as B × A. If you think about it for a bit, you’ll see why: you’d be switching around the order of the declared components! The example I just talked about only uses two component types: A and B. How would we represent some_type, for example? The answer is to chain multiple product operations together, like so: some_type = int × char* × double × int The set of values within a product type could be expressed like this (Please leave your complaints about my (ab)use of math symbols in the comments): C = A × B = {(a, b)a ∈ A, b ∈ B} You could represent the set of all values in some_type like this: some_type = { (val1, val2, val3, val4)val1 ∈ int, val2 ∈ char*, val3 ∈ double, val4 ∈ int } Alright, we’ve established what product types are. What’s this got to do with Java? When Java 16 was released, the record class feature was stabilised. Record classes are a great example of what a product type is. All fields are final; you can’t inherit from these classes either. All of a record’s state is set at the time of its construction3 and once a record is created, that’s how it’ll look for the rest of its lifetime, all 200 milliseconds of it. This contrasts with normal Java classes, which are all over the place. You can have public and private state, there’s hidden state via inheritance that you don’t think about until it pops up like some haunted animatronic on caffeine to jumpscare you with weird bugs, and you can have mutable fields, static fields, and all sorts of other distracting things that yadda yadda yadda… (you get the idea). The problem with normal Java types is that it is impossible to generalise what a type’s components are. And that matters when all you want is to efficiently process data; you have to navigate a maze of potentially nonstandard getters to even get at your data in the first place, let alone munge it. Now, Java never did support destructuring like JavaScript or Rust do. But even if Java had supported it, the spec would still probably restrict that feature to records. Let’s ask ourselves a few questions to better understand why. Note Destructuring is a feature certain languages (very famously, JavaScript) have which allows you to take a complex value, and, to borrow a PHPism, EXPLODE it into its components as a list of completely independent variables. Read more about this feature here. How would you even destructure a normal Java class anyway? A Java class’s internal state includes all its fields, both public and private. However, allowing the extraction of private fields by destructuring doesn’t seem like a good idea; we all know how mad old Uncle Bob gets about breaking encapsulation. So fine, we have to exclude private state. What about public state, then? Let’s first think about this: How do Java objects expose public state? Sure, you can define a field as public, and if you want to prevent undue modification, make the field final. But there is another extremely common approach to this as well. Most Java objects set every field to be private and make all fields accessible only through accessor methods for reading and writing. Unfortunately, there are no language enforced conventions for defining accessors; you could give the getter for foo the name getBar, and it’ll still work fine, except for the fact that it would confuse anybody trying to access bar and not `foo'. Sure, you can use frameworks like Lombok to take away the complexity and uncertainty by slapping a few annotations on your POJO classes, but that doesn’t change the underlying fact that normal classes in Java are very difficult to statically reason about due to how many “variables” contribute to defining the state of a class. I suspect this is one of the problems that prevented the Java Language Specification authors from adding pattern matching to all classes right off the bat.4 To fix this, they created records, an entirely different class hierarchy. There is already a precedent; Java 5 introduced enums, which inherit from java.lang.Enum. Similarly, all records inherit from java.lang.Record. So how do records do what normal classes don’t? Records solve this problem by restricting how they can be defined and rigidly defining the set of properties they can have. Specifically: Records are implicitly final classes and can’t be inherited from. No more illegitimate child classes birthed of a tryst with an entirely different concubine library. Records cannot extend any class but java.lang.Record. This avoids the pitfall of inherited state polluting the record’s code. A record’s components cannot have any visibility modifiers. A record’s components are always final and immutable. This does not extend the immutability to the contents of each record component, however. Only the references of a record’s components are treated as immutable. When you declare a record and do not define getter methods, getters will be defined using very specific syntax. This syntax is very regular; Java just uses the name of the field as the getter’s name. For field a, the getter would be a(). Java will use your definition if you manually define a getter that matches the naming conventions. Otherwise, Java will automatically create a getter method that correctly follows the conventions. The nonstandard getter won’t make much of a difference. The fields that back a record’s components are always implicitly private and are accessed only through getters. (There is a little more to it, but this seems like a good stopping point.) These properties of records guarantee that any new language feature Java brings out that uses records such as pattern matching will always work, because the language spec itself guarantees the behaviour and structure of records. Sweet. Tell me what I can do with them. Pattern matching. Continue… It’s quite a drag to have to write extremely nested code when you have a lot of conditions based on the types of your data. This problem will come into perspective when I introduce sum types further into the article. Pattern matching is a way to statically (Meaning at compile time, as you write the code) verify that certain patterns are present in the data you are processing. Take a look at the example below. Note that the data within A is a Record instance, and could contain any record type. We first try printing r’s contents with normal Java if statements, before doing it with switch pattern matching. record A(Record inner) {} record B(char b) {} record SomeOtherRecord() {} Record eitherAorB() { boolean cond1 = ((int)(Math.random() * 100) % 2 == 0); boolean cond2 = ((int)(Math.random() * 100) % 2 == 0); return cond1 ? new A(cond2 ? new A(null) : new B('e')) : new B('f'); // returns either A or B. } void main() { var r = eitherAorB(); String oldJavaResult = \"\"; if (r instanceof A) { var inner = ((A)r).inner(); // We have to cast it... if (inner instanceof B) { oldJavaResult = String.valueOf(((B)inner).b()); } else if (inner instanceof SomeOtherRecord) { oldJavaResult = null; } } else if (r instanceof B) { oldJavaResult = String.valueOf((B)r.b()); } else { oldJavaResult = \"r does not match any pattern\"; } System.out.println(\"With the old method: \\\"\" + oldJavaResult + \"\\\"\"); // The type is Record. var result = switch (r) { case A(B(char a)) -> String.valueOf(a); // Destructuring! case A(SomeOtherRecord(/* ... */)) -> { // handle it. yield null; } case B(char b) -> String.valueOf(b); default -> \"r does not match any pattern\"; }; System.out.println(result.toString()); } The switch block is clearly better structured than the if-else ladder above. Switch patterns are very powerful when you want to quickly and easily extract deeply nested data without waffling around with instanceof checks and cumbersome type casts. If you ever get a chance to work with Java 21 (May you be blessed with management that isn’t allergic to new Java versions), I’m sure you’ll appreciate this feature. If you’d like to try this yourself, here’s how. Install Java 21 (There’s a handy jdk21-jetbrains-bin package available in the AUR if anybody wants to immediately try it. I use Arch, btw). Copy this code into a main.java and run it with: java --enable-preview --source 21 main.java This also showcases another nice new preview feature, unnamed main methods. In the previous example, we were able to use pattern matching to switch over different record types. Now, let’s set that aside for a second and talk about how we manage choices in Java. Choices, choices… What do you think of when you need a restricted set of alternatives to choose from? Java enums fit that bill; they are composed of a set of static variants and cannot change the data they contain inside. public enum Color { RED(255, 0, 0), GREEN(0, 255, 0), BLUE(0, 0, 255); public final int red; public final int green; public final int blue; Color(int red, int green, int blue) { this.red = red; this.green = green; this.blue = blue; } } The enum above defines three colours, red, green, and blue, with set values for the various fields, and it isn’t possible to change the colour values within without messing up every single place where this enum is used (The values are final in the code above, but imagine if they weren’t). Now, imagine a different problem. You want different colour representations such as RGB, HSL, and CMYK. Maybe just make an enum for it? public enum ColorRepresentation { RGB, HSL, YUV, CMYK } This gives us a nice, restricted set of values we can choose from. But it’s cumbersome to use; if you want to have multiple colour values for different representations, you’d need to store the actual colour data separately and keep a ColorRepresentation enum value within to help figure out what is actually going on… class Color { public final ColourRepresentation repr; public final Number val1; public final Number val2; public final Number val3; } Obviously, this is NOT how anybody who knows Java would design the Color class. A much better way of implementing multiple colour representations without sacrificing readability is to use polymorphism! Listing: Color implemented with an abstract class Now, given a Color instance, you’d just need to check if it is an instanceof your desired colour representation, and you’d be able to access data from that representation. But this implementation has a flaw. How do we restrict what a colour is in our class hierarchy? Any user of your library could create a new RYB class that inherits from Color, or from RGB, for example. This becomes a problem when your library does not expect any new variants of Color to exist or if it does not expect specific Color variants to change their behaviour. Unless the API is designed to be extensible, creating new representations could cause crashes in the best case (So you have a chance of knowing what went wrong) or in the worst case, subtle bugs that affect code far away from the problem’s source. To fix this, we could do a few things: Make all variants final. While this helps, it doesn’t preclude the creation of new variants directly from Color, since it’s impossible to make Color itself final. Ensure that all internal logic always has a default case for unrecognised variants. This will reduce the extensibility of the library, but if that is not a goal, it will help. But this will also be a lot more error-prone; if even one part of the logic forgets to account for the bad case, there’ll be problems. Or, we could use sealed classes or interfaces and kill two birds with one stone. Sum types Java 17’s sealed classes enable design patterns based on the concept of Sum types. Where a product type’s range of values is the product of the value ranges of its constituent types, a sum type’s range of values is the sum. Well, that was pretty obvious from the name… But what does it mean for the range of values to be a sum? Sum types encode that a type can be any one of its constituents at a single time. They are also known as tagged union types because, in type theory, they are usually represented as a type whose range of values is the union set of its components, where each component type is “tagged” with a label. You could express a sum type like this if you were to use my pseudo-type-theory notation: T = A + B + C The set of values that are in T could be expressed with this logical predicate: T = { xx ∈ A ⋃ B ⋃ C } You may be reminded of C’s unions when you hear the term union types. union MyUnion { int intValue; double doubleValue; char charValue; }; MyUnion is composed of three component types, and C allows you to treat a value of MyUnion as a container for any of these three types: union MyUnion myUnion; myUnion.intValue = 42; printf(\"Integer value: %d\\n\", myUnion.intValue); myUnion.doubleValue = 3.14159; printf(\"Double value: %lf\\n\", myUnion.doubleValue); Note that the value of the union is overwritten in the second assignment of doubleValue. If you were to print myUnion.intValue after the second assignment, you’d see gibberish; that’s actually just the bytes of doubleValue cut in half and interpreted as an integer. This exposes the most significant flaw C unions have; there’s no built-in way to know which variant is contained within a union value without external information. Thus, we need an external discriminant to determine what’s inside. Java’s polymorphism can do that for us with instanceof. But Java’s class hierarchy is too open; there’s no way to restrict the number of variants of a Java “union”. What we need are tagged unions, which is exactly what sealed types allow us to represent. The sealed modifier exists to make it clear that you can’t extend a sealed class beyond the classes allowed to inherit from it. This allows the developer to control how users interact with their library’s API. Listing: Color implemented with a sealed class Note the syntax of the sealed class Color. There is a sealed modifier and a permits clause with the names of all the subclasses of Color. permits is used to specify which classes get to inherit from a particular class and is used to prevent any unwanted inheritance. Note also that each implementation of Color is marked as final, so you only get the four colour representations you see here; you can’t make your own. This class hierarchy is locked down. No new classes can inherit from Color, whether they are located in the same package or not. If your class hierarchy starts with a sealed class, you must mark all inheritors (direct or indirect) as sealed, non-sealed, or final. If an inheriting class doesn’t have these modifiers, it is a compile error. Here’s what each of these modifiers mean: sealed - The class cannot be inherited unless the inheritor’s name is mentioned after permits. non-sealed - The class can be inherited normally. Helpful in controlling the scope of custom behaviours. final - The class is a “leaf” in the inheritance tree; you can’t extend it anymore. These modifiers can be used to control exactly how the classes of an API can behave and how they are used. This avoids situations where the only thing stopping everything from exploding are rules that can only be enforced by developers agreeing to not do the wrong thing. Imagine we’re writing code to handle colours based on their format. We already have a nice, restricted way of ensuring there’ll be no funny business. But how would we structure the code that handles the sealed class instances? Earlier Java versions wouldn’t give us much of a choice; the best we can manage is an if-else ladder: Color color = new RGB(255, 0, 0); if (color instanceof RGB) { RGB rgb = (RGB) color; // ... } else if (color instanceof CMYK) { CMYK cmyk = (CMYK) color; // ... } else if (color instanceof YUV) { YUV yuv = (YUV) color; // ... } else if (color instanceof HSL) { HSL hsl = (HSL) color; // ... } else { System.out.println(\"Unknown color type\"); } We could do a bit better if we’re on Java 16+ by using if pattern matching: if (color instanceof RGB rgb) { // ... } else if (color instanceof CMYK cmyk) { // ... } else if (color instanceof YUV yuv) { // ... } else if (color instanceof HSL hsl) { // ... } else { System.out.println(\"Unknown color type\"); } But wouldn’t it be nice to switch on a colour variable and extract the contents at the same time as well the way Rust can? Rust would let you do this, for example: let color = Color::RGB(255, 0, 0); match color { Color::RGB(red, green, blue) => { // ... } Color::CMYK(cyan, magenta, yellow, black) => { // ... } Color::YUV(y, u, v) => { // ... } Color::HSL(hue, saturation, lightness) => { // ... } } Note that these colour values are being destructured in the match block above. How would we get that done with sealed classes? Switch pattern matching with destructuring only works on records, and records can’t inherit from any class but Record… The solution is to just use sealed interfaces. They work in exactly the same way as sealed classes, except even records and enums can implement them. public sealed interface Color permits RGB, CMYK, YUV, HSL { // Common properties or methods for all color representations String getDescription(); } record RGB(int red, int green, int blue) implements Color { public String getDescription() { return \"RGB Color: (\" + red + \", \" + green + \", \" + blue + \")\"; } } record CMYK(double cyan, double magenta, double yellow, double black) implements Color { public String getDescription() { return \"CMYK Color: (\" + cyan + \"%, \" + magenta + \"%, \" + yellow + \"%, \" + black + \"%)\"; } } record YUV(int y, int u, int v) implements Color { public String getDescription() { return \"YUV Color: (Y=\" + y + \", U=\" + u + \", V=\" + v + \")\"; } } record HSL(double hue, double saturation, double lightness) implements Color { public String getDescription() { return \"HSL Color: (H=\" + hue + \", S=\" + saturation + \"%, L=\" + lightness + \"%)\"; } } And here’s how you can neatly pattern-match and extract the data out of a Color instance, which is nice if all you want to do is get the data out of the class without calling any methods on it: Color color = new RGB(255, 0, 0); switch (color) { case RGB(int red, int green, int blue) -> { // red, green and blue are in scope here. } case CMYK(double cyan, double magenta, double yellow, double black) -> { // ... } case YUV(int y, int u, int v) -> { // ... } case HSL hsl -> { // you can also leave the value intact and directly use the pattern matched value. System.out.println(hsl.getDescription()); } case null -> { System.out.println(\"How did color become null?!\"); } } Note Java 21 allows you to catch the null case within switch blocks and expressions now, so you don’t need to precheck for null before you get to a switch. You may notice we aren’t using a default case here. Java would have normally raised an error stating that all cases haven’t been covered. However, because Color is a sealed class, Java can tell that every case has been handled. Guards! Guards! Did I mention we’ve got guard clauses? Guard clauses! You can attach additional conditions to switch arms that have to be true for the arm to be executed! Guard clauses allow the succinct expression of more complex conditions within switch statements and expressions. No more extremely nested if conditions in your switches. Consider a situation where we need to special-case RGB colours where red > 200 is true. Before, we had to put that condition inside an if condition within the corresponding case’s body: switch (color) { case RGB(int red, int green, int blue) -> { if (red > 200) { System.out.println(\"Very red.\"); } else { System.out.println(\"Not that red...\"); } } // ... } That isn’t the ugliest thing ever, but it still means you end up nesting your code a bit more in the long run. It’s generally easier to parse code that stretches out vertically than horizontally since there are fewer scopes to keep track of. Java 21 allows us to integrate that condition within the case label with the when keyword. switch (color) { // A guarded destructuring case. case RGB(int red, int green, int blue) when red > 200 -> { System.out.println(\"Very red.\"); } // You can use guards with direct pattern matching as well. case RGB rgb when rgb.green > 100 -> { System.out.println(\"Sort of green...\"); // ... } // this case is needed to preserve exhaustivity. case RGB rgb -> { System.out.println(\"Not that red...\"); // ... } // ... } Note Java will still eagerly match whichever case evaluates to true first, so make sure to put more specific cases (guarded or not) first, followed by less specific ones. Ugh, exceptions (ft. an example from JEP 441) We have a new class of exceptions to deal with now. Specifically, java.lang.MatchException5. What happens when a pattern match goes wrong? Consider the case of a bad record getter implementation: record R(int i) { public int i() { // bad (but legal) accessor method for i return i / 0; } } static void exampleAnR(R r) { switch(r) { case R(var i): System.out.println(i); // i's accessor always throws! } } The switch block above will throw a MatchException because when i’s getter is called, an ArithmeticException is thrown. JEP 441 states: (A record accessor method which always throws an exception is highly irregular, and an exhaustive pattern switch which throws a MatchException is highly unusual.) Exhaustive switch blocks will throw if none of the specified variants can match the selector. Regarding this, the JEP states: (An exhaustive switch over an enum fails to match only if the enum class is changed after the switch has been compiled, which is highly unusual.) A MatchException will also be thrown if a guard clause raises an exception when executed. static void example(Object obj) { switch (obj) { case R r when (r.i / 0 == 1): System.out. println(\"It's an R!\"); default: break; } } The example here is very easy to spot; we can easily statically determine that there’s a divide-by-zero error here. However, the waters would be muddier if the dividend were to be a dynamic, possibly 0 value. As my late grandfather (A doctor) always said: Divide by zero, not even once. Conclusion In this article, we’ve looked at a bunch of things that Java 21 allows us to do (I haven’t covered certain things like how generics interact with switch patterns, however). In the next one, I’ll show you some interesting quirks and a few practical examples of how we can leverage these functional building blocks to improve how we write Java code.

There are also more Gotchas in Go compared to Java. reply ashishb 6 hours agorootparentprevFully compiled languages have another huge advantage. If you write a tool in Python and targeted say Python 3.10 then people using Phython 3.9 might not be able to use it. So, you really can&#x27;t use latest and greatest features of Python 3.11 or 3.12. However, with Go, you can build your tool in Go 1.21 or whatever, and the user does not even need a Go toolchain on their machine.I was planning to write a small side-project to generate GitHub Actions boilerplate.

It sets up systemd so you don&#x27;t need to use Docker.

Mac users get a bundle. Linux, well, Linux users get a deb that sets up the app+its apt repo, or a tarball. Maybe in future a FlatPak or Snap or something else.It knows how to bundle and minimize a JDK along with your app as part of the release process.

But adding them will make go look like java.I just wish java would add null safety in the type system in a first citizen way.For enterprise use java has no competitors. You have c# which is microsoft trying to estabilish nash equilibrium fu*ing the developers. I am a bit worried about ever increasing complexity and a steep learning curve, but seems like this is a problem on all fronts. reply neonsunset 8 hours agorootparentJava is an inferior language to C#. To get a superior language you would likely have to go for Kotlin. There is no comparison, because Java gets features today that C# had for years. Not even mentioning having to retrofit green threads because adopting async&#x2F;await (used by TS, Rust, Swift and other languages) is impossible at this point. reply bad_user 4 hours agorootparentC# does not have virtual threads. What C# has is async&#x2F;await. Which was nice for its time, but at the same time it&#x27;s an error prone design, as computations should never start async by accident, blocking should be the default. C# also has no useful interruption model. Java&#x27;s interruption model is error prone, but at least you can work with it.Async&#x2F;await also splits the standard library and the ecosystem in 2 (blocking vs non-blocking, or blue vs red), and it can&#x27;t automatically update the behavior of old code.The introduction of virtual threads in Java also works well with \"structured concurrency\", as seen with Kotlin&#x27;s Coroutines. Kotlin&#x27;s approach to concurrency is also superior to that of C#, actually. But what&#x27;s interesting about Java is that its evolution is often one that involves runtime changes, lifting all boats. Java engineers preferred pushing more changes in the runtime, and somewhat ironically, the JVM ended up being the true multi-language runtime.Java is a good case study of how languages should evolve. It has extreme backwards compatibility, and features being pushed are assessed for how they impact the whole ecosystem, including libraries or languages not in Oracle&#x27;s control. Project Loom was developed in the open, compared to what Microsoft usually does. reply neonsunset 4 hours agorootparentDo give async&#x2F;await in C# a try, it has all the structured concurrency features other languages have to invent APIs and special syntax for :)(if you want to take a look at good structured concurrency, you might be interested in Swift implementation) reply orra 26 minutes agorootparentBut async&#x2F;await is special syntax. I agree it&#x27;s a nice improvement over using Task APIs directly. reply bad_user 4 hours agorootparentprevI worked with C# professionally.The async&#x2F;await syntax works with the language&#x27;s other statements, but for a long time it had gotchas. It doesn&#x27;t qualify as \"structured concurrency\", and it has the aforementioned issues — it&#x27;s (accidentally) error-prone, it splits the ecosystem in two, and has no interruption model.I am not familiar with Swift, but I think you can hardly beat Kotlin&#x27;s implementation. This is a good introduction from Kotlin&#x27;s lead:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Mj5P47F6nJg reply neonsunset 4 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"it splits the ecosystem in two\"? I never observed such split, certain methods intentionally offer sync and async variants.Interruption is achieved through cancellation tokens and has to be handled by consuming methods. There is no way around it because interrupting execution at an arbitrary point would lead to all kinds of issues regardless of the language (unless it implements some form of transaction abstraction and rollbacks all uncommitted changes). reply bad_user 40 minutes agorootparentThose \"cancellation tokens\" from C# are a band-aid.In Java, you don&#x27;t need to initialize those \"tokens\" manually, because the interruption signal is baked into Threads. Moreover, a lot of the standard library cooperates with Java&#x27;s interruption, which is why you see plenty of methods throwing `InterruptedException`; and it&#x27;s also reflected in types such as `CancellableFuture` or the `Flow.Subscription` (reactive streams). Of course, user-level code that isn&#x27;t well-behaved, can end up catching InterruptedException, or resetting the interruption signal, without actually interrupting. This makes Java&#x27;s interruption model somewhat error-prone, but it&#x27;s workable, and at least it&#x27;s baked in.Note that interruptions could also be preemptive, as you don&#x27;t necessarily need cooperation. If you think of the call-stack, or flatMap&#x2F;SelectMany in reactive APIs, the compiled code could check the interruption flag automatically and interrupt the call chain.And resource leaks aren&#x27;t necessarily a problem, if the interruption protocol is well-thought-out. In Java, try&#x2F;finally still works in the presence of interruption, since at worst you get an `InterruptedException`. It&#x27;s not ideal because you can interrupt the interruption process, and in truth the ideal would be for interruption to be its own communication channel, complementing that of exceptions. But it&#x27;s totally doable, and here I am familiar with several libraries from Scala&#x27;s ecosystem, namely Cats-Effect, Monix, and ZIO that show it (with limitations imposed by the runtime).Either way, what C# provides is basically next to nothing. In fairness, some C# libraries tried fixing it, such as Rx.NET, but it&#x27;s not enough. And the aggregate result in the .NET ecosystem is that interruption is not something people design for. Like what to interrupt a network socket? This ends up being a setting, presented as a timeout in case of inactivity, as a configuration of the connection, instead of a higher-level generic function that can be applied on the consumer side. And the probability for resource leaks goes up actually, because in the presence of concurrent races, you really need interruption. reply kamma4434 1 hour agorootparentprev> regardless of the languageThat’s a choice, but it is unfortunate for the programmer.

While C# indeed has many cool features, I do think it has already went into C++ territory where all the different, independently cool features have very non-trivial interactions that make it very hard to reason about.Also, async-await is not a good thing — virtual threads are superior in every way in case of a managed language. reply neonsunset 2 hours agorootparentWhy async&#x2F;await is not a good thing?

It’s especially baffling that they realized the issue with implicit nullability and got rid of it (though not with Java methods, which opens another can of worms), then went and intoduced implicit “exceptionality”.The correct way to deal with Java’s checked exceptions would have been introducing a Result type, or, preferably, type algebra, like in TypeScript, so something like: fun openFile(fileName: String): FileFileNotFoundException {…}Then you could handle it similarly to null: val content: StringFileNotFoundException = openFile(“myfile.txt”).?read() …then you have to do a check before you use content as a String…or val content: String = openFile(“myfile.txt”)?.read() ?: “File not found”(There could also be other possible ways of handling the exception, like return on exception, jump to a handling block, and so on.)In fact, null should be treated as an exceptional value the same way all exceptions should be. reply iopq 5 hours agorootparentprevChecked exceptions are gross, they get in the way when you&#x27;re prototyping, and you end up just ignoring them anyway (since you&#x27;re prototyping) reply quelltext 5 hours agorootparentThe ergonomics of checked exceptions may be debatable but compared to golangs explicit error handling at essentially each function call is definitely worse. reply guideamigo_com 39 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t mind Go&#x27;s errors.

I mean, even `sync.Map` is specialized for two specific use cases instead of like Java&#x27;s ConcurrentMap that is of general purpose. And In Java there are concurrent sets, queues, barriers, phasers, fork-join pools, and etc. I&#x27;d assume that even with Go&#x27;s go routines, we can find great use of such containers, right? At least fork-join is not that trivial to implement. And using mutex everywhere seems just so... low level.I understand that there are 3rd-party implementations, but concurrency is so tricky to get right that I would be really hesitant to adopt a 3rd-party package, unless it is as mature as Java&#x27;s JCTools or Google Guava, both of which are also backed by a large number of users and developers. reply segfaltnh 6 hours agorootparentBecause the predominant patterns are to do concurrency with message passing, so having multiple goroutines trying to mutate the same container is the exceptional case (though as you say, mutexes are the answer when needed). Another reason is containers are embedded features not stdlib, which has huge implications to how willing someone is to go against the grain, for better and worse. reply za3faran 1 hour agorootparentIronically, golang does not have constructs to build immutable types to pass them around, while Java does (records). reply bbkane 5 hours agorootparentprevYet another reason is that you really want generics for container types and Go&#x27;s generics are relatively new reply insanitybit 11 hours agoparentprev`Executor.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor` versus `go` really gets to the heart of why I think that Go developers aren&#x27;t going to be switching.edit: Sorry, it&#x27;s actually: try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) { executor.submit(...) )instead of `go` reply erik_seaberg 11 hours agorootparentYou’re likely to need a lot of boilerplate that “go” statement won’t generate: pass and wait for completed results, report errors, timeouts, cancellation, bounded parallelism, pushback, service monitoring. reply insanitybit 11 hours agorootparentMy comment is perhaps too glib.

The threads have to have low overhead, so that I don&#x27;t have to think about whether I should create a new one or not.Kernel threads are for parallelism and scaling across cores. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentprevThe JVM automagically swaps out blocking network calls executing in a virtual thread to a non-blocking implementation, so potentially many other requests can be served in the same time.So you get the benefit of async frameworks, with none of the negatives: the blocking model is trivial to reason about, read, maintain, and works perfectly with tooling (you won’t get an exception in some WhateveScheduler, but at the exact line where it actually happened. Also, can step through with a debugger). reply osigurdson 4 hours agoparentprevI once posted an what are your build times.

So if you do if (x instanceof Foo) { ... } else if (x instanceof Bar) { ... } ...then your code will break at runtime if someone adds a new class, as that code won&#x27;t expect it. So the article is saying the solution is to use the new \"sealed\" interfaces feature, so nobody can create any new classes implementing that interface, and your \"if\" statement will not break.Surely object-oriented programming already thought about that and already solved that? (I know object-oriented programming is out of vogue at the moment, but Java is an object-oriented language.)The solution there is to add a method to the interface, and all your classes implement that. Then rather than having a massive if&#x2F;switch statement with all the options, you call the method.That is better than preventing people from extending your code, it allows them to extend your code. They just have to implement the method. And the compiler will force them to do that, so they can&#x27;t even accidentally forget.The example given of color spaces (RGB, CMYK etc.) is a great example. I can absolutely imagine writing code which uses color spaces, but then some user or client having a need to use a weird obscure color space I haven&#x27;t thought of. I wouldn&#x27;t want to restrict my code to saying \"these are the color spaces I support, due to this massive if&#x2F;switch statement listing them all, the code is written in such a way that you can&#x27;t extend it\". reply pkolaczk 1 hour agoparentThe solution with sealed classes also allows anyone to extend the code, but in a different dimension than the solution with an interface method.The solution with interface method and virtual call is very inflexible when you want to add new operations instead of adding new classes. If you want to just add one new operation, then you have to go to all the implementations and add new methods. And you possibly break the implementations you don&#x27;t have access to. And all those methods must be defined in a single class, even if they are unrelated to each other. This seriously degrades code readability (and performance as well - those vcalls are not free either).The sealed class extends much better in this case. You just add a new switch in one place and done. No breaking of backwards compatibility.This is the famous expression problem.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkolaczk.github.io&#x2F;in-defense-of-switch&#x2F; reply nine_k 1 hour agoparentprevThere are valid use cases for that.Consider a security interface of some sort, e.g. such that validates a security token.With a normal interface, it is easy to implement it and ignore the token (allow all), siphon off the token, add a backdoor, etc. If a class doing that is somehow injected where a security check is done, it can compromise security.Now with a sealed interface, there cannot be new, unanointed implementations. If you get an object that claims to implement that interface, it&#x27;s guaranteed to be one if the a real, vetted implementation that does the actual security check, not anything else. You&#x27;ve just got rid from a whole class of security bugs and exploits. reply kaashif 12 hours agoprevNice article as someone familiar with sum types but not sum types in Java.I don&#x27;t know if sum types alone are enough to get me to like Java, pervasive nullability is still around and even rears its head multiple times in this article. reply leapis 11 hours agoparentNullable is a huge issue in Java, but annotation-based nullability frameworks are both effective and pervasive in the ecosystem (and almost mandatory, IMO).I&#x27;m really excited about https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jspecify.dev&#x2F;, which is an effort by Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc to standardize annotations, starting with @Nullable. reply kaashif 11 hours agorootparentThis can never be as effective as changing the default reference type to be not nullable, which would break backwards compatibility, so you can never really relax.I know Kotlin is basically supposed to be that, it has a lot of other stuff though, and I haven&#x27;t used it much. reply martindevans 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s basically what c# has done.

People get good at modeling problems in Java, but that doesn&#x27;t mean Java is the right language to model all problems in.A problem that is best represented as stateless functions processing data is a miserable fit for Java, a problem that is best represented as thousands of threads going off to do independent work and then unifying results, is a bad fit for Java.Sure Java can be used, and I&#x27;m sure as an experienced Java developer you instantly thought of how to model those problems in Java, but experienced users of languages that map naturally to those problem domains don&#x27;t have to think of how to translate to their chosen programming language, because the language is a natural fit for that particular problem domain.As a trivial example, I once saw Java used to parse a raw binary stream that had a lot of unsigned ints in it. Miserable usage of Java, tons of wasted space. In a language like C&#x2F;C++, or even C#, it was possible to just directly map a structure onto the raw byte stream, but for Java they had to read each unsigned 32bit INT into a 64bit INT to ensure no overflow.Horrible mismatch, lots of unnecessary allocations, ugly code, wrong tool for the job! reply ivan_gammel 4 hours agorootparent> Java&#x27;s reliance on traditional OO means that only a small subset of business domains naturally map to the language&#x27;s constructs.In my career I worked on a really wide range of business domains and have not even noticed the problems you are talking about.The problem of mapping certain types like unsigned int that you mentioned is rather rare integration scenario.

Your advocacy is important, we of course need progress and testing new concepts. Yet what ultimately matters is business value and user experience.

The .NET CLR introduced this in 2005, bettering the JVM. Java was in a sleepy slow release mode back then. We&#x27;ve been waiting 18 years for value types and proper generics - Valhalla has been just about ready for a very long time.

C# may be a better language, but the difference is minimal. Most C# developers claiming that C# is a better language often don&#x27;t know Java. I remember one C# guy telling me that Java didn&#x27;t have closures before Java 8, which was not quite true. Java developers had access to Groovy which had closures. Groovy may be another programming language, but it has always had 99% Java syntax compatibility and they both compile to the same byte code and work seamlessy together. Groovy 4 also has LINQ if you like that. And using Groovy is no harder than including it as a dependency in Gradle&#x2F;Maven.Java eco system is so vast, and of top notch quality, with excellent documentation available for free. It enables businesses to move faster, at a pace most other languages cannot offer. It&#x27;s not perfect, especially I find data sciene libraries lacking in Java compared to what the Python eco system offers. But depending on the task I try to choose the right tool for the job, not the same language for every job. reply paulddraper 5 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s because C# only \"recently\" became cross platform in a reasonable way.Hard to overstate the mindshare that it lost for that reply 5e92cb50239222b 3 hours agorootparentAnd it&#x27;s still not as cross-platform as Java is, or pretty much all other tech stacks. FreeBSD and commercial UNIXen are not supported at all. If you prefer to develop on macOS or Linux (hi there), you don&#x27;t get access to many Windows-only tools (mostly for debugging and performance measurement). Microsoft only cares about other operating systems to inasmuch as you can host the resulting application there, but really expects you to develop on Windows. Which makes sense... for them. reply neonsunset 3 hours agorootparentFor Linux and macOS you can use Rider and CLI tooling (as expected for most other langs), VS Code is up there but obviously does not come with profiling or advanced debugging tools.The bias does exist but it&#x27;s going away, especially that now a lot of developers are moving over to M-series macs. reply mrkeen 2 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve written in C#. It&#x27;s Java. If they&#x27;re not the same language to you, you need to learn more languages. reply mu53 6 hours agoparentprevIts a good language, but the corporate sponsor and community is suspect. Microsoft has a long history of user hostile actions. The types of companies that use C# often treat SWE as second class. Learning and using C# limits career options to low salary, high stress jobs. reply neonsunset 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m going to vouch for this comment but not because it is correct but rather it presents good opportunity to address the concern.C# and .NET are most heavily invested in by Microsoft which owns and steers its development, that is true. It is also true that JVM world sees investment from multiple MSFT-sized corporations.And yet, despite the above, it keeps moving forward and outperforming Java on user experience, performance and features despite being worked on by much smaller teams. I think it stands on its own as a measure of a well-made technology.In addition, you can look at source code and contribute yourself, 90% of what makes .NET run is below. Almost all development happens in the open: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;installer https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;roslyn https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;aspnetcoreCould Microsoft do a better job at making it even more community-facing and attempting to make the .NET foundation as a sole owner and steering committee of the language itself? Sure. But it&#x27;s not that bad either today. Quick reminder - Oracle is not exactly a saint, perhaps even worse (MSFT has never gotten into any litigation even remotely related to .NET or C#).As for career opportunities, as other commenters would note, this is highly specific to a region and does not translate globally. Again, we are discussing the \"how good the language&#x2F;platform is\" first and foremost. I don&#x27;t see startups adopting Go because of the market or trusting Google not to rug pull them...so perhaps we can do a better job so the next language of choice they pick is C#, which has much higher ROI in the hands of the good developers (for example, it can be very easy to adopt as a second language if you are well versed in Rust). reply catlover76 4 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have as much experience or knowledge as others in this thread, but just taking the opportunity to chime in that C# is a great language, and pretty pleasant to work with. And it was a language to which I was introduced as a 24 year old at a venture-backed startup, not at like Boeing or the company Dilbert works at or something.It has features like LINQ. It has routinely had a lot of good updates, new features always coming out, increases in performance, etc. The primary thing lacking has been good support for developing and deploying on Linux, and a couple other devops-related things. It&#x27;s a shame to see that holding it back, but at least MSFT actually opened up Linux support at all (nobody thought they would). reply bbkane 4 hours agorootparentprevSee https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isdotnetopen.com&#x2F; for why people think .NET has openness issues reply Bognar 5 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft uses C# internally and has a vested interest in making it better for all of its own developers, as well as making it good to increase industry adoption so it has a larger pool of skilled developers to hire from. Your arguments about who backs the language don&#x27;t hold water. reply iopq 4 hours agorootparentDoes it have a vested interest to make everything work cross-platform? reply neonsunset 4 hours agorootparentWell, Linux has won the cloud meaning it is and will be a primary target for .NET.I&#x27;m not sure what vested interest MSFT had in some of the changes introduced for iOS in .NET 8, but now it can be targeted with NativeAOT too, so there is clear investment and dev effort both from community contributors and MSFT employees to support various platforms.Somewhat arbitrary example, there is also a project to support RISC-V (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;issues&#x2F;84834). reply paradite 6 hours agoparentprevWe live in bubbles.In my limited 6 years of professional experience as a software engineer, I have never met a single person who writes C# or .NET. reply equasar 1 hour agoparentprevSecond this. But here in hacker news, C# is hated for no reason, just the old Microsoft mantra and NET Framework reply devjab 5 hours agoparentprevIt’s because C# is only really nice on the surface. As soon as you actually do something with it that takes it beyond its cozy CRUD, it becomes such a nuisance to work with.We have an ODATA client that we build our selves to use in our React frontend. Now, this would obviously not have been something we also used on the backend if we knew what we know now, but it’s the perfect example to illustrate my decades of experience with C#. We had the client because we use a lot of Office365 and BC36 APIs and they are ODATA, and since we had the client we figured we might as well use ODATA on our internal APIs. Which was all well and good until we tried mixing EntityFramework, ASP versioning and ODATA together. These are all Microsoft packages mind you, and they just don’t work together. They each use the Model builder magic that C# comes with, but they each use it differently enough that things become a nightmare. Which basically sums up why C# has been a terrible language for its entire existence.If you never get to those breaking points, then C# is fine. But when you use it for what you’d assume it was intended for, well… At least the ODATA experience sort of triggered my C# PTSD from back when I wrote an admin system to maintain all the thousands of school printers and computers in a municipality, which was hefty Active Directy work and an absolute nightmare to the point where I literally had to either extend or rewrite half the Microsoft packages because they either weren’t finished or outright terrible (again likely because they weren’t finished). Similar to how the ODATA, ASP versioning and EntiryFramework packages aren’t really finished right now. I mean, I can look at the road map for EF and see some of our issues as planned fixes on who knows when. Anyway, since those days more than a decade ago, it’s become obvious that if you want to do anything AD related then you need to use PowerShell and not C#, really, C# doesn’t even run in Azure runbooks and Python does so it’s obvious that Microsoft themselves don’t really use a whole lot of C# for that part of IT operations internally. And I think it’s frankly the same with a lot of things. The ODATA package seems to fall in that same “not used by Microsoft” box. Because it appears to be some sort of “fork” that’s mostly maintained by a single employee in China.So yes, if you just use regular ASP and EF without versioning or ODATA to do very standard CRUD monolith APIs it’s a language that’s both fast and productive. Sure you’ll still need to do all sorts of silly things with your Azure DevOps pipelines to get EF migrations for Microsoft’s own SQL server to work, but hey, you can. But if you’re actually going to be doing things that takes it beyond it’s “basics” then no, C# is really not the language people are looking for but don’t know about.I’m also partly in the “Java is sort of 10 years late with 21” club, but it’s not like anyone has switched away from Java in those 10 years, and really, it’s not like it was a fun experience to go through the .Net -> .Net Core -> .Net, .Net Standard and .Net Core -> .Net years, so maybe Java did it right? reply zigzag312 2 hours agorootparentYour issue seems to be with packages provided by Microsoft, not C# language itself. Model builder magic is part of those packages, not C# language. These types of libraries often make simple things quick and easy, but complex things (or just simple customization) much harder or even impossible. reply romanovcode 6 hours agoparentprev> C# keeps being the language people are looking for but don&#x27;t know about.Every time I point out about C# most programmers are saying about evil Microsoft and being locked in the ecosystem. Most programmers I&#x27;ve met do not even know that .NET Core is MIT open-source and runs on any device.I really wish C# would be more widely used because it is amazing, and for sure 10 times better then Java. reply acheron 12 hours agoprevIn other news, we have an upgrade path at work to go from Java 8 to Java 11 pretty soon. reply MBCook 11 hours agoparentWe (finally) upgraded last year from 8 to 17.

But I&#x27;m not sure how much of what the tool is measuring is really tied to stress response, versus just demonstrating this direct inspiration&#x2F;heart rate correlation reply kbre93 12 hours agoparentAs you breath more slowly, heart rate oscillations (i.e. the variability) increase, which is a reflection of the parasympathetic nervous system activating (the \"rest and digest\" response). This can help to mediate the stress response, which from the sympathetic nervous system or the fight-or-flight response. reply sirsinsalot 12 hours agorootparentIt is interesting that I, and many others, experience our digestive cycle as anxiety.At certain points in my digestion, my HR spikes, anxiety spikes, impending doom sensations occur.These are also sensations that happen with pre-stroke SNS responses.Rest and digest, indeed! reply polishdude20 12 hours agorootparentI get something similar in that I start to feel a tiredness come on about 2-5 mins before I start to get gas pains. If I don&#x27;t help that gas along (by moving or pushing on my stomach) in short order, it turns into me needing to run for the toilet. It&#x27;s as if the trapped gas, left untreated, triggers a rapid digestive emptying. Or, the cases where I can receive the gas, there&#x27;s no other contents in the way. The cases where I can&#x27;t relieve it, well, there&#x27;s lots of stuff in the way.Anyways the thing is that I get super tired before the pain in my stomach is even noticed.

Abstract We present an approach to modeling an image-space prior on scene dynamics. Our prior is learned from a collection of motion trajectories extracted from real video sequences containing natural, oscillating motion such as trees, flowers, candles, and clothes blowing in the wind. Given a single image, our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a per-pixel long-term motion representation in the Fourier domain, which we call a neural stochastic motion texture. This representation can be converted into dense motion trajectories that span an entire video. Along with an image-based rendering module, these trajectories can be used for a number of downstream applications, such as turning still images into seamlessly looping dynamic videos, or allowing users to realistically interact with objects in real pictures. With stochastic motion textures, we can simulate response of object dynamics to an interactive user excitation. Try it yourself! Click and drag a point on the image below, release to see how the scene moves! Try a different image by clicking on the icons below: We can minify (top) or magnify (bottom) animated motions by adjusting the amplitude of motion textures. Slow-motion videos can be generated by interpolating predicted motion textures.

(stretch goal: particles.) there&#x27;s a tiny bit more to it than this, but that&#x27;s most of it.for someone who calls themselves a game developer as opposed to an expert user of certain software, this should all be completely straightforward to write in a weekend, because these lower-level constructs—underpinnings to higher-level abstractions found in general-purpose game engines like Unity and Godot—arise naturally from thinking about the things the computer needs to do (functions) and keep track of (structs, arrays of structs, pointers) to make your gameplay come alive, more generally, unbound by tool-specific mental schemas. I&#x27;m not suggesting one write a game in assembly, but merely something a bit closer to that than GameObjects and Components or Nodes. proving to yourself that you don&#x27;t need such abstractions to make a game is empowering, and causes \"game engines\" to be somewhat demystified for you, unlocking a breadth of new knowledge, understanding, and possibly even inspiration—if you&#x27;ve only ever thought about game development in terms of the high-level abstractions specific to a general-purpose game engine. reply fennecfoxy 1 hour agorootparentAh damn bruh, I guess my artist friends aren&#x27;t really artists since they don&#x27;t know how to program photoshop from scratch.

I hope these kind of companies die quickly. reply lifechoseme123 16 hours agoprevTLDR: Don&#x27;t bet on Unity&#x27;s success. Bet on their collapse. The place has zero integrity in management. I&#x27;ve never worked at a worse managed place, and I hope I never do again.(Disclaimer: two of my three engineering managers were actually very good skilled engineers and managers (the one bad one was the \"people manager\", who \"always knew he wanted to be a manager\" and was put in charge of an engineering team... he had followed an engineering director from app dynamics). It&#x27;s the business management steering the ship that I think is the problem)I used to work at Unity. I left quickly after what I saw.The biggest problem at Unity: Internal Distractions. Slack channels are filled with political discussions (As you might venture to guess: It&#x27;s a race to the bottom of the Oppression Olympics-- lots of \"no my group is more marginalized!\" \"no mine is!\" type of people).Me, as a Software Engineer-- I was working while other employees were arguing about political issues (as if they could change each others minds-- unlikely, and a waste of time.)I thought \"How is HR allowing people to NOT work yet instead spend that time arguing politics in so many slack channels? Who is doing the real work here?\"Then there was the main problem (For me) of being hired into a bait-and-switch role (after the 7 or 8 interviews... Lord have mercy...)I was told:- You&#x27;ll be fully remote, you can work from anywhere. (My manager soon told me: No, we hired head count inand we expect you to stay there. Because I like to visit for 1-2 days every quarter, and I want to see the whole team.)- You&#x27;ll be a NodeJS developer. (Turns out... you&#x27;ll be a low-code Mulesoft developer, and maybe if you&#x27;re lucky you&#x27;ll work with NodeJS)- We hire you on Salary. (Turns out... you&#x27;ll be treated like an hourly employee. I took a 2 hour lunch break one day because I expected to be judged on my impact & contributions, not the time my rear-end is in a chair. \"Yeah... I&#x27;m going to need you to keep your lunches to one hour only\". It was then that I decided to resign.)- They offered $110k base salary. I countered with $140k. I accepted $120k base, plus some stock. Had they paid me more, perhaps the BS I experienced would have been tolerable. But they didn&#x27;t pay me the \"Oh, and accept all of our BS\" rate I asked for (looking back, I should have asked for much more, given what I saw internally).After leaving Unity, I arrived at a company and it was such a breathe of fresh air to find that nowhere in Slack did anyone mention anything about their political opinions-- all the people actually worked. Unlike at Unity, where many people spend time arguing about irrelevant non-work topics.I&#x27;m telling you-- I have never seen the amount of meaningless distracting politically argumentative conversations at a company as I did at Unity reply johnnyanmac 6 hours agoparentSounds like you got a particularly bad part of Unity (and I have heard about those parts, even if they were far from my line of work). I had a wonderful team&#x2F;project at Unity and while there were some who would talk politics I can&#x27;t imagine any of them spending hours arguing about it on the company hour. I can&#x27;t definitely say no one did, because Unity had literal thousands of public channels to grok through (there was literally a channel dedicated to asking what channel to post a question in. It&#x27;s that saturated).But that might have been because my director shielded the team from a lot of the BS up top. Come 2022, I and quite a few others of my team were laid off, and within 12 months said director was also out of the company. I don&#x27;t think it helped that Johacim took a silent leave within that timeframe either.The only agreement I have with your experience is that you do have tons of interviews. But mine were all fit into one full-time day, and it was mostly to see if any of the teams in that office wanted me. So less \"5 interviews for a single position\" and more \"5 interviews with 5 teams, and 1-2 with directors to ask about the company\". reply mikelevins 16 hours agoparentprevIt least your Slack channels didn&#x27;t include employees pasting in porn GIFs to comment on the clients who were currently in meetings with the commenter.I quit that job the second week. reply lifechoseme123 16 hours agorootparentWhat company was that?

It is (or was, back in 2018) $3 on IOS, and now f2p on Android for that reason.if you want a frame of reference for how absurd this is (not that you should to understand how 19&#x2F;20 of your \"customers\" aren&#x27;t buying your game): PC piracy has stayed around 33-40% throughout the decades. I cannnot blame developers for switching or abandoning the platform given those piracy rates. It would legitimately be better to offer a demo on Android (a properly isolated demo, not \"part of the full game\" demo) and point them to console&#x2F;PC than it would to spend resources porting to Android.\\-----Gabe Newell is oft-quoted saying \"Piracy is a service problem\". Well, this shows that services can simply get around this by turning the pirated content into a thin client and store all the value on the server. It simply took until \"always online\" was no longer a lofty assumption to perform. reply Tade0 17 hours agoprevWent to the website of one of the signers, clicked \"reject\" on their cookie popup, which just navigated me into this paragraph:> What can you do if you do not want storing cookies to be set or want them to be removed?> You are able to withdraw the consent to store cookies by changing the settings of your web browser.I&#x27;m warming up to the idea of there being some kind of barrier to entry to this industry.

    "originLink": "https://jackcook.com/2023/09/08/predictive-text.html",
    "originBody": "Jack Cook Home Blog A look at Apple’s new Transformer-powered predictive text model New York, NY — September 08, 2023 At WWDC earlier this year, Apple announced that upcoming versions of iOS and macOS would ship with a new feature powered by “a Transformer language model” that will give users “predictive text recommendations inline as they type.” Upon hearing this announcement, I was pretty curious about how this feature works. Apple hasn’t deployed many language models of their own, despite most of their competitors going all-in on large language models over the last couple years. I see this as a result of Apple generally priding themselves on polish and perfection, while language models are fairly unpolished and imperfect. As a result, this may be one of the first Transformer-based models that Apple will ship in one of its operating systems, or at least one of the first that they’ve acknowledged publicly. This left me with some questions about the feature, notably: What underlying model is powering this feature? What is its architecture? What data was used to train the model? After spending some time with these questions, I was able to find some answers, but many of the details still remain unclear. If you’re able to get any further than I could, please get in touch! How does the feature work? After installing the macOS beta, I immediately opened the Notes app and started typing. Despite trying many different sentence structures, the feature generally appeared less often than I expected it to. It mostly completes individual words. Predictive text completing one word at a time. The feature will occasionally suggest more than one word at a time, but this is generally limited to instances where the upcoming words are extremely obvious, similar to the autocomplete in Gmail. Predictive text completing two words at a time. Can we dig deeper? Finding the model itself was a little tough, but I eventually found the model being used by AppleSpell, an internal macOS application that checks for spelling and grammar mistakes as you type. With the help of xpcspy, I wrote a Python script that snoops on AppleSpell activity and streams the most probable suggestions from the predictive text model as you type in any application. My “predictive spy” script in action. Unfortunately, I wrote this script earlier in the summer, on the first macOS Sonoma beta. In one of the subsequent betas (I’m not sure which), Apple removed the unused completions from the XPC messages sent by AppleSpell. I wasn’t able to glean too much about the model’s behavior from these completions, but it was still a cool find. Where is the model? After some more digging, I’m pretty sure I found the predictive text model in /System/Library/LinguisticData/RequiredAssets_en.bundle/AssetData/en.lm/unilm.bundle. The bundle contains multiple Espresso model files that are used while typing (Espresso appears to be the internal name for the part of CoreML that runs inference on models). I wasn’t ultimately able to reverse-engineer the model, but I’m fairly confident this is where the predictive text model is kept. Here’s why: Many of the files in unilm.bundle don’t exist on macOS Ventura (13.5), but they do exist on the macOS Sonoma beta (14.0). And the files that do exist in both versions have all been updated in Sonoma. sp.dat, one of the files in unilm.bundle, exists on Ventura, but it’s been updated in the Sonoma beta. In the updated version of the file, I found what looks pretty clearly like a set of tokens for a tokenizer. The number of tokens in sp.dat matches the shape of the output layer in both unilm_joint_cpu.espresso.shape and unilm_joint_ane.espresso.shape (ANE = Apple Neural Engine), two files in unilm.bundle that describe the shapes of layers in an Espresso/CoreML model. This is what we would expect to see for a model that is trained to predict the next token. The predictive text model’s tokenizer I found a set of 15,000 tokens in unilm.bundle/sp.dat that pretty clearly look like they form the vocabulary set for a large language model. I wrote a script that you can use to see this vocabulary file for yourself, which you can check out on GitHub. The vocabulary starts with , , , andtokens, which are all fairly common special tokens (roberta-base and t5-base are two popular language models): >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer >>> >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"roberta-base\") >>> tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([0, 1, 2, 3]) ['', '', '', ''] >>> >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"t5-base\") >>> tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens([0, 1, 2]) ['', '', ''] Next come the following sequences: 20 special tokens, named UniLMCTRL0 through UniLMCTRL19 79 contractions (I’d, couldn’t, you’ve…) 1 special _U_CAP_ token 20 special tokens, named _U_PRE0_ through _U_PRE19_ 60 special tokens, named _U_NT00_ through _U_NT59_ 100 emojis And then comes a more normal-looking list of 14,716 tokens, most of which are followed by the special character ▁ (U+9601), which is commonly used in byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, such as the GPT-2 tokenizer, to denote a space. I have to say that this vocabulary file strikes me as pretty unique, but it’s definitely not out of the question for a language model deployed in this setting. I’ve personally never seen emojis featured so prominently in a language model’s tokenizer, but existing research has shown that domain-specific models and tokenizers can drastically improve downstream model performance. So it makes sense that a model trained for use in things like text messages, in which emojis and contractions will be used a lot, would prioritize them. Model architecture Based on the contents of the unilm_joint_cpu model from earlier, we can make some assumptions about the predictive text network. Despite sharing the name of Microsoft’s UniLM from 2019, it looks more to me like a model based on GPT-2. GPT-2 has four main parts: token embeddings, positional encodings, a series of 12-48 decoder blocks, and an output layer. The network described by unilm_joint_cpu appears to be the same, except with only 6 decoder blocks. Most of the layers within each decoder block have names like gpt2_transformer_layer_3d, which would also seem to suggest it’s based on a GPT-2 architecture. From my calculations based on sizes of each layer, Apple’s predictive text model appears to have about 34 million parameters, and it has a hidden size of 512 units. This makes it much smaller than even the smallest version of GPT-2. MODEL DECODER BLOCKS PARAMETERS HIDDEN SIZE Apple’s predictive text model 6 34M 512 gpt2 12 117M 768 gpt2-medium 24 345M 1024 gpt2-large 36 762M 1280 gpt2-xl 48 1542M 1600 For the limited scope of the predictive text feature, this makes sense to me. Apple wants a model that can run very quickly and very frequently, without draining much of your device’s battery. When I was testing the predictive text feature, suggestions appeared almost instantly as I typed, making for a great user experience. While the model’s limited size means it wouldn’t be very good at writing full sentences or paragraphs, when it exhibits very high confidence in the next word or two, they’re likely to be good enough to suggest to the user. However, with my script that snoops on activity from AppleSpell, we can get the model to write full sentences anyway. If I type “Today” as the first word of my sentence and take the model’s top suggestion each time, here’s what I get (video): Today is the day of the day and the day of the week is going to be a good thing I have to do is get a new one for the next couple weeks and I think I have a lot of… Not very inspiring. We can compare this with the output from the smallest GPT-2 model: Today, the White House is continuing its efforts against Iran to help the new President, but it will also try to build new alliances with Iran to make more… Or the largest GPT-2 model: Today, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the city of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, and the city’s Independent Police Review Authority, alleging that the police department and the Independent Police Review Authority engaged in a pattern or practice… Pretty cool seeing the effects of all those extra parameters! It’ll be interesting to see how this feature grows and evolves in the future, and whether Apple decides to keep its scope fairly narrow or someday expand its abilities. If you’re interested in trying any of this out for yourself, all of my code is on GitHub. © Jack Cook 2023",

It generated garbage, but all that garbage made somewhat sense in the context of only the word \"Today\".Whereas GPT2 hallucinated random stuff about the US government. A text prediction model should predict what the user wanted to type, so if you evaluate the models based on that, GPT2 actually performed horribly, since the user showed zero intent in talking about the US. reply codeflo 5 hours agoprevAnd interesting test. I didn’t see a mention of the temperature setting used. Temperature controls the probability to pick a token that isn’t the top prediction, which leads to more creative&#x2F;less robotic results.For actual input prediction, you probably want the temperature to be zero.

For me autocorrect is 99% spot on and so it’s a valid trade off for me to deal with correcting the remaining 1%. My wife on the other hand cannot live with it so she turned it off. And every time I type something on her phone I immediately feel slower because I know each of my key presses have to be much more deliberate. reply Me1000 4 hours agoparentprevWord (or multi-word) prediction is a great starting place for an autocorrect model. If the keyboard I&#x27;m using knows the probability of all the possible next tokens I could type, then you can start making the tap targets for those keys bigger. And since the model is super cheap to run, you can replay the last n keyboard taps to simulate a different correction being made. That&#x27;s at least how I&#x27;d make autocorrect better if I worked on the keyboard team.Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve heard autocorrect is much better on iOS 17. But I won&#x27;t update until the general release next week. reply deergomoo 3 hours agorootparent> then you can start making the tap targets for those keys biggerThat’s how autocorrect has worked since day one, it was just using a simpler heuristic-based prediction rather than a machine learning model. reply aidos 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it’s better and I just need to keep typing so it can figure out what I mean.In the last couple of weeks using the beta I’ve found myself fighting it more than ever.

Fed up with heavy phones, I purchased a 14 Plus 512GB (very similar physical size) and set it up from scratch while migrating whatever is included in iCloud (Photos, iMessage etc).

I remember when I got my first smartphone I bought SwiftKey app (later bought by Microsoft) that made language switching very easy by just swiping the space. Later the app got so good I just left it on default setting and it would still recommend the right words. Since I bought the app it has been always one if first things I installed on a new android phone (I think I had it on an iPhone 3g back in the day too, but I can&#x27;t remember for sure).I recently realised how much of a difference it makes when you type quickly as I got an extra work phone with stock android I have to use occasionally.There is also a feature of this app I use only occasionally, but when I do its great. It let&#x27;s you type by moving your finger between letters in one continously motion.

It should be obvious, but I wonder whether people reading posts like these interpret them as hostile towards the newbies. It&#x27;s the technically challenged pseudo-leadership out there that is to blame for most of it. The running head-first into \"DX\" while still consistently having some of the worst developer experience known to man as a whole and not seeing this, this is a by-product of a largely inexperienced but overvalued senior layer in the tech world that find big voices either via Twitter or more directly via pseudo-lifestyle dev channels on YouTube.Some of them flaunt credentials that would fall apart immediately in real conversations but they are the ones that host the conversation so it can&#x27;t really come up. Not all dev YouTubers are like that, of course, but I&#x27;m sure a few come to mind as people are reading this.On top of the above I think people aren&#x27;t considering that software is often a reflection of values[0] and that people disguising theirs as \"best practices\" does not make them more valid than others. It&#x27;s perfectly fine to not prematurely pessimize your solutions and that often requires making choices that some people will see as wrong because they have different values, for example. This is not only fine as a personal value but many businesses reach a point fairly fast where an ever-growing part of their work is performance oriented, despite what a lot of people tend to think. Solutions that see no real use or have no plurals tend to reach this point much slower or never than solutions that do.The above is also interesting to think about; a lot of people don&#x27;t value reasonably fast software because they&#x27;ve largely never experienced it. It&#x27;s not an uncommon reaction to marvel at simple solutions that have no real optimization put into them but simply aren&#x27;t written completely wastefully from the beginning, because they&#x27;re so much faster than what people are used to.[0] Bryan Cantrill - Platform as a Reflection of Values: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;230142234 reply erik_seaberg 10 hours agorootparentprevProbably not.

So the functional style is about as far from dead as it could possibly be.Additionally, not only has the ecosystem been adopting a more functional style as time passes (especially due to features that have been added such as destructuring and spreading, which heavily encourage a more functional style), some of the core APIs in the standard library that used to make (pure) functional programming a bit more awkward by mutating their arguments now have pure equivalents [0][1] as well.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Refe...

When you say you always used to use forEach, are you saying that you used it for pure computations? Or is near enough everything you write effectful? reply da39a3ee 3 hours agorootparentprevYes. In Scala people seem to say it&#x27;s the idiomatic way to sum a list of numbers which never felt right to me. It just seems to much code to look at for that. reply BigJono 1 hour agorootparentSumming a list of numbers is the exact kind of use case you should use reduce for. If it feels wrong to you it&#x27;s just because you have more experience with for loops than reducers.In languages like JS that have both styles, the place you probably want to use for loops over reducers is for more complex operations where mutation can simplify the code. For example if you have 10,000 elements in an array that you want to aggregate into 1,000 properties on an object (with a non trivial relationship between array elements and object properties), it&#x27;s probably going to look nicer in a for loop than it is in a reducer with a bunch of spread and ternary operators.IMO .reduce calls should probably be one line. If not then it&#x27;s time to either write a for loop or compose more smaller functions.Avoiding them entirely is just FUD though. To compare summing an array in JS: let sum = 0; for (const n of numbers) { sum += n; } const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);The latter is much nicer to read if you&#x27;re used to both styles. What I particularly like about it is it clearly signals that &#x27;sum&#x27; is a variable that we will be using further down. The for loop style leaves ambiguity as to whether &#x27;sum&#x27; is going to be used later or if it&#x27;s just some context for something that&#x27;s happening inside the loop.Actually, to throw a hot take in the mix here, I think people should be more accepting of multiple statements across single lines in C-style languages. let sum = 0; for (const n of numbers) sum += n;That would be a perfectly fine way to signal to the reader that \"this is a specific line of code to produce a sum value\" (much the same as the reduce example), but people seem to have a dogmatic aversion to leaving braces off if&#x2F;for statements or putting multiple statements on a single line. reply yakshaving_jgt 3 hours agorootparentprevIt definitely is the idiomatic way. How would you do it otherwise? Recursion? reply secdeal 3 hours agorootparentprevin Scala the idiomatic way to sum is the method sum on collections List(1,2,3,4).sumAlthough this is indeed implemented with reduce.

What you propose, a filter to hide these, is exactly what has been done just through the official open&#x2F;closed filters. reply layer8 11 hours agorootparentThis is not accurate. When searching for issues, users won’t find closed issues by default. When issues are linked, closed issues are rendered differently (struck through). You can’t comment on them anymore without reopening them, and reopening them is often discouraged or not enabled at all. It is a drastically different state. reply rezonant 8 hours agorootparentEither you are thinking of other project management tools or assuming that some of the \"stale issue locking\" and automated issue management tools that some larger projects use are default.On GitHub, it is true that the Issues search shows only open issues by default, but I think users are quite aware that they may need to search for closed issues, especially since it&#x27;s unlikely they are on the absolute latest version of a package, especially when debugging problems in production. Additionally, some projects close issues once the mainline has addressed them even if the fix isn&#x27;t in a released version.GitHub does not render closed issues as struck through, and it does not by default lock conversations on closed issues.EDIT: I am not taking a side on whether or not it&#x27;s a good idea to do this sort of \"bankruptcy\" mass close. reply Falkon1313 4 hours agorootparent> Additionally, some projects close issues once the mainline has addressed them even if the fix isn&#x27;t in a released version.And that is a general issue with the maintainers not understanding what they&#x27;re doing, or not understanding how issue trackers work.If you close an issue that is still present in the current release, then you&#x27;re doing it wrong - with one exception.

This auto-currying thing sounds like a reaction against some parts of JavaScript where you can get burned by default arguments.A curried function is like a partial application for each argument. If mul:=(a,b)=>a*b then currying would be being able to say double:=mul(2). Currying everything and requiring all function calls to have one parameter per call — six:=mul(2)(3) — might have some benefit in avoiding bugs.Generally speaking though my hunch is that the lodash author grew tired of the project’s focus on meta programming: noodling around with JavaScript using programming paradigms that hinder rather than help its users.

Speaking from personal experience, at some point maintaining OSS is incompatible with living in the real world. The work is free and often thankless (but not always). The problems are complex and compete with real world responsibilities, like work, family, rest. People get pissy and regularly want to argue with you or read the docs for them. It also carries enormous responsibility if your OSS is popular.I am anticipating a huge collapse in the OSS ecosystem as the people who drive them say \"fuck it\" and walk away for more important things. reply eternityforest 11 hours agoparentThat I can understand. These days I&#x27;m almost starting to think of nontrivial personal projects as more an addiction or self harm than real projects.The OSS ecosystem is insanely inefficient though. There&#x27;s lodash, underscore, and plenty of others. They don&#x27;t all need to exist. There&#x27;s also lots of libraries that only do one thing, which are mostly a subset of something like this.Most of this stuff will be used with minifiers and tree shaking, and unused features will be removed, we don&#x27;t need lightweight libraries when the heavy ones are easily optimized and mostly made of separate parts, so the dev effort mostly scales linearly.I think OSS has plenty of manpower, even if everyone decided to only spend a quarter of the time they currently spend, if it weren&#x27;t for the fact programmers like elegance and simplicity more than anything, and constantly want to rewrite to make things just a little bit better. reply bluefirebrand 12 hours agoprevLodash is a great library. It&#x27;s something I wind up using a little bit of on almost every project I work on.However, as JavaScript has become better and better, I use Lodash less and less. Every time I catch myself using it, I make sure to go see if there&#x27;s a built-in for what I&#x27;m trying to do. I also find myself commenting on PRs with links to \"you don&#x27;t need Lodash for this\" quite often.I still hope this isn&#x27;t a sign they are stepping away from the project. reply darepublic 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s definitely convenient but I think invariably I would prefer to just roll my own versions of its utils if it came down to it reply BoiledCabbage 12 hours agorootparentWhy? reply mostlylurks 7 hours agorootparentNot super relevant for lodash in particular, but another reason for why someone might want to do this is dependency hell. At least with code you write yourself, you know that the author(s) won&#x27;t keep changing the API (very common in the javascript ecosystem, unfortunately), forcing you to either waste time constantly changing your own code to match the newer APIs, or stick to a single version for a long time, which may become incompatible with newer versions of other dependencies, your build system, your language, your environment, etc, which will become an issue if you have something else that you want to update but that old version of the dependency doesn&#x27;t support it. So in some cases it might be easier and more maintainable to just write your own version of whatever small feature of the dependency you might otherwise have used, but knowing when this will be the case is a skill of its own. reply darepublic 11 hours agorootparentprevBecause the surface area of lodash is so large and I need just a small fraction of it. And when I do need it it&#x27;s easy to make a simple transparent version of the needed until rather than invoke a mystical black box. I admit this is opinionated and I have managed to work with lodash and keep my mouth shut about it reply BoiledCabbage 11 hours agorootparentThanks for sharing - I disagree with the approach, but understand it.Or rather, I feel that can work for individual coding, or possibly very small teams - but in the end I feel it usually works out to be unintentionally anti-team behavior.It trades off \"I need to learn and understand this black box of behavior for instead I have this code that I know and can easily reason about\". While for the entire rest of your team it went from \"there is this common pattern that most of all 20 (or however many) of us know - and instead makes it 19 of us now need to learn this non-standard behavior&#x2F;implementation, but at least one person knows well.\"Essentially everyone else has to learn more code, so that one person doesn&#x27;t. Agreed it&#x27;s usually not the most complex of code, but it&#x27;s usually buggier and shifts to cost &#x2F; burden to everyone else. The opposite of economies of scale and leveraging prior fixed costs of learning.But again, I don&#x27;t know your situation and will readily admit my opinion above doesn&#x27;t in anyway make it factually a better approach. Just my opinion on it same as yours. reply rcme 8 hours agorootparentIt works perfectly fine. You just copy and paste the code you need. If someone else needs it, they search the code base first, which is normal in large code bases. There are tons of different libraries that provide deep equality checks for instance. When I work in a code base, I need to search for existing solutions in the code base before adding someone new. It doesn’t matter if the functionality is provided by a first or third part library. reply xeromal 8 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re aware but lodash has individual packages for each of their functions. reply dheerajvs 5 hours agorootparentprevI searched my monorepo and could find only two lodash functions installed: lodash.startcase and lodash.unescape.It&#x27;s nice to be able to install individual functions like these, which I don&#x27;t prefer to write myself. reply 0000000000100 12 hours agorootparentprevLess dependencies makes maintaining the project easier. reply erik_seaberg 12 hours agorootparentPopular libraries have been battle tested in prod, and my teammates probably have prior experience with them. reply darepublic 11 hours agorootparentThere are more than a few popular js libs that are pretty trash IMO. Though I would not count lodash among them. Battle tested can often just mean teams use them for better or worse, and I can often see in the code how bad frameworks cause juniors to contort their solutions in all the wrong ways to make them adhere to a framework instead of untie the knot and do it the right way. Sometimes it is the framework being used incorrectly. The devs should invest time to learn the API better. But often it&#x27;s better to just learn how to do the solution sans framework rather than add to the stack of bespoke APIs to learn. And junior devs can become dependent on frameworks for every little thing to the point where they will always reach for one even if the choices are poor reply SkyPuncher 12 hours agorootparentprevHow? That’s more internal code with bugs. reply sebastianz 11 hours agorootparentSome internal code with bugs is way better than lots of external code with other people&#x27;s bugs. reply SkyPuncher 3 hours agorootparentPretty much disagree on every front. Particularly for a major library.There&#x27;s a very good chance those \"other people\" have thought about the problem they&#x27;re trying to solve way more than you have. reply sebastianz 2 hours agorootparentWe are discussing lodash here. It&#x27;s a javascript library with utility functions.The link we are discussing states they have just deleted 400 bugs declaring \"bankruptcy\".If you, like many people using lodash are using 10 util functions from it to iterate arrays or split strings, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re better off just maintaining your own functions.And I say this as a user of prototype.js, another utility library, 18 years old, in a very old project. That lib is dead and unmaintained, and it&#x27;s going to cost me a long time to remove. So now I&#x27;ve inherited all their bugs and code, and it&#x27;s mine, just like if you use the old lodash, the \"bankruptcy\" bugs are now yours. reply yakshaving_jgt 2 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t think this learned helplessness is depressing?Whether or not a team decides to own some portion of code is a complex topic. Sometimes it makes sense to leverage something external, and sometimes it makes sense to write it yourself.In my business, we had a [ostensibly senior] guy insist we use an external technology because it would be too hard for us to own that piece ourselves, despite it being a core part of the product. Technical due diligence on the external technology showed that it didn’t actually work as advertised. Six figure price tag and apparently millions invested for a thing that doesn’t work (and “doesn’t work” in this case meant “corrupted financial data”).Whether or not a team owns some technology is highly context dependent, and your comment comes across as reductive. replykakadoodle 12 hours agorootparentprevMaybe start explaining why not, and then ask why someone would? I think it would create a more interesting conversation. reply throw1234651234 8 hours agoparentprevI haven&#x27;t used lodash or underscore.js since 8 years ago.

First, they’re a way for maintainers to keep track of work they have to do, and second, they’re a way for the larger community (including users) to keep track of defects in the software.

It catches edge cases I might not think of, and the performance tradeoffs have been negligible to none.I don&#x27;t use it for everything, and definitely try to use native and&#x2F;or narrower scope methods when it makes sense, but it&#x27;s saved me a lot of time and headache throughout the years. reply ChrisMarshallNY 11 hours agoparentprev> at least have a look at lodash internals just in case.I think that&#x27;s the issue.

I was expecting the usual \"I made a window manager in JS\" type of web OS, but this is an actual OS as in a kernel + userland programs that can run on it.It seems that the file system is systematically queried over HTTP and never cached: calling `ls` multiple times does a query for each element of the PATH then for the \"binary\" itself (a .wasm file). It that a design choice? Like to be able to have multiple users connected on the same remote filesystem and have each access up-to-date? Or is that something that will be optimized later on?EDIT: I see that files that I create are stored locally (and available whatever the login I choose at the beginning).I came across a few bugs: trying to use pipes to chain commands always hang, and ^C doesn&#x27;t work; using an append file redirection \">>\" to add a line to a file (I tried creating a multi line file with `cat` but it failed) makes every subsequent commands fail. reply baudaux 18 hours agoparentThere are several file systems: a virtual file system (in the resource manager), a network file system (in netfs, with a cache in RAM), a local persistent file system (in localfs, using littlefs and indexedDB). Pipe driver is there. and some signalling as well.At the moment the project is a proof of concept, for sure a lot of things are not developed and not debugged.

I don&#x27;t know if you are effectively recreating a low-level machine on top of the browser&#x27;s high-level APIs, or using the high-level APIs to skip substantial parts of the implementation.How serializable is the state of the OS? Can you freeze and move the image? What resources can&#x27;t be preserved?

I guess they make sense for businesses. Are you saying you want a thin client experience for yourself? If so why on earth would you want those limitations? (Eg latency and dependency on an internet connection). Modern machines like the m1 air give you excellent battery life, lightweight form factor, and quite acceptable performance.

You’ll have the Linux kernel, but only as a driver framework to allow for a completely clean, completely web-based OS on top of it.Chrome OS is close, but it still has many native bits and pieces (window chrome, taskbar, etc.) I’m talking about going all the way. reply solardev 14 hours agoparentI think they address some different use cases. Electron makes cross platform frontends easier (at least across desktop OSes and web), but it doesn&#x27;t really address typical OS-level concerns. Most web apps don&#x27;t need to go that low, they just deal with the UI and business logic. Where they need higher performance, they can also spin off individual worker threads (in WASM or JS) for compute work, without touching the OS.Maybe high-performance web gaming? Or hardware dependent encoding etc.?But otherwise, I think the typical web app would benefit from a shared UI framework... which is different from a shared OS. You can have one without the other, kinda like how MUI (the Material React UI kit) runs on any browser and doesn&#x27;t care about the OS, while Linux runs everywhere too but never looks the same on any two machines. reply baudaux 18 hours agoparentprevexaequOS is a full system, a kernel with drivers and apps.

Forget about Raytracing, the tech. But RayTracing as in better Graphics. iPhone has been able to output very decent graphics for games for quite some time. Arguably since Unreal Engine Game running on iPhone, and if I remember correctly that was Infinity Blade. And yet the market for hard core games on Smartphone is just not there. To the point where there are very little overlap between Smartphone Gaming and PC &#x2F; Console.And if anything the small market of Console Games wanted on Smartphone may be much better served by Cloud Streaming.Edit: Also worth mentioning the constant iOS changes means developers have very little incentive to keep updating their game over a long period of time. reply hayst4ck 4 hours agoparentprevStreaming is fantastic. It means there is an indirect reference between the display of the game, and the running of the game. It means you can play max quality games on a $200 chromebook. The game can be running in the same rack as the server. Visual&#x2F;input lag is a different type of lag than game client&#x2F;server lag, I&#x27;m not sure which one will win the long haul.As fiber is being installed into more residences, streaming becomes an even better prospect. I would much rather be vendor locked into steam than into the xbox, play station, or ios stores. Steam still has execs that think about more than next quarters profits, they aren&#x27;t trying to bleed their cash cow dry like most other companies seem to be doing. From a monetary point of view $10 a month with no contract is more appealing than $500 or even $3000 every several years. It definitely seems like there are many economies of scale wins to be had via centralization.Apple also failed to create a marketplace culture. IOS gaming is synonymous with \"pay to win\". Good games just aren&#x27;t put on those devices with the exception, maybe, of riot&#x27;s games and pc ports. I would be worried about Apple&#x27;s \"lets make money off kids gambling\" culture, that is absolutely pervasive in mobile gaming, becoming more pervasive due to cross pollination. Apple is generally a benevolent dictator, but when it comes to mobile games they are a slum lord. reply nvy 4 hours agorootparent>Streaming is fantastic.Streaming is awful.It perpetuates the idea that you pay for a thing but don&#x27;t own it.

So instead, I setup the game on my PC and just streamed it to my netbook, over wireless in the house.I&#x27;m mentioning this because it was actually playable and honestly it was cool to see the tech getting better for this (not a bunch of input bugs, or performance as bad as what VNC&#x2F;RDP would historically give you) and being able to do something like that without a hassle.Of course, that&#x27;s a bit different from not owning the game and just renting someone else&#x27;s hardware&#x2F;service to play it on. reply tommek4077 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, and too many people still think bandwidth equals good latency.

Why pay for the full price of an X-Box that sits idle most of the time?

You pay for an x-box and you own it. You can mod it, develop games on it, play games on it, sell it, whatever.

I&#x27;m not exactly sure what you mean by the surplus being captured by the producer in this case, but typically, for a voluntary transaction to occur in a free market, both the buyer and the seller must perceive some kind of surplus or benefit. If consumers willingly opt in for the streaming service, they must see the transaction as beneficial to themselves right?What I am saying is that, looking at past trends and assuming the technology becomes competitive, I believe a majority of consumers will opt for option B (streaming) rather than stick with option A (owning). reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentprev> If this were the case, it would beg the question as to why many consumers and businesses willingly opt for rental models.Lack of understanding on consumer side and malicious intent on business side? reply maccard 2 hours agorootparentBecause it&#x27;s a smaller upfront cost, and a \"pay per usage\" cost ongoing. Many people don&#x27;t want to (for example) dedicate the space to a large dvd collection for something they&#x27;re only going to watch once, or to buy a media cupboard to hold two extra dvds. People don&#x27;t want the hassle of reselling&#x2F;searching the second hand market (where companies like eBay provide value, but friction and risk at the same time as anyone who has ever had an \"item not received\" case opened against them will tell you). reply olalonde 1 hour agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a common theory among people who hold a minority preference in a market, but it&#x27;s almost invariably wrong. On aggregate, people tend to be rational. And there&#x27;s plenty of valid and rational reasons for preferring to rent vs owning. Some reasons I can think of: lower cost, convenience (don&#x27;t need to go to a store or wait for a shipment, doesn&#x27;t take space in your apartment), not having to worry about hardware breaking, not having to worry about upgrading when a new model comes out, not having to worry about backups, portability, access to a huge catalog, personalized experience, ability to easily switch service providers, etc. It&#x27;s not hard for me to understand why many people would prefer to rent. reply deagle50 2 hours agorootparentprev> If you&#x27;re going to veer into Economics 101 then you&#x27;d better reconcile with the fact that this \"renting\" only causes more surplus to be captured by the publisher, and not by the consumer.Why should the savvy renters care?

Renting was a concept between the latter two. At an increased logistic effort between them (returning the product, more but smaller payments) the number of products bought from the producer is reduced.With dealers included, exhaustion occured between producer and dealer. With dealers removed and products rented exhaustion no longer occurs at all.That&#x27;s a significant change, much more so than removing dealers or a switch to renting alone.Producers retain full control, and individual consumers lack the negotiation power dealers had, which is an issue if there is no eqivalent alternative product from a different producer. reply tgma 3 hours agorootparentprev> Owning is wasteful unless you have close to 100% utilisationKlaus Schwab \"You will own nothing and be happy\" dystopia.

So we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree. Maybe you live farther from data-centers than I do.Rather than buying a new computer to play cyberpunk, I streamed it and it and was quite happy. It cost me $10 for one month and my relationship with the company ended afterwards. I&#x27;ve used streaming a bit more and I&#x27;ve tried several different services and generally been happy with all of them. nVidia now is great, I just finished BG3 on it and it ran well.> It perpetuates the idea that you pay for a thing but don&#x27;t own it.I think that&#x27;s myopic. A new computer every 8 years for $2000 or $10 a month for 8 years? From a purely monetary and economic point of view, there are clear advantages to subscriptions. From economies of scale perspectives there are clearly advantages to subscriptions&#x2F;centralization. There are disadvantages, too. So it&#x27;s most correct to talk about trade-offs.Where I think you are right is that it gives vendors power to alter the rules and leave you praying they alter them no further. We are seeing the down side of now, with the enshittification&#x2F;shrinkflation&#x2F;brand looting of nearly everything in the American economy. So I agree that in a might makes right world, a world in which there are no consequences for our aristocracy, centralization&#x2F;streaming&#x2F;etc puts you in a weaker negotiating position and could very likely be good in the short term, but bad in the long term.> It creates more incentives for ongoing monetization (to support the streaming infra)I think that depends on if these streaming companies are subsidizing the streaming or not in the same way Uber subsidized rides: at a loss. Allocation for peak capacity is the direct cost to the company, and any unused capacity could potentially be re-tasked for other purposes. Any user that doesn&#x27;t contribute to peak capacity+growth projection is free from the perspective of hardware acquisition. Hardware is an economies of scale world, there may even be positive tax implications.I&#x27;m not sold that there is any special incentive to monetize streaming unless the companies are streaming at a loss. Letting kids gamble is the culture of mobile gaming, and I think it&#x27;s culture that perpetuates it more than structure. I think the PC market salivates at the idea of loot boxes (just look at EA), but the culture is quite against them. PC gamers have provided consequences to predatory publishers while Apple and mobile gamers have not.> It introduces horrendous input lag and it means there&#x27;s yet another probably buggy layer of abstraction between the game and the player.I haven&#x27;t personally experienced this. I have had almost entirely good streaming experiences on broadband. I think from a purely theoretical point of view, input+vision doubles the potential latency and therefore it should be worse.I think from a practical point of view it&#x27;s probably easier for one company to \"solve\" input&#x2F;graphics lag for all games while games run in ideal conditions, than it is for every game&#x27;s netcode to be fantastic.While we&#x27;re comparing and contrasting:Have you read the EULA&#x27;s of the anti-cheat software on some of these games? Literal root kits, some from Chinese companies, some that allow direct raw memory dumping from the computer if not direct RCE&#x2F;remote access for investigation.From an environmental point of view computing from a datacenter as well as time sharing devices is probably a win.So while you come in strong against it. I think you should be somewhat respectful of other people&#x27;s positive experiences.\"Streaming is awful\" is poor criticism. \"Streaming quality is greatly dependent on where you live and your internet quality\" is probably an accurate criticism. Streaming from SJC in San Francisco is probably going to be a pretty good experience. reply shadowgovt 3 hours agorootparentprevHaving played both Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny 2 exclusively as Stadia games, I respectfully disagree with your third point. And your second point is actually a flaw in the current videogame industry economics; the lack of any kind of subscription relation and perpetual-payment model for most games breeds most of the ills we see in the industry (buggy AAA launch titles, crunch time, studios releasing brilliant products, then going under because they just timed their release badly and were the second-best thing against something else that took all the attention that cycle).But Stadia is definitely not a counter-argument to your first point. ;) reply pushedx 4 hours agorootparentprevStreaming is horrible. All of the game streaming services so far that offer a half-serviceable GPU cost $40+ per month, because that’s the minimum cost for offering a GPU to a user over the Internet. The remote end of a game stream is orders of magnitude more resource and power hungry than the remote end of a video stream. For it to be profitable, without tying in some kafka-esque monetization scheme into even single player games, it would have to cost at least $60 per month.I’ve paid for and used multiple remote GPU gaming services and all of them suffered from horrible jitter in input lag. If even once every 20 minutes you suffer in a (even single player) game randomly due to network latency, you’re going to hate the service. This was on residential fiber as well. I think this is why Google exited the market. It’s just a bad gaming experience.When you think about the type of player that would need to champion this service for it to reach critical mass among hardcore gamers, think of a speedrunner or top-level competitive MoBA or FPS player. In the offline case, they are honing thier skills at a time resolution of 16ms or less (in the case of an FPS player 8ms or less). This type of gameplay just isn’t possible over the Internet in general. Live more than 400 miles from a datacenter? Whoops, you can’t get good at games.Game streaming, not to mention the “own nothing” aspect of it, is just horrible from the perspective of anyone who cares about the game they play and getting good at the game they play. reply MikusR 8 minutes agorootparentGeforce Now is 20$ a month for a 4080. reply rkangel 1 hour agoparentprevA lot of these discussions seem to be ignoring control inputs.

Windows has a monopoly on PC gaming and Valve does not want to be subject to any future restrictions or requirements that may be enforced in the future, so they funded andfacilitated gaming on Linux based PCs.Analogously, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t want to be subject to the duopoly of Google and Apple with mobile (gaming), so they want their cloud steaming platform available on competitors. reply sundvor 9 hours agorootparentFirst: I&#x27;m happy that Steam has put effort into Linux!Then, as a bit of a tangent:Windows only has a \"monopoly\" on PC gaming because Apple refuses to licence their operating system for non-Apple hardware - and because Linux just isn&#x27;t mainstream enough.If you could buy OSX just like you can buy Windows and install it on your home built PC, I&#x27;m confident the landscape would at least be somewhat different.(It is certainly possible to install osx yourself on your own PC hardware, if you put your pirate hat on and are happy with massively outdated GPU drivers etc - or at least it was half a decade ago when I checked last).Of course Apple would also have to develop some care for gamers. reply darklion 9 hours agorootparentYour last sentence betrays your entire argument.“Windows has a lock on PC gaming because macOS isn’t available for PCs.

My argument is that Apple have been ignoring it pretty much completely.If a significant user base of PC users had OSX, then with a bit of TLC&#x2F; development from Apple I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be a very viable platform for gaming as well.I.e.

I think they can auth with steam directly and you can play most games available on the steam store. reply solardev 7 hours agorootparentIt is. You can play a subset of games from Steam, Epic, Ubi Plus, and Game Pass -- if the publisher opted them in.For Game Pass specifically, you don&#x27;t own the games... it&#x27;s a subscription service, like EA Play or Ubi Plus, that lets you play from a library of games as long as you&#x27;re subscribed. Of those, several (but not all) are also playable on GeForce Now. You still have to have a PC Game Pass (or Ultimate) subscription.Without GeForce Now, if you have PC Game Pass (the cheaper plan), you have to install and play those games on your own computer. If you have Game Pass Ultimate, you can also stream some of those games from Microsoft&#x27;s cloud of Xboxes. They are inferior to Nvidia&#x27;s offering, but the selection might be better as long as you don&#x27;t mind lower resolution and having to use a controller for most games. You also get access to the EA Play subscription library that way.Confusing, right? It&#x27;s a pity. When GeForce Now first launched, you could play any game on it -- all of Steam was available -- but publishers started complaining I guess (who knows why? maybe they wanted to one day launch their own services, heh, good luck with that).Notably, there were a few games that were Stadia streaming exclusives (like Red Dead Redemption and Elder Scrolls Online). Once Stadia died, there was no way to stream those anymore (unless you rent a whole virtual PC like Shadow.tech). Can&#x27;t play those now, sadly.There are a lot of streaming services now: First-party ones like Playstation Plus, Amazon Luna, Xbox Cloud, Ubi Cloud (via Luna).There are third-party stream-a-game-directly ones that just launch you into Steam and&#x2F;or the game directly, no OS maintenance required: GeForce Now and Boosteroid.There are also \"rent a PC\" style streaming services like Shadow, AirGPU, probably others (including renting them directly from cloud providers, usually at an incredibly high price).Of all those, GeForce Now offers by far the best performance and quality, because Nvidia both controls the supply of RTX cards and also has written some incredible software to support the streaming, enabling play at 4k&#x2F;ultrawide&#x2F;120 Hz&#x2F;low-latency via Reflex, etc. It is also the best value in terms of monthly costs. Its primary downside is the limited library available; only some games are available on there (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;geforce-now&#x2F;games&#x2F;). reply charcircuit 6 hours agorootparent>but publishers started complaining I guess (who knows why? maybe they wanted to one day launch their own services, heh, good luck with that).They could simply want Nvidia to purchase rights to use their game.

It's as simple as that'. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian Peter Higgs This article is more than 9 years old Peter Higgs: I wouldn't be productive enough for today's academic system This article is more than 9 years old Physicist doubts work like Higgs boson identification achievable now as academics are expected to 'keep churning out papers' Decca Aitkenhead Fri 6 Dec 2013 12.37 EST 151 Peter Higgs, the British physicist who gave his name to the Higgs boson, believes no university would employ him in today's academic system because he would not be considered \"productive\" enough. The emeritus professor at Edinburgh University, who says he has never sent an email, browsed the internet or even made a mobile phone call, published fewer than 10 papers after his groundbreaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964. He doubts a similar breakthrough could be achieved in today's academic culture, because of the expectations on academics to collaborate and keep churning out papers. He said: \"It's difficult to imagine how I would ever have enough peace and quiet in the present sort of climate to do what I did in 1964.\" Speaking to the Guardian en route to Stockholm to receive the 2013 Nobel prize for science, Higgs, 84, said he would almost certainly have been sacked had he not been nominated for the Nobel in 1980. Edinburgh University's authorities then took the view, he later learned, that he \"might get a Nobel prize – and if he doesn't we can always get rid of him\". Higgs said he became \"an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises\". A message would go around the department saying: \"Please give a list of your recent publications.\" Higgs said: \"I would send back a statement: 'None.' \" By the time he retired in 1996, he was uncomfortable with the new academic culture. \"After I retired it was quite a long time before I went back to my department. I thought I was well out of it. It wasn't my way of doing things any more. Today I wouldn't get an academic job. It's as simple as that. I don't think I would be regarded as productive enough.\" Higgs revealed that his career had also been jeopardised by his disagreements in the 1960s and 70s with the then principal, Michael Swann, who went on to chair the BBC. Higgs objected to Swann's handling of student protests and to the university's shareholdings in South African companies during the apartheid regime. \"[Swann] didn't understand the issues, and denounced the student leaders.\" He regrets that the particle he identified in 1964 became known as the \"God particle\". He said: \"Some people get confused between the science and the theology. They claim that what happened at Cern proves the existence of God.\" An atheist since the age of 10, he fears the nickname \"reinforces confused thinking in the heads of people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?\" He also revealed that he turned down a knighthood in 1999. \"I'm rather cynical about the way the honours system is used, frankly. A whole lot of the honours system is used for political purposes by the government in power.\" He has not yet decided which way he will vote in the referendum on Scottish independence. \"My attitude would depend a little bit on how much progress the lunatic right of the Conservative party makes in trying to get us out of Europe. If the UK were threatening to withdraw from Europe, I would certainly want Scotland to be out of that.\" He has never been tempted to buy a television, but was persuaded to watch The Big Bang Theory last year, and said he wasn't impressed. I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian’s journalism. From Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what’s happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest – not profit motives. And we avoid the trap that befalls much US media – the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we’re not afraid to name who is responsible. And as a global news organization, we’re able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective on US politics – one so often missing from the insular American media bubble. Around the world, readers can access the Guardian’s paywall-free journalism because of our unique reader-supported model. That’s because of people like you. Our readers keep us independent, beholden to no outside influence and accessible to everyone – whether they can afford to pay for news, or not. If you can, please consider supporting us just once from $1, or better yet, support us every month with a little more. Thank you.

Given the volume of his other academic commitments, at most he would be able to take a look at those papers, certainly he was not able to contribute meaningfully to (any of) them. So why does a top scientist, at the end of his career, whose place in the pecking order is established, still feel this need to have his name on papers to which he has contributed nothing, instead of taking a different path, in which he demonstrates, with facts, that unattainable \"productivity\" is not what scientists should aspire to?Someone might say, \"Well, maybe it&#x27;s not him, but his students or collaborators who want his name, so they can say they published a paper with an important scientist.\" And why would they want to say that? To impress other scientists, the ones who will give them professorships, appointments, fellowships, etc.A world I am lucky to have left behind. reply cycomanic 11 hours agoparentI think this is a misrepresentation of reality. Generally there has been strong pressure from government (and the public) on \"justifying\" their spending through measurable outcomes. Throughout the 90s there were numerous media campaigns about \"useless\" research and we can still see the same sentiments even here on HN.Yes academics (well typically more the lab leaders etc), we&#x27;re involved in some of the system that we see now, but it was in reaction to the pressure from politics and society. What do you expect people to do when the places that fund them start to demand measurable outcomes for something that is inherently difficult to measure. You come up with some (often arbitrary) metrics. That whole dynamic then just became an anweful feedback process. reply borroka 11 hours agorootparentI strongly disagree.The public (let&#x27;s take the 75% of the educational attainment level folks, excluding PhDs, so non-academic people who are educated enough) knows nothing about research, how research is conducted, what a paper is, how a paper is published. Zero clues. You can imagine what the bottom 75% think. Researchers are considered by the public to be little to no more than glorified teachers. It is like saying that bigger and better weapons are invented and built to justify the Defense budget to the public, where for the public a bomb is a bomb is a bomb.How do I know?(1) I was an academic and I often had low-level conversations about my research, in my home country, in the U.S., in Europe, South America, everywhere. Not a single interlocutor outside of academia knew what is the typical process to follow to have some research results published in a scientific journal, or whether a publication in a certain journal can be indicative of more or less cited&#x2F;quality research.(2) I read comments here and there on newspapers, forums, social media, etc. Letters to the editor of your local newspaper are considered to be equivalent to a publication in Cell.(3) Ask, for fun, like I used to do, your regular guy if (a) an electron is bigger than an atom, (b) how many people live on earth.Re: research is useless. Most academic science is useless, and the uselessness of 95 percent of research is somehow considered inevitable by the \"scientific community.\" But in that 95 percent there is a portion of research that is speculative and ultimately turns out to be useless, which is a good thing to have, and a portion of research (the majority) that serves only to pay the salaries of the researchers involved, is clear to everyone and their cousin that it will go nowhere, and is published in journals that no one, and rightly so, will ever read. reply majormajor 12 hours agoparentprevI think this in near-inevitable in any org or federation of orgs of people with more than a few hundred people involved (wild-ass-guess, substitute your own).Once you have too much scale for a few people to truly know what&#x27;s going on, all that&#x27;s left to keep people working on the right incentives is trust, and inevitably you&#x27;ll have some bad actors at some point, and after that you put in some metrics and then it gets worse cause even good actors pursuing those metrics may have gone off the rails.The only places I&#x27;ve seen avoid it moderately successfully have had exceptional people managers, like 1-in-100&#x2F;1000 level, to minimize the appeal of playing the game instead of doing the work. reply borroka 12 hours agorootparentEvery system that was later changed for something better was, at one time, considered inevitable, natural, ineluctable. reply wrp 7 hours agoparentprev> ...the scientists themselves...have largely contributed to the development of this particular academic system...This is a strong claim, which I think needs some references to support it.Watching my dad&#x27;s generation in academia from the 1950s forward and my own from the 1980s forward, my impression has been that this change in campus culture has been entirely driven by the administrative level. reply ttymck 6 hours agorootparentWho do you think the administrators of physical science colleges are?EDIT: I guess you can omit \"physical science\", I suppose we are talking about research across all disciplines. My point remains. reply wrp 2 hours agorootparentUltimate decision making is largely by people with a background in business, not science. It seems to be poorly understood even among faculty that administrative policy is ultimately set by the board of trustees&#x2F;directors. These boards are filled with people who gained prominence through social or business activity. My impression is that successful research scientists rarely if ever land on a board of directors. Although scientists are hired to fill administrative positions, their continued employment depends on their following the directives of the board. reply bsder 10 hours agoparentprev> For once, neither politicians nor administrators were responsible for a system of \"perverse incentives,\" since these gray figures are not involved in either hiring or tenure decisions.This is incorrect. The government and politicians are definitely some of the biggest factors.The collapse of the longer timescale corporate R&D labs meant that research funding transferred to the government. Before that, if universities got too demanding, the academics would leave to the corporate labs.These factors combined with Bayh-Dole and the lottery nature of \"intellectual property\" to cause universities to start chasing funding of short-term gains rather than long-term research.(Famous example: Katalin Kariko, the woman behind much of the mRNA groundwork, was denied tenure and had a very difficult time getting funding). reply borroka 10 hours agorootparentThe comment makes little sense, the way that is worded.When and where were politicians responsible for the collapse of the \"the longer timescale corporate R&D labs\"? Are you thinking of ATT&#x2F;Bell Labs?

Let&#x27;s say biologists, who are a massive presence in academia, exactly where in the private sector were they working before the aforementioned collapse of \"the longer timescale corporate R&D labs\"? Pharma is strong, maybe stronger than ever, but most of the top pharma-adjacent biologists prefer to stay in academia and collaborate with Pharma, more than the opposite.You are just thinking about a bunch of labs (Bell labs?) able to move maybe 1% of the academics at most in their heyday. And it seems to me, like I explained, that the \"productivity pressure\" is coming from academics themselves, not from outside academia. Before the 70&#x27;s, it was fairly easy for a moderately successful Ph.D. to get a position in academia, but the number of positions available did not keep up with the increase of Ph.D.&#x27;s who wanted to do academic research. And the \"productivity\" measurements started. reply bsder 4 hours agorootparent> When and where were politicians responsible for the collapse of the \"the longer timescale corporate R&D labs\"?I did not say this and am quite mystified how you managed to construe my words to imply that.The fact that those corporate labs had a longer term focus and then disappeared is simply a fact.> Academics who? Let&#x27;s say biologistsBefore PCR (1984ish?), biology had such a vanishingly small presence relative to research funding that it almost doesn&#x27;t count.Every big company up through about 1970-1980 had very large R&D departments that had been in existence for anywhere between half to a whole century.Sure: IBM, Bell, and Xerox are remembered strongly. However, Kodak and Polaroid had big chemical engineering departments. RCA and Motorola were household names. Every big name in steel (US Steel, Bethlehem, etc.) all had lots of research in metallurgy. Corning was a huge driving force behind ceramic chemistry. Dupont similarly for plastics.When those big companies went down, so, too, did their research departments and the funding driving them. This was a problem because companies funded a LOT of the local universities--Pittsburgh universities, for example, were still using equipment even in the 1990s that had been funded decades earlier by the big steel mills.The collapse of the corporate giants meant that the percentage of academic research funding from government suddenly went way up. reply osigurdson 15 hours agoprevI have a kind of meta point on this whole discussion.We like metrics because they are not subjective. We don’t like metrics because they tend to be insufficiently specified optimization problems (I.e. we are looking at 3 variables when we really need to look at 1000+). We dance around this with “Goodhart’s law” type statements, but this is blatantly insufficient.My hypothesis is the brain is obviously working with raw data - photons and sound pressure changes fundamentally and is actually solving the broader optimization problem- albeit subconsciously in the immensely powerful associative cortex. If we were to present the same problem to AI, it would end up being similarly subjective - influenced by its training and structure.In summary, human intuition is currently the most powerful computational device. It should be objectively trusted over and above any gameable metric. Thus only non-gameable metrics should be accepted and intense scrutiny should be place on all metrics used. reply kurthr 13 hours agoparentI find it weird that many businesses&#x2F;organizations&#x2F;people try to come up with one metric to keep things simple (and to be easy to optimize), but are then surprised by Goodhart&#x27;s law. It&#x27;s important to have multiple metrics that measure different things (and are orthogonal enough to make it hard to optimize them all) and then use judgement to decide when something has gone too far on one path. I look at ASICs which might have Ops&#x2F;sec, Power, Cost, TTM (even those could be broken down to MACs&#x2F;FLOPs, maxTemp, Design vs Unit cost, TikTok-cycle vs manhours).

I gave an important piece of work to one of the very senior engineers who I managed. Over the course of a month, he repeatedly said \"trust me\" regarding the status of his project. When 6 weeks went by and he finally showed it, it was in such a state that it was essentially unusable. We ended up throwing the whole thing out. Furthermore, he left for another job about two months after that, leaving his work in a shitty state.I made plenty of mistakes there, but I also learned a valuable lesson, \"trust but verify\". Until someone shows me concrete evidence of what they&#x27;ve done, I really have nothing to go by.To be clear, I&#x27;d love to be able to \"have more trust and fewer metrics\". But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s really hard to give people the freedom to, say, hole up for months at a time while they say \"trust me\". reply osigurdson 15 hours agorootparentManagers need to have the capacity to understand the work being done.

Unless you happen to have a situation where your project includes regular submission of work artifacts -- which describes a lot of modern software, sure, but is far from universal -- monitoring the work regularly is at odds with the \"trust\" you mentioned above. I&#x27;ve often seen managers who attempt to monitor like this accused of micromanaging. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentprevTotally agree. To be clear, I am technical, and I definitely was able to evaluate the work being done once it was delivered. My mistake (among many) was letting the work go too long without any visible progress.That&#x27;s why I get annoyed when people just lament about the problems with things like OKRs and KPIs, while totally disregarding the problems these things were designed to solve and pretending that if managers just had a more \"trusting\" mindset that a million Higgs and Wiles would be free to blossom. reply osigurdson 13 hours agorootparentI don’t understand the “once it was delivered” aspect. Why not ask people to commit whatever they have and then you can see if it is going in the right direction (or not).If you can’t do this yourself, at some point you need to be able to trust (yes trust) someone who can.

I’d love to be able to do research based on my own interests without having to worry about business or career concerns. I’ve come to realize that when one is paid to do research, the researcher is suddenly under pressure by the person or institution paying the researcher. “He who pays the piper calls the tune,” after all. But if I make a living through non-research tasks, then I’ll have research freedom.The tough part is coming up with a business idea that would allow this type of lifestyle; that’s where I’m currently at. If I could make $130,000 per year, heck, even $65,000, and live in an inexpensive part of America then I’d be fine, but the trick is figuring out how to make that much money in only 20 hours instead of 40. reply osigurdson 9 hours agorootparentWhy not live somewhere even cheaper?

Academia has fallen into a self consuming game where fierce individual competition to appear productive means that researchers don&#x27;t have the space to actually think creatively and come up with incredible new insights.2. Scientists like Higgs had the privilege of lower hanging fruit to harvest in their day, so a career of lesser intensity was sufficient for people in his cohort to produce incredible contributions. Modern scientists legitimately have to work harder to produce less profound results.Maybe there&#x27;s something to both lines of thinking.I&#x27;m also reminded of the classic story of the pottery teacher who graded one class by final project quality and another by total weight produced over the class period, and found that the latter group ended up producing higher quality work. Higgs in this article seems to be of the persuasion that in his profession, the former style produces better results. I think many of us here would find that intuitively wrong in general. reply theonemind 17 hours agoparentI feel like he&#x27;s kind of invoking Goodhart&#x27;s law that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Academia can only produce what&#x27;s possible to produce under the constraints of meeting certain metrics. If you can&#x27;t structure the work in such a way as to make the right metrics look good while doing it, you can&#x27;t do the work at all, because you will be fired, and it doesn&#x27;t matter how important the work is or why you need to do something that doesn&#x27;t produce the desired metric to get it done. reply atrettel 17 hours agorootparentAnother way to put this is that the incentives in academia right now encourage \"careerism\", for lack of a better term. People have to put so much effort into maintaining their position that the actually big picture goals like research become difficult to do, especially when you have to show progress every quarter and funding is only given out in one to two year increments. Researchers end up playing it safe, because big risky ideas may pay off in five to ten years, but that kind of research is hard to fund on a yearly or even quarterly basis. reply opportune 9 hours agorootparentThis. The other problem is that as academia becomes a careerist pressure cooker of competition, where the actual science takes a back burner and you’re incentivized to churn out high-likelihood-to-succeed but not-actually-profound science… why even go into academia?Personally, I’d have loved to be a part of the Academia of the mid 20th century. But my exposure to research 10 years ago (thankfully, before committing to a PhD) quickly taught me that it’d be extremely unfulfilling, difficult, and poorly compensated compared to private industry. It would be cool to be a tenured professor I guess, but the coolness and prestige of that title is riding the coattails of the past when academia was less of a slog.I get to work on novel CS problems (distributed systems) in my FAANG job without having to publish X papers per year while I progress on the actual meaty problems, for a lot more pay. It’s just strictly better IMO. I’d rather take 3 years from beginning to end to finish something new I’m actually proud of that’ll be used by hundred of millions of people, than be forced to publish papers very few people will read at a regular cadence or lose my job. reply theptip 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, definitely a case of Goodhearting. One way of further breaking this down is the idea of “slicing the bologna” where if you have an idea, you slice it as thin as you can into as many papers as possible. This you can cite your own previous papers, get more totoal citations & papers, and generally game the impact factor.Additionally the “publish or perish” regime encourages small incremental research projects, rather than large expensive risky ones that might not produce a paper for many years.All this against the backdrop that it is getting increasingly harder to find new discoveries since the low-hanging fruit is mostly harvested. reply ivan_ah 10 hours agorootparentLol... \"slicing the bologna\" is such a great phrase to describe this.I&#x27;ve seen it happen a lot in both experimental and theoretical fields. Rather than publish one big paper that explains a new idea clearly at a high level + show its numerous applications, they publish many (6-10) small results based on the the \"machinery\" behind this idea. It can be frustrating as a beginner in such fields, like learning from a textbook that shows you just solutions to problems and doesn&#x27;t explain the general theory. reply theptip 8 hours agorootparent:) I first heard it in sprinting, where they try to beat the previous world record by the smallest possible margin so they can claim sponsorship bonus from beating it next year too. reply osigurdson 15 hours agorootparentprevI completely reject Goodhart’s “law”.

Sales on false promises to customers, overpromising feature delivery, overstating financial benefits to the customer, are so common as to be cliche.The customers end up being short term relationships, the sales provide negative value to the company due to reputation loss (not realized for perhaps years), but the salesperson collects the commission and is probably working somewhere else when the smoke clears.And I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re claiming \"number of users\" is ungameable. If so, I&#x27;d invite you to reconsider that - we&#x27;ve just lived through an entire era where companies gamed user metrics to harvest sweet, sweet VC dollars.

If I hire a machine to generate cash and they are consistently able to do and grow that it seems that this is a good game to play.You could also reformulate the objective function to NPV. reply rfrey 13 hours agorootparentThe point is that not all cash is the same, and some immediate cash causes medium or long term harm. But if cash is your metric, it will be gamed by not distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy cash.So you modify your metric to try to eliminate the harmful kind. But now you&#x27;re in the same race as other metrics. reply osigurdson 12 hours agorootparentIf NPV isn’t sufficient then you are essentially in the realm of maximizing happiness as the objective function. reply rfrey 8 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re begging the question by assuming we can tell what sales are positive and which are negative value. In other words you&#x27;re asserting we have perfect knowledge and can&#x27;t be gamed, to argue the measurement can&#x27;t be gamed. reply osigurdson 5 hours agorootparentHere is a thought, introduce a new term \"metric NPV correlation factor\". If a particular metric has a perfect correlation with NPV it is assigned 1.0. If increasing or decreasing the metric has no impact it is assigned 0.0. Now that we have established a gradient, it is possible to further the discussion.You are stating that cash &#x2F; sales do not have exactly 1.0 but can be something less. I can accept that. However, the correlation is very high and higher correlation factors are harder to game. Metrics with high correlation factors also do not need to be hidden.Let&#x27;s contrast this with another metric: number of emails sent per month. Low correlation factor, easy to game, likely to actually cause harm to a business. This is the kind of metric that you would certainly need to invoke Goodhart&#x27;s law on (i.e. hide) which is, in turn, a sign that a metric should not be used.My main thesis is metrics must have high NPV correlation factors or should not used at all. High levels of scrutiny should be placed on those introducing such metrics. Finally, no metric should ever be hidden as it is a clear sign that NPV correlation is low by definition. replysqueaky-clean 14 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ve never heard of someone tanking the consumer&#x27;s opinion of a company in exchange for some short term profit?If you make the metric \"cash over the past 20 years\" that would be less able to be gamed, but do you really want to wait 2 decades between each performance review for your sales team?There&#x27;s also the problem of one person gaming the cash metric to the detriment of others. Like a used car salesman who lets other salesmen \"warm up\" the customer but then swoops in to be the one to actually make the sale. Is he really 10x better then the other sales staff or is he jut a leech claiming other people&#x27;s sales effort as his own? reply nitwit005 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s never that simple. Salespeople frequently want to do things that damage the brand. A lot of companies force them to present pitches a certain way to try to prevent that.And you don&#x27;t want 50 different sales people all trying to sell to the same client, undermining each other&#x27;s efforts. That means you need some scheme to assign people to opportunities, such as sales territories. They will learn to game that system. replycontravariant 17 hours agoparentprevIf the low hanging fruit is gone and producing profound results requires more effort you&#x27;d expect the number of papers to decrease, or at least it wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to use number of papers as a metric because producing good papers requires exceedingly large amounts of efforts and possibly luck. reply thaw13579 17 hours agorootparentWhile that seems reasonable, it assumes the amount of impact per paper has remained constant, while is practice it has greatly declined. These days scientists will literally try to identify the set of \"least publishable units\" in a research project to maximize the number of papers (I&#x27;ve attended meetings where this is discussed without irony).

If you make 20 vases, the 20th is most likely far better than the 1st. Same with painting, drawing, other forms of sculpture... nothing teaches like practice. There&#x27;s such thing as more complicated pieces that require more work, but the majority of actual skill at pottery is practiced the same way whether you are aiming for a relatively complex piece, or one that is just hard enough it doesn&#x27;t bore you.On the other hand, in science, there&#x27;s no such thing as random practice making you better. The more papers you publish, the higher percentage of the time is dedicated to the writing bits, and getting through the approvals, and doing a million submissions, instead of coming up with good hypothesis, and finding something to do. Aiming at a hard problem is going to lead you to publishing less, not more, so the things you&#x27;ll work on are going to be minor improvements, nothing difficult. Therefore, the chances that you&#x27;ll discover anything major definitely decrease the more often you publish.So if in your intuition you&#x27;d be better off focusing on making a lot of unimportant papers... why would anyone aim for any fundamental problem, which has a higher chance of failure? You think the efforts to actually publish and submit, all away from the lab aren&#x27;t mostly wasteful? Because it&#x27;s really hard for me to imagine how publishing more doesn&#x27;t mean far less time doing research. reply ansgri 12 hours agorootparentInteresting analogy with pottery. I see that an important academic practice that does scale like vases is structuring your research in easily publishable way. As a beginner (typically a young highly motivated idealistic student — who else would want to go to academia in the first place?), you can start with good research idea and important results and no understanding of academic world, but struggle to get accepted anywhere decent because you didn&#x27;t follow all unwritten rules, and as you get experience, you learn the rules of the game and plan your work to contain many low-risk \"least publishable units\" to build your reputation. So yes, \"a lot of unimportant papers\".Many interesting papers nowadays come from commercial R&D departments, like MS Research, because unimportant papers probably don&#x27;t move your main KPIs (which would be \"a lot of patents\" AFAIU), and only interesting results improve the image of the company and serve as good marketing material. reply imbnwa 16 hours agoparentprev>I&#x27;m also reminded of the classic story of the pottery teacher who graded one class by final project quality and another by total weight produced over the class period, and found that the latter group ended up producing higher quality work.

    "originBody": "Skip navigation links Documentation Get Help Donate About Us Languages ISRG celebrates 10 years of helping build a brighter Internet → The Next Gen Database Servers Powering Let's Encrypt Jan 21, 2021 • Josh Aas and James Renken Let’s Encrypt helps to protect a huge portion of the Web by providing TLS certificates to more than 235 million websites. A database is at the heart of how Let’s Encrypt manages certificate issuance. If this database isn’t performing well enough, it can cause API errors and timeouts for our subscribers. Database performance is the single most critical factor in our ability to scale while meeting service level objectives. In late 2020, we upgraded our database servers and we’ve been very happy with the results. What exactly are we doing with these servers? Our CA software, Boulder, uses MySQL-style schemas and queries to manage subscriber accounts and the entire certificate issuance process. It’s designed to work with a single MySQL, MariaDB, or Percona database. We currently use MariaDB, with the InnoDB database engine. We run the CA against a single database in order to minimize complexity. Minimizing complexity is good for security, reliability, and reducing maintenance burden. We have a number of replicas of the database active at any given time, and we direct some read operations to replica database servers to reduce load on the primary. One consequence of this design is that our database machines need to be pretty powerful. Eventually we may need to shard or break the single database into multiple databases, but hardware advancements have allowed us to avoid that so far. Hardware Specifications The previous generation of database hardware was powerful but it was regularly being pushed to its limits. For the next generation, we wanted to more than double almost every performance metric in the same 2U form factor. In order to pull that off, we needed AMD EPYC chips and Dell’s PowerEdge R7525 was ideal. Here are the specifications:Previous Generation Next Generation CPU 2x Intel Xeon E5-2650 Total 24 cores / 48 threads 2x AMD EPYC 7542 Total 64 cores / 128 threads Memory 1TB 2400MT/s 2TB 3200MT/s Storage 24x 3.8TB Samsung PM883 SATA SSD 560/540 MB/s read/write 24x 6.4TB Intel P4610 NVMe SSD 3200/3200 MB/s read/write Dell PowerEdge R7525 internals. The two silver rectangles in the middle are the CPUs. The RAM sticks, each 64GB, are above and below the CPUs. The 24x NVMe drives are in the front of the server, on the far left. By going with AMD EPYC, we were able to get 64 physical CPU cores while keeping clock speeds high: 2.9GHz base with 3.4GHz boost. More importantly, EPYC provides 128 PCIe v4.0 lanes, which allows us to put 24 NVMe drives in a single machine. NVMe is incredibly fast (~5.7x faster than the SATA SSDs in our previous-gen database servers) because it uses PCIe instead of SATA. However, PCIe lanes are typically very limited: modern consumer chips typically have only 16 lanes, and Intel’s Xeon chips have 48. By providing 128 PCI lanes per chip (v4.0, no less), AMD EPYC has made it possible to pack large numbers of NVMe drives into a single machine. We’ll talk more about NVMe later. Performance Impact We’ll start by looking at our median time to process a request because it best reflects subscribers’ experience. Before the upgrade, we turned around the median API request in ~90 ms. The upgrade decimated that metric to ~9 ms! We can clearly see how our old CPUs were reaching their limit. In the week before we upgraded our primary database server, its CPU usage (from /proc/stat) averaged over 90%: The new AMD EPYC CPUs sit at about 25%. You can see in this graph where we promoted the new database server from replica (read-only) to primary (read/write) on September 15. The upgrade greatly reduced our overall database latency. The average query response time (from INFORMATION_SCHEMA) used to be ~0.45ms. Queries now average three times faster, about 0.15ms. OpenZFS and NVMe NVMe drives are becoming increasingly popular because of their incredible performance. Up until recently, though, it was nearly impossible to get many of them in a single machine because NVMe uses PCIe lanes. Those were very limited: Intel’s Xeon processors come with just 48 PCIe v3 lanes, and a number of those are used up by the chipset and add-on cards such as network adapters and GPUs. You can’t fit many NVMe drives in the remaining lanes. AMD’s latest generation of EPYC processors come with 128 PCIe lanes - more than double what Intel offers - and they’re PCIe v4! This is enough to pack a 2U server full of NVMe drives (24 in our case). Once you have a server full of NVMe drives, you have to decide how to manage them. Our previous generation of database servers used hardware RAID in a RAID-10 configuration, but there is no effective hardware RAID for NVMe, so we needed another solution. One option was software RAID (Linux mdraid), but we got several recommendations for OpenZFS and decided to give it a shot. We’ve been very happy with it! There wasn’t a lot of information out there about how best to set up and optimize OpenZFS for a pool of NVMe drives and a database workload, so we want to share what we learned. You can find detailed information about our setup in this GitHub repository. Conclusion This database upgrade was necessary as more people rely on Let’s Encrypt for the security and privacy that TLS/SSL provides. The equipment is quite expensive and it was a sizable undertaking for our SRE team to plan and execute the transition, but we gained a lot through the process.

They are shockingly quiet after being booted, even under pretty decent load. If you tune C-states for energy conservation in the BIOS, they idle at just under 100W each. With moderate load (like you&#x27;d have in a homelab), around 125W. According to iDRAC, the peak they&#x27;ve seen is about 350W.For better apples-to-apples, each of them has 2x E5-2650v2, 3x SATA SSDs, 8x 16 GiB PC3-12800R sticks, and 1x NVMe SSD (mounted in a PCIe adapter).As a comparison, I also have a Supermicro X11SSH-F with a bunch (9) of spinning disks. It has a single E3-1220 v5, 1x NVMe SSD, 2x 32 GiB PC4-17000U, and averages 125W. Given the relative power consumption of HDDs, that&#x27;s a pretty impressive difference IMO.My entire rack (the aforementioned servers, and some Unifi networking gear) pulls around 500-600W in total. When the backup server (Supermicro X9DRi-LN4F+; dual-socket something-or-other Xeons, some DDR3 ram, and 8x spinning drives) kicks on daily to ingest ZFS snapshots, the total consumption is around 700W, I think.

I went from Ubuntu -> Arch -> NixOS looking for a distro with well-supported ZFS.

Once you go declarative (and climb the learning curve), you are done with everything else I guess.Put it this way, I can switch to an entirely different window manager by changing 1 configuration line. And it works every time. I&#x27;ve tried that on other Linux distros, and it always borks something or other. I can also change my GRUB theme and boot animation via Plymouth, something I would have NEVER risked on ANY other Linux distro due to the risk of modifying boot configuration... but since it&#x27;s declarative (and validated) on NixOS, I&#x27;ve had no issues (just tweaking).

(That also might be why FreeNAS, which I also have running as my NAS, switched to Linux from Debian when they re-branded as TrueNAS Core&#x2F;Enterprise.) Come over to NixOS, where you can simply reboot into any of N previous instances after an update that borks something (which almost never happens, anyway, because you can actually specify, in your machine configuration, \"use the latest kernel that is compatible with ZFS\").

I was completely undewhelmed by the specs, it even has spinning rust. The upgrade costs to SSD&#x27;s were like 250 per disk. So reading these specs, how much does such a server cost? Or do you put the disks in yourself? Can you negotiate a 50% discount?

Is the current architecture not going to keep up with demand? reply mcpherrinm 9 hours agorootparentGrowth, plus reliability by reducing the SPOF.We are beginning to hit the limits of what we can do with the current single-writer database in this hardware.As well, the size of the data is larger than I’d like for a single MariaDB cluster. That makes operations like setting up new replicas take a long time. Being able to operate on smaller shards will help a lot at parallelizing some of that work. reply tyingq 15 hours agoparentprevI would guess they try to get 3-5 years out of a new server, and this was done in 2021...so still a bit early for a refresh.

If you start pushing anywhere close to that much bandwidth, you will be throttled &#x2F; have your account closed. For example, Hetzner caps your bandwidth at 20TB per month.Additionally, if you are actually pushing close to that much traffic, you can negotiate guaranteed commit prices w&#x2F; AWS that are competitive (especially when you consider the quality of bandwidth. I can only get ~100 mb&#x2F;s to my hetzner server because of how bad their peering is. I can easily saturate my 1GB connection to anywhere in AWS.)---(Having said that, this does only apply to egress via cloudfront.

The on-demand price is even more absurd. reply louwrentius 15 hours agoparentprev [–] I think there are ton of great use cases for the cloud, but people should try and think for themselves and decide if their circumstances and workload is really a good fit.A ton of people forget that a bunch of servers across a few colocations can pay for itself in months, especially if you go for second-hand gear that is dirt cheap.Again, going (back) to colocating hardware could not be good fit.

Create a free Team Why Teams? Is this fraud? And if so, to what extent am I responsible? Ask Question Asked yesterday Modified today Viewed 23k times 53 I am the most senior technical employee at a small company providing software as a service to other businesses. The company only has about 10 employees, so one of the directors does a lot of the sales & marketing. One client they are trying to get is funded by local government, so (rightly) has strong security checks as part of their procurement process. One such check is ensuring that we penetration 'pen' test our software. The director asked me to fill out a procurement document that had been sent to them by the client, including a question about pen testing. I, truthfully, wrote that we had never pen tested our software. (It's worth pointing out at this point that even as the most senior technical employee, I don't have decision making abilities. Decisions are taken by the (non-technical) directors, often in different directions to what I, with a technical background, would take. I've been lobbying to implement stronger security practices such as pen testing since I started at the company in 2020, but that advice has not yet been taken.) The director was not very happy with the document that I had produced (at one point writing 'what the f***' in their email correspondence with me), and they asked me to rewrite the document with the, quote, \"more political\" answers that they would provide. They provided me with an answer to the pen testing question that essentially said \"we did pen testing when we launched, but haven't done it since\". I made sure they were aware that this wasn't true, changed the answer in the document to theirs verbatim, exported a PDF and send it back to them as requested. At that point, I was confident in my personal ethical position. Yes I had produced a document that was factually inaccurate, but when I sent it, I was very clear that I thought the sections that were not written by me were not accurate. I don't think any reasonable person could interpret this as dishonesty. At no point did I present something as fact that I knew wasn't fact. The director then chose to forward this to the client, without my \"this is not accurate\" warning. The client came back and asked to see evidence of the pen testing that had taken place. The director simply responded with \"this is a question for our technical manager, [my name], I'll set up a zoom so you can talk\" I now feel like I'm going to have to defend the company's position \"we have pen tested\", knowing that it is not true. Which leads to my questions: Have I done anything fraudulent so far? (To be clear, I'm not looking for legal advice, just opinions from people who may have been in a similar situation.) If I take this zoom meeting, and toe the company line (which I know to be false), am I committing fraud which I could be personally liable for? (Again, not looking for legal advice, just opinion.) If this is fraud, how can I explain that I don't want to be a part of this to the directors? And is such an issue worth resigning over? managementunited-kingdomsoftware-developmentclientsfraud Share Improve this question Follow edited 13 hours ago terdon 4184 4 silver badges 12 12 bronze badges asked yesterday Louis 1,0212 2 gold badges 5 5 silver badges 8 8 bronze badges 17 \"Fraud\" has specific legal meaning and I think that is beyond the scope of this site. You may want to consult an attorney. And keep copies of what you've written in a secure location if you know others are altering your statements. – alroc yesterday 37 Regardless of any potentially fraudulent aspects of this question, I think the bigger elephant in the room is that your bosses would likely throw you under the bus to protect themselves when the pen testing can't be substantiated. – Peter M yesterday 32 So you changed a document with your name on it to include blatantly false assertions, and you're \"confident\" this was ethical behavior? Respectfully, that's incoherent. Textbook \"superior orders\" defense. – Daniel R. Collins yesterday 5 Whatever you do, be sure to archive any communication relevant to this in a place your employer can't touch. For example, by forwarding e-mails to your personal e-mail. If shit hits the fan, you might need that evidence, and your employer may lock you out of your company e-mail. – marcelm 23 hours ago 23 \"I was very clear that I thought the sections that were not written by me were not accurate.\" - You really weren't. You exported a standalone PDF document containing only the director's lies and none of your explanatory annotations. You must have known the PDF would be used to lie to the client. That none of your caveats would be passed on. Better options include refusing to put false statements in a document, or at a minimum putting them in a 'live' doc with clear notes highlighting that the false content is false, and telling the director to PDF it themselves if they want a PDF. – aroth 21 hours ago Show 11 more comments 10 Answers Sorted by: Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 61 I am not a lawyer, but... the common understanding of \"fraud\" is obtaining money or other advantages dishonestly by deception. If the client has made it clear that pen testing is an important part of this procurement decision, and your boss has made it clear that he wants you to deceive them about this, it's hard to see how that wouldn't be fraud. Whatever we want to call it, it's clearly unethical. Moreover, since it relates to your area of responsibility, if it does blow up there's a good chance you'll be left holding the bag. It sounds like you're hoping for a way to stand aside from this issue, let your boss commit fraud or not as he chooses without making you part of it. Leaving aside the morality of allowing that to happen, it's unlikely that this is an option. Speaking from experience of seeing a similar scenario play out before, my experience of such people is that they're unlikely to accept \"do what you like, just don't involve me\" as an answer. You know he's doing something shady and very likely illegal; he knows you know. That makes you a threat. Making you complicit in that shady behaviour would make him safer, both because you'd have reason to keep silent and because he'd have somebody to throw under the bus if he got found out. But if he can't have that, then the next best thing is to get rid of you, probably without warning. From there, if you try to make waves, he can represent you as \"disgruntled ex-employee\" and present the lie as being your idea. Get legal advice, don't dawdle, and start looking for new jobs ASAP because resigning may not be your decision. Take printed evidence of what happened and keep it somewhere your boss can't get. My leaning would be towards tipping off the client, but that is probably an area where you'd be much better off taking advice from a lawyer than from the internet. Footnote: people like your director love to give instructions verbally, because it gives them the option of denying it later or claiming they were misunderstood. (\"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\") A work-around for this situation is to put those instructions in writing for them afterwards, something like this: To: MyBoss BCC: MyHomeEmail Hi Boss, just wanted to confirm my understanding of our conversation this morning. My recollection is that you'd like me to speak with Client and give them the impression that we have done pen-testing already - please let me know by COB today if I've misunderstood anything here, otherwise I'll proceed accordingly. Better if you can bury that \"please acknowledge in writing that you're soliciting for me to commit fraud\" in among some more innocuous points, so it's not quite as obvious what you're doing. This may not save your job in the long run, but it gives you at least some insurance against later denials.

He has already told [client] that he is relying on your word that pen-testing was done, and that you told him that you can present evidence on demand. If this is fraud, how can I explain that I don't want to be a part of this to the directors? You say, \"You have asked me to present [client] with evidence that we have pen-tested. But there is no such evidence, because we have not pen-tested. Do you want me to lie to [client]? If so, exactly what do you want me to tell them?

The director simply responded with \"this is a question for our technical manager, [my name], I'll set up a zoom so you can talk\" You're being set up to fail here: because the two options you have on this call are to lie to the client (which could easily constitute fraud, and you'll probably get called out on since you have no evidence), or to go directly against what your director has said and then deal with the fallout of that (note that if they try and fire you then you have a strong case for unfair dismissal, and potentially protection under whistleblowing laws - talk to a lawyer). Personally, I would be looking for a new job at this point: because a company that expects you to lie to clients to win business is not one I'd want to work for, and your director is expecting you to do it or you'll be thrown under the bus. Not a good environment. But shorter term, there's one other option to consider: go and get a pentest. If you can arrange one quickly enough, you can probably stall the client with something along the lines of \"We're actually undergoing a pentest next week, and we should get the report by $date that we can share with you\". Oh, and given there's a real chance you could end up in an employment tribunal over this (especially if they try and bring disciplinary action against you or fire you), document everything, make copies of emails and correspondence about this, and store it outside of corporate IT.

But the client will probably only care about the most recent pentest report (and may not really care at all - this is often just a compliance tickbox exercise). Given that OP has been put between a rock and a hard place, I think that it's probably the least bad option, and should buy them some time to go and find a better company to work at. – Gh0stFish 19 hours ago Add a comment 14 Have I done anything fraudulent so far? Yes. You created a document which contains false, misleading, or inaccurate information, and distributed it to others. It doesn't matter if you were explicitly told to do this, if you provided separate information explaining the deception, or if the person you gave it to understood the deception. At the point that you created and distributed it you expressed a lie to another person. The creation AND distribution are the key points - if it never left your procession then there's no problem. If you didn't create it then there's no problem. Adding your signature to something someone else created is the same. If I take this zoom meeting, and toe the company line , am I committing fraud which I could be personally liable for? (Again, not looking for legal advice, just opinion) When you use the words \"fraud\" and \"liable\" then you are explicitly asking for legal advice. Consult an attorney. In some areas lying to some government employees could be considered criminal. If we ignore legal culpability, civil or criminal liability, and just ask, \"Is taking the call and maintaining the deception fraudulent?\" then the answer is clearly yes. You are not an actor, paid to play a part in a work of fiction. You are an expert in your field paid to represent objective facts and professional opinions about a product you financially benefit from. Carrying on the deception is defrauding those you convey the lie to. Further, your director is setting you up to take full blame and responsibility. If the customer buys the product, and never finds out about the fraud, then the director wins a sale and they continue to take risks for financial gain - lying will sometimes net you a sale where it otherwise wouldn't. If their risk doesn't pay off and the customer discovers the deception then they merely need to state \"My expert told me it was pen-tested, provided this document in answer to the customer's questions, and then took a call with the customer telling them the same thing. All the communication I sent was misunderstood - I was never asking them to lie, I understood from their conversations with me that it was pen-tested and I was merely helping them understand how to fill out the form given what they told me in person.\" Keep a paper trail. Make sure to include others in the company in your communications - always cc one other person in all emails with this director. If this is fraud, how can I explain that I don't want to be a part of this to the directors? And is such an issue worth resigning over? Send to all directors: \"I incorrectly filled out that document and will contact the customer to retract it. If you'd prefer to resolve this with the customer please cc the email to me as well so I can clearly document the resolution of the error. I'm happy to meet with the customer at any point to explain the error and the current status of the software including the lack of pen-testing. I'm also happy to discuss possible timelines for pen-testing. I regret the error, and will endeavor in the future to avoid similar errors.\" The company will always seek to protect itself, so making threats of any kind will cause you more problems. Resigning is a reasonable course of action if the culture of the company allows for such deception in general. If they're lying to gain customers then the chances that they'll lie to you are pretty high. If this individual appears to be an outlier, and if, during this process of revision and reconciliation, you find others are unhappy with the deception, then it might be worth staying with the company. If resigning, get a new job first, and hand in your minimum (or two weeks) notice only after you've secured another position. Again, if they're lying to clients, then you don't want to give them opportunities to hurt you or your job prospects.

Shop around for a reputable third party to do the pen testing for your company. Then prepare a report outlining the cost of pen testing and the time frame it can be done within. Doing the pen testing will take time. And fixing all the issues, the pen testing will uncover, will take time as well, probably several months. Then call the client ahead of schedule on the phone and have a private talk with them. Ask questions. Ask about their timeline. Find out if they're serious. For all you know, they may not be. And suggest the idea of a 3rd party doing it. If they ask about seeing the previous pen testing report, insist on producing a more up-to-date report. Be like a broken record if you have to. And if you must throw someone under the bus, throw the director under the bus (but only do so as a last resort). But most likely, the potential client is not interested in a half-baked out-of-date report anyway.

The latter you don't want to do, both ethically and legally. So, as long as you have paper trail of their fraudulent plans and their instructing you to be a part of it, just pretend you accept your director's instructions and during the call explain to the client that he was lied to by the directory and no penetration testing has ever been performed.

Yes I had produced a document that was factually inaccurate, but when I sent it, I was very clear that I thought the sections that were not written by me were not accurate. I don't think any reasonable person could interpret this as dishonesty. At no point did I present something as fact that I knew wasn't fact. I would have sent the document in an email with my position specified in it. I have had to deal with business partner making up similar lies often. And I would always leave an email trail. You need to protect yourself. I don't see how you have committed fraud as you have only sent the document internally and have presumably verbally told them you are unhappy with it. However, you could still be held responsible in the future. In New Zealand, for example, the Companys Act specifies that if an employee performs an act that a Director normally would, then that employee is held accountable as if they were a director. Legislation in your country is probably softer. Going forward, I would advise you not to lie to a Client. Instead, tell your manager that you can not lie to a Client and they have to come up with another solution. Eventually it is up to you. You either lie to a Client (and take a risk of getting prosecuted) or you take a risk of getting fired.

For better advice, talk to a lawyer. Before the meeting, ensure that you have a copy of the original questionnaire, filled out with your original answers. Be prepared to speak over your director, if they plan to attend. As the first order of business, start the meeting by explaining that there's been internal confusion over the questionnaire. Explain that some specific questions need to be clarified. State in no uncertain terms that no pentesting has taken place. Be prepared to interrupt your director. Also be prepared to be kicked from the call, if this is a teleconference. As soon as you're off the call, within maybe two minutes, send a copy of the original questionnaire to your client's point of contact along with a brief explanation. You will likely be dismissed from employment regardless of what you do, but this plan will allow you to punish your director and employer for trying to lie about technical requirements, as well as making it obvious to your client that you have their security and compliance in mind.

Even if they backpedaled when you resisted, you&#x27;re not a team player with them, and you&#x27;re a threat to someone very dishonest.At that point, options:* just leave;* consult a labor attorney (you can get a free initial consultation); or* go above the director&#x27;s head, probably (in a small company) to the owner&#x2F;CEO, whatever attorney is on staff or they retain, or HR (though, you&#x27;re still probably over at the company, even though they&#x27;ll diplomatically pretend that you&#x27;re not, because you are in 100% corporate butt-covering territory now, in a place that puts someone very dishonest as a director). reply satisfice 13 hours agoparentYes, he should not have made the change.

You should have asked your boss about it first and take his word.During the zoom call, you can simply reply that your boss told you so and ask him to produce the old report if it’s still in his possession.Anyways I think these tests (iso 27001) should be held regularly to mean anything. Being compliant in 2021 doesn’t hold the same “level of guarantee” in 2023.And that last part is up to your client’s policy.Do they need a recent third party audit or whatever… you should ask them questions and check with your boss if it’s worth the spending. reply lolinder 15 hours agoparentNowhere does the author say they were unsure whether it had happened:> I, truthfully, wrote that we had never pen tested our software. ...

I&#x27;m neither a software dev nor an engineer, and I initially found it confusing when I&#x27;d come to a forum like this and see people say \"I&#x27;m a software engineer\" or \"I work as a software engineer for X\" without actually having any of the aforementioned credentials.In contrast, I don&#x27;t think people are so blase about using the term \"engineer\" casually in other contexts, or even other areas of engineering. Folks calling themselves mechanical engineers, or electrical engineers...actually are engineers. As for the example you gave of a \"car doctor\", it is evident that people might use the term \"doctor\" in such a way as to show they&#x27;re not actually doctors, which is not the case in the present context. I don&#x27;t see mechanics referring to themselves as just doctors, or describing what they do with cars as medicine. replymarcosdumay 15 hours agorootparentprevThe OP is only saying that if he had the piece of paper, he would know that the piece of paper would almost automatically be retracted as soon as he acted like this.And, no, this sort of thing didn&#x27;t exist before the pieces of paper, for obvious reasons. reply tamimio 10 hours agorootparentprevWriting a piece of code after a bootcamp isn’t engineering, and being the technical guy will not make you an engineer either, for starters, you learn engineering ethics in the engineering disciplines, and he (or she) would know what to do in that situation.

However... given the circumstances the author is in, I don&#x27;t think his director is the type to schedule a pen test and then wait for all the violations to be resolved in order to get the contract.

But assuming this is part of an RFP response, \"embellishment\" of answers is par for the course, and I understand the frustration of the director.First, there&#x27;s always a good chance nobody on the client side actually cares about this. RFPs tend to come with hundreds of questions, most of which are put in as requirements by completely detached departments to make them feel important, but don&#x27;t actually matter. If something is important, it can be negotiated. For example, if the pen test is important, you can get the client to agree to sign the contract with a clause that says if they don&#x27;t get pen tests results by X date the contract is void.Second, well, what is a pen test, really? If you ever called one of your APIs to validate that your authorization or authentication code works, or you&#x27;ve validated that your AWS security groups are blocking external traffic to your database, congrats, you&#x27;ve performed a \"pen test\"! The client won&#x27;t consider that sufficient, of course, but it&#x27;s a justification for an answer on an RFP, at least. If they want more details, as they do in this case, they can always schedule a follow-up call or ask to see the pen test results document.This situation reads like an engineer who needs a bit of business&#x2F;sales experience more than anything. In their discussion with the client, you can start with \"we&#x27;ve currently only done in-house penetration testing, but are looking to contract an external vendor to do penetration testing by X date.\" Assuming you&#x27;ve done any testing, this is a true statement, and the client can determine if that&#x27;s sufficient.The real solution to this is to get SOC2&#x2F;ISO27001 certification, though, which makes a lot of these RFP headaches go away. reply maxbond 16 hours agoparentLying is not an embellishment or puffery, it&#x27;s a lie. Engaging a company for a 3 day pen test that&#x27;s totally insufficient, that would be an embellishment.It doesn&#x27;t matter if the client doesn&#x27;t really care. That&#x27;s just a rationalization, plain and simple. No different in kind from, \"well the bank teller doesn&#x27;t really care if I rob the bank because it&#x27;s not their money, and the money is insured anyway, so is it really even robbery?\" Only different in degree (to be fair, an enormous degree; just to illustrate).A pen test is a real thing. \"What is a pen test really?\" is another rationalization. There may be many flavors of pen test, but fabrications are fabrications. One of the most important part of pen tests is that they are external. It&#x27;s like saying, \"what is an audit really? We have accountants and they check our books for anomalies.\" Just doing your job as an engineer and looking for bugs is not a pen test. In the same way that being careful and rereading your own changes is not a code review.This reads up me like an engineer committed to their work. I think they should be proud of themselves for not going along with this. I think the problem is that management isn&#x27;t doing their job properly. They&#x27;re cutting corners because they fucked up and didn&#x27;t make sure a pen test happened or listen to their technical people. This is a strategic necessity for the company that would have been so easy to accomplish and should have been foreseen. They&#x27;re trying to rule by dictate and it could destroy their career if this ends up in court. Even now, they could get some kind of rush job done - but no, they choose to endanger the company and the people in it instead.Imagine being a lawyer or a paralegal and getting your hands on those emails in discovery.

There is no requirement that it is systemic, formally documented, performed by a “security expert,” or that it is done by any external party.Those are all desirable _properties_ of a pen test that may be required for various certifications, but an engineer can absolutely conduct a quick and informal pen test at any time. reply DoreenMichele 16 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t actually like this answer but there&#x27;s likely some truth to it.I am reminded that when I bought a house in my twenties, at the scheduled closing there was some detail that was incorrect. There was a line in the document where we had to say something like \"Yes, x paper is in hand.\" In reality, I think we were still waiting for it.And when I was like \"But this isn&#x27;t true. Shouldn&#x27;t we wait until we have this?\" the banker said \"That&#x27;s your call.\"So it was lie about it because the paperwork wasn&#x27;t going to go through if it said anything other than \"Why, yes, we absolutely have that!\" or delay closing on the house, which could mean losing it. So I signed.And it never came up again. No one ever called and said \"But what about blah?\"If you are knowledgeable about the bureaucratic process, you may know which check boxes must be checked off, true or not, to file it and in most cases don&#x27;t actually matter. If you aren&#x27;t knowledgeable, you are seriously gambling.So in reality, this kind of thing does go on, like it or not. And if you are too pedantic, you can&#x27;t get things done. Things will grind to a halt while you dot every I and cross every T. reply turquoisevar 10 hours agorootparentThere’s a difference between you knowingly waiving a requirement that is to your benefit (receiving the necessary disclosure document before closing) to further a goal to your benefit and you making a statement on a form to the detriment of someone else.In your analogy it would be as if the seller ticket the box saying that they’ve disclosed all deficiencies to you despite not having done so, to not jeopardize your willingness to close. reply DoreenMichele 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t recall what the document was but in real estate, a defect can also negatively impact neighbors or future owners. If the defect was the responsibility of the previous owner and not having the disclosure at the time of the closing means you no longer have legal standing to pursue remedy and you don&#x27;t get around to fixing it, it may get grandfathered in and now it&#x27;s potentially a permanent situation.I think TFA is a case where the OP messed up. He shouldn&#x27;t have lied to appease his boss and it seems he wasn&#x27;t clear about that at the time.He didn&#x27;t seem to feel he was lying. He told his boss X then did as he was told. And I think this sort of mental disconnect is common and, among other things, leads to problematic choices for how to relate online.In his mind, while filling out the papers, what he said was part of this larger conversation and his boss knew what he really believed to be true. The problem is that putting it in writing means other people can read it and they aren&#x27;t part of this larger conversation.I was clear that signing the papers could come back to bite me but based on the banker&#x27;s remark inferred he wasn&#x27;t concerned and he felt rescheduling was a bigger problem. Odds are good the item showed up soon after and was added to the file and said the \"right\" thing, so didn&#x27;t create problems.I still think what I said elsewhere: OP should probably be planning his exit.

What do you think it will be when legalities hit later?- You are being used, and sorry to burst your bubble, bullied too, it is clearly what type of work environment when you get a WRITTEN email with a slur, not even verbal.- From my experience too, going to higher management will not do anything (like a CEO) in small companies, as usually they are all the same, in fact, the CEO will be using the director as a shield to take the shit later, and the director is using you as a shield, you get the idea.The course of action if I were you:- Meet with the client and be transparent, say you never said that, no pentesting is ever done, and be clear the director said it. I would even go the extra mile and record that call, just ask for consent first.- Give your resignation right after the meeting, and be clear about the reasons why, you will thank yourself later.- Edit: I would also make a CYA (cover your arse) folder, I usually do that in similar situations, document everything.You can of course take legal advice, but since nothing is actually done (assumed in the negotiation phase) and unless there’s hard evidence (like those emails you mentioned are clearly asking to falsify it), I don’t think it will be worth it, but I’m not a lawyer. reply unyttigfjelltol 16 hours agoprevThe conduct to this point was wrong.

Doesn’t need to be harder than that. Pen tests for satisfying compliance requirements are easy, cheap, and quick.-My advice: get on the zoom call and when asked about the pen test, repeat something like “we have a security policy in place that obligates us to do a penetration testing at least annually”(Assuming you have such a policy. If you don’t, then you and your company is out of your league selling to governments)Assuming you have a basic set of security policies (almost all of which will say you’ll do pen tests annually), just repeat the line like “we have a security policy in place that obligates us to do a penetration testing at least annually”And if you’re asked again more specifically whether you’ve done one in the past year, don’t answer directly and repeat the quote again.The key here is do say the maximum amount of (positive for your company) truthful information and deflect or redirect away from questions where the truth would hurt the sale. Engineers often have trouble with this because it’s most engineers have a tendency to want to answer questions directly and literally.And, make sure the sales rep is in the call. If the client backs you in a corner and you don’t know how to redirect or deflect, then you hand the baton to the sales guy.Edit: Or, just do a freaking pen test. You can get one done in less than 2 weeks for less than $2k. reply lostdog 16 hours agoparentI would go with, \"I was not involved with pen testing, buthas assured me that it was done.\"But really the right thing to do is to have a conversation with the director where you tell him that you want to support the company as well as possible, but saying that a pen test happened is not something you can do. You want the director to feel that you are reasonable and supportive, but realize that they have to find someone else to claim that the pen test occurred. reply gaganyaan 16 hours agoparentprevWhy be misleading? The directors are clearly wanting him to be a scapegoat. Just get on the zoom call and say you&#x27;ve never done pen testing, and your director lied to them. Also look for another job, this one has a short lifespan remaining one way or another reply cj 16 hours agorootparentTelling the truth isn’t misleading.If you’ve read questionnaires from Jira, AWS, etc, you’ll notice their answers rarely answer the questions directly.Google Jira’s public CAIQ for an example. reply gaganyaan 16 hours agorootparentYou can 100% tell the truth and be misleading. And why should this person put in that effort? The directors will throw them under the bus in an instant, and in fact are probably planning on it. reply catiopatio 16 hours agoparentprev [–] Your advice is to lie by omission after lying by commission?That’s blatantly unethical, if not illegal. reply cj 16 hours agorootparent [–] My advice is to answer the questions politically instead of literally.Compliance people (on the other end of the line) actually like this in many cases… literal answers can make their jobs harder than politically worded (but not untruthful) answers. reply catiopatio 16 hours agorootparent [–] Your advice is to mislead and obfuscate to maintain a lie. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Might just be my imagination though.Also I did some analysis on this dataset a few months ago, and it seems like layoffs tend to happen near the beginning of the month, but I&#x27;m not sure why that would be.Also, as an aside, this doesn&#x27;t cover all places and I&#x27;d guess smaller startups would be less likely to show up. My last place went from about 45 to 10 employees over the last year (layoffs, RTO bs, terminations for \"performance,\" etc.) and isn&#x27;t on this list, for example. reply slg 9 hours agoparent>The time series chart shows a pretty strong decrease in the number of layoffs the last monthDo people remember how these companies were talking a year ago? Because I do.Meanwhile, I just searched Google News for \"[company] quarterly results\" for the three companies with the highest layoff rounds and here were the headlines for the top result for each:>Alphabet reports better-than-expected quarterly results driven by growth in cloud>Amazon reports blowout profit, beats on sales and issues optimistic guidance>Meta reports better-than-expected results and issues optimistic guidance for third quarterIt is almost like the \"difficult economic environment\" that was \"forcing their hands\" might not have been as real as they were claiming. I don&#x27;t know if this was another example of active collusion among big tech companies, but it certainly seems like these layoffs were at least partially motivated by power starting to shift too much into the hands of labor for the liking of some of these companies. reply jsight 9 hours agorootparentI often hear the phrase \"you can&#x27;t drive by looking in the rear view mirror\". In practice, though, most businesses actually do that.A lot of the companies with layoffs had a \"bad\" quarter or so, but hiring continued during that bad quarter. So they correct for the past with layoffs, then resume hiring.It makes perfect sense if you don&#x27;t think about it. reply malfist 9 hours agorootparentIf I&#x27;ve learned anything in the past decade it&#x27;s that CEOs aren&#x27;t any better at predicting the future than you or I.In fact a lot of business strategy seems to be making 5 year plans from last quarters data and assuming last quarter will repeat for five years. Look at all the aggressive hiring. Look at all the aggressive layoffs. reply gedy 8 hours agorootparentAnd enforcing RTO reply oblio 9 hours agorootparentprevTo make things worse these companies are still doing layoffs in various hidden and underhanded ways. From what I figure they&#x27;re doing \"employee refreshes\", i.e. getting rid of more experienced Covid hires with high salaries in favor of less experienced post-Covid hires with lower compensation.For at least a few big companies, it&#x27;s both big and scummy. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentprevIf a company has a great quarter buy hired for a much greater quarter, there could still be problems. My understanding is that there was a bit of a hiring frenzy (everyone desperate to hire as many people as possible) that wasn’t really justified, and most of those companies still have more employees than they did two years ago (even ignoring hiring after layoffs). reply malfist 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t have a history of colluding to keep power from employees.It&#x27;s very suspicious that this \"time of cost cutting\" just so happened to coincide with increased office spending. reply cojo 10 hours agoparentprevI’m not sure if this accounts for the datasets you are referencing, but one reason for layoffs to cluster at the beginning of the month, in the US at least, is health insurance…Typically if you are laid off, your health insurance coverage will run at least through the end of the current month as of your last day before COBRA would kick in. This isn’t a hard and fast rule necessarily, and some layoffs extend healthcare coverage longer anyways, but I know for a fact multiple layoffs I’ve been involved in over the years have timed for the first of the month for this reason. reply zamadatix 9 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d hold off coming to any conclusions on the numbers for a given month until at least after it has passed. reply ehsankia 8 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;m getting a lot more interviews recently.Would these people immediately seek a new job, or would there be a lag between being laid off and seeking a new job, especially if you got a 6-12 month package. Wouldn&#x27;t you want to take a few months off? reply k_process 3 hours agorootparentNot in the US where health insurance is tied to your job and career gaps are perceived as substantially negative. reply moneywoes 4 hours agoparentprevwhat levels are you interviewing for? any suggestions? reply dcoleyoung1 12 hours agoprevtrue aficionados of tech booms remember https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fucked_Company reply jowea 11 hours agoparentThe more things change.... reply garrickvanburen 11 hours agoparentprevLegend reply cle 12 hours agoprevIt would be interesting to count people who were likely forced out due to return-to-office mandates. reply jmspring 9 hours agoparentI think that would be an interesting number to know. I get occasional pings for remote contract options, the rates have dropped quite a bit from personal observation.I’ve been lucky to be fully remote for over a decade. I avoided talking beyond a couple screens with Amazon during Covid because the hiring managers were wishy washy about if “hired remote” meant that would be a permanent thing. Despite the hullabaloo I think most Amazon management knew fully remote had an end date. reply pugworthy 10 hours agoparentprevAlternately, those that chose to not keep their job because they did not return. reply wavefunction 10 hours agorootparentI note your passive voice in this \"construct\" for this fantasy reply pugworthy 10 hours agorootparentI also note the presumptive statement of the comment I replied to. Not everyone agrees that remote work is still a good idea in all situations. reply SantalBlush 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s only a presumptive statement (in this sense) if one assumes there wasn&#x27;t a single employee forced out due to RTO mandates. reply cebert 12 hours agoparentprevI’m a huge proponent of RTO, but that’s a personal decision not a layoff. reply paxys 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a personal decision when the job was advertised as fully remote, you were hired in city A with the expectation that you would continue to live there, and then a few months later the company said \"move your family 2000 miles to city B or resign\".If the company changes the terms of employment and you don&#x27;t accept the new terms, that&#x27;s not on you. The company is the one deciding to fire you, plain and simple. reply finikytou 12 hours agorootparentprevits not a decision when it is forced... reply cebert 12 hours agorootparentThe employee chose not to return to the office though. reply toomuchtodo 11 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constructive_dismissal reply austhrow743 4 hours agorootparentprevWould you be putting it on the employees if instead of laying off people, companies dropped their salary to minimum wage? reply tnel77 12 hours agorootparentprevHard to argue with that logic. reply lmeyerov 12 hours agorootparentACT 1\"We&#x27;re hiring remote, being in NYC or London or Peru is totally fine, geographic diversity of talent is a strength!

I know it&#x27;s annoying, it took me a year to get through a waitlist for ours, haha SF. Totally not a layoff... though HR does tell us to expect 10-20% attrition...\" reply arrowsmith 11 hours agorootparentIs this legal? reply codingdave 11 hours agorootparentIANAL and don&#x27;t know for sure whether or not there are any criminal statutes that would prevent it... but in general, employment is all about what is in your contract with your employer.If you have a contract saying they&#x27;ll never move your job to a new city, you can take a civil action against them to enforce that. But I&#x27;ve never seen such things in my employment history. reply verdverm 10 hours agorootparentCompanies have been doing this forever. As I child, IBM almost relocated our family multiple times. They were doing huge reorgs in the 90sThis is almost certainly down to contract law, but IANAL too reply gusgus01 12 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s definitely still a discussion around the concept of constructive dismissal that could be had. Although a lot of that has to do with the exact parameters of the RTO, so it would be company to company. reply toomuchtodo 11 hours agorootparentI have provided guidance to several folks over the last few years with regards to taking a remote role. I have told all of them to require in their offer letter that the role be defined as remote without an in office component (it helps if you don&#x27;t take a role at an org that has an office within 50 miles of your home address). I have also provided them with contact information for an employment attorney who will provide a letter to their employer with regards to their employment arrangement being remote if the employer attempts to unilaterally change the working arrangement. In no cases has the employer successfully required the employee return to office, and only once was the attorney necessary to push the issue.n=1. If you&#x27;re taking a remote role, have it codified in your offer letter. Retain that as an artifact in the event you need to engage legally. Always be prepared for your job to end at any time due to the state of US employment, but also set yourself up for success whenever possible. The party with the best position of power and the least to lose typically is the one who wins. Always be preparing a paper trail if you feel like the actions your employer is taking might infringe on your labor rights. You&#x27;ve then done all the hard work to then hand it over to an attorney and&#x2F;or government regulator for actioning.And if you&#x27;re not organizing and unionizing to secure remote work as a right at your org, you should consider it. Very favorable environment at the moment to do so.(not an attorney, not your attorney) reply sokoloff 10 hours agorootparent> Very favorable environment at the moment to do so.Is it? I would think that during hiring booms would be a far more favorable environment for workers to drive demands. reply toomuchtodo 10 hours agorootparentNLRB is more aggressive than historically with adults in charge at the executive branch.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37421903Also, structural labor shortages for the next decade.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37524951 reply sokoloff 10 hours agorootparentNLRB just helps you vote to put a union in place. So, now you can pay a union your dues, but if the union doesn&#x27;t have actual structural leverage over the employer, you&#x27;re likely going to pay 1% of your salary for roughly the same deal you have now. reply toomuchtodo 10 hours agorootparent1% of my salary at improved odds of having more power in a work arrangement with an employer sounds like a steal, vs 0% and having no chance. Nothing is assured as always.I spend more than that on annual auto insurance, for comparison, and the odds are much higher I need protection from an employer vs another driver. We may have different opinions on value, and that’s okay. replybjt12345 10 hours agorootparentprevLike in \"office space\".The office had burned down.Everyone failed to go to work. replytempsy 12 hours agoprevI’m mostly interested in forced resignations due to not wanting to RTO.The flip side is impact to “zoom towns” that were booming with remote workers and whether a bunch of new listings from RTO workers will drag certain housing markets lower reply ConorSheehan1 1 hour agoprevSite isn&#x27;t mobile friendly.

Hopefully this is a good sign for our industry. reply steveBK123 8 hours agoparentAI pump began around then.. reply skeeter2020 9 hours agoprevI had a former coworker reach out after he was let go by Paper. They&#x27;ve done 3 rounds of lay-offs, around 100 people each time since May 17. Bravo! talk about the wrong way to make cuts; everyone left must be freaking out. reply shrikant 12 hours agoprevIs this crowd sourced, or is there an element of curation? My ex-employer is on there twice as Kape and Kape Technologies. reply toomuchtodo 12 hours agoparentIt is crowdsourced but also curated by an individual. reply pugworthy 10 hours agoprevIt would be interesting to have an unbiased reason for various layoffs. reply superfrank 9 hours agoparentRates went up and changed where businesses put their money.Let&#x27;s say your company has an idea that they are pretty sure can make a 2% return each year. If they can borrow money at 1% interest, it makes sense to borrow money to fund that project. When rates go up and loans now have 6% interest, borrowing money to fund that project no longer makes sense. On top of that, if they can park money in something like bonds and get a guaranteed 4% return, it actually makes more sense to just shut that project down and put the money in the bank since that&#x27;s a higher return with lower risk.The company in the scenario will actually make even more with less people since parking money in the bank doesn&#x27;t require employees to get a return.That&#x27;s a super simplified version of what has happened. When the safe assets give small returns it makes sense to take risks because the alternatives pay so little. When safe assets give big returns appetite for risk goes down and money flows to safe investments.To put this another way, if you put one million dollars in the bank for 10 years at 1% interest, you&#x27;ll have a little over 1.1 million dollars at the end of ten years. That same million dollars at 6% interest will be worth just under $1.8 million after ten years. To justify taking that money out of the bank you&#x27;ve gone from needing a 10% return to an 80% return. reply OhSoHumble 9 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m at one the companies that issued layoffs. It was dictated by VCs that there had to be a significant reduction in cost before they gave out additional funding. reply ChrisArchitect 8 hours agoprev(2020)Anything new here? reply xeromal 8 hours agoparentThe layoffs are always updated reply syndicatedjelly 13 hours agoprev [–] Why is it okay to list the specific employees who were laid off?

It seems to be gleaned&#x2F;scraped from LinkedIn, so I guess if you keep your profile up to date you will show up in this list... reply mkmk 12 hours agorootparentTypically these lists are created by one of the laid off employees or the HR team that laid them off, and are opt-in. They are circulated to help those who were laid off find new jobs. reply syndicatedjelly 12 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not cool at all reply ssnistfajen 12 hours agorootparentWhy? LinkedIn is public info. These people willingly posted on LinkedIn about changes in their job statuses.The amount of details contained in these spreadsheets (previous job title, YoE, location, work preferences, contact info, etc.) are pretty clearly meant to match with potential employers reply JoRyGu 12 hours agorootparentprev [–] Shouldn&#x27;t as in they might contain names against people&#x27;s consent and that&#x27;s bad, or shouldn&#x27;t as in there is some process in place for people to submit their names and they derive the data from that process? replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://wejn.org/2023/09/running-ones-own-root-certificate-authority-in-2023/",
    "originBody": "Wejn.org Posts Tags About Written on 2023-09-16 Running one's own root Certificate Authority in 2023 internet security sysadm unix x509 Update 2023-09-17: Well, hello Hacker News! (comments) I also added nameConstraints to the cacert.sh to make this even better than before. Yay, constructive feedback! Problem statement Anyone wanting their own X509 cert these days has free-beer alternatives like ZeroSSL or Let’s Encrypt. But, what if it’s just for internal services, some of them even cut off from the ‘Net? And more importantly, what if you don’t wish to be bothered with juggling the renewals every 3 months, or want that sweet wildcard x509 cert with minimum hassle? Well then… how about the age-old solution of rolling out your own root CA? Ideally one that will be accepted without issue by major browsers, including the ones on iOS. Let’s dig in. Background / history lesson Way back when I was just a little bitty boy… we used to do this whole shindig with sign.sh -- Sign a SSL Certificate Request (CSR) script and a modicum of openssl genrsa, openssl req -new -x509, openssl req -new elbow grease. If the copyright line1 is to be believed, that thing predates the height of the Y2K mania. And there isn’t that much wrong with it even now, save for a questionable choice of hash functions. Or so I thought, as I was running that thing with default_days = 3650 for the past many many years. And while that continues to work fine in Firefox on Linux to this day2, you’re bound to hit a brick wall when trying to use server certificates generated that way with Apple devices3. Turns out4, Apple really doesn’t want you to use server certs that are valid for longer than 398 days5, along with a plethora of other restrictions. tldr: 2048bit+, SHA2 digest, CN ignored, altnames is king, keyusage=serverAuth. And with that, here’s what works as of the time of writing… in Firefox and on recent MacOS/iOS. Solution These “make your own x509 root cert” guides are a dime a dozen. And if you’re lazy, go use mkcert instead. It might even work out of the box6. If you’re like me, and simply want to take the road less traveled by (because understanding all this stuff makes all the difference), here’s the requirements: a x509 cert for the certificate authority a x509 cert for every internal service, or maybe just a singleton *.int.wejn.org7 a way to serve the CA certificate somewhere The last one is out of scope, but basically you need a static website that spits out the PEM-encoded certificate with application/x-x509-ca-cert mime type. More on that some other time. Viewing from the top, I want something like: # _gen_all.sh ## generate CA key+cert ./cacert.sh ## generate host key+cert for a single host ./hostcert.sh snowflake.int.wejn.org ## generate wildcard host key+cert with two alt names ./hostcert.sh int.wejn.org '*.int.wejn.org' that in the end produces ca.crt, ca.key, snowflake.int.wejn.org.{crt,key}, int.wejn.org.{crt,key} in working order8.

But it does on mine. Swearsies. Obviously the ca.crt needs to be imported on every device as a root CA, and a guide explaining how to is different for each OS / browser. But having the static website outlined above goes a long way to simplify the import process10, especially on iOS. :) Going rogue with the CA Thanks to the addition of nameConstraints (which I discovered via Hacker News comments), it’s no longer possible to go rogue and issue certificates for other unrelated domains. That makes it significantly safer. Check this out: $ ./hostcert.sh int2.wejn.org '*.int2.wejn.org' CN: int2.wejn.org ANs: int2.wejn.org *.int2.wejn.org Enter to confirm.

Here in openssl, but it would fail the same way on the end user devices. Neat! Closing words This was my brief foray into the wonderful world of running your own root certificate authority in 2023… one that gets accepted by both Apple devices and Linux browsers. An obvious downside of this is having to guard a bunch of secrets11 and the need to rotate the host certificates yearly – because Apple says so. But thanks to the nameConstraints it should be at least tad safer in case the CA keys were compromised. ← → ⇈ © 2023 Michal Jirků. I speak only for myself. 1. Copyright (c) 1998-1999 Ralf S.

Given that it’s roughly the same as a wildcard certificate in terms of end-user use, it’s IMO understandable that this isn’t a priority for the CA ecosystem to support.(The use case of circumventing CT is probably a non-starter as well.

A certificate is fundamentally just a type of credential, like a password, but for historical reasons they’re treated like getting citizenship papers. There’s always this ceremony even in scenarios where it makes zero sense — such as internal-use certificates used for a gRPC API server behind a load balancer.Why - for the love of God why - can’t I just obtain a cert like this directly out of a secret store such as an Azure Key Vault!?These things are already full hardware security modules (HSMs) with all of the capabilities required to run just about anything short of a public Root CA and maybe even that too.But no.NO!Script it yourself. Make a root cert, “upload” it, make a cert, sign it, upload it, link it, renew it, re-configure it, and on and on. Oh… you wanted a CRL too? A 1kb file? Ha-ha! No. Make it and host it yourself!!It’s absurd.So many services depend on a simple CA->cert setup: VPNs, API auth, load balancer back-ends, clusters, etc…But my mark my words: no cloud will have a trivial turnkey solution this decade.This is because running a CA is culturally accepted to be a hard problem. It is! If you’re DigiCert. It isn’t if you’re building a three-server internal use cluster. But the problem is hard, you see? That accepted fact! Everyone knows it! Ceremony is required.

At first, it sounds like more work (you’re now your own CA but without full freedom of a truly self hosted one). reply Nextgrid 9 hours agorootparentThe main advantage is that this CA and all downstream certificates would be globally-trusted (limited to the domain), which is not the case for a custom CA.Security-wise it shouldn&#x27;t be any worse than wildcard certificates which are already a thing. It would actually improve things, because the user can now issue downstream certificates much more granularly without having to interact with the root CA (so you can issue fully offline for an intranet, or issue extremely-short-lived certificates that would otherwise run afoul of root CA&#x27;s rate-limits). reply jiggawatts 9 hours agorootparentIt would improve things for everybody but the certificate authorities.They&#x27;re selling something with a marginal cost of zero for $50 each. A wildcard certificate costs more not because it is materially different or \"harder\" to issue, but because it replaces many $50 certificates. Thus, it \"must\" cost more, or everybody would just use wildcard certificates everywhere and reduce profits at the large public CAs.It is actually possible to get a domain-specific CA like the one you&#x27;re thinking of. I saw one at a large department of education. It allowed unlimited issuance of certificates such as HTTPS, mail-signing, document-signing, and some other types that could be locked to a DNS domain. However, there was still a cost per certificate and the up-front cost was huge, something like $100K. reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentHopefully let’s encrypt continues to put the pressure on them so eventually the other cert authorities start offering things worth paying for. replystanleydrew 11 hours agoparentprevThis is a decent rant, and I mostly share your frustration.But At least GCP and AWS have certificate authority products which essentially do work the way you want them to:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;certificate-authority-service https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;private-ca&#x2F;Azure may well have one too, I just don&#x27;t use their service. reply jiggawatts 10 hours agorootparentYou just answered a rant about too much ceremony by linking to an entire service that costs a staggering USD 400 &#x2F; month.

A certificate is fully public (it’s useless if not). I don’t see how they’re similar in that dimension. Or how certificates are possible without a third party (a core reason for all the ceremony).

Certificates aren’t, I need to be able to hit any website at any point, for the first time. reply jiggawatts 9 hours agorootparentThe key phrase here is internal use. Think authentication between two micro services, not HTTPS for someblog.com.The third party in this case is just a file: the internal CA key.Try to think of this in the following terms: the issued certs are just signed tokens, nothing more. They’re also conveniently a public-private key pair, but that’s not the point.The point is that if you used a 1kb random password for service to service auth and someone tried to sell you a $400&#x2F;mo service to generate them, you’d laugh in their face and then have security escort them from the building.Sprinkle a tiny bit of cryptography on top and suddenly people think $4,800 annually is a bargain for 1kb passwords.I can buy a decent used car for that kind of money. reply jeroenhd 1 hour agorootparentThere are ways to use internal CA certificates to authenticate microservices, though they&#x27;re mostly based on Kubernetes.

If you build a (non-Kubernetes} certificate management solution, you&#x27;ll probably want to sell it for big bucks as well. Generating certificates is just an openssl command line on a timer, the difficulty is getting those certificates deployed in the right places automatically. It&#x27;s all possible through some basic scripting, but to do it right you need to solve more than just the certificate part. reply matthewaveryusa 9 hours agorootparentprevPKI can provide non-repudiation while signed tokens and API keys cannot.

(Narrator: Let&#x27;s Encrypt showed that they can&#x27;t justify this either.)People conflate the two and then try to charge $50 for the $0.0000001 use-case, which is a markup of five million percent. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s upsetting. It&#x27;s just so absurd, and people blink slowly and then start suggesting $40 options as-if that discount somehow makes it okay.

It isn’t hard, but neither is it cheap not. You oversimplify and gloss over a few _really_ important aspects of why and how certificates work. A certificate _acting like a password_ in some cases doesn’t mean it actually _is_ a password, and if you don’t really need the additional functionality to the point where the cost outweighs the delivered value, you are using the wrong tool for the job.Running a CA is not at a technical challenge. Running a _trustworthy_ (there is that word again) CA is process heavy and it involves quite a few people doing work on a regular basis, and without those processes you may as well just something else - like an untrusted CA, or some kind of token issuing service (which, shockingly, also costs money to run properly).A few really good options around DIY CAs were mentioned in this discussion, smallstep is pretty good for example. Nothing (except possibly your $org’s security policies) prevents you from throwing that up somewhere and start vending certs.The fact that it is an internal CA to be used for internal purposes makes no difference, unless you believe that “everything internal is trusted because it is internal” in which case many other discussions on a very wide variety of subjects is due. reply jiggawatts 19 minutes agorootparentInternal here means I don’t need the certificates trusted by a third party.Having built many Enterprise PKI systems — including Smart Card auth - I do know the complexity involved. I can prattle on for hours about how the Key Recovery Agents should be distributed and stored, and how “offline” means no network cables at all you dimwit.I also know that there is virtually no difference between a root CA certificate and a signed leaf certificate.They’re both just files.The difference is the amount of ceremony.DigiCert’s Root CA certificate files had a lot of ceremony — with good reason.But the CA for “I need five devs in India to get VPN certs with a common root” is practically zero.No, it does not take a “a lot of infrastructure” to host a 1kb file. It really doesn’t, and your persistent confusion is my point: you are simply unable to let go of your preconceptions.Just last week I needed a pair of certs with a common root for a load balancer’s back end.

Is this due to a limit on how many SANs one can include in a single certificate.(Maybe the performance degradation of generating a certificate on the fly is less than using a certificate that includes 100s of SANs.) reply entuno 2 hours agoparentI&#x27;m sure sure about a hard limit in the x509 standard (would need to dig into the RFCs) - but the BadSSL site has two test domains that have certificates with 1,000 and 10,000 SANs respectively:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1000-sans.badssl.comhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;10000-sans.badssl.com1,000 works in Firefox and Chromium, but 10,000 gives `SSL_ERROR_RX_MALFORMED_HANDSHAKE` in Firefox, and `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR` in Chromium. OpenSSL won&#x27;t connect to it either - it gives `read_state_machine:excessive message size:ssl&#x2F;statem&#x2F;statem.c:610`So in practical terms, the answer seems to be somewhere between the 1,000 and 10,000. reply chrisweekly 3 hours agoparentprevI think user-perceptible performance degradation might set a lower practical ceiling than purely technical limitations would. I&#x27;ve seen as many as ~200 SANs on a single cert -- but I&#x27;m not claiming any special expertise or insights. reply c0l0 13 hours agoprevActually running a CA, even if only for private purposes, without certain regret down the road involves more than creating an OpenSSL cnf file, creating a root cert&#x2F;key, and running with it.

It&#x27;s so nice getting certs for side projects or self hosting in an instant and with an encrypted (pgp) offline (flash drive in a safe) CA I&#x27;m never really worried about having to reroll. Installing the CA is pretty trivial on most devices and means I don&#x27;t have to worry about CTLs or rate limits, which is especially helpful when I&#x27;m hacking on a saas side project that ends up requesting 10+ certificates every test run. reply NegativeK 14 hours agoprevI went with DNS based Let&#x27;s Encrypt for internal certificates, since I&#x27;m okay leaking my internal DNS names.> An obvious downside of this is having to guard a bunch of secrets and the need to rotate the host certificates yearly – because Apple says so.The guarding secrets thing makes me too uncomfortable with managing my own CA.

It does not. It allows you to issue valid certificates. It&#x27;s only used for signing.It&#x27;s the webserver&#x27;s key that protects the traffic. The webserver&#x27;s operator has that key regardless of who the CA is. In the case of PFS cipher suites (eg EDH) an ephemeral key is used for confidentiality and the endpoint keys are just used for integrity and key authentication.

Even with the webserver key you aren&#x27;t decrypting those streams.You never encrypt data with a key from certificate, even without PFS. That would be too slow. You generate a pre-master key and then use it to generate keys for symmetric algorithms, like AES or Chacha20, that are actually used for data stream encryption. The only difference between PFS and non-PFS is that in the former case pre-master is generated using some form of DH, with promise of keys being destroyed after some time, and in the later case, client just generates a random key, encrypts it with the public key and sends it to the server. reply sneak 6 hours agorootparentMitM is not \"intercept and decrypt arbitrary traffic on the network\" which is what was asserted.

In the early 2010s, the company’s Bulldozer-derived CPU cores stood no chance as Intel made massive gains in power efficiency. Zen narrowed the gap, but AMD still had a lot of work to do. Idle power consumption was still worse than Intel’s. The GPU side was stronger thanks to AMD’s acquisition of ATI, but AMD’s integrated GPUs were often left using horribly out of date graphics architectures. Terascale 3 remained in use on APUs well after GCN discrete GPUs hit the market. AMD launched the Ryzen 7 5800H in 2021 with Vega (improved GCN) graphics, when desktop GPUs had already transitioned to using RDNA 2. Recent AMD products have been turning the situation around. Van Gogh (Steam Deck APU) and Rembrandt finally brought RDNA 2 into integrated GPUs. Phoenix takes another step in the right direction, combining current-generation Zen 4 cores and RDNA 3 graphics into a potent package. We’d like to thank AMD for putting together an excellent Hot Chips presentation on the Phoenix SoC. Alongside using up-to-date architectures for the all-important CPU and GPU, Phoenix integrates a variety of accelerators to improve power efficiency in specific applications. Intel had been integrating accelerators like their GNA AI accelerator for a while, and AMD is looking to catch up. An XDNA accelerator helps with machine learning inference, and an audio controller offloads signal processing from the CPU. Importantly for a mobile SoC, Phoenix also features a capable video engine. We’re going to complement our coverage of AMD’s Phoenix presentation with test data, since Cheese owns a laptop with the Phoenix-based Ryzen 7 7840HS. That laptop uses DDR5-5600 46-45-45-90, and runs the cores at up to 4.5 GHz. HP has thus chosen to artificially limit clock speeds, because the SKU should be boosting to 5.1 GHz. Jiray has also contributed some data from the Ryzen Z1 Extreme as implemented in the ASUS ROG Ally handheld. That configuration gives us a look at Phoenix with LPDDR5. Curiously, ASUS lets the handheld reach 5.1 GHz boost clocks. Phoenix is manufactured on TSMC’s N4 process and occupies 178 mm2. The chip has 25.4 billion transistors, and combines Zen 4 cores with RDNA 3 graphics. Alongside the all-important CPU and GPU, AMD has added several supporting IP blocks to accelerate ML inference and signal processing. Phoenix’s die ends up being smaller than AMD’s prior Rembrandt, and fits into the same 25x35mm BGA package. CPU Side On the CPU side, Phoenix has a cluster of eight Zen 4 cores. We’re very familiar with the core architecture already, and recommend checking out our articles on that. Phoenix however has a different cache setup, with only 16 MB of L3 instead of the usual 32. AMD likely shrank the L3 slices to 2 MB per core to reduce die area usage. From our testing, latency is identical to desktop Zen 4’s. Actual latency will be slightly worse because desktop Zen 4 clocks higher. For example, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D’s non-VCache chiplet sees 8.85 ns of latency at a 16 MB test size. The Ryzen 7 7840HS gets 10.92 ns of latency at the 10 MB test size. Part of that difference is because HP insists on limiting clock speed to 4.5 GHz, even though the 7840HS should be able to boost to 5.1 GHz. Memory latency is also higher at 103.26 ns for the 1 GB test size, compared to 87.68 ns on the 7950X3D. Memory timings play a role here, because my 7950X3D is using DDR5-5600 36-36-36-88. Laptops often have worse memory timings, and the DDR5-5600 CL46 memory used by HP is no exception. Phoenix’s memory controller supports both DDR5 and LPDDR5. The latter is useful in handhelds where power efficiency is of paramount importance. Memory latency with LPDDR5 is higher at 119.81 ns. However, AMD has dramatically improved LPDDR5 latency compared to Van Gogh, which suffered massive latency when CPU cores accessed DRAM. Bandwidth to Infinity Fabric The CPU cluster interfaces with the rest of the system through a 32 byte per cycle Infinity Fabric link. Unlike desktop designs where the write path is half as wide, the CPU-to-fabric write path can also handle 32 bytes per cycle. This is very unlikely to affect real world performance, as I have seen no workload where a single core needs more than 30 GB/s of write bandwidth. A workload with more than one thread could demand more bandwidth, but can also be split across CCX-es. Try writing zeroes and see what happens Paraphrased, from Mahesh Subramony on the sidelines at Hot Chips 2023 Furthermore, AMD has implemented write optimizations to reduce Infinity Fabric traffic. Write bandwidth from a single 7950X3D CCD can exceed 68 GB/s when zeroing cachelines with CLZERO. Zeroing out memory is surprisingly common, because programs will initialize memory to ensure newly allocated memory starts at a known state. Operating systems will often do so as well. If applications zero memory with recognized methods, they can see higher effective write bandwidth than a generic test may suggest. Filling CCX-es one by one with a very contrived set of test runs Stepping back, maximum write bandwidth is very close to that of desktop Zen 4. Read behavior is slightly different because the single cluster’s 32 byte per cycle interface can’t saturate the memory controller. However, 60 GB/s is still plenty of bandwidth for eight cores. Caches should be absorbing the bulk of memory accesses in most client programs. Some applications may take all the bandwidth they can get, like scientific computing or machine learning, but mobile SoCs aren’t your best bet for that. Infinity Fabric Optimizations Infinity Fabric is AMD’s coherent interconnect. It’s critical to power efficiency because interconnect power can be a significant portion of chip power consumption, especially in workloads that aren’t pushing compute at full tilt. AMD has profiled a variety of workloads, and set up Phoenix’s Infinity Fabric to enter different operational modes based on whether a workload is compute bound, IO bound, or has very specific characteristics (like videoconferencing). These optimizations avoid Van Gogh’s problems, where it was limited to around 25 GB/s of CPU-side bandwidth, thanks to an Infinity Fabric implementation heavily optimized for gaming within a tiny power budget. On Cheese’s HP laptop, Infinity Fabric clock varies depending on workload:Ryzen 7840HS (Phoenix) Ryzen 4800H (Renoir) CPU Load 2 GHz 1.6 GHz GPU Load 1.4 GHz 1.6 GHz Mixed CPU/GPU Load 1.6 GHz 1.6 GHz Infinity Fabric clock when running CPU/GPU bandwidth tests My suspicion is AMD’s using low fabric clocks to improve energy efficiency when the GPU’s pulling a lot of bandwidth. The GPU has four 32B/cycle ports to fabric, letting it get enough memory bandwidth even at low fabric clock. CPU workloads are given higher fabric clocks because client programs tend to be more sensitive to latency than bandwidth, and higher fabric clock improves latency. Phoenix’s variable Infinity Fabric clocks contrast with Renoir’s, where fabric clock goes to 1.6 GHz regardless of what component is generating memory traffic. To further save power, AMD aggressively pursues power and clock gating opportunities. A new Z8 sleep state allows power and clock gating for brief periods of idleness, like between keystrokes, with imperceptible wake time. Phoenix can achieve high residency in Z8 state during video playback, suggesting the media engine’s buffers and caches are large enough to let it make memory accesses in short bursts. Additional power savings come from optimizing various physical interfaces. Memory controllers can dynamically change clock and voltage states depending on how much traffic they have to serve. A USB 2.0 interface that AMD has been using for years turned out to have a lot of power optimization opportunities, so AMD tuned that as well. GPU Side Pheonix’s GPU is based on AMD’s current-generation RDNA 3 architecture, and gets a proper “Radeon 780M” moniker rather than just being called Vega or gfx90c. It features six WGPs for a total of 768 SIMD lanes, capable of 1536 FP32 operations per cycle. These are divided into two shader arrays, which each have 256 KB of mid-level cache. A 2 MB L2 cache helps insulate the iGPU from DRAM, and is pretty important to the iGPU’s performance. Compared to Van Gogh, Phoenix has twice as much L2 cache, slightly more memory bandwidth, and 50% more SIMD lanes. To get a sense of how disproportionately big Phoenix’s L2 cache is, AMD’s RX 7600 discrete GPU also has 2 MB of L2 cache, as does Nvidia’s old RTX 3050. Latency at L0, L1, and L2 is quite similar when compared to the RX 7600, though the discrete card is slightly faster thanks to higher clock speeds. Past L2, Phoenix’s iGPU suffers much higher latency because it lacks an Infinity Cache. (LP)DDR5 gives the iGPU a better bandwidth per SIMD operation ratio than that of desktop GPUs, so dedicating area towards another level of cache can’t be justified. DDR5’s bandwidth really can’t be understated. With DDR5-5600 or LPDDR5-5600, Phoenix can achieve higher GPU-side DRAM bandwidth than Nvidia’s GDDR5 equipped GTX 1050 3 GB from several years ago. 5.6 gigabits per pin is also faster than some early GDDR5 implementations. If GPU-side memory accesses hit cache, Phoenix’s iGPU enjoys several times as much L2 bandwidth as Van Gogh. Using Nemes’s Vulkan based bandwidth test because Van Gogh doesn’t have OpenCL capable drivers For perspective, Nvidia’s flagship GTX 980 Ti from 2015 gets 686.9 GB/s of L2 bandwidth in the same test. Phoenix won’t have to worry about L2 bandwidth issues at all, even with its large shader array. Unlike top end desktop RDNA 3 parts, the iGPU runs the frontend and shader array at the same clock. With smaller GPUs, AMD did not see much benefit in clocking the work distribution hardware faster, because the shader array is often the bottleneck. We already saw signs of this on AMD’s RX 7600, and Pheonix’s iGPU has an even smaller shader array. Valve’s Steam Deck already demonstrated how a lot of PC games can run on a handheld. Phoenix’s iGPU is wider, faster, and enjoys more bandwidth than the Steam Deck’s. AMD didn’t provide framerate figures, instead choosing to show Phoenix’s performance advantage over Intel’s iGPU. But given the Steam Deck’s performance, I expect Phoenix to deliver playable framerates at 1080P or 720P with some settings turned down. Video Engine Even if it’s not used for gaming, RDNA 3 comes with a AV1-capable video engine, making Phoenix more future proof as next-generation video codecs start to gain traction. While the engine is not new, AMD did reveal that it uses a race-to-idle scheme to save power. It also has enough throughput to handle several simultaneous video streams, which is important for videoconferencing. XDNA AI Engine Machine learning has taken off in the past few years, and AMD has put an AI engine (XDNA) on Phoenix to accelerate inferencing. XDNA is built from AIE-ML tiles using a Xilinx developed architecture. Phoenix’s XDNA implementation has 16 AIE-ML tiles, and can be spatially partitioned to let multiple applications share the AI engine. AMD didn’t go into specifics of the AIE architecture, but thankfully documentation is public. From AMD/Xilinx’s documentation on the AI engine XDNA aims for enough throughput to handle small ML loads while achieving very high power efficiency. It runs at very low clock and uses very wide vector execution. Documentation suggests a 1 GHz clock, but Phoenix’s XDNA might be running at 1.25 GHz as AMD says BF16 is supported with 5 TFLOPS of throughput. To drive the very wide vector units, XDNA has two vector register files. One 6 KB set of registers provides multiplier inputs. A separate 8 KB register file holds accumulator values and is accessed at a later stage in the multiply-add pipeline. Both register files can be addressed in 1024-bit, 512-bit, or 256-bit modes, with consecutive 256-bit registers forming a 512-bit or 1024-bit one. 6-stage pipeline for BF16 FMA. One cycle longer than the integer FMA pipeline because an extra stage is used for FP normalization. Imagine wanting to be normal. Multiply-add operations seem to have 5-6 cycle latency depending on whether you need FP normalization. It’s a bit long for something running around 1 GHz, but XDNA gives you permutes as part of the deal. Simpler 512-bit adds and shuffles enjoy faster 3 cycle latency. Each XDNA tile feeds its massive vector units with 64 KB of directly addressed data memory. The data memory is not a cache, saving power because no tag checks are needed. Further power savings come from using 20-bit addressing, which ought to be enough for anyone. Addresses are generated by three AGUs, which operate on 20-bit pointer and modifier registers. Using separate registers for addresses is nothing new (the 6502 had two index registers), and avoids needing six extra ports on the main scalar register file. Integer vector pipeline, showing decompression to handle sparsity After addresses are generated, the data memory can handle two 256-bit loads and one 256-bit write per cycle. XDNA enjoys the same bandwidth when accessing data memory on neighboring tiles, which gives a single tile high bandwidth access to 256 KB of memory. XDNA can save significant memory bandwidth (and computational power) with support for 50% sparsity, though ML models have to be developed with sparsity in mind to see benefits. The memory subsystem can decompress sparse matrices, and mask registers let the vector units avoid pointless calculations. Rough sketch of an AIE-ML tile At the frontend, each XDNA tile has 16 KB of program memory for instruction storage. Again, this isn’t a cache, so power is saved by avoiding tag checks and using fewer address bits. VLIW instruction formats allow simple decode logic while letting the frontend bring in up to six instructions per cycle, as long as they’re in the right mix. A VLIW bundle with 6 instruction occupies 16 bytes, but bundles can be shorter too if not all of the slots are needed. AIE-ML tile interconnect layout, from AMD’s documentation At the engine level, XDNA uses a specialized interconnect and memory subsystem. I already mentioned how each tile can directly access data memory on its neighbors with very high bandwidth. But that’s not it. Tiles can forward accumulator outputs to their neighbors too, with dedicated 512-bit interfaces. A general AXI4 interface allows more generic transfers between tiles, and crossing tile boundaries happens with two cycle latency. The whole engine has a shared block of L2 SRAM, which acts as staging memory. AMD didn’t disclose the L2 SRAM size, but I suspect it’s a row of four memory tiles. Each memory tile has 512 KB of capacity, so Phoenix’s XDNA engine could have 2 MB of L2 SRAM. System memory is accessed via DMA, which streams in data using a 32-byte per cycle port to Infinity Fabric. If applications take advantage of it, XDNA should let Phoenix handle AI workloads with better power efficiency than the GPU. Technically, the RDNA 3 iGPU can achieve higher BF16 throughput with WMMA instructions. However, doing so would likely require a lot more power than the more tightly targeted XDNA architecture. Saving every bit of power is vital in a mobile device running off battery, so XDNA should let programs use AI with minimal power cost. AMD says most applications they’re targeting are friendly to INT8 operations, and XDNA should provide massive throughput there. Zooming up, AMD’s Xilinx acquisition is starting to bear fruit. Previously, AMD’s smaller company size and lower budget meant they had less capability to branch out into side projects. AMD’s mobile chips had no answers for Intel’s GNA or IPU. XDNA is a step in the right direction, and gives AMD a potent accelerator for machine learning. Audio Co-Processor As you might have noticed, offloading processing to dedicated accelerators is a becoming a favored way to improve power efficiency. Phoenix goes further than offloading AI by offloading audio processing too. In fact, you could run AI noise reduction on the audio coprocessor if you can fit it within its two DSPs. The audio processor can run at a very low clock while it’s being used as a wake source. With voice assistants playing a role across several operating systems, this could potentially save a lot of power. Another cool use of low power, always-on DSPs is using ultrasound sonar to detect humans. AMD’s ultrasound runs at above 20 KHz but below 35 KHz, letting it get through the microphone and speaker’s band pass filters. Then, it can use Doppler shift to distinguish human movement from static objects in the same way that a look-down radar filters out ground clutter. AMD has opened up this ultrasound engine to third parties. As another note, dog hearing can cover the 20-35 KHz range, so the ultrasound engine may be able to detect static dogs by making them non-static, after which they will cause a Doppler shift. Final Words Phoenix is the latest addition to AMD’s long line of APUs (chips with integrated graphics). Ever since Picasso launched with Zen cores and Vega graphics, AMD’s APUs saw massive improvements from generation to generations. That’s largely because AMD started from so far behind. But Zen 2 and Zen 3 APUs were already very solid products, so Phoenix’s improvements make it a very dangerous competitor. AMD has put a lot of focus into reducing power consumption across every area of the chip. Zen 4 cores do an excellent job on the CPU side, while RDNA 3 provides strong graphics performance. Hardware offload helps power efficiency on specialized AI and audio processing workloads. To support all this, Infinity Fabric gets lower power states and very flexible clock behavior. Phoenix ends up being able to perform well across a wide range of form factors and power targets. Today, Phoenix has already surfaced in a variety of products. These include handhelds like ASUS’s ROG Ally, along with a variety of laptops and mini PCs. AMD now has a mobile CPU ready to take on Intel’s best, and Intel should be worried. We’d like to thank AMD for putting together an excellent presentation at Hot Chips 2023, and hope to see their mobile efforts reach even further in the future.

Not sure why AMD had to ape a failing Intel arch here that was introduced only to improve Intel&#x27;s multicore benchmarks. Now with AMD we will get all the \"heterogenous goodies\" when programs keep running into weird states due to scheduler not being 100% in its core allocations. Even if 5c&#x27;s only difference is in the smaller cache and slower AVX-512, this could bite in unpredictable ways. Moreover, if AMD really needed to go with this hybrid design, why not ape Apple M1 or M2 with only 2 or 4 crappy cores? reply wtallis 6 hours agoparent> Phoenix 2 that will feature few good cores (Zen 5) and many crappy cores (Zen 5c).Phoenix 2 is already starting to ship, with Zen 4 and Zen 4c cores in a 2+4 arrangement. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with this approach: the main downside of Zen 4c cores is they cannot clock as high, but the kind of systems the SoC is going into are thermally limited to the point that using more than two CPU cores is already guaranteed to drop you down to the clock speed range that Zen 4c runs at. Ignoring the impact on chip floorplan and just looking at the implications for software, it&#x27;s more like a more pronounced version of Intel&#x27;s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (preferred cores) rather than the heterogeneous P vs E core situation. All the cores have the same feature support and same performance per clock and the same sizes for their private caches. reply Klinky 7 hours agoparentprevYou can do more power optimizations with efficiency cores than the performance cores. There are power tradeoffs to get max perf. You can significantly reduce vcore if your max frequency is much lower.

    "title": "Linux on a MacBook Pro (M1 Pro): How Good Is Asahi Now?",
    "originLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFx6R26aRHw",
    "originBody": "so I've had this MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro CPU for a while now and apart from daily driving it for a month and a half showing how mid Mac OS is as an operating system I haven't really used it all that much but of course the real goal of getting this very expensive device was to see how well Linux could run on it which brings us to today's video we're going to install azahi Linux on this thing and see what works what doesn't work yet and how usable it is in its current state so grab a cup of your favorite beverage and let's see if modern Apple Hardware can be a good choice to run Linux in 2023 and let's see if today's sponsor can be of use to you as well this video is sponsored by Chasm workspaces which is a great tool to stream any operating system desktop or application straight to your web browser they just released version 1.14 which adds translations for 200 and 43 languages along with a completely redesigned administrator user interface to streamline administrative workflows additional updates include support for local webcams and Printers Plus the ability to persist your data to cloud storage drives like Google Drive next cloud or OneDrive along with saving your persistent profile to S3 block storage these updates make it easier than ever to host on-demand access to your desktops and applications the chasm workspaces Community Edition can be self-hosted or they also have a cloud SAS subscription so to learn more about Chasm workspaces click the link in the description below so first the distro it's azahi Linux you can't currently run any Linux distro you want on Apple silicon Hardware while basic support for the CPU is baked in recent Linux kernel versions most of the hardware in a Mac isn't supported yet but thankfully some ins insanely Goods developers have created azahi Linux it's Arch Linux with some super bleeding edge drivers to support the newest MacBooks and desktop Max from M1 to M2 and of course there's also Fedora azaki remix which is Fedora plus all the patches and drivers from Asahi inside but I thought I would give a shot to the source material first if you want a dedicated video about Fedora azahi let me know and I plan that for next month now what's interesting is that azaki Linux is just a reverse engineering effort Apple doesn't publish specifications or open source code on how their stuff works they haven't locked the bootloader on recent Max but they also don't really officially support installing any other OS than Mac OS so the Mad azahi devs have taken upon themselves to reverse engineer everything and they've managed it pretty well already so let's see exactly how well now installing azahili Linux is a simple process you just run a single terminal command there is no ISO to download or graphical installer you just run a command in the Mac OS terminal what it will do is download an install script and run it it will actually create a dual boot and it won't completely replace Mac OS so you can try it without worrying too much about making your Mac unusable although your Mac probably runs Mac OS right now which I would argue makes it unusable but maybe that's just me Asahi supports all M1 machines for now except the Mac Studio and you will need about 60 gigs of storage because Mac OS requires a lot of free space for future updates and Asahi leaves that available so you're not stuck in the future it gives you a choice for the desktop you want you get the default azahi desktop which is Arch Linux for arm with plasma but you can also get a minimal OS without a graphical environment or a minimal UEFI environment so you can try any other Linux distro although as I said previously none really have good support but maybe from Fedora azaki remix you also get to pick the size of the partition of course and then the installer starts resizing it and we'll start the install proper it will also ask a few questions along the way like the name of the US and the space you want to use in the newly resized partition it is really easy if you're not afraid of using the terminal but it's really guided but also if you're not afraid of using Alpha quality software because yes azahi isn't in beta or stable it's Alpha so you will encounter some problems once the script has done its thing you will need to completely shut down the Mac then reboot it by pressing and holding the power button until you see a volume list to boot on where you can pick Asahi Linux you will also have to disable system Integrity protection it's all guided with the azahi installer by just typing your Mac OS username and password and then you will be dropped into azahili Linux proper with a first run setup to create your user after that the default boot option will be Asahi not Mac OS to use Mac OS you will need to restart by holding the power button until you get the volume selection and you can pick Mac OS so let's look at what works out of the box on this M1 Pro MacBook Pro yes Apple's naming scheme is now just as bad as Microsoft's with the Xbox so on my MacBook Pro a lot of stuff works perfectly without anything to do on my part the keyboard is recognized perfectly with the function keys mapped to some KDE features like the search key opening K Runner all the mission control key opening the KD overview keyboard backlight also works fine out of the box the touchpad is also fully functional in tap to click with the normal click with the usual vibration that Mac touchpads have and two finger scrolling and tapping also works the display is recognized with its full resolution although it doesn't support the high refresh rate that it should have it's locked to 60 hertz Wi-Fi also worked immediately but audio didn't with the default audio interface being turned off and turning it on didn't do anything for me Bluetooth also works perfectly charging the laptop as well and in terms of ports the USB C ports do work but only as USBC and USB 2 for now not USB 3 and not Thunderbolt either so basically you get the same transfer speeds as what Apple gives you on the iPhone if it's fine for a phone it's fine for a computer isn't it now this won't prevent you from plugging in some peripherals like a USB stick but you won't get charging and plugging into a display at the same time with one cable for example external displays also do not work through these Sports the display lights up it detects something is there but no image ever carries through the SD card slot also works but the HDMI port doesn't the audio jack is also not supported but it's probably because the whole audio system isn't also the webcam won't work the onboard mic is detected but doesn't record anything and sleep doesn't completely work it can go into S2 idle but not deep sleep so while the device will use less power than if it was on it won't save as much power as in Mac OS and the support is a bit broken for example if you have USB peripherals plugged in they might not wake up with the computer so for now you get something relatively usable the the Basic Hardware that you really absolutely need works but it is not optimized and a lot of stuff isn't available yet what's really missing for me is the speaker and audio output I don't care about the mic the webcam the USB speeds I do everything with like Wi-Fi transfers anyway but yeah no sound kind of a bummer now what about CPU performance and battery life then well it was a bit tough to test here because geekbench's default executable for Linux isn't supported on arm they have an experimental version but it failed to run for me I managed to find a geekbench 5 version for arm and Linux which Ran So I will at least have some comparison point the M1 Pro under Linux got a single goal score of 1718 and a multi-core score of 10079 compare that to geekbench 5 on Mac OS where I got 1775 in single core and 12 521 in multi-core that's a difference of three percent for single core and 24 for multi-core in favor of Mac OS which means that CPU support on this MacBook Pro isn't bad under Linux you do get a little bit less Max performance out of it but it's still very reasonable and it's probably due to better supporting the efficiency cores and the the performance scores in terms of battery life though it is way worse with YouTube videos playing in the loop in the background Asahi barely lasted for about four and a half hours compare that to Mac OS well the same test gave me about 13 hours not exactly the same is it so you're still getting really solid performance and probably better performance than a lot of x86 laptops that go for the same price as these MacBook Pros but you're still not taking full advantage of the hardware and the battery life is really bad which is probably due to the GPU so let's talk about that by default the GPU isn't really used for anything inazaki but the developers managed to write a fully conformant opengl driver for Apple silicon something Apple themselves doesn't have because they only support their own Graphics API called metal now this driver isn't fully enabled yet by default so you're not getting graphical acceleration in the Window Manager you're not getting animations and you're not getting GPU accelerated video decoding either the system runs with llvm pipe which means software rendering so no vsync no smooth window movement no Waylon no gestures no smooth animations except you can very easily install the new GPU drivers with just a few command lines and that's what I did now I do get GPU acceleration and it is now recommended that I use Weyland because the azaki team said X11 wouldn't really be a supported Target for their Graphics drivers and also the battery life got way better thanks to these drivers it reached 8 to 9 hours of video playback in a loop which is much better than the four and a half to five hours I got without the drivers it's still not close to Mac OS but it's very usable and also kind of better than most x86 laptops at the same price range as per gaming don't expect much here steam will not run because well it's arm and steam on Linux doesn't have an armed version even if it did there are no Vulcan drivers yet so stuff like dxvk wouldn't work and there is no translation layer baked into azaki to run x86 apps you can run a few Linux native games here like super tuck scart at very good frame rates but you won't really be gaming on this thing I guess you could try something like box 86 but without Vulcan drivers your gaming experience is gonna be virtually non-existent so basically exactly like on Mac OS because they don't have games either now Jokes Aside once there's a Vulcan driver available I'm pretty sure you'll be able to run Steam with box 86 which seems to give decent performance and probably game on that thing although it will always be hackier and slower than just using a supported architecture to run the same thing still they've done a great job and in day-to-day use the new opengl drivers are actually really good for just using your desktop now of course we also need to talk about app support Asahi Linux is basically Arch plus more drivers so you do get the Aur and everything else Arch has access to but the OS is running on an RM CPU which means some software just is not available for that architecture there's no OBS Studio there's no steam now to be fair most of what I use personally was available can own boxes LibreOffice Firefox audacity next Cloud they were all there if you use mostly free and open source software you will probably be fine for third-party proprietary apps that people package that's flat packs or snaps though you will probably not be able to run them which means it is very important before you decide to jump in and buy your Mac to run Linux or switch your Mac over from Mac OS to Linux just check if the software you really need runs for me personally no OBS studio and no Dev insurance resolve is a deal breaker I would never be able to run this laptop as my main device as it is right now so the question is is azahi Linux ready and that's the question that absolutely depends on your use case if you just need the Base Hardware decent performance and decent battery life then yes I would say go try it it is still Alpha quality so you will face some problems not all apps have an armed version so you won't be able to run everything and GPU support is really Bare Bones even with the new drivers there's the lack of audio the lack of webcam the like of the microphone on the laptop which are big bummers but it's currently being worked on and the lack of external display support is also a deal breaker for me personally but if you don't care about any of this and you're not a gamer then yes Asahi Linux in a day-to-day use case is fine already but also Macs are very expensive and if you want to take advantage of every single Hardware feature you paid for to the maximum of its abilities then no azahi Linux is not ready yet your battery life won't be as good you won't have access to a lot of GPU related stuff some of the the ports and some of the hardware flat out doesn't work including Thunderbolt which is the main advantage of these devices it all depends on your own use case basically so I hope this video gave you a good look at what azahi Linux can and can't do currently for me personally it wouldn't work there's too many stuff missing too much of the hardware isn't working and some software I absolutely need just doesn't run on arm but for you it might be different now if you want to see how well Fedora azahi runs on the same device leave me a comment in the description below and in the meantime I'll leave you with this segue to our sponsor if you're looking for a device to run Linux specifically you might be better off looking at our sponsor tuxedo they make laptops and desktops that ship with Linux pre-installed and all the hardware has been picked specifically because it runs well under Linux and if there are a few Kinks to iron out they generally submit patches Upstream to fix all of these issues they have a big range of devices that should treat every need and every price point if you wanted something like a Mac you can find stuff that is just as well built and a little bit less expensive and if you want an Ultra Book a Nook or Tower a gaming laptop they also have all of this all the laptops can be opened repaired and upgraded including the ram the SSD and also the battery and sometimes even the wireless card and there are a lot of customization options you can bring your own keyboard layout you can have your own logo engraved on the lid of the laptop you can change the look of the super key it's just very customizable so if you need a new computer and you want to run Linux on it don't play around with a Mac if you really need something productive click the link in the description below and get yourself a tuxedo laptop or desktop so thanks everyone for watching the video I hope you enjoyed it if you did don't hesitate to like to subscribe to turn on notifications to write a comment and if you didn't like it well there's that dislike button as well and just leave me a comment down below to tell me why and if you want to support the channel I left plenty of links in the description below just for that liberape patreon YouTube

(youtube.com) 142 points by sys_64738 13 hours ago| hidepastfavorite91 comments dan-robertson 11 hours agoOne thing I was curious about but couldn’t work out from reading online is whether hardware-assisted tracing is supported. (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linaro.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;coresight-perf-and-the-opencsd-l... or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Gm2ZXIB18PQ for descriptions. This uses the ARM CoreSight&#x2F;Embedded Trace Macrocells feature. The Intel equivalent is something called Intel Processor Trace. MacOS doesn’t seem to expose this tracing functionality in the way that perf on linux may, and the publically released Darwin source code seems to barely mention it). Has anyone here installed Linux on an M1&#x2F;2 computer and checked if the hwtracing support works? reply zamadatix 10 hours agoparentIf you know of a quick and easy way to test I&#x27;d be glad to report the result. I have an M2 running the Fedora version of Asahi. reply chaxor 12 hours agoprevThe battery life (i.e. the backlight being either ON or OFF, without anything in between) is one of the biggest points that hinder moving to asahi for me.Every time I open it up to try it out again, it&#x27;s so bright that I try to reduce the brightness, which turns off the screen completely, which then has to be fixed by imagining what the screen state is and using hotkeys and typing out commands to get it back to full on blasting the sun out from the screen.The selling point for this when usable IMO is having a laptop that will last 4x the (already insane) battery lifetime of macos, by having just a basic terminal and no default background processes that macos has. reply SamuelAdams 5 hours agoparentYou might need to use Ashai-edge to get the latest features. Backlight control is one of them. reply zamadatix 9 hours agoparentprevAdjustable brightness has been available for M1 devices for about a year now and I forget how long for M2. Before you go and install I&#x27;d wait for this Arch Linux ARM -> Fedora switch to finalize in the next couple of weeks though. reply ranguna 56 minutes agorootparentI know fedora will inherit the kernel changes the Asahi team is doing, but will the Asahi team fully switch to fedora? reply djhope99 12 hours agoprevI run Asahi Linux on my M2 MacBook, initially I was quite impressed but agree with other comments here that development seems to have stalled. Nothing really impacting my daily life has changed for 6-12 months. I don’t use it as my main os but I occasionally boot into it, update it and see if anything has changed.Lack of external monitor support and built in speaker support are by far the most needed features imo. reply psanford 5 hours agoparentDevelopment hasn&#x27;t stalled. There&#x27;s a bunch of features that they have been making a lot of progress on. I&#x27;d expect to see quite a few of them before the end of the year. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentAlso, I guess it is an 80-20 thing - as they progress, a unit amount of change will be less user-noticeable. reply POiNTx 7 hours agoprevAnyone with a Macbook Air 15 inch M2 running asahi? What has your experience been like? reply ChatGTP 5 hours agoprevIt’s a shame they we can’t buy better hardware for Linux.

Better yet do 4-6x 21700s. reply ChatGTP 1 hour agorootparentprevI’m not in the USA, so warranty on these alternate brands is a nightmare.My Lenovo is ok, but I don’t see it continuing forever.

I&#x27;ve been curious and would like to hear experiences reply mixmastamyk 12 hours agoprevThis is a well done video but doesn’t bring any new info if you have already been paying attention. That’s ok, but also has all the annoyances of youtube, poor information density with semi-frequent “hit like&#x2F;check out my sponsor.” reply bestouff 12 hours agoprevI got my MacBook Pro M1 exactly 1 year ago. At the time I thought the Linux state was incredible - so much things were usable, the remaining missing bits would be quick to come. Fast forward to now. From a pure user point of view nothing has changed. No sound&#x2F;webcam&#x2F;microphone, no hdmi, no thunderbolt, battery draining when running and on suspend, wifi&#x2F;bluetooth need a periodic reboot, etc. Only a (quite good) 3D driver has been added. I wouldn&#x27;t do it again. reply extr 12 hours agoparentYeah, I think people were overly optimistic given the initial progress. The Asahi team has done incredible work to be sure with just getting it running and the GPU driver. But there is a long tail of things to fix to make it truly usable as a daily driver.For me personally, I thought the project was awesome, installed it, booted it, and realized the trackpad felt really janky. I start playing with the acceleration settings and then caught myself and remembered that not having to deal with that exact thing was why I bought a Mac to begin with. reply tourmalinetaco 12 hours agorootparentOne major problem is in the fact that Hector&#x2F;Asahi has very little experience with distribution maintenance, and is mainly suited to the role of reverse engineering the M1 chip and implementing the driver. It would be far better if he put all of his focus into the M1 driver itself and let others handle the surrounding distro variants. In fact this recently came up when he misconfigured GRUB during updates and soft-locked Macs until they ran a list of sudo commands to fix the error. reply mort96 11 hours agorootparentTo their credit, this is a more challenging than your standard Linux distro. Lots of software just has a bunch of subtle bugs on arm which don&#x27;t exist on x86_64. Other software has a bunch of subtle bugs on 16k page sizes. Those problems aren&#x27;t ones you&#x27;ll face as a distro maintainer for some x86_64 Linux distro. Then there&#x27;s the issue that Arch Linux ARM is itself not always super competently managed, so it&#x27;s not a solid foundation to build on top of.I think it&#x27;ll be very good for them to leave all the distro responsibilities to Fedora and focus on the hardware specific stuff. But I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll stop facing weird issues related to not being part of the 4k page size x86_64 monoculture. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentI wonder, wouldn’t a NixOS Asahi fork make sense? It has proper, fail-safe updates (you can select the previous version in the boot menu) and reproducible package builds even for very finicky configs. reply saagarjha 7 hours agorootparentprevOk, but the page size is something they chose themselves? reply vulcan01 7 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that the chosen page size is optimal for the M-series integrated memory. reply tedunangst 8 hours agorootparentprevBut was the grub issue caused by the 16k page size? reply NoahKAndrews 12 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the whole point of their new partnership with Fedora reply charcircuit 10 hours agorootparentThat didn&#x27;t help as the parent mentioned as Fedora Asahi Remix shipped a bug that caused people&#x27;s grub config to be overwritten with one that didn&#x27;t work preventing the machine from booting. There was no way to remotely fix users and a solution took days to come out for people to manually fix it by typing in commands to the bootloader. reply prmoustache 12 hours agoparentprevAs a linux user why would you buy hardware from a company that do not provide any modicum of support for it? reply Asdrubalini 11 hours agorootparentBecause the hardware is really good. Better than any other hardware you can find (especially for a performance&#x2F;watt standpoint, which for a laptop is somewhat important). Touchpad and keyboard are also top tier, screen is really nice, speakers are good and I ran out of adjectives. reply bigstrat2003 9 hours agorootparentObviously everyone has to make their own decisions on tradeoffs, but for me there&#x27;s no such thing as hardware good enough to put up with all the complications that Asahi Linux will face for some time to come (as they work to iron out all the kinks). reply sneak 12 hours agorootparentprevTo not end up with a PC laptop, the likes of which haven&#x27;t been meaningfully redesigned save for spec bumps for 15 years.Trackpad, speakers, case, thermals, cpu - the lowest end MBA blows the highest end \"ultrabook\" out of the water. reply croes 7 hours agorootparentThe MBA is the best in performance per watt but there are better ultrabooks if you ignore the energy consumption.> the lowest end MBA blows the highest end \"ultrabook\" out of the waterThat&#x27;s untrueAnd remember the screen cracks?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;30&#x2F;m1-macbook-screen-cracks&#x2F; reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t really make sense to ignore energy consumption in a supposedly portable device. That’s like saying that a ship is more efficient way of transport, if you ignore that it can’t go over land. reply p1necone 9 hours agorootparentprev> thermalsApple has been consistently terrible at cooling design, the only reason m1&#x2F;m2 systems don&#x27;t have thermal issues is because they sidestepped the problem entirely by building a very thermally efficient chip. reply sneak 9 hours agorootparentNot having the problem in the first place is the best way to solve it. We are discussing finished products. My M2 air lasts a million hours and doesn&#x27;t get hot. My XPS lasts 4 or 5 and burns the top of my legs.I&#x27;m not sure yours is the criticism you think it is.Ultimately, heat is waste, and the less of it you generate, the better. When I said \"thermals\" I meant chip design, not cooling system design. This is obviously one of the huge benefits of their vertical integration. reply fooker 9 hours agorootparentprevMaking a difficult problem irrelevant is pretty solid engineering. reply matternous 9 hours agorootparentprevA chip that doesn&#x27;t get hot sounds like pretty efficient cooling design to me. reply unlikelytomato 7 hours agorootparentprevI struggle to understand this Goalpost. Thermals and power go hard in hand. Battery life and noise follow suit. Overheated legs and wrists are not much fun either. In any case, most other laptops in a similar form factor have equal or worse cooling. Thermal throttling shows up on laptop reviews a lot. reply Ar-Curunir 8 hours agorootparentprevSo they treated the symptoms by treating the cause? Sounds like a win to me lol. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentprevSo.. they don’t have thermal issues? reply weatherlight 5 hours agorootparentprevthey took entire class of problem and made it disappear, that&#x27;s great engineering. reply throwaway2990 7 hours agorootparentprevActually Apples cooking has been pretty rock solid. What let apple down was Intel.Intels mobile CPUs have been, and still are absolute trash. reply OJFord 12 hours agorootparentprevI am a Linux user and not a MacBook owner, but I do really like (having used it myself in the past - 2013 Air, 2016 MBP - and seen others&#x27; recent stuff) Mac hardware. If my preferred Linux distro (Arch btw) just worked out of the box on Macs I would love one (though I do have a Framework now and the repairability etc. certainly would make me reluctant).Also though, I have a Windows desktop pretty much just for Fusion 360. I really dislike Windows, macOS as a BSD derivative is obviously a bit more comfortable&#x2F;familiar&#x2F;usable, I would love to (legitimately) dual-boot macOS and Linux, the former to allow me to run software that&#x27;s not available on the latter. WINE (even with Lutris etc. recent work) is too fragile and difficult to get working and keep working. reply jwells89 12 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s very little comparable in the non-Mac world when it comes to battery life, no performance penalty for not being tethered, and heat&#x2F;fan noise, mainly.I&#x27;ve looked. There&#x27;s a couple that are kinda in the same realm if you squint but come with tradeoffs like having to keep the CPU throttled to get anywhere near the advertised battery life. reply manderley 10 hours agorootparentBut that doesn&#x27;t apply at all if you&#x27;re a Linux user? reply jwells89 10 hours agorootparentI’ve read that battery life for Linux on M-series is still a good deal better than on quite a few other laptops despite it being non-optimal.There are also those using macOS on their MacBooks until Linux gets good enough to daily drive. reply edwcross 3 hours agorootparentprevBecause Framework does not work with resellers (so my company cannot buy it), Dell keeps doing stupid Linux-hostile things (like re-releasing accessory revisions that break Linux features), and Lenovo has no high-end laptops available (at least not on the business side).

It&#x27;s only recently that some level of official support has emerged in limited cases. reply justinclift 10 hours agorootparentIn laptops, Dell has been officially making Linux compatible models for years.There are also smaller, specialist manufacturers that do Linux laptops. System76 is one that springs to mind, though other people have mentioned various others before. reply ficklepickle 8 hours agorootparentLenovo seems to have a pretty good selection of models offering Linux. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentAnd most of them are similarly riddled with random bugs, like the CPU throttling to hell. E.g. the T480 has a more limiting throttling, because the motherboard can tell whether you hold it in your lap or not, but only on windows - on linux it defaults to the safe bet of being on your lap all the time. It can be circumvented by a python script that regularly overwrites this variable.. reply kaba0 2 hours agorootparentprevWhich serious hardware company has any modicum of support for linux? It’s not like the thinkpad runs on 100% open hardware, most of that was reverse engineered the same way. reply Gigachad 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause I primarily care about having the best computer. And then Linux is a nice to have. reply hu3 7 hours agorootparentThe question started with: \"As a linux user\"...Linux doesn&#x27;t seem like a nice to have for Linux users. reply Gigachad 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve used linux for a decade now and still use it on my desktop. But it&#x27;s not a strict requirement for me. On my laptop I just need something that has a super good battery life and is performant. And the macbook is so far ahead of the rest that it wins for me.I didn&#x27;t buy the macbook expecting to install linux on it, but if I can later, that&#x27;s just an extra win. reply rowanG077 5 hours agorootparentprevFor me it&#x27;s the same base reason. I primarily care about having the best computer, which means Linux is a must. reply alphanullmeric 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause absolutely nothing else is as good in all aspects.

Thanks for the comment. reply heavyset_go 12 hours agoparentprevAnd Apple is always releasing a moving target. This was the same case even back when they were running on PC architecture with Intel hardware. reply wtallis 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure the \"moving target\" argument holds up to much scrutiny. Asahi has been able to re-use the UART driver from the Samsung SoCs that went into the earliest iPhones, the I2C driver from PA Semi&#x27;s PowerPC chips, and the GPU reverse engineering was greatly helped by the PowerVR heritage. There&#x27;s clearly a fair bit of \"if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\" in Apple&#x27;s hardware design strategy. Meanwhile, on the Wintel side the past ~decade has seen a complete overhaul in how systems sleep, and CPU features like TSX and SGX and MPX have come and gone, presenting OS developers with plenty of churn to deal with. reply zamadatix 10 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t say Apple is any less a moving target rather they&#x27;ve only released 2 generations of the M series so far. As an example it&#x27;s looking like the 3rd generation will swap the GPU architecture you mentioned for something completely new.Sure, there are plenty of things that don&#x27;t change much, and that I2C driver is a good example, but that doesn&#x27;t really mean the target as a whole is particularly stable it just means they don&#x27;t feel the need to rewrite I2C every chip revision. Meanwhile many of the things churning on the x86 side, like memory encryption, don&#x27;t really matter for projects like this. reply wtallis 9 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t trying to say that Apple&#x27;s platform is remarkably stable, only that there&#x27;s no evidence it is particularly unstable. Even if their next GPU architecture requires a more or less complete re-write of the drivers, that on its own still wouldn&#x27;t justify considering Apple&#x27;s platform to be more of a moving target than the PC&#x2F;Wintel platform—though it would bolster complaints about the necessity of reverse engineering rather than having documentation available (complaints that apply just as much against NVIDIA&#x27;s GPUs). It&#x27;ll probably take at least one or two more generations of Apple hardware before one can reasonably accuse them of being a constantly moving target. For now, the best evidence we have to go on is the fact that it took Asahi about a week to bring M2 support up to parity with the M1 support they had at that time. reply zamadatix 8 hours agorootparentThat the first updated version didn&#x27;t just boot automatically is 100% evidence it&#x27;s more unstable than your typical system family. It partially comes down to Apple putting absolutely nothing into Linux, even Nvidia does better than that these days, but even then you can at least expect to boot year old Linux on a new PC even if it doesn&#x27;t support the latest CPU scheduling optimizations for it or whatever.I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;d even agree M2 is even at parity with M1 in Asahi yet, let alone the first week. They did get a lot of things working quickly but I think that&#x27;s far overselling what happened. reply wtallis 7 hours agorootparent> but even then you can at least expect to boot year old Linux on a new PC even if it doesn&#x27;t support the latest CPU scheduling optimizations for it or whatever.It&#x27;s still extremely common that booting a year-old distro on brand new hardware leaves you with a blank screen due to missing GPU drivers, or leaves you with unaccelerated graphics on par with what Asahi currently offers by default. And it&#x27;s hardly unheard of to have issues with power management and even audio with new x86 platforms in recent years. Going a bit further back, Intel has been known to break NVMe and not require OEMs to offer a BIOS option to put the chipset in the standards-compliant mode. reply zamadatix 4 hours agorootparentAnd yet if all that happened it would still be a better state than the M2 support in Asahi at launch. When the GPU acceleration doesn&#x27;t work at least the display output can. When a certain chipset has an issue with NVMe at least you can still boot other ways than the internal NVMe drive.When the M2 launched you couldn&#x27;t boot the kernel. When you could boot the kernel you couldn&#x27;t handle displays. When you could handle displays you couldn&#x27;t connect to Wi-Fi. All this in the first minor update to the SoC, one where nothing major even changed yet. This is why, despite my love and regular use of Asahi, I&#x27;ll never believe a claim new Apple systems are a remotely stable target. Certainly not more than x86, where I can boot a decade old distributor and still at least get video output. reply wtallis 4 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re not being particularly fair. You seem be be wanting to hold Asahi Linux to a standard of having day-1 support for all the critical subsystems of new Apple hardware, while excusing or ignoring all the historical instances of Linux not having usable support for corresponding components in the Wintel ecosystem by the time new hardware is in the hands of end users.> When a certain chipset has an issue with NVMe at least you can still boot other ways than the internal NVMe drive.A laptop that cannot boot off its internal storage is pretty much useless as a laptop. The theoretical capability to work around this with external USB storage is a pathetic workaround that does not strengthen your argument.> When the GPU acceleration doesn&#x27;t work at least the display output can.Except when it doesn&#x27;t. Sure, a sufficiently skilled user can usually figure out a working configuration, but let&#x27;s not pretend like a black screen early in the boot process is unheard-of, and a showstopper for many users.> Certainly not more than x86, where I can boot a decade old distributor and still at least get video output.As long as your decade-old distro had UEFI support (which most did, by then). But otherwise, it is possible to run into issues with a BIOS CSM no longer being an option (eg. on the last three years of Intel integrated graphics).And again, I&#x27;m not trying to say Apple&#x27;s hardware platform is unusually stable and backwards-compatible. I&#x27;m trying to refute an unwarranted claim that after only two generations it&#x27;s already proven significantly unstable—a claim you seem to agree with based on a selective memory of the history of Linux on x86. The conventional wisdom still is that running an x86 Linux distro older than your hardware is asking for trouble, especially for laptops. Hardware vendors in the x86 ecosystem ship breaking changes fairly often; only a few of them even try to get Linux driver support in place before the hardware launches, and those drivers still frequently miss the deadlines for making it into major distro releases prior to the hardware shipping. replydylan604 12 hours agoparentprevdoes the original Apple recovery partition remain so that you could return it back to the original OS if one was to try this but prefer to go back? reply zamadatix 10 hours agorootparentThe other responses are answering everything but the actual question: You can NOT remove the recovery partition when installing Asahi. It&#x27;s required to boot Asahi.In regards to the comment about not needing to uninstall OSX (actually macOS 13 at this point) if you don&#x27;t want to: you almost definitely do want a side-by-side install. macOS is the only way to get firmware updates right now and there are certain scenarios you could run into on the Asahi side that may require you to install macOS to be able to fix them. If you really really wanted, it is technically correct that you could uninstall the non-recovery macOS though. reply wtallis 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you have access to a second Mac, you can restore macOS even after a complete disk wipe, no recovery partition needed:> Will this break my machine?

I&#x27;m not really a big fan of macOS from a development perspective. But honestly the whole system integration thing is where it wins over everything else and that will never be replicated by Linux based on the last 20 years of experience. It&#x27;ll be persistent problems and regressions. I don&#x27;t have the time, energy or motivation left in me to deal with that sort of stuff now. It only ever gets to 80% done. The last 20% is too hard for people to nail down.My supposed freedom I trade for friction.

This mirrors the satisfaction programmers often find when grappling with a compiler or achieving the ideal abstraction. However, it seems that this sense of accomplishment, while valuable in its own right, shouldn&#x27;t be derived from the tools I use for my primary tasks. I prefer my machine to just work, so I can focus on addressing higher-level, more significant challenges.I say this as someone who would be absolutely delighted if a few distros just worked 100% seamlessly on an MBP or similar.

Read our editorial policy. Home Features Unity's self-combustion engineThis Week in Business We dive into the Runtime Fee and why it makes perfect sense for Unity management and no sense at all for anyone else Feature by Brendan Sinclair Managing Editor Published on Sept. 15, 2023 Follow Unity This Week in Business is our weekly recap column, a collection of stats and quotes from recent stories presented with a dash of opinion (sometimes more than a dash) and intended to shed light on various trends. Check back every Friday for a new entry. Unity had a pretty bad week. I'm actually writing this lead on Tuesday afternoon, but feeling pretty confident that whatever happens from here on out, this much will be true. (Friday morning update: Yup.) Tuesday morning, Unity decided to introduce its new Runtime Fee, which Unity developers of a certain size will have to pay every time their game is installed on a new device after January 1, 2024. STAT$0.20 – The fee per install for small developers (Unity Personal subscribers) whose games brought in $200,000 in the past year and have 200,000 lifetime installs to date. STAT$0.01 – The fee per install for large developers (Unity Enterprise clients) whose games brought in $1 million in the past year and have lifetime sales of one million or more. It doesn't sound like a lot, and if a developer just had to pay the fee each time they sold a $60 game, it wouldn't be. But there are problems because these charges are based on game installs, not sales, and Unity has not done a great job communicating what's going on here. QUOTE\"An install is defined as the installation and initialization of a project on an end user's device.\" – Unity's initial FAQ on the new fee. We asked Unity if that would include demos, since those are distinct projects that get installed on end user devices and certainly seem to count. QUOTE\"No, demos, trials, game bundles and giveaways - like the Humble Bundle - do not count as installs.\" – A Unity spokesperson, in an email response to use on Tuesday afternoon. Oh, phew! That could have been bad, but thankfully Unity was quick to dispel— QUOTE\"If it's early access, Beta, or a demo of the full game then yes [it will result in a Runtime Fee]. If you can get from the demo to a full game then yes. If it's not, like a single level that can't upgrade, then no.\" – A Unity representative in the company's official forums in a thread edited Tuesday night. What. How about games included in streaming services? They aren't really installed on an end user's device, so they shouldn't count, right? QUOTE\"Subscription services, like Game Pass, do count as an install.\" – Unity's spokesperson responds to our inquiry about how streaming games would be counted for the Runtime Fee. Bummer, but at least we got an answer I suppose, and now we know developers will be on the hook for— Developers switch off Unity ads in Runtime Fee protest Read more on GamesIndustry.biz QUOTE\"As for Game Pass and other subscription services, [Unity Create GM Marc] Whitten said that developers… would not be on the hook, as the fees are charged to distributors, which in the Game Pass example would be Microsoft.\" – Axios adding key context for Unity's policy Tuesday evening. That's great, but how will Unity even track this? If I buy a copy of Dear Esther Landmark Edition (made with Unity) on GOG.com, I get a DRM-free copy that does not require any online connection to play. How does Unity tell if I install the game on a hundred computers or none? Or the same computer 100 times? Just imagining Riccitiello shaking his fist at the heavens, screaming \"Esssssstherrrrr!\" QUOTE\"We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won't go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of the number of times the Runtime is distributed for a given project.\" – Unity's representative tells us the company definitely has a very good, very accurate process for determining how much money you need to pay it, but you're not allowed to know what it is. Also, even if you did know how many times the Runtime was distributed, that's not the same as how many times it was installed, which is the thing you're actually charging people for. The company also said it has anti-fraud technology to detect pirated copies of the game being installed so developers won't be charged for those, but we question a) whether such technology exists (If I legally install that DRM-free copy of Dear Esther on my laptop and then on my PC, how exactly does that work differently from me installing it on my laptop and then pirating it by giving a copy to a friend to install on their PC?) and b) how eager Unity will be to invest in technology that will reduce the amount of money it is owed. Remember when Facebook sent a memo to employees about \"friendly fraud\" (kids using their parents' credit cards to buy stuff) and why they shouldn't try to stop it? Good times. Unity closes offices in wake of death threat Read more on GamesIndustry.biz Obviously, Unity's new fees did not go over well. A collective of studios pulled Unity and IronSource ads from all their titles as a form of protest, and called upon others to do the same. The developers of Among Us, Going Under, Cult of the Lamb, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, Slay the Spire, Wizard With A Gun, and Floppy Knights have all publicly said they are inclined to switch engines if the changes go through. A lot of those statements talked about trust, because trust is crucial for developers using a commercial game engine. Games can take years to build, and if a developer is going to commit to building a project in Unity, Unity needs to commit to supporting them over that span. And Unity knows this. QUOTE\"It's a huge commitment to us. Because as soon as we bet on that platform, we have to stay convicted to it for a very long time. Because creators will download it and start using it, and once we've said we're going to support the platform, we need to make sure they know we're there.\" - Unity Create VP Marc Whitten told us earlier this year why Unity has to think in the long-term every time it adds support for a new platform or a technology like VR. I don't think the problem with Unity's new Runtime Fee is that Unity botched the messaging, although it definitely did that. It's not that this new fee is a prime example of enshittification, although it definitely is that, too. I'm not even sure the problem is the extra money it takes out of developers' pockets. I think the real problem here is trust. Trust is essential in any relationship, personal or professional, and trust is something Unity has squandered a bit of lately. Like when developers expressed widespread concerns about a future where employers replaced them with AI and Unity decided there was no time like the present. Or when one of the vetted and verified third-party AI solutions it offered was not so much \"using cutting-edge generative 3D AI technology to enable the creation of assets and virtual worlds\" as it was \"using stolen assets.\" Build confidently with Unity's verified solutions that have undergone enhanced vetting that did not catch asset descriptions openly advertising that they have been stolen On top of that, game developers work in a notoriously unstable field with precious little job security, so it probably didn't instill much trust in Unity when the company laid off nearly 300 people in January, even though Riccitiello said he was \"thrilled with the work they've done\" in one group's case. That trust might have taken another hit when Riccitiello cut 600 more jobs a few months later saying the shrinking headcount was \"all about setting ourselves up for higher growth.\" As for this week, Unity had an arrangement with these developers that they understood, and one day Unity decided to change that arrangement for its own benefit, without consultation or recourse, in a way that will impose additional costs on developers for as long as their games continue to be installed, which is entirely outside their control at this point. So even if you're a successful developer who can take the financial hit of the new fee, if you see that Unity is willing to do this, would you trust it not to do it again? Would you trust Unity to not unilaterally change the deal in other ways that disadvantage you? If you stick around and show Unity that you're willing to put up with this violation, how can you trust it won't take it that much further next time? And if you're not a Unity developer yet, how could you possibly trust that it is worth the time and effort it takes to learn the engine having seen what the company is willing to do? If you're building a business, you reasonably want stability from the partnerships you rely on. Unity's Runtime Fee this week – both the fee itself and the haphazard, ill-advised way it has been rolled out – show that Unity doesn't put much value in stability. The reason Unity did this So why would Unity kick such a hornet's nest here? I hope you won't think me too cynical when I say it's about profit. Or more precisely, the lack thereof. STAT$2.6 billion – Unity's lifetime accumulated deficit over 19 years of operations, a figure we got by combining the $2.2 billion lifetime debt of its last annual report with the $447 million in net losses it reported for the first two quarters of its current fiscal year. That's a lot! It has also doubled in pretty short order. STAT$1.3 billion – Unity's lifetime accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021. Unity has never had a profitable quarter in its history. It has posted modest operating profits in the past three quarters for the first time ever, but I imagine there are lots of businesses whose books look better if you ignore income taxes, depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, millions in restructuring costs associated with laying people off because you think it's a healthy habit to get into, and of course stock-based compensation. STAT$494 million - The cumulative stock-based compensation Unity reported paying out over its past three quarters. STAT$152 million – The cumulative \"profit\" Unity reported over those same three quarters. Speaking of stock-based compensation, there's been some coverage of recent stock sales made by Unity CEO John Riccitiello with the implication that it was insider trading because he knew this Runtime Fee would go over like a lead balloon and sink the stock price. I would stop short of saying Riccitiello would never – he was after all president at EA during a span where the SEC reportedly investigated the company for stock options backdating (as was the fashion in the games industry at the time) – I will point out that the vast majority of Riccitiello's pay at Unity comes in the form of stock and stock options, and the reported amount he sold is almost negligible compared to what he would have left. Riccitiello's total compensation last year was $11.8 million, but the actual cash part of that was just $380,000, which is still a fabulous amount of money in absolute terms but around Unity's San Francisco headquarters is about enough to get you a two-bedroom apartment with mold problems. (Also, Whole Foods cashiers get super snippy when you try to pay with stock options.) The worst part of living in San Francisco is that the city is overrun with parasitic freeloaders who can't even pay rent. When we spoke with Riccitiello last year about Unity's decades-long bubble bath in red ink, he explained it was simply the company's strategy, where it took losses in order to fuel growth. QUOTE\"Should you be profitable? Well we could be, but we wouldn't be serving the industry in the ways we do now. Our market shares wouldn't have increased.\" – Riccitiello, noting that Unity's market share went from the low teens to over 70% as a result of the strategy. QUOTE\"Avoid references to markets or market shares or dominance.\" - A Google internal document surfaced by the Justice Department this week in its antitrust trial against the search giant, as reported by Bloomberg. The company has spent decades coaching employees to avoid certain words and phrases since they can be red flags for monopolistic behavior. The emphasis on growing market share is understandable, but companies don't exist to grow market share. They exist to earn money. Market share is just a means to that end. And you're really only going to be willing to lose billions to build your market share if you know you can take it all back and then some down the road. First, you make yourself essential to the market, even if it costs you billions to get there. Then once you hit a threshold – let's say, I don't know, 70% of the market – you lean into the enshittification process. You charge more for your services, you give your customers worse terms, you turn the heat up slowly and continuously, confident in the knowledge that people are so locked in to your business and have so few viable alternatives that they may grumble but they will ultimately put up with it. What are they going to do? Not use Unity? Are your developers familiar with alternative engines? The competition for top talent is already fierce; how much tougher will it be if you're hiring for a proprietary engine? If you jump to something like Unreal, how do you know Epic won't do the exact same thing once you're invested in their software? I see a lot of developers talking about Godot, but I also see developers talking about Linux whenever Microsoft pulls some underhanded shenanigans with Windows and that doesn't seem to have cracked the OS market wide open. Unity lit money on fire for decades to buy a market advantage that overrules the basic economic incentives that supposedly ensure free markets work best for customers And what about the developers of existing Unity hits like Call of Duty Mobile, Pokémon Go, and Marvel Snap? If they aren't happy with these changes are they supposed to rebuild their games from scratch in another engine? Take them down entirely just to avoid racking up fees? Unity lit money on fire for decades to buy a market advantage that overrules the basic economic incentives that supposedly ensure free markets work best for customers. It was successful in doing that because it's very hard for a sustainable business to compete against one that is fine losing billions of dollars. And it's such a common strategy in so many industries today that there's just no sense of horror or outrage from the onlookers. Industry watchers and Serious Business People have seen this play out so many times they just acknowledge it's happening and treat it as if it's a perfectly cool and normal thing and not illegal predatory pricing. QUOTE\"Pricing below your own costs is not a violation of the law unless it is part of a strategy to eliminate competitors, and when that strategy has a dangerous probability of creating a monopoly for the discounting firm so that it can raise prices far into the future and recoup its losses.\" – The FTC explains that this strategy is basically illegal, even though it hasn't had much luck getting courts to agree. QUOTE\"The market's reaction to the blowback that Unity is receiving from the developer community may be overdone, particularly as developers have few lower-cost options to turn to… Given the utility provided by Unity's solutions and its dominant market share within mobile gaming, we do not anticipate a rush for the exits from its core customers.\" – In a note to investors Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter says Unity should be fine because the market lacks viable competitors. QUOTE\"When it comes to 'fair', it usually depends on who you ask. From Unity's (and likely its shareholders') point of view, it has technically been subsidising developers' work (i.e., operating at a substantial GAAP-basis loss) every year since inception.\" – In a guest column on Thursday, Midia Research's Karol Severin suggests it could be seen as fair for Unity to add this Runtime Fee because it has lost so much money over the years. The difference here is that Unity deliberately chose to lose money. Unity set its terms and prices for developers every step of the way knowing that they would not be profitable. Developers did not choose this strategy for Unity, so Unity cannot insist that they now make the company whole. Unity also never told developers this was an exchange, a sweetheart deal now in exchange for Unity putting the screws to them later. In fact, that was pretty much the opposite of the sales pitch. QUOTE\"There's no royalties, no fucking around. It's simple.\" – In 2015, John Riccitiello talks to us about the new Unity business model, contrasting it to the royalty-based model Epic had announced the day before for its Unreal Engine. Riccitiello was on a bit of a roll that day, so let's let him expound on that thought. QUOTE\"I do think you could argue that royalties are quite a bit like free-to-play. They sort of hook you and then try to exploit that relationship. That's not what we're trying to do.\" No? Because that is 100% what you have done. QUOTE |\"If you were to walk around Unity, you'll find this point about transparency, clarity... democracy is like every other paragraph of every other conversation. It's a deeply embedded value. We thought for a while about things like royalties, [but] we just didn't think it was right. We thought about the nickel-and-dime model of free-to-play, not to implement it, just to see whether it had any implications for us, but we didn't think so.\" Obviously Unity's a very different place these days. There's not much clarity, as we've seen from the continual restatements about how the Runtime Fee works and what it covers. There's not much transparency, as Unity isn't telling people how it figures out how much they'll owe. And there certainly isn't much democracy, because Unity's subscribers certainly wouldn't vote for what's happened this week, and it must have happened over the concerns and objections of a whole lot of non-executive Unity employees, too. The internal pushback against this has actually escalated beyond any reasonable bounds, with police saying the death threat that closed two of Unity's offices yesterday and today was made by an employee. Before we move on, there's one more quote from that \"no royalties, no fucking around\" Riccitiello interview that we should get to. QUOTE\"With Unity, it's capped. It's $75 a month or $1,500 for a perpetual license; we're not nickel-and-diming people and we're not charging them a royalty. When we say it's free, it's free. When we say $75 a month, it's $75 a month. Yeah, you can buy other stuff from us. We're not a one-trick pony, but we're not charging a royalty, which I think is akin to looking for whales.\" I don't know what's more hypocritical here, telling people you're not nickel-and-diming them and explicitly nickel-and-diming them with per install fees that range from two dimes to a fraction of a nickel, or throwing shade on whale hunting when you have spent years making tools to help whale hunters hunt whales better and are in the midst of pivoting toward whale hunting yourself. QUOTE\"The price increase is very targeted. In fact, more than 90% of our customers will not be affected by this change.\" – In one of its many \"clarifications\" this week, Unity says the Runtime Fee was designed in such a way that it will bring in a lot of money from a relative handful of its biggest customers. This of course isn't the first sign that Riccitiello had a change of heart about whale hunting, given his well-publicized remark last year that developers who focus on creativity rather than monetization are \"some of the biggest fucking idiots.\" The reason Unity did this One angle I find interesting here is that Unity had alternative methods of enshittification it could have resorted to that would not have resulted in the same blowback. For example, it could have simply jacked up the cost of its various subscriptions a bit and gestured in the direction of inflation. So if Unity could have padded its coffers without the grief, why upend the status quo like this? Part of it seems to be a way to upsell developers to get them even more deeply invested in Unity's ecosystem. They can reduce their Runtime Fees by upgrading their subscription program, or using Unity Gaming Services live-ops backend solution or Unity LevelPlay (the IronSource ad monetization platform), which would be an appealing way to increase Unity's market share in other services that it can enshittify down the road. However impactful this might seem today, Unity believes it's going to be more impactful to the way the industry develops down the road Beyond that, I suspect another part of the reasoning here is because however impactful this might seem today, Unity believes it's going to be more impactful to the way the industry develops down the road. We already know Unity management are big believers in AI, and if companies really can use the tech to cut headcount, they'll not only be paying fewer salaries but fewer Unity seat license fees. So if Unity expects its existing (unprofitable) model to be disrupted, it's naturally going to want to adopt a model better suited to the industry landscape of the future. Fortunately, Unity released a 2023 Gaming Report earlier this year detailing trends it sees shaping that landscape, a number of which would make the Runtime Fee more profitable for the company going forward. QUOTE\"Studios are starting more mobile-only games compared to 2021\" – One of Unity's top five trends to watch. STAT44% - The increase in mobile-only games made by large studios (300+ people) in 2022, according to Unity's 2023 Gaming Report. The report found a slight decline in such projects from mid-size studios (10-49 people), while every other size of studio saw an increase in mobile-only game development. The Runtime Fee policy is designed with free-to-play games most obviously in mind. It makes no distinction between monetization models, but it's pretty clear where the upside is considering a free-to-play hit can result in one billion downloads while an absurdly successful premium game like Grand Theft Auto 5 has been running strong for a decade and still shipped \"just\" 185 million copies. That doesn't mean smaller developers won't be hurt by the fee, especially since they will pay the most per download by far and are the least likely to be running a free-to-play live service game. It's just to say that John Riccitiello's eyes are much more likely to do the Tex Avery horny wolf gag when he's reading about Minion Rush than the latest indie darling. So if you're seeing a marked shift toward mobile games, especially from the deep-pocketed studios with the greatest ability to produce one of those rare mobile megahits, pivoting your monetization model to take greater advantage of the free-to-play games that dominate the mobile industry makes sense. QUOTE\"Large studios are increasing the number of multiplatform games\" – Another of Unity's top five trends to watch. Unity found that in 2022, large studios (300 or more people) released 16% more multiplatform games than in 2021, and 110% more compared to 2019. On top of that, mobile was an overwhelmingly common option for multiplatform games. 75% of large studios' multiplatform offerings had a mobile option, as did 100% of upper midmarket (150-299 people) studio's multiplatform titles. Given how commonly multiplatform players will use the game on multiple platforms (creating multiple installs) and how much more likely these larger studios are to launch the kind of megahits that would pay eternal dividends through Runtime Fees, this is another trend the new change would benefit from. QUOTE\"In 2022, there were more players but fewer payers\"– One more point from Unity's 2023 Gaming Report. Last year, daily active users went up 8% year-over-year for the median game, while the rate of paying active users went down 2% for games in the top 50th percentile. That may not sound like a ton, but if you pull back to include games in the 90th percentile, the decline in the rate of paying active users was 30%. The average dollar value per transaction was also down 8% for the top 50th percentile, and 17% for the top 90th percentile. If Unity thinks mobile revenues are going down while the userbase keeps growing, imposing a fee tied to installs instead of revenues makes sense. I don't think these trends are necessarily going to have massive effects for Unity's business, but the Runtime Fee plan strikes me as an optimization for them, a way to improve Unity's outlook whether the industry evolves this way or that. Honestly, I think this new Runtime Fee makes perfect sense from a mile-high point of view, if you think about Unity as a business where you just turn whichever dials and pull whatever levers will make the numbers go up the most. The only problem is it makes no sense at all if you instead think about Unity as a game development tool that game developers should want to use.

It was successful in doing that because it&#x27;s very hard for a sustainable business to compete against one that is fine losing billions of dollars.This right here is the most notable part of the article, and it is entirely correct - it has been for years. Venture capital is fine to use for actual ventures, to create new markets or hell, to break into a market with entrenched powers... but when it is used on a long time purely to undercut and destroy legitimate prior businesses (taxis&#x2F;Uber, hotels&#x2F;AirBnB, game engines&#x2F;Unity), authorities should step in.It&#x27;s time to revive anti-trust, anti-dumping and other anti-predatory politics. reply Pulcinella 15 hours agoparentThis part of the article needs a citation. Unity has been setting money on fire, but it hasn&#x27;t been buying a market advantage. It&#x27;s been burning money on highly, highly, highly questionable (at best) acquisitions like buying Weta and Iron Source as well an insane hiring spree and then paying those people for years for work and churn that Unity never actually manages to ship in the engine. reply yterdy 13 hours agorootparentThe other elephant in the room is that the owner of Unity&#x27;s main competitor is quite a bit larger than it is.

Please don&#x27;t take my statement as a defense of Unity. The intended implication was, \"A market sans Unity is not a robust and competitive space, it&#x27;s Unreal as a monopoly.\"I don&#x27;t know if there are many other options for mobile, but for XR (in this phase where UX norms are being hashed out), I really hope that people look beyond the two, and even dark horse Apple, to what Snap is doing. Even further: look at what people are doing with Dreams on the PS4&#x2F;PS5 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MartinNebelong).Part of why this hurts is that we let ourselves be taken in by a singular platform... again.

They came up with a business model that literally required customers to get into strangers&#x27; cars. Eighteen nanoseconds later, the taxi industry was dead.There is no other possible conclusion to draw, except that the taxi industry had it coming.Fast-forward to today. The venture capital has long since run out. Taking an Uber costs at least as much as the taxis ever did. Yet, do you foresee any way for the taxi industry to make a comeback, except by holding the rest of us at gunpoint? reply turquoisevar 8 hours agorootparentThat’s a decent amount of revisionism.Uber used VC money to heavily undercut the taxi rates, heavily inflate driver pay and decided to speedrun breaking as many laws as possibleAs for getting into strangers’ cars, getting in a taxi is no different.Do you think Uber was able to become as ubiquitous as it is if it didn’t heavily subsidize both sides of the equation and abide by the laws?I doubt it.Like you aptly describe now the fares as on par if not more than taxis, because now that they’ve attained dominance over the market by burning VC money, they can squeeze the customers and drivers alike. I’m not even sure if they’re turning a profit yet. reply Rapzid 12 hours agorootparentprevI suspect it&#x27;s still cheaper than Taxis would have been without it existing especially counting for inflation.But then, the biggest issue being solved wasn&#x27;t price it was availability.

We have a whole generation of people that don’t want to pay for anything (speaking generally, not just Unity related). People are building their businesses using tools that are free&#x2F;near-free and that are losing vast sums of money. It’s created a broken market both from the supply and demand sides and it’s why businesses are having to resort to subscriptions. Almost none of the people using Photoshop would pay $1000 for it every time a new major update comes out, even though they use it daily in their business and generate their income from it. reply EPWN3D 13 hours agorootparentThis is just reality though. I know it really feels \"wrong\" that money was so cheap for so long, but in all likelihood, interest rates will return to close-to-zero in the long run precisely for the factors you call out.Business investments are now overwhelmingly software; it doesn&#x27;t take massive infusions of capital to make your business more efficient, because efficiency gains are achieved through acquiring a copy of an infinite resource -- software.Sure software vendors can create artificial scarcity through licensing fees, but competitive market pressures will keep those down, and the floor of software fees is very low. As a result there has been less demand for money than there has been in the past. Hence lower interest rates. (Aging populations and slowing population growth also drive interest rates down.)In other words, cheap money is an implication of the software-driven world we live in, not some sort of moral failing. It&#x27;s not the result of policymakers doing something with punchbowls to prop up governments or whatever dumb metaphor gets thrown around. reply beefnugs 9 hours agoprevLet the wars begin:- Unity itself can hire dark botnets to beef up their profits at any time- game developers need to start selling with the caveat \"5 re-installs included\" and of course you change the price to over-sell how many installs the average person does- game developers are now incentivized to make huge huge huge game downloads for no good reason other than to make people think twice about uninstalling and reinstalling later since it takes so long- steam and game distribution platforms now need to start limiting re-installs and downloads for everyone, more complexity, more hassle, more bugs- everyone needs to start running whitelist firewalls again, since automatic private data exfiltration is getting so out of control we need to block all internet access by default now reply gmerc 5 hours agoparentThis exactly (minus the huge downloads, no point).

Is this the result of some new business strategy being pushed to high level execs? Or has the idiocracy produced by failing upwards finally come home to roost? reply WJW 13 hours agoparentCompanies have been self-immolating for short term gains since basically forever, so that is nothing new. Raising interest rates have definitely pushed some long-term money losers over the edge though. Rather than subsisting on ever more funding rounds they now need to figure out how to make money out of their huge \"free tier\" subscriber base and the quickest way is to start charging them money. Predictably, the people who formerly got valuable stuff for free are not fans of this idea. reply aschearer 16 hours agoparentprevWhen the tide goes out you find out who&#x27;s swimming without their trunks. reply vinyl7 16 hours agoparentprevEnd of ZIRP is making them all suddenly have to actually make money instead of relying on loans and investments. Unfortunately two decades of ZIRP means that none of the current leadership knows how to make money. reply ThePhysicist 16 hours agoprevI think it would make more sense to take a cut of the revenue when a game is sold, as that is easier to calculate for the developers. I can understand why they chose installs though as that&#x27;s easier to measure for them and they would need to trust developers with their revenue numbers as they don&#x27;t own the distribution platform like e.g. Apple does, but honestly they could&#x27;ve just used the installation rate as a sanity check for the license numbers reported by developers.As a game developer I would be very wary about signing such a contract as I&#x27;m sure these metrics can be easily gamed, so anyone with enough malicious intent could probably install-bomb my game and rack up large charges for me, and in the end I would be responsible for proving that those installs were malicious (which I imagine could be quite difficult). reply rightbyte 16 hours agoparentLike, you better not make a good game that is installed more than once.Pay-per-install seems like a really bad way to charge dev costumers by. E.g. a nice long lived game will be charged way more than shovelware, due to users reinstalling when they buy new machines. reply Sakos 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve installed Deus Ex probably 30+ times since I first played it at launch. Hell, sometimes I&#x27;ll install it, decide not to play it, uninstall it, then reinstall it a week later. I&#x27;ve reinstalled it like three times this month because I can&#x27;t decide whether I feel like replaying it or not. That would basically mean over 10% of the game&#x27;s original full price going towards Unity with ongoing costs in perpetuity. That&#x27;s without distribution (whether brick and mortar or Steam) and other costs, and without the developer further monetizing the game off of me.That&#x27;s absurd. reply qwytw 11 hours agorootparentPresumable only one install per unique device counts. At least that&#x27;s what they say.Not that they even seem to know at this point how will the install be even tracked.... reply Sakos 10 hours agorootparentAnybody who believes anything they say now is a fool. Every developer would have to go out of their way to track the same thing Unity is tracking to ensure that Unity isn&#x27;t literally lying to them about how many installs and how much is owed.

Mandatory telemetry which neither the developer or end use can disable and which phones private user data to a third party (outside the EU presumably) which is not necessary for the product to function must surely be illegal?If so Unity&#x27;s management can&#x27;t be that stupid to now know this? replylancesells 16 hours agoparentprevI think it would be even easier to charge for tiers of software instead of the rent-seeking until the end of time. reply gmerc 4 hours agoparentprevInstall tracking is impossible.

Markowitz, Daniel Moran Published: August 17, 2023 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190 Article Authors Metrics Comments Media Coverage Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Conclusion Materials and methods Supporting information References Reader Comments Figures Abstract Current policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase adaptation and mitigation funding are insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. It is clear that further action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and achieve a just climate future. Here, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility and climate finance by conducting an environmentally extended input output analysis that links 30 years (1990–2019) of United States (U.S.) household-level income data to the emissions generated in creating that income. To do this we draw on over 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers from the Eora MRIO database to calculate both supplier- and producer-based GHG emissions intensities and connect these with detailed income and demographic data for over 5 million U.S. individuals in the IPUMS Current Population Survey. We find significant and growing emissions inequality that cuts across economic and racial lines. In 2019, fully 40% of total U.S. emissions were associated with income flows to the highest earning 10% of households. Among the highest earning 1% of households (whose income is linked to 15–17% of national emissions) investment holdings account for 38–43% of their emissions. Even when allowing for a considerable range of investment strategies, passive income accruing to this group is a major factor shaping the U.S. emissions distribution. Results suggest an alternative income or shareholder-based carbon tax, focused on investments, may have equity advantages over traditional consumer-facing cap-and-trade or carbon tax options and be a useful policy tool to encourage decarbonization while raising revenue for climate finance.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Introduction Anthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to all of humanity [1, 2]. Yet, extreme economic inequality, across and within societies, results in a powerful disconnect between those facing the worst climate impacts and those reaping the economic and consumption benefits that drive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [3–8]. This disparity in harm and benefits has been a central tension at international climate negotiations, particularly when trying to allocate responsibility and financial compensation between developed and developing countries. In recognition of such disparities, wealthy nations at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC–COP 15) agreed to mobilize $100 billion a year, by 2020, to fund mitigation and adaptation efforts in poorer developing nations. The creation of a “loss and damage” fund at the recent UNCCC COP 27 marks an additional commitment to address disparities between those disproportionately driving emissions and those disproportionately experiencing the harms they cause. These efforts represent progress, yet there is also some reason for skepticism. Existing climate commitments will not keep global temperature rise within 1.5°C [9], finance pledges fall about 5-10x short of the need [10], and nations have consistently failed to meet these insufficient emissions and finance pledges [9, 11]. This has made the current moment pivotal to address an increasingly urgent climate crisis and suggests addition perspectives may be useful in motivating such efforts. Emissions responsibility frameworks and prior work While existing climate agreements are based on national-level territorial emissions, alternative consumption-based and income-based frameworks have been proposed to account for trade related emissions transfers and to better align responsibility with the flow of benefits. At the national level, consumption-based emissions have been well studied over the last several decades [12–21], while income-based emissions [22–29] have received less attention. Because consumption and income ultimately flow to households, these alternative frameworks also allow emissions responsibility to be quantified sub-nationally at the household-level. The United States (U.S.) provides an interesting case for consumption- and income-based analysis due to its significant emissions, high levels of consumption, and extreme economic inequality. Since the Industrial Revolution the U.S. has cumulatively emitted more GHGs and captured more wealth (GDP) than any other country. At the same time, the U.S. has significant economic inequality, with the top 10% of income earners capturing 46% of pre-tax national income, in 2021, and the top 1% alone capturing 19% [30]. From a consumption-based standpoint, prior U.S. analyses have been conducted by Weber and Matthews [18], Jones and Kammen [31], Song et al. [17], Sager [32], Feng et al. [16] and others. In a recent paper we fill in a gap in these studies by explicitly addressing the undersampling and underestimation of top 1% and top 0.1% households’ emissions in prior work [33]. We find extreme and growing emissions disparities between very high-income households and the rest of U.S. society. While emissions related to household consumption (consumer responsibility) have been well explored for the U.S. and many countries—informing climate equity debates–very little work [34, 35] has been done linking households to the emissions used in generating their incomes (income responsibility). This misses a critical connection between climate altering GHG emissions and those households reaping a tangible benefit from these emissions—obscuring alternative policy solutions. To date, the only research we are familiar with on income-based household GHG footprints are an initial U.S.-based analysis we conducted [34] and recent work by Pottier and Le Truet [35] that report wage-based footprints for households in France. Here we present results for an analysis that links GHG emissions to the full range of U.S. household incomes (wages, investments, retirement, etc.) over a 30 year period (1990–2019). In doing so, we offer a new perspective on emissions responsibility, fill in a key knowledge gap for a major GHG emitting nation, and highlight some alternative tax policies that could help close the climate finance gap [10]–including post-COP 27 loss and damage funds. Research approach To link U.S. households with the GHG emissions that enable their income we calculate global GHG emissions intensities (metric tons (t) CO2e per dollar) of income using a multi-region input-output (MRIO) model (see Materials and Methods) [36, 37]. We calculate emissions intensity using two distinct accounting approaches: direct producer emissions and supplier emissions. In the producer framework, each industry’s direct operational emissions (Scope 1) are allocated to households in proportion to the share of total income they receive from that industry. The supplier framework allocates emissions to households in the same proportional way, but each industry’s emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions occurring in all activities which directly and indirectly provide sales revenue to that industry in its role as a supplier. For example, in the producer framework households receiving wage or investment income from a power plant are responsible for the direct emissions it generates, while in the supplier framework households receiving wage or investment income from selling financial services or fossil fuel to that power plant are responsible for the plant’s emissions, proportional to their importance as a supplier. The producer approach allocates direct emissions from 429 U.S. industries, while the supplier approach includes the full downstream supply chain emissions of 9,812 industries across 190 countries (about 2.8 billion inter-sectoral transfers or around 96 million per year). Industry-specific emissions intensities are linked with an individual’s wage income from that industry, using the nationally representative Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) harmonized Current Population Survey (CPS), which includes around 5.4 million individuals (~181,000 individuals annually) [38]. Emissions for unearned income, such as investment and retirement (social security, IRA, 401(k), etc.) income, are also included and based on weighted national average multipliers that model a range of diversified investment portfolios. In total, emissions associated with 12 pre-tax income categories are included and aggregated by household (~65,000 annually). The post-tax analysis includes 35 income categories that capture social and government transfers and reduces the household’s income responsibility by the amount of taxes paid (see Table E in S1 Text for a comprehensive list of income variables). To compare emissions responsibility across the income distribution, households are then binned into income groups including deciles 1–9, the next 9% (90–99.0th percentile), top 1% (99.0th - 100th percentile), next 0.9% (99.0th—99.9th percentile), and top 0.1% (99.9th - 100th percentile) (see Materials and Methods for how we estimate top 1% households, which are under sampled in CPS and S1 Text for additional methodological details). Results Below we present results for both supplier and producer frameworks. For brevity, Figures use the supplier framework and all Figures except Fig 1 present pre-tax income footprints. Producer-based Figures generally show similar results. They are included as Supporting information files and referenced in the corresponding Figure legends below. We mainly focus on pre-tax footprints since they provide a clear picture of the raw income-based emissions distribution. Post-tax results are mostly presented to show the impact of tax policy and social transfers on this distribution (see Table 1 and Tax effects on emissions footprints in S1 Text).Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 1.

Social transfers make up a significant share of lower income groups’ post-tax footprint, wages dominate middle income groups’ emissions, and wage and investment income are the key drivers of very high-income groups’ emissions (Fig 1). For average top 0.1% households, we find investment income drives >50% of emissions. The CO2e intensity of incomes also varies across the income distribution (Fig 2). In the supplier framework, the CO2e intensity of wages tends to increase with income, though there is significant dispersion within groups. In the producer-based analysis, middle income households have the most CO2e intensive wages while low- and high-income households, employed in various service sectors, have less emission intensive incomes (see S2 Fig). These differences result in some decoupling of national income and national emissions (NE) shares (Table 1), for some income groups. For example, top 1% households have NE shares that are higher than their income share in the supplier framework and lower in the producer framework. While underlying income inequality is by far the most important factor shaping extreme inequality in emissions footprints, differences in income sources and GHG intensity (see S3 and S4 Figs) cause emissions heterogeneity at a given income level and a divergence between national income shares and emissions shares for some income groups.Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 2.

(Producer-based results are presented in S2 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.g002 Most recent year (2019) In 2019, we estimate U.S. household income-based emissions range from ~0 to over 8,000 t and follow a strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.94) with an elasticity of 1.0 (Fig 3). We find a highly unequal emissions distribution with Gini coefficients of 0.57 (producer) and 0.58 (supplier) (for Lorenz curves, see S5 and S6 Figs). It is worth noting that at a given income level differences in the GHG intensities of income sources result in emissions variability. For example, we estimate a pre-tax income around $1 million has emissions as low as ~200 t or as high as ~1,300 t depending on the type of profession or investments that are generating that income.Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 3. Relationship between pre-tax income and household GHG footprint (log-log) using the supplier income method (2019) (n = 69,483 –includes 2,000 synthetic data points for next 0.9% and top 0.1% households). (Producer-based results are presented in S7 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.g003 Binning households into income groups, we estimate the highest earning 30% of households are responsible for about 70% of income-based NE while the lowest earning 70% are responsible for only about 30% NE (Fig 4). Depending on the framework, the highest earning top 10% of households drive 40–43% of NE. At the top of the income distribution, we estimate top 0.1% households account for 7–8% NE and have average absolute emissions > 2,000 t (producer: = 2,110; = 1,870; 95% CI = 2,035 / 2,180 and supplier: = 2,670; = 2,395; 95% CI = 2,585 / 2,765).Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 4.

Similarly, gray error bars are bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals on the total t CO2e given an assumed ±20% error in carbon intensity per dollar. (Producer-based results are presented in S8 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.g004 Super emitters We term households with emissions >3,000 t CO2e per year as “super emitters”. For pre-tax income, we estimate about 43,200 U.S. households or 34% of the top 0.1% households are super emitters with the supplier framework ( = 4,317 t, = 4,053). About 26,500 households, or 21% of top 0.1% households surpass this threshold with the producer framework ( = 3,906 t, = 3,583). Post-tax, the percent of top 0.1% households classified as super emitters drops to about 9% (supplier) and 3% (producer). Almost all super emitting households come from the top 0.1% income group. They had average incomes of over $10.6 million (supplier) and $11.5 (producer) (Table 2). Because GHG intensity varies widely across sectors, a household may surpass the 3,000 t threshold with either much lower or much higher income than the average, depending on the GHG intensity of their income source. While super emitting households can also be employed in any sector of the economy (Table 2), they are markedly overrepresented in finance, real estate, and insurance; manufacturing; mining and quarrying; and services (other). Meanwhile, households earning income from accommodations and restaurants; education; retail and wholesale trade; and some other fields are underrepresented among super emitting households. Generally, both producer and supplier frameworks show the same directionality in terms of divergence from U.S. average employment by sector, but there is variability in the scale of this divergence.Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. Factors that shape super emitter household footprints (GHG intensity and income) (2019) and a comparison of super emitter employment by sector to that of the overall U.S. economy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.t002 Relationship to racial inequality Black households had mean pre-tax footprints of 19 t CO2e (supplier and producer) ( = 11 t in both), White Hispanic households had 26 t (supplier) and 25 t (producer) ( = 16 t in both), and White non-Hispanic households had 40 t (supplier) and 36 t (producer) ( = 22 t in both). The fact that White non-Hispanic household emissions were 1.4x - 2.1x higher than other groups partly reflect differences in the CO2e intensity of employment across groups. For example, in the supplier footprint White non-Hispanic households had emissions intensity of wages 1.12x higher than Black households. More critical, however, is the extreme racial inequity of the underlying income distribution. In 2019, the top 1% of the income distribution was 76% White non-Hispanic, 8% Hispanic, and only 3% Black. Meanwhile, Black households make up a disproportionate share of bottom decile households. Post-tax the racial emissions gap closes somewhat, but White non-Hispanic households still have emissions 1.3–1.7x higher than other groups. An additional observation is that significant emissions inequality exists within each racial group. Comparing the median to the means, shows that the emissions distribution is right skewed, with most of the population having emissions far below the mean and a relatively small percent of the population having emissions much higher than the group mean. Emissions by age group In terms of age, average emissions tend to increase with age until peaking within the 45–54 years old head of household age group (Table 3). After this point they tend to decline. This mirrors household incomes, which tend to increase as cohorts gain experience and seniority within the labor force, then decline as they enter early retirement and retirement age.Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 3. Income and emissions (supplier and producer) by age of “head of household” (2019). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.t003 Time series: (1990–2019) Looking across 30 years of data a few noteworthy trends emerge. First, emissions intensities consistently differ across income groups and have fallen (45–49%) over time (Fig 5). Second, these falling emission intensities have resulted in decreasing national average household emissions, despite rising incomes (Fig 6). Yet, this declining national average belies a divergence that has occurred between the bottom 99% of the income distribution and the top 1%. While the bottom 99% have seen rising incomes, their absolute emissions have fallen (Fig 7) due to declining emissions intensities. For the top 1% however, income growth has outpaced falling emission intensities and resulted in flat or rising absolute emissions (Fig 7). Finally, these trends have resulted in a large and increasing share of national emissions generating economic benefits for high income households (Fig 8).Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 5.

(Producer-based results are presented in S11 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.g008 Put together, these trends reveal an interesting emissions story: despite falling emissions intensities, declining national average emissions and rising incomes for all groups, unequal income growth has created significant and increasing emissions inequality between extremely high-income households and the rest of U.S. society. This has moved the income-based national emissions Gini coefficient from 0.51 (producer and supplier) in 1990 to 0.57 (producer) and 0.58 (supplier) in 2019. Discussion Limitations and sources of uncertainty Our study is limited in scope, makes certain assumptions about unearned income that are important for top 1% households, and relies on survey and emissions databases that can introduce errors. First, this study focuses on linking emissions with income. Household wealth is only considered insofar as it generates realized income as capital gains or dividends. Because wealth is even more unequally distributed than income, a wealth-based emissions analysis would very likely show greater emissions inequality than our results. In estimating the emissions intensity of unearned income, it is not feasible to estimate itemized sources of investment income per household. Instead, we assume that households have a diversified passive investment portfolio generating unearned investment income equal to the weighted mean GHG intensity of the U.S. economy. When creating the synthetic dataset for top 1% households, where investments are a key source of income, we allow the GHG intensity of individual household’s investment income to vary up to ±25% from the mean. This creates a distribution of households whose average equals the mean but whose individual portfolios can be overweighted to either more or less GHG intensive industries than the national average. While some households may be outside these bounds, we assume extremely overweight portfolios in either GHG intensive or non-intensive industries are somewhat rare, tend to balance out and in aggregate do not meaningfully affect the overall group mean. This study assumes that on average, investments are passively managed, though further study of how investors can actively influence the carbon intensity of their investments is an interesting topic for future work. The emissions per industry for wage income are taken from the Eora MRIO (see Materials and Methods). In Eora, import and export data reported across countries may not exactly align and balancing used in Eora to resolve these discrepancies may lead to minor estimation error, though the affect is minimal on large economies like the U.S. In all MRIO models emissions data are taken from IPCC-style inventories which itemize emissions by activity rather than by economic sector. Reallocating from activity-based inventories to sector-based inventories introduces error that could affect the accuracy of estimated emissions per wage income sector. Additionally, converting from symmetrical and non-symmetrical Supply-Use (SUT), Industry-Industry (II), and Commodity-Commodity (CC) tables, in the original Eora, to a symmetrical II intermediate transaction matrix involves the Fixed Product Sales Structure Assumption [39] and again moves away from the original national data reports. While some error is inherent, for a large economy with robust GHG reporting the effect on the final income group GHG estimates is limited. All surveys, including the IPUMS CPS we use for household income are sensitive to sampling and non-sampling error. Most important to our study, top 1% households are under sampled in CPS (See Undersampling and underestimating top 1% incomes in CPS and Table A in S1 Text). To address this, we use income data from the World Inequality Database (WID) [30] and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates on capital income shares to estimate incomes for these missing households (see Materials and Methods). Linking household incomes with Eora GHG intensities also requires the use of a concordance matrix. This reduces the number of U.S. industries from 429 to 246 and can impact an individual household’s emission estimate if their employer has a much higher or lower emissions intensity than the sector average. Yet, it seems reasonable that over- or under-estimates for individual household emissions intensity tend to balance out at the income group level. While some degree of measurement error is unavoidably present in any estimate of carbon intensity, ultimately income-based footprints are the direct result of the total income dollars received and the carbon intensity of those dollars. As the U.S. is a large economy with fairly accurate income and emissions data collection, we consider error in overall estimates for these variables is likely small. Considering the limited heterogeneity of emissions intensity across income groups and between capital and wage income, any error in group-level CO2e intensity is also fairly limited. Nevertheless, to quantify the impact from a quite high level of error, we ran our model with carbon intensity ±20% from the baseline analysis. We then bootstrapped the results for each income group and extract lower 95% bounds from the -20% analysis and upper 95% bounds from the +20% error estimates (gray error bars in Fig 4). In practice this yields lower and upper bounds ±21–24% from the baseline group means. While the ±20% choice is arbitrary and we believe far higher than the actual error, given that the underlying error is unknown, it was chosen as a reasonable starting point. Results show that even when a high degree of error is tested, the absolute emissions and NE share from next 0.9% and top 1% households remains quite high and distinct from the lowest earning 99% of households. (See the S1 Text for additional discussion on uncertainty). Income and emissions inequality Across all accounting methods, those at the very top of the income distribution are responsible for striking absolute t CO2e and disproportionate shares of national emissions. Disparities between these top income groups and the rest of society have also been growing over time. Between 1990 and 2019, Deciles 1–9 all saw declining absolute emissions and NE shares. For the bottom 5 deciles absolute emissions fell an average of 51% (producer) and 38% (supplier), while their NE shares showed average declines of 20% (producer) and 17% (supplier). For top 1% households, trends moved in the opposite direction. The next 0.9% and top 0.1% groups saw their NE shares respectively rise 46% and 82% (producer) and 43% and 83% (supplier). By 2019, the top 1% alone ( = 475 t (producer), = 595 t (supplier)) were responsible for more emissions (15–17% NE) than the poorest 50% of U.S. households put together (14% NE). Average top 0.1% households ( = 2,110 t (producer), = 2,670 t (supplier)) have emissions 1,650–1,700x higher than an average bottom decile household ( = 1.3 t (producer), = 1.6 t CO2e (supplier)). This divergence between top 1% households and the rest of society has been driven by rising income inequality (Fig 6) and has occurred despite the falling GHG intensity of incomes (Fig 5 and S9 Fig). Income-based emissions responsibility closely correlates with income inequality. We find that in 2019 the poorest 50% of the U.S. population captured just 15% of pre-tax national income and was responsible for 14% of pre-tax NE in both frameworks (Table 1). The top 10%, top 1%, and top 0.1% captured about 41%, 16%, and 7% of national income. We find they have fairly comparable NE shares of 43%, 17%, and 8% for pre-tax supplier and 40%, 15%, and 7% for pre-tax producer. While limited, the differences between income shares and emission shares are due to variations in GHG-intensity across income sources, income groups, and accounting methods. An interesting recent study by Pottier and Le Treut analyzing wage-based emissions in French households finds the emissions distribution is more unequal than the wage distribution [35]. Here they find large variability in the carbon intensity of wages is driving this difference. They also find an interesting gender gap in emissions, with men tending to earn wages from more carbon intensive activities than women. While income-based emissions accounting is distinct from consumption-based accounting, it is worth noting that an income-based approach estimates greater inequality. For example, in a related consumption-based study that we conducted, we estimate the top 10%, top 1%, and top 0.1% of U.S. households are responsible for a much lower 24%, 6%, and 2.3% of national emissions [33]. The discrepancy is due to large savings rates among high-income households (which reduces consumption) and significant heterogeneity in GHG intensity across income groups, with low-income households purchasing more GHG intensive goods. In France, Pottier and Le Truet find this same trend of income-based emissions being more unequal than consumption-based emissions [35, 40]. We find that because income-based emissions are the result of both income and the GHG intensity of that income (which varies across industries and producer and supplier accounting principles (Table 2)), households at the same income level can have very different emissions levels. For example, in the producer framework a household earning $980,000 from the petroleum refining industry would be a super emitter (>3,000 t), while the same amount of emissions would require $11 million in income from the hospital industry. In the supplier framework, becoming a super emitting household would take at least $18 million in hospital income, but only $2.7 million in income from the coal industry. Households may also have very different GHG intensities from different income sources. This is particularly true for high income households that have a significant share of income flowing from investments. For example, one might earn wages from a low GHG intensive sector like education but have above average GHG intensity of investment income from a portfolio that is overweight on fossil fuel companies. In terms of how age relates to emissions, prior consumption-based work by Zheng et al. has shown that seniors (age 60+) in the U.S. had the highest per capita footprint (20 t) of any age group [41]. With our income-based analysis we find the highest household emissions are among the 45–54 years old peak earning group. If our analysis was wealth-based however, rather than income-based, it would likely agree with the findings from Zheng et al. that seniors have the largest emissions footprints. This is because, while incomes tend to decline for cohorts above age 54, household net worth continues rising and peaks within the 65–74 years old cohort [42]. Even the 75 and above group has a higher net worth than the 45–54 peak income group. While different in methodology, an interesting study by Lucas Chancel looking at global income groups’ consumption and investment found that for the global top 1%, emissions related to investments account for a much greater share of their emissions responsibly (70%) than their consumption (30%) [43]. Finally, it is worth noting that household income is shaped by a variety of demographic factors. While we report on emissions disparity by race, ethnicity, and age, we are principally focused on quantifying the emissions distribution in relation to the income distribution as it exists and do not investigate in great detail how demographic factors influence the income distribution. Policy implications Carbon pricing, either through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, are seen by economists as an essential and cost-effective way to help decarbonize the US economy [44, 45]. Prior work has suggested this tax would need to be >$200 per t CO2e, to achieve even a 5% reduction in oil consumption, and estimates that 70–80% of this cost would be initially passed onto consumers [45]. Another paper we have published looking at consumption-based U.S. emissions suggests that a tax this high would present a significant burden to low-income families, even though they have comparatively small GHG footprints [33]. Meanwhile the tax may not be sufficient to shift behavior of high-income households, who have significant consumption-based emissions, but adequate savings rates to absorb the tax. While a carbon tax-funded dividend has been proposed to reduce financial strain on low income households [46], consumer-facing carbon taxes have not found sufficient political support, despite two decades of development. The fact that income-based footprints are more inequitable than consumption-based footprints [16, 17, 35, 47–49] suggests an alternative income-based approach to carbon pricing schemes, applied to wage earners or investors, could have equity and political advantages over consumer-facing carbon taxes. Such a tax could be calculated based on direct emissions (producer), on the supply of fossil fuels into the economy (supplier), or some split between the two. Tax revenue could be used for climate mitigation or adaptation projects either within the U.S. or to meet and increase international climate finance pledges including loss and damage funding agreed to at COP 27. While either wage or investment income could be the focus of such a tax, a wage-based tax has some drawbacks. Just like low-income consumers, low-income wage earners would have the least ability to absorb a tax. To address this, a carbon income tax could be applied progressively, to shield low-income workers. Yet the effectiveness of such a tax to shift the economy to lower GHG emissions may be insubstantial as workers generally have limited agency in shifting their industry’s emissions behavior. While a tax may generate revenue that could be invested in decarbonization or climate finance, it may be politically unpopular to create a wage-based carbon tax that would impact a wide swath of the public. Because unearned investment income and asset ownership are heavily concentrated at the top of the income distribution, limiting a carbon tax to either of these items could further focus it on those reaping the most economic benefit from GHG emissions, increase public support, and reduce GHG-intensive economic activity in a more direct way. A consideration here is that while there is some overlap of households in the top 1% or 0.1% of income earners and the top 1% or 0.1% of wealth holders there is far more annual churn among the top income group [50]. Here, households may see huge profits one year from the sale of a business or stocks, but far less income in subsequent years. In this way, an asset-based shareholder carbon tax may be more desirable than an unearned income tax because it would set a more stable annual tax rate and keep the focus on those with the most economic power. It would also be more equitable in that it accounts for the historical emissions embodied in unrealized capital gains, rather than focusing solely on present day emissions that generate unearned income. Furthermore, it concentrates behavior change incentives on the executives and large shareholders who have the most agency and power to reduce their industries’ emissions activities. At the extreme end of the income distribution, an interesting 2022 study by Oxfam International on 125 global billionaires with assets in excess of $2 trillion, estimates emissions related to their investments were over 3 million t per person annually [51]. If these individuals were incentivized to reduce the GHG intensity of their industries or shift their investments to other industries, in response to a tax, it could meaningfully impact emissions. Indeed, they estimate the overall carbon intensity of billionaires’ emissions, in their study, could be reduced fourfold if investments were shifted to funds with stronger environmental and social standards [51]. Work by Lucas Chancel suggests that a progressive carbon tax tied to the carbon intensity of investments could be helpful to accelerate decarbonization, while having limited impact on most households [43]. Further work by Chancel, Bothe, and Voituriez [52] estimate a progressive global wealth tax starting at 1.5% for individuals with net worth’s >$100 million (~65,000 individuals or $700,000 (or 1.9x) higher than the IPUMS CPS mean. For the top 0.1% this discrepancy increases. IPUMS CPS top 0.1% households have a threshold of $1.2 million and average pre - tax income of $1.5 milli on. Meanwhile WID estimates a top 0.1% threshold of $2.4 million and a mean of $6.8 million - about $5.3 million (or 4.7x) higher than the CPS average. To account for the discrepancy with WID, we estimate top 0.1% and next 0.9% incomes by creating synthet ic datasets of households, whose mean income matches WID estimates and whose distribution is right skewed (to capture the significant inequality even within these groups) ( Fig A ). The first challenge is that WID average and threshold income data is for adults, while our unit of analysis is households. To better match the WID and IPUMS CPS household units we convert WID estimates from adults to tax units (which combines incomes of married couples). This is done by calculating the percent difference of national income captured by each group and increasing the tax unit income proportionally [2] .In practice, we estimate pre - and post - tax income of tax units are respectively about 6 - 8% and 7 - 9% higher than adult (equal - split) unit incomes. 1 / 24 Download figshare S1 Text.

Wages and employer healthcare contributions are industry specific CO2e multipliers and are presented by income group. The other income categories use weighted national average multipliers (shaded blue area). Note: Healthcare (employment) has the same intensity as wage income and Healthcare (public) has the same intensity as social benefits. (Supplier-based results are presented in Fig 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.s003 (TIF) S3 Fig. Supplier-based CO2e intensity of wages per individual (n = 141,159), by sector (2019). The blue diamond denotes the mean. Note, means here are calculated based on individual-level wage data and the CO2e intensity of their primary employment industry. This leads to some minor differences from the industry-level (n = 246) CO2e intensities used to calculate sectoral means in Table 2. See Carbon intensity by sector in S1 Text for further discussion. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.s004 (TIF) S4 Fig. Producer-based CO2e intensity by sector (2019) (n = 141,031). The blue diamond denotes the mean. Note, to make differences between sectors clearer, 128 outlier observations related to Manufacturing are not displayed. The max value of those observations is 3.03 t CO2e per $1000. Note, means here are calculated based on individual-level wage data and the CO2e intensity of their primary employment industry. This leads to some minor differences from the industry-level (n = 246) CO2e intensities used to calculate sectoral means in Table 2. See Carbon intensity by sector in S1 Text for further discussion. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.s005 (TIF) S5 Fig. Supplier-based emissions Lorenz curve (2019). Note, the population on the x axis is ranked by emissions, rather than income. While emissions strongly correlate with income there is some emissions variability at any given income level. Therefore, there is some minor discrepancy between the national emissions shares here and those seen in Fig 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000190.s006 (TIF) S6 Fig. Producer-based emissions Lorenz curve (2019).

    "commentBody": "Americas richest 10% is responsible for 40% of its planet heating pollutionHacker NewspastloginAmericas richest 10% is responsible for 40% of its planet heating pollution (plos.org) 135 points by nithinj 6 hours ago| hidepastfavorite114 comments tarcar 33 minutes agoThe title is editorialized, the original title is \"Income-based U.S. household carbon footprints (1990–2019) offer new insights on emissions inequality and climate finance\" and the abstract says \"In 2019, fully 40% of total U.S. emissions were associated with income flows to the highest earning 10% of households\". reply somedude895 14 minutes agoparent\"associated with income flows\"Yeah so the editorialized title is ignorant at best and deliberately misleading at worst. I&#x27;ve flagged it. reply refurb 6 minutes agoparentprevI mean that seems entirely intuitive. Most income flows involve emissions.So the highest income have the highest emissions from income flows.Did the authors somehow think this wasn’t true? reply atleastoptimal 2 hours agoprevHonestly lower than I thought, given that the top 10% own 100% of America&#x27;s private jets and luxury yachts reply tinco 2 hours agoparentDo you think that private jets and yachts are a significant portion of CO2?First of all, such things are of the top 0.1%, not the 10%. You need to be thinking of more mundane things. As someone on this forum you very likely belong to the top 10%.How often do you order on Amazon? How often do you dine out? Do you have a heated pool? How often do you fly? How often do you eat beef or pork? How long is your daily commute?Those are the sort of things that influence your CO2 expenditure. Sure you could 10x that with flying private jets, but almost no one does that so it&#x27;s not as significant. reply shaky-carrousel 45 minutes agorootparentA household would need to earn an annual income of around $200k to be in the top 10%. Are you saying most people here earn that amount of money? reply cgio 30 minutes agorootparentThe proportion of people in the top 10% of the general population here is expected to be much higher than 10% but I would expect most probably less than 50%. reply pydry 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not almost no one.When my boss&#x27;s boss&#x27;s boss spends 4 hours on a private jet he creates as much CO2 as I do in a year.I need a house. He doesnt need a jet. His jet should be banned yesterday. reply rglullis 1 hour agorootparentYou don&#x27;t need a house as big the one you have, and you (as an example of the average middle class american) don&#x27;t need to live in the suburbs, with inefficient construction techniques, dependent on a car to go anywhere, ordering ubers to conveniently bring packages of food twice a week, etc.Between banning private jets and banning parking lots, guess which one would be better for the environment?Americans really don&#x27;t understand (a) how wealthy they all are and (b) how a lot of this wealth is based on completely wasteful spending. reply RandomLensman 1 hour agorootparentWho gets to determine need? reply figassis 46 minutes agorootparentAs you get wealthier, you believe you need things, like a 3 br home where each kid has their own room. If money gets tight, you realize a 2 br is actually fine. Problem is, when you consider downgrading you feel that need a lot more than if you’d never had it. Same goes for the jet. That 2 hr trip suddenly feels really critical compared to just planning your travel better. Wasn’t there a post here recently where Musk redirected his cousin’s plane to go unplug some servers? Where was he going that was so important in the middle of the night? And could that detour have waited for a normal flight booking? And apparently the decision turned out do be a mistake according ti Musk himself.So to answer, money determines needs. reply RandomLensman 42 minutes agorootparentSo each person by itself. reply HeartStrings 53 minutes agorootparentprevStatistics do. reply RandomLensman 40 minutes agorootparentWe have tried this before and it wasn&#x27;t great. reply abraae 1 hour agorootparentprevI guess the point is there&#x27;s only 1 of him, and thousands of you (i.e his peons).So it doesn&#x27;t matter what he does, it&#x27;s not statistically significant.Sidebar: your boss&#x27;s boss&#x27;s boss&#x27;s should be allowed his private jet - he should just pay a fair price for the fuel that reflects the damage he is doing. Like 10x the current price. reply sshine 55 minutes agorootparentWhat’s the point of money if everything costs in proportion to how much you have? Then everything costs 1. reply SirSourdough 18 minutes agorootparentI don’t think the argument being made is that the cost should be proportionate to wealth, but proportionate to impact or alternatives.If flying private incurs 10x or 100x the externality costs of flying coach, it should be priced (taxed really) to reflect that a significant portion of those externality costs are an unnecessary luxury benefit. reply inexcf 17 minutes agorootparentprev\"Based on the damage he is doing\" is not \" based on the money he has\" reply jl6 1 hour agorootparentprevThe point being that even though your boss’s boss’s boss has an outsize impact, there aren’t many people like him, whereas there are millions of people like you, so in absolute terms “your” emissions matter too. reply pydry 1 hour agorootparentBecause a small group of people refuses to fly commercial, more CO2 emissions are produced than the entire country of Uganda.You dont think they need to take personal responsibility for their actions?

If the 40% is as a result of investments in companies that pollute, then I fail to see the point of the article. It makes little difference if those positions are held by the richest 10% or the poorest, the environmental impact is the same.There is a question of whether climate change is a minor concern for the wealthiest individuals, compared to the middle class. Most evidence seems to show that the rich simply do not care or at least do not feel like they should make changes to their lifestyle.Currently taxing seems like the only viable solution, but can we really tax a private jet enough that those who use them the most would scale back? I doubt it. What would the cost of a flight from San Jose to San Francisco need to cost to stop someone like Elon Musk from firing up the jet? reply imtringued 1 hour agorootparentprevThat would mean a carbon tax of $1000 per ton because direct air capture of CO2 and storing CO2 is on the same order of difficulty as storing nuclear waste. Possibly worse because CO2 is a gas that can leak out through tiny gaps so every storage site has to be inspected for leaks forever. Pumping CO2 underground is the equivalent of letting a tree capture CO2 with a random chance of the tree starting to rot and releasing all its CO2.The only realistic storage option is solid carbon and that is why I put the price tag so high. reply jiofj 2 hours agorootparentprevSince there is no way currently of removing CO2, and we don&#x27;t even know how that technology would work, there is no fair tax amount.

If you just plant a massive forest and do nothing else, today&#x27;s trees will eventually die, rot, and re-release all that CO2. That forest will regenerate itself if left alone and be a store of CO2, but any individual tree is lifecycle approximately zero. reply mrweasel 45 minutes agorootparentI mean you&#x27;re not wrong, but if we take that view the only permanent solution if to capture the CO2 and stuff it back into the ground, preferably as a relatively stable substance such as coal or oil.Most of the worlds large forests are no more, many European countries are stripped of their old forests, so replanting those are required anyway, for other environmental concerns. They could on a permanent basis capture some percentage of the CO2. It is permanent if you view it as a forest and not individual tree. reply sokoloff 40 minutes agorootparent> if we take that view the only permanent solution [is] to capture the CO2 and stuff it back into the groundI think that&#x27;s basically correct on the scale that&#x27;s needed.

But there are other options: migrate to places where it isn&#x27;t that hot or cold. And that&#x27;s where we have a nice little feedback loop: on account of climate change the temperate zone where you are not expected to require much heating or much cooling is shrinking so you&#x27;ll need more heating and more AC which will cause more energy to be pumped into the atmosphere.Those &#x27;little people&#x27; are still by and large the richest fraction of the world population (they have cars, eat meat, have heated houses and AC).

I&#x27;m not suggesting that there necessarily needs to be strikes or market manipulation, just that applying focused, intense pressure collectively would cause the companies to bend. It may not be the smartest thing to do with your money in the short-term, but we desperately need to (yesterday) rally behind things like green energy and sustainability.Changing hearts, moving minds, changing policy individually is hard. I do agree with you. I personally choose to reject the learned helplessness instilled by only voting correctly by calling people to action - to encourage discourse among their peers. If you&#x27;re knowledgeable or have specific insight, speak out, make appearances or encourage and lift up those who are willing&#x2F;capable to be in the spotlight.I do absolutely realize that whatever I do is a drop in the bucket because I am essentially a nobody and am physically unwell. My heart is hardened by this backwards world, and I probably don&#x27;t do many favors for the things I am passionate about because I rarely sugarcoat how I express myself. Still, I do what I can when I think can be a rational voice.Putting yourself out on a limb - being gutsy and inspiring others, is something that has been forgotten largely in part (in my mind) due to the shattering of the middle class and because of mainstream media (and the divisiveness they instill).But I&#x27;d like to say that moving forward as a society, in a way that makes everybody happy - with plentiful benefits to our economy, is something that only people with stakes in absolutely unethical companies (e.g. companies involved with fossil fuels) would openly take issue with.The research is pretty clear: we need to shed this dirty habit if we want the Earth to be a good place.Customers&#x2F;the many should be more active in their purchases&#x2F;the way they vote. But as I explained, advertisements largely brainwash people, and there aren&#x27;t enough alternatives to simply boycott these companies.Intelligent people, skilled people, (edit:) and people with money need to take the stage and move this world forward. reply Synaesthesia 41 minutes agoprevWhen I watched this TV show where real estate agents were selling massive houses to the rich and famous in Beverly Hills, expansive multi-million dollar homes, I just though of all the concrete and materials used to build such homes (all of which emit CO2 when made) and the heating and cooling bills associated with that.It&#x27;s all unnecessary stuff, you don&#x27;t need a collosal mansion, that&#x27;s the sort of thing which contributes to these figures.

And vice versa. reply somedude895 11 minutes agoparentprevThe lifestyle of the rich is a drop in the bucket and not what the article is about.

Current, America isn’t even responsible for 40% of the planet’s warming. Therefore, 10% of America cannot be responsible for 40%. I assume they mean 10% of america is responsible is for 40% of america’s planet heating. Which is of no surprise. reply footy 5 hours agoparentYes, that&#x27;s obviously what they mean. The pronoun \"its\" is modifying \"America\". reply gaadd33 5 hours agoparentprevEnglish isn&#x27;t your native language is it? The it&#x27;s refers to America&#x27;s warming.

Something that would pick and choose between the different compression techniques in this paper and also the ones from arrow and parquet. reply abeppu 17 hours agoparentWhile I wish there were good principled methods for determining these choices, isn&#x27;t a meaningful limitation that often when you first start writing the data, you typically don&#x27;t know all of the ways it will eventually be used? Sometimes, the team tasked with making data available for various forms of bulk processing has to guess at what teams and mandates might exist years from when they are setting up the data lake, or even what compliance requirements will arise. E.g. as different areas introduce data protection laws, perhaps your datalake which could previously assume that records are written but not deleted has to support queries to find PII values associated with a person who has issued a delete request, and you&#x27;re forced to rewrite lots of files. Or a downstream team starts using vector DBs and wants to assemble datasets by doing queries for records which match any of 100k IDs, which have associated vectors in regions of interest, and you need something that&#x27;s not a single scan but also not a large number of point lookups. Etc, etc. How do you have a principled method for optimizing for unknown future use cases? Does it make sense to talk about a probability distribution over future queries? reply hinkley 14 hours agoparentprevAs with most frustrations in my career, many of the expensive bits come down to hoarding. We don’t know what will spark joy so the system has to be able to do anything at any time. This is not free. Sometimes it’s goddamned expensive.I have in this decade encountered systems that still have to run overnight. Meanwhile I’m spending multiple developer salaries maintaining a system that might be asked to answer a question in ten seconds, or might not be asked any questions for days at a time.Somebody save me. reply datadeft 13 hours agoparentprevI would be happy if Parquet or ORC was used in most DWHs. The difference between JSON and Parquet is much bigger than the difference between Parquet and BtrBlocks. reply thesz 14 hours agoparentprevWe, probably, will be even better off by leaving cost model craft to the system.I recently had to look into various TPC benchmarks and some of them are very non-trivial to cost-estimate. I found at several queries in TPC-DS that join the same table to itself four (4) times. Even triangles (join with itself three times) are hard, squares like these in TPC-DS are even harder. reply wood_spirit 21 hours agoprevMany years back I found that the actual performance of orc and parquet and avro was dominated by the optimisations of the client libraries you used to access them rather than the theoretical pros and cons of the formats themselves. (IIRC on spark chose parquet, on presto choose orc etc?)Hopefully the gaping performance gaps have closed. reply ayhanfuat 20 hours agoparentThis came up in a Twitter discussion, too. Contains a link to an interesting paper which I copied below.> As someone who work with C++ parquet readers and writers I say that different configurations can easily result in 10x differences in size -- the default behavior is usually very poor (Tony Wang &#x2F; @marsupialtail_2) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;marsupialtail_2&#x2F;status&#x2F;17021850155038883...> TUM have written a great summary about performance niches around parquet file IO performance, @DatabendLabs adopted a lot of optimizations mentioned in the summary and result is great in practice. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.gi.de&#x2F;server&#x2F;api&#x2F;core&#x2F;bitstreams&#x2F;9c8435ee-d478-4b...

By analyzing a collection of real-world datasets, we selected a pool of fast encoding schemes for this use case. Additionally, we introduced Pseudodecimal Encoding, a novel compression scheme for floating-point numbers. Using our sample-based compression scheme selection algorithm and our generic framework for cascading compression, we showed that, compared to existing data lake formats, BtrBlocks achieves a high compression factor, competitive compression speed and superior decompression performance. BtrBlocks is open source and available at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maxi-k&#x2F;btrblocks. reply mrits 20 hours agoparentIt is interesting and I&#x27;d love to look over some details benchmarks on the differences. Storing floats as integers overcome several of their challenges. The example of dollar units would be a good candidate for a short delta compression.I doubt I&#x27;d ever used columnar compression again as I felt it too difficult to fight DBAs on keeping the original sorting and schema preserved in an optimal way. I do find it really interesting though. reply j-pb 22 hours agoprevViktor Leis&#x27;s working group consistently produces interesting fundamental database research.

I&#x27;ve been using ART variants for almost 15 years now. The algorithm was somewhat common in supercomputing&#x2F;HPC (used to index some types of sparse data models), which is where I originally came across it. In addition to being performant, ART is considerably more expressive and flexible than people might assume. reply sakras 13 hours agoprevI’ve been really excited about this paper since I went to the presentation at SIGMOD for it. I think the key innovation here is that it’s the first open standard for a format that’s just a simple combination of lightweight encodings. As far as I’m aware, most columnar DBMS already have storage like this, so it’s not very novel from a technical perspective.However, the data science&#x2F;big data world has been bogged down by inefficient, clunky formats like Parquet for quite a while and so I applaud any steps towards bridging the gap between the two worlds. reply FridgeSeal 12 hours agoparentOn the other hand, the popularity and language-independence of parquet has seen a fantastic explosion of tools&#x2F;products&#x2F;libraries that I think is really healthy.Generally with “data stuff” you’re chained to whatever the dominant language and tools do (for the longest time, Python and Spark) and you’d have to accomodate them and their idiosyncrasies directly. Nowadays though, basically everything has a pq lib, there’s tools at all scales: DuckDB, ClickHouse, Databend, etc. The Arrow internal representation of parquet means we’ve escaped the dominance of single massive packages (e.g. pandas and spark dataframes) as the only way to deal with certain datasets.I think it’s great what we’ve managed to get via Parquet, even if it’s a little bit clunky. reply Loic 22 hours agoprevCorresponding source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maxi-k&#x2F;btrblocks reply amadio 18 hours agoprevSad that the author seems to be unaware of similar work, but in high energy physics: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1742-6596&#x2F;2438&#x2F;1&#x2F;...
