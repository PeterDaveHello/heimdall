    "originBody": "Costs of running a macOS app studio business I created The low-tech guys, a brand under which I develop macOS apps for a living. I started this business with a good friend of mine, thinking I could help him stop working long hours at his consulting job and ease into more creative work. However, getting to a state where you earn enough to live off the app sales takes time, and he did not have that time. So it's just one \"low-tech guy\" doing all this, and that is me. So what are the largest costs of running such a business? Well to be honest, that is time. Time I could have spent with my wife, my brother, my dog, instead of answering support emails from my first waking moment to right before sleeping. Time I could have walked outside, do some handy work in natural light, instead of sit on my butt and wreck my spine 6-12h a day. But time is hard to quantify, so let's talk about money instead. # App Store I sell 3 apps on the App Store: rcmd - App switcher using the ⌘ Right Command key Grila - Keyboard-centric calendar Gamma Dimmer - Basic screen brightness dimmer rcmd makes the bulk of the sales, but mostly because I didn't have time to further develop and act on feedback for the other two. Here are the numbers for 2023: Sales (how much people paid in total): $14.9k Proceeds (how much I get from the sales): $11.5k Costs: $3.4k App Store commission fee (small business 15%): \u0010$2.3k VAT, Sales Tax, foreign currency exchange fees: $1.1k # Paddle I publish apps independently as well because the App Store has some strict restrictions regarding what you can do in an app (no private APIs allowed, no IOKit for talking to hardware directly etc.). So the apps where I can use code to tickle my curiosity and experiment more are not on the App Store. I use paddle.com for selling these apps because they handle all tax work for me (calculate VAT and sales tax, send it to the relevant authority, handle reverse charge and chargebacks etc.). They also provide a useful Mac SDK for licensing and checkout. For most year, I only sold Lunar there, an app for adaptive monitor brightness. Just recently I also started selling Clop (an image, video and PDF optimizer), but most numbers will be relative to Lunar's price. Here are the numbers for 2023: Sales (how much people paid in total): $93.5k Proceeds (how much I get from the sales): $73.3k Costs: $20.2k Paddle commission fee (5%): \u0010$4.7k VAT, Sales Tax, foreign currency exchange fees: $15.5k The disadvantage of using a Merchant of Record like Paddle is that I don't get to reclaim the VAT at the end of the year. That's because it's some kind of B2B relation: I sell them my app in gross with 0% VAT, and then they resell it and collect taxes themselves. Oh well, the price of convenience and peace of mind... # Romanian corporate income tax So in 2023, people paid a total of $108.4k (wow.. 108400 US dollars.. I’m amazed to see that number myself, thank you good people for helping me keep doing this) and after paying fees to a bunch of states and platforms, I’m left with $84.8k. Before taxes. Yep, it doesn’t stop here, you didn't think I'd get to spend eighty-five thousand dollars, did you? THE LOW-TECH GUYS S.R.L. is a business incorporated in Romania so it has to pay taxes on the income. Calculating that final tax needs applying such a chaotic and stupidly complex formula that I think I’ll spare you the details. If you really want to know, it’s something like: I have to pay myself a minimum salary of about $1k/month on which I pay half as taxes, then I pay 3% from the remaining sum as income tax, then I pay 8% as dividend tax, then I pay 10% of 24 minimum monthly salaries for mandatory health insurance, then I have to pay a mandatory accountant and a mandatory billing software, and a mandatory business bank account... I most surely forgot something and I'll also have to pay a mandatory fine next year In short, another $13k flies out the window to Romanian corrupt politicians to line up their greasy pockets. A small amount of those might end up in healthcare and education, so that corrupt hospital managers and inspectors can get their part as well. I'm left with $71.8k. Before expenses. Thankfully, a macOS app business doesn't have many of those. Here's what I currently have to pay: A bare metal Hetzner server: $600 This is where I host all my DMGs, websites, APIs, analytics, experiments etc. An IPStack subscription as a fallback for Lunar's Location Mode: $140 Apple Developer Membership: $100 Depending on the app features, I might also need to buy the latest MacBook or iPhone to develop and test hardware-related features (like DDC support for M1 or XDR Brightness for MacBook HDR screens), or for example I needed to buy a bunch of varying light sensors and ESP32/ESP8266 boards to develop adaptive monitor brightness using wireless light sensors. These are not recurring so I can't count them in, just thought I'd note them here for whoever's interested. I'm also a Romanian, living in Romania, earning USD but spending RON so I'll also lose a significant amount on foreign currency exchange. I calculated that to be at least $1k # End result $108 400 - $3 400 (App Store) - $20 200 (Paddle) - $13 000 (Romanian CIT) - $600 (Hetzner server) - $140 (IPStack API) - $100 (Apple Developer Program) - $1 000 (Foreign exchange) --------- $69 960 (Net profit) ￼ $108 400 (What people paid) [100%] - $69 960 (What I get) [64%] --------- $38 440 (What God knows how many intermediaries get just so that I am allowed to ask money for my work)[36%] In the end, I get the equivalent of a $5800/month net salary. Not bad, but very far from what I could earn as a consultant. To put it in perspective, this summer I took a $120/hour consulting gig for an MDM company because they said they need a few days worth of work for a macOS app and I said why not, it's just a few days. It turned out they needed a lot more and were happy to continue paying that amount because macOS skills are not easy to find. But I could not fit into the same old Slack chat + Zoom meetings + SCRUM + daily report + doing something that you feel it has no purpose in the real world for 8 hours a day madness that consulting work needs. So I said \"no, I'm sorry, I'd like to continue building my apps\". At $120/hour, one would get $120 * 8 hours * 21 days - ~12% taxes → $18k/month after taxes. Which is a mind boggling amount of money for a Romanian. And it's 3x more than my app revenue. But I like to believe that with that difference of $12k I'm buying time. Time that I can spend as late mornings, drinking coffee quietly while playing with my dog. Time that I can spend eating a quiet meal with my wife without being in a hurry for a meeting, and then taking time after to talk about our house projects. Time for taking weeks off from being in front of a laptop without having to ask someone for my own time back.",

At 39 I&#x27;ve reached this point where I can verbalise that sentiment whereas before I could only really feel it. Having to sell one&#x27;s time to others sucks. Doing things on someone else&#x27;s schedule sucks. And ultimately as the post ended, having the freedom to spend life the way it should be spent means sacrificing that extra bit of money we might want but don&#x27;t need. Great post. reply ljm 10 hours agoparentI had a bit of a mental shift after I turned 30, realising I&#x27;d spent the best part of a decade building up my career in various ways.I&#x27;m still in the typical 9-5 job since I&#x27;m way too young to retire (and we don&#x27;t get paid the crazy money in the UK that software engineers in parts of the US do), but I&#x27;ve been able to settle on what I want and what I don&#x27;t want so I have the power to walk away.In the simplest terms, I just need to be at a place working on something I give a fuck about, which pushes me to smaller upstarts. This sometimes incurs a bit of a paycut but I see that as a worthwhile hit to take if I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m selling my soul to people I realise I don&#x27;t want to work for.Just gotta avoid the lifestyle creep so a temporary downsize doesn&#x27;t contribute to mental distress. reply varispeed 9 hours agorootparentBuilding up career is a trap.The system is designed to capture everyone as a wage slave and every year there are more barriers put to keep the \"pleb\" in their lane.The only way to build wealth (independence, freedom) for one&#x27;s family is through starting a business that you can scale.If you go to work at a company always think how you can use the knowledge gained there to start something of your own. Use salaried work as a paid for education, not a mean for living, otherwise you&#x27;ll get trapped forever.30 is a turning point, where most people realise about the situation they are in and look for escape.> In the simplest terms, I just need to be at a place working on something I give a fuck aboutThat would always be one&#x27;s own business.If you are not in a position to run one, always ask for true equity in the business you want to work in. reply ryanjshaw 4 hours agorootparent> If you go to work at a company always think how you can use the knowledge gained there to start something of your own.Pro tip: avoid highly specialised knowledge that can only be used in particular firms e.g. highly capitalised or regulated entities. Yes you will be paid well above market rates but it will be very difficult to convert those skills into a business because you won&#x27;t have access to the market as a solo entrepreneur.Time and again I&#x27;ll see that the people who start successful lifestyle businesses started off in a lower paying, more general career e.g. web development. It works because you&#x27;ll encounter problems that apply to a huge market, and you&#x27;ll have past customers you can tap into to sell your product that addresses those problems e.g. WordPress plugins or invoicing software particular to your region of the world. Boring but high demand software. reply p1nkpineapple 1 hour agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t having deep specialisation in a particular field help you to gain a competitive advantage when deciding to go it alone and starting a company in that area? reply saagarjha 9 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely not true. If you keep your expenses down and your compensation up (FAANG, etc.) you can easily make enough to retire early. reply ryandrake 8 hours agorootparent“Just be one of the vanishingly few to 1.work at FAANG + 2.as a L6-or-greater SWE + 3.in the Bay Area” is not a realistic strategy.Yes, if all those miracles come true that lottery winner can retire early, but I don’t think that is a broadly applicable plan. reply wnolens 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not even just FAANG anymore. Plenty of places pay over 350k for a senior.And Seattle is probably a much better place with respect to taxes and cost of living. Most other cities where FAANG will employ are fine. Don&#x27;t have to be #1 to win.Still a lottery winner with respect to the global employment market. But if you graduated with a US software engineering degree, you can make this happen. reply ryanjshaw 4 hours agorootparentAnd for those who were born outside the US, none of this is applicable (unless you are young and can try emigration), and the advice to be an entrepreneur is correct.EDIT: There are some people here who claim you can earn that kind of money outside the US, but they never give details when pressed, or describe some kind of very specific set of life circumstances you will never be able to replicate. reply dartos 6 hours agorootparentprevYou also need to be okay working at a FAANG.After working in a 4k person org, I don’t think I could stomach working at another giant company. replyChrisMarshallNY 12 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not that upset that no one wants to work with an old guy (that&#x27;s me), and I was forced to retire.I still get to play with software, but on my own time, and on my own schedule.The difference is amazing. reply magic_hamster 12 hours agorootparentAmazing given you can maintain your standard of living. reply ChrisMarshallNY 11 hours agorootparentI had enough saved, to allow myself to do OK.

It means being willing to lie or mislead people into thinking you aren’t in the category of people who gets discriminated against, making yourself too much trouble to fire, and finding open-minded employers.If you’re in a disadvantaged group, you need to pick your battles, and accept that life isn’t fair. reply rrrix1 8 hours agorootparentPure Wisdom! reply ldoughty 10 hours agorootparentprevYou do not often get an email to tell you you were not accepted for a position (unless you made it far in the process)Businesses have pushed heavily for at-will employment; this means that businesses don&#x27;t need to say why people are fired.So they don&#x27;t have to write down why you were not hired, nor why you were fired.So you have to prove that you were not hired&#x2F;or fired for being in a protected class. This is extremely difficult short of a recording of the interviewer saying e.g. \"so you&#x27;re pregnant?\" => can possibly argue discrimination, but it&#x27;s still difficult. This kind of stuff works in a panel interviews or bad work environment when you can compel testimony from other workers who would rather risk their job over jail... but doesn&#x27;t work well in 1:1 or 2:1 situations where one or two people just need to lie to avoid the lawsuit. reply joebob42 3 hours agorootparentOr, not even lie, but just be unaware of the subconscious biases influencing them.

Also, the entire industry pretty much actively supports and accommodates ageism.

A number of folks used the interview process to try humiliating me, and taking out their personal animus.After a few of these, I decided \"Bugger this for a lark,\" and just accepted that I shouldn&#x27;t bother looking, anymore.But I think people are being hoist by their own petard. I&#x27;m seeing folks in their forties, that never had any issue, finding work, hitting the wall.

It appears Romanian practice is similar; see “Depreciation” on this page:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxsummaries.pwc.com&#x2F;romania&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;deductions reply tomschwiha 11 hours agoparentHere in Germany its similar, maybe its could be worth for the author to consult a tax consultant as he may be missing out quite some money. Also a wage you pay yourself is usually better off for tax readons - that&#x27;s why the maximum wage you can pay yourself as business owner is limited. reply dazhbog 11 hours agorootparentAgree about the accountant, they are expensive in some countries, but usually worth it.Can you elaborate on your last point? For salary you still need to pay >20% income tax + social insurance, and for dividends you still need to pay >20% after you just paid your corporation tax >15%.I&#x27;m curious, why its better to pay yourself more, when your laptop, phone and even food can be covered by the company? (Assuming a single founder company, doing everything legally) reply sitharus 5 hours agorootparentI’m always amazed at other country’s tax systems. Here in NZ if you’re a sole trader you only pay personal income tax, if you incorporate you either take the whole profit as income and pay income tax, or take a dividend which comes with tax credits so you only pay the difference between the company tax already paid and personal income tax. So just taking it all as salary is easier. reply tomschwiha 8 hours agorootparentprevIt really depends on the percentages, so I can mainly speak about Germany: For example you have a revenue of 100.000. If you have a limited liability company (UG or GmbH in Germany) you pay 30% taxes on the profit, so you have 70.000 left at the end of the year. If you want to transfer it to your personal account you will need to pay additionaly taxes of 25%. So you are left with 52.500.If you directly pay yourself 100.000 as wage it is fully deductable as company expense. So you don&#x27;t pay any company taxes and would only need to pay income taxes of ~25.000.So a payout as wage you have 75.000 instead of 52.500.For both values at least in Germany you would also need to pay health insurance and possible for pension. (Health insurance at least additional 8.000 - 10.000). reply tomschwiha 8 hours agorootparentThe best would be probably to let the company cover the PC &#x2F; tablet &#x2F; phone costs as they are business expenses and payout yourself the remainer as long as long as you can still increase your business operations.A good tip I once got was that you should always try to get money out of your company while you can - having it on your personal bank account is better then in your companies one. reply gruez 6 hours agorootparent>The best would be probably to let the company cover the PC &#x2F; tablet &#x2F; phone costs as they are business expensesDepending on how your local tax codes are structured and how strictly your local tax authority interprets them, letting the company buy the electronics and then subsequently using it for non-business use might count as a fringe benefit and therefore be taxable. In other words, if get your company to buy you a iPhone 15 Pro Max and a 16 MBP Pro with M3 Max, but all you&#x27;re doing is some light macOS app development, they might (rightly) think that those aren&#x27;t really being used for business purposes and are actually a sneaky way to remunerate yourself. reply pard68 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat is \"social insurance\"? reply croemer 10 hours agorootparentLiteral translation from a language such as German, French or the like. The right translation would be payroll tax, all sorts of mandatory insurances like health, unemployment, retirement (continental Europe has a few more mandatory items than US) replyJhsto 11 hours agoparentprevAnecdotally relevant to employees too: sometimes companies (and even public organizations like universities) let you keep the hardware they buy for you after it meets the 3 years depreciation rule. reply croemer 10 hours agorootparentSounds like black hat tax accounting. If it&#x27;s still worth something after 3 years it would be an in-kind payment which will need to be taxed. reply threecheese 12 hours agoprevI am a paying customer and regular user of Lunar and Rcmd (for which I might have paid more than 12 bucks, just sayin) and I am pretty sure I saw Clop on Setapp and was thinking of trying it. I’m glad to have the opportunity to give feedback: your app and website design aesthetic really makes you stand out from most of the “popular Mac app” authors (you know who you are), which have a very much Web1.0 look and feel (and many of these rockstars have been writing for the platform that long).

What happens when you collect VAT from EU customers? Do you have to transfer to each of EU countries? Is it enforced somehow? What if you don&#x27;t collect VAT at all? Technically speaking, EU customers buy stuff on your site, not in EU. E.g. they also buy stuff from US Amazon.com and don&#x27;t pay any VAT. Especially for digital goods - there is no need for an EU delivery address. reply jim180 9 hours agorootparentIt depends. Apple pays VAT on your behalf, so you don’t have to do anything.If, let’s say another service does not do that, you have to pay it your self, but MOSS[1] exist for that, which means that you’ll pay for your local tax agency, and it will distribute VAT payments per country.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;business&#x2F;taxation&#x2F;vat&#x2F;vat-digit... reply croemer 9 hours agorootparentprevEuropean Economic Area to be precise (i.e. Norway, Switzerland etc abide by the same rules). Yes, if you&#x27;re not a tiny business (OP isn&#x27;t tiny) you have to pay VAT to each end customer&#x27;s country. Though you can declare it in your home country to reduce bureaucracy. VAT law is well developed, what matters is the location of the end customer, not where the seller is, so your technically speaking isn&#x27;t how it works. Wrong, if they buy from US Amazon, they pay VAT at EU customs entry (unless customs misses it or it&#x27;s below threshold of some 40 EUR or so). Is it enforced? Yes. Do they catch everyone who cheats? No. Do you want to break the law? Better not. reply zerr 2 hours agorootparentEEA might demand their citizens to pay the VAT, but how can it demand&#x2F;enforce this e.g. for some company in Vietnam? What happens when EEAians buy goods in Vietnam with EEA bank&#x27;s credit cards, e.g. in a not-tiny restaurant? Is the VAT cancelled because they are physically in Vietnam for the time being? reply cfn 51 minutes agorootparentI have been in this situation but selling to the States. Nothing happens if you sell to end users who pay with credit card but as soon as you have a large sale to a company or institution they will ask for all kinds of documents that force you to register properly and pay taxes. reply Sytten 7 hours agoparentprevI assume he means on his expenses.

Far far far from the truth.I am learning Swift&#x2F;swiftUI (as a backend guy with little previous experience with frontend&#x2F;UI programs, okay) and building apps for OSX can be very painful. Starting from outdated docs (basically no books about OSX development since ... 10-15 years? or more?) to the new fancy ways of doing things with SwiftUI (that sells the promise that \"you do it once,...\" and it will work exactly as they planned to when you sell *Hello World* apps).It&#x27;s not the use case itself to be hard, but the fact you need to support multiple operating systems (which as you might know, Apple produces every year a brand new model, so imagine the fun), or that maybe the specific API you rely on (from Apple, not some random guy out there) has some weird memory leak because it&#x27;s written in C++ or Obj-C, who knows last time someone touched it. And Apple is updating everything but that specific thing, so you need to build something around it. I don&#x27;t even want to start on the lack of libraries for Swift - a lot of open source libs are outdated, bugged, last commits 1-2 years ago, which means you either have to fork and fix, or well, you do it yourself from scratch.Nowadays selling software for OSX has basically nothing to do anymore with the idea or use case itself but all the toil that the poor developer has to put with up. I learnt that most apps on the App Store deserves some money (sometimes they ask for a lot, nothing to say, but that&#x27;s their business model). reply alin23 11 hours agorootparentI definitely feel your pain.

I wrote Lunar v1 in 2017, and it was fully free for 4 years, but those years were essential for the app to mature and get a good following.In June 2021 I launched Lunar v4 with the new support for Apple Silicon and I also added a paid tier. I started making good money from the start, most likely because Lunar was already \"known\". I was making about $3k&#x2F;month back then, which was enough for me to not need a full time job anymore.Getting to $6k was a gradual process since 2021 until now: constantly launching free apps, giving more attention to those that provided utility to most people, adding paid tiers when I had enough to offer over the existing free features. reply spike021 12 hours agorootparentHow do you plan what features should be added while the app is free, and then which features in the future will go into a paid tier?Last year I worked on a pet project iOS app (which I never released unfortunately) and one of my struggles was figuring out how I&#x27;d portion out the features from free to not-free after release. I was thinking at the time of doing what you&#x27;ve done, basically releasing as free for a while and then adding a paid set of features. It&#x27;s just difficult to plan what should fit there. reply alin23 11 hours agorootparentIf I want to build a feature that I know would need a lot of work so I’d like to make it paid, I note it down. That’s it, I just leave it there, and focus on getting the app launched as free first.After the launch, feedback will guide you through what noted features to act on, and even add some more.Launching it as free also gives you time to iron out the inevitable edge cases that won’t appear in your tests. People will have lower expectations, and feedback will contain less angry tone, which is usually a big demotivator.The “launch early” phrase you keep reading in maker circles, makes a lot of sense for indie devs. It’s easiest to validate an idea, and get help on the direction of the app. Your idea of what the app should be is not always the best idea, user feedback can help fine tune that.However if you have a very specific vision, and “if someone pays, good, if no one pays, still good”, then disregard what I said above. Keep working on your vision, something unique might sprout out of that.EDIT: I realized I might not have answered your actual question. Because I always build apps to fix a problem of my own, I make free only what’s essential for that problem. Like what I would do in a script, but with just a bit of polish and UI for it to be usable by non tech users as well.That’s how Clop launched: first it was a single Swift file that checked the clipboard for images in a loop and ran pngquant on them. I would run that at the command line. Then I packaged it as an app with minimal UI and released it as free.Most of everything else will be paid. That’s what happened with video and PDF optimization on Clop.But if it’s an improvement on an existing free feature, I will add it for free. That’s what I did with ignoring specific types of images from the clipboard, or detecting Universal Clipboard etc. reply zubairq 3 hours agoprevGreat comments about the 9-5 wage trap here! reply eviks 4 hours agoprevA rather inefficient system that results in such a large cut of the revenue reply zerr 10 hours agoprevHow&#x27;s the market on Windows platform?

I hate this world, and how it delivers another year of pain, misery and greed. Just blow up and take us all with it please. reply aurizon 6 hours agoprevThere is a buzz word = turn-key ap. That is an app that installs and runs and they you have a pack of youtube&#x2F;? videos for all install problems that you can use to prune support calls, along with remote access ap that you send to client on the basis that you as dev or your employee are so good at this stuff that once on his desktop you can solve all problems a lot faster than chatting on the phone. The first aspect - turn key = sell and never see them again apart from the annual fee = it must have seen-all&#x2F;solved-all installation bugaboos, and eveyt ime you get a new one = fixed. Unless you reach turn-key, you are a boat with a leak, double sales = 2 boats = 2 leaks and you need more people on the pumps. You need a boat with no leaks at all - as if that was ever possible, so you get as close to that as possible so you waste less time on support = more in the bank. reply w0mbat 13 hours agoprevThe Apple app store is a disaster for making a living as an indie. People can&#x27;t find the apps so sales are low, market rate prices are also low. The only way to make a living is to rip-off users with misleading subscriptions, which I won&#x27;t do. I made much more money writing $20 shareware in the 90s.That&#x27;s why I write apps for a corporation now. reply czottmann 11 hours agoparent> The only way to make a living is to rip-off users with misleading subscriptions(Personal experience&#x2F;anecdata follows.)I don&#x27;t know. I sell a macOS&#x2F;iOS productivity app on the App Store[1], and while not getting rich there, I can tell you that&#x27;s actually useful to people, you can put a non-peanuts price tag on it. I love that it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to get an app out in front of a lot of potential customer.That said, I wouldn&#x27;t never rely on the App Store to surface my app on its own, it&#x27;s ridiculous.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actions.work&#x2F;actions-for-obsidian reply newaccount74 10 hours agoparentprevThere are a bunch of people who make enough money to live on the App Store, even without subscriptions.

I&#x27;ve heard of a few others as well.There are a lot of things that suck on the App Store, but it&#x27;s definitely possible to make a living. reply qup 11 hours agoparentprevWhy not write shareware again?More users than ever. reply gumballindie 12 hours agoparentprevThat’s by design. You are meant to work for a corporation. Capitalism is nearly dead due to this - corporation flooding the market, drowning indie enterprise, and clogging money. We need a return to capitalism and do away with guilded corporatism. reply plagiarist 11 hours agorootparentThe specific case here is usually referred to as commoditizing the complement, it&#x27;s probably intentional at this point if it wasn&#x27;t intentional from the start.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gwern.net&#x2F;complement reply Almondsetat 12 hours agoprevIsn&#x27;t $5800&#x2F;month a shit ton of money in Romania? Who even gets paid similar amounts there? He mentions a consulting job, but you don&#x27;t consult as many hours a month as a salaried person reply alin23 11 hours agoparentYes, it’s a lot of money in Romania. I could live very comfortably if that would continue being the case. If I had my own place.My “not bad” remark is because I still can’t afford housing with all the money I make. I’ve been living in rent since college >10 years ago and I’m sick of it. You get no legal benefits when renting in Romania, everything is done by hiding from the state and local authorities. So you can’t even get a family doctor in your area.Me and my wife have been trying to buy a house for the last 4 years and even tried to renovate a 100 year old house in an isolated village because it was all we could afford. Long story but we got scammed, the land plot is unusable in its current state.Housing prices are so out of control here that even with that consulting money I would still need to not spend anything for a year to be able to afford a house that doesn’t need heavy repairs and has all the paperwork in good order. It’s very common here to sell houses that were built without a permit. reply poseva 14 minutes agorootparentHouse prices per sqm in Romania based on average net earnings per month is lower than ever, lower than 2014 when price per sqm were at the lowest after the 2008 financial crisis.Why don&#x27;t you consider buying the house with a bank loan? it&#x27;s the best decision to do so even if you have all the money... if you talk with a financial consultant you&#x27;ll see why.Housing prices are not out of control, we are lagging years behind other European countries in regard with house prices. If you look on the numbers you will see that this is actually a good time to buy a house in Romania. reply codingcodingboy 10 hours agorootparentprevNo offense but I think you do not understand how privileged you are. reply alin23 10 hours agorootparentOffense seems to be the only thing you do around here. I know I’m privileged, I work with unprivileged people to help them get better sometimes and that is probably the best way to feel how much inequality there is between us.Having a lot of money relative to the place you live in doesn’t guarantee your happiness. Privilege means nothing in the face of illness of a loved one, having to live with parents at 30 because you had to evacuate a rent made without contract and more things I would like to not share on a tech forum..Please get a sense of what’s being talked around here, what’s the negativity for? reply codingcodingboy 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t want to be negative and it&#x27;s great to see what you&#x27;ve accomplished, the problems you are mentioning and alluding to are unfortunately not exclusive to your country, I could share some horror stories too and I come from the \"developed and rich\" western europe.The point is that the net income you get is very high for european standars, let alone Romania. With that level of income it is really weird that you cannot solve the problems you have.The phrase \"I would still need to not spend anything for a year to be able to afford a house\" is bonkers. reply mathverse 43 minutes agorootparentNo offense but you seem very uneducated in the matter. Being self employed makes it more difficult for OP to get a loan while \"good\" real estate is reaching almost western european level of prices in Central & Eastern Europe.Your post reeks of jealousy for OP&#x27;s net salary but you fail to account for your accumulated wealth over time of you and your family. OP&#x27;s had not been earning this wage for years while you and your family has.OP probably uses a lot of his net salary to support his spouse and family while you dont have to do that. reply alin23 3 hours agorootparentprevBonkers it is yet it’s true. The house prices are a joke right now here. I don’t know what drives such prices, 95% of Romanians will never be able to afford a €200k house with 50sqm of paved courtyard in front. Supply and demand my ass…Believe me, I’m so sick of “calling for details” because everyone hides most useful details in the house ad, then asking if it has paperwork ready which most don’t and expect you to buy the house based on how the house looked 20 years ago before heavy renovations with the cheapest materials possible, then spending numbing hours on trains to get to see that house in real life only to see how many lies were said on the phone and how that house would never be evaluated at more than half its price…That above is extremely common, I’ve been going through this for the past 4 years and I’m So. Sick. Of. It. reply poseva 5 minutes agorootparentIf you think house prices are a joke now, just wait 2-3 years.I&#x27;m actually a structural engineer with a passion for passive houses and went into programming 8 years ago. I designed and built a lot of houses and I know what you&#x27;re talking about.. the house builders chase profits disregarding any laws.IMHO the best thing is to buy a lot and build yourself the house, this way you are sure that you get what you want. hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour agorootparentprevTo my ears, supply and demand sounds like it makes a lot of sense here. Romania began as a country where most people owned their home, and still is; and it sounds like making the move from owning to renting comes with significant loss of political privileges, like healthcare, apparently. If I didn&#x27;t speak English and would lose access to healthcare if I sold my house, I probably wouldn&#x27;t sell it either unless it was absolutely necessary. Hence the supply is low, and when you throw corruption on top of that...OP, consider moving to a country where renting doesn&#x27;t turn you into a second class citizen if this really bothers you so much. It&#x27;s counterintuitive, but you&#x27;ll probably find the property markets to also be more sane there. replyttoinou 8 hours agoprev [–]But I could not fit into the same old Slack chat + Zoom meetings + SCRUM + daily reportHow hard is that ? replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Summary This report is mainly based on the comprehensive benchmark used to verify performance of the first Cray 1. This comprises the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory program kernels (aka Livermore Loops), that provides a range of Millions of Floating Point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS) measurements. In this case, results from my 1990s conversion to all C code are used. To support these performance ratings, results are also considered from two similar vintage benchmarks. These are the Linpack and Whetstone benchmarks. The first is linpack-pc.c, my accepted conversion for PCs, available at Netlib. For the second, I took over design responsibility from Harold Curnow, the original author, and developed enhanced variations, including one with 100% vectorisation, the initial target being the first Cray 1 system delivered to the UK. A selection of available results is provided to demonstrate performance variations and comparisons over the years. Other important issues can be considered, based on the information provided in my first Raspberry Pi report. \"In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1\" Background Activities - This provides details of my involvement in evaluating, acceptance testing and benchmarking mainframe and supercomputer systems for UK Government and University projects, including hands-on Cray 1 program development of benchmarks and stress tests.. Results Provided - Livermore Loops MFLOPS minimum, geometric mean (official average) and maximum, Linpack MFLOPS, Whetstone overall MWIPS and average MFLOPS of appropriate tests. These are all single core benchmarks. Raspberry Pi ARM CPUs - The comment above was for the 2012 Pi 1. In 2020, the Pi 400 average Livermore Loops, Linpack and Whetstone MFLOPS reached 78.8, 49.5 and 95.5 times faster than the Cray 1. Android ARM CPUs - 2012 Android tablet results identified Cray 1 gains with a range from barely there up to 10 times. My 2021 mid priced phone produced MFLOPS gains of 123, 74 and 151 times. Windows and Linux PCs Intel CPUs - The first PC to reach the average Cray 1 Livermore Loops score is indicated as a 1994 100 MHz Pentium. Best results for the original benchmarks are for a medium range laptop with a 2021 11th generation 4150 MHz Core i5 CPU. The the three MFLOPS gains were 117, 131 and 134 times. Advanced SIMD compilations lead to i5 gains of 359, 337 and 226 times. Multiprogramming Livermore Loops - Four copies of the Advanced SIMD Livermore Loops Benchmark were run at the same time. This resulted in a MFLOPS throughput gain of 1134 times. Vector Whetstones - This single core benchmark uses large data arrays that produce 100% vectorisation for all test functions and was produced to benchmark the first UK Cray 1. Results are included for thirteen 1978 to 1991 supercomputers. For this benchmark, Single and Double Precision (SP and DP) versions are available, the latter could be appropriate for comparison with supercomputer longer words. Top SP and DP MFLOPS measurements for the Core i5 were 602 and 433 times faster than Cray 1. Multithreading MP Whetstones - Results are provided essentially from running multiple copies of the mainly scalar version of the Whetstone benchmark, using 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads, via a single program. It highlights complications due to varying CPU MHz, according to the number of threads, and benefits of PC Hyperthreading. Single and double precision versions were run, in this case obtaining similar performance. Eight thread throughput gains over the Cray 1 were Raspberry Pi 400 times, Android phone 757 times and Core i5 laptop 1521 times. MP MFLOPS - This executes combinations of floating point multiplications and additions handling SP or DP variables, intended to demonstrate near maximum performance, again from a single program. For Intel, assembly code listings are provided for the normally fastest test. Based on the mix of floating point operations, an estimate of Cray 1 maximum speed, running these, is reduced from 160 MFLOPS to 122. The Core i5 laptop gains, over the revised Cray 1 maximum rating, were SP 2671 and DP 1317 times via 326 and 161 GFLOPS. Gains on the other devices were Android phone SP 293 times and Raspberry Pi SP 247 times, both at greater than 30 GFLOPS. This benchmark has a run time parameter to use up to 64 threads that should demonstrate far superior performance of more advanced CPUs. Background Activities Next or Go To Start Background Activities Reliability Studies - I worked for the UK Government Central Computer Agency from 1960, initially analysing fault returns that were contractually required for all new systems. These provided the first detailed statistics included in my book “Computer System Reliability” published in 1980. I also provided assistance in running acceptance tests, gathering similar information, over the years, for inclusion in my book. Acceptance Trials and First Supercomputer Involvement - During the late 1960s, with 20 staff, I became in charge of all acceptance trials, taking personal responsibility for top of the range computers. This included organising and supervising trials the UK Atlas 2 for Cambridge University Mathematical Laboratory, the 1962 earlier version said to be the most powerful supercomputer in the world. Scientific Systems Evaluation and Acceptance Trials - In the 1970s and early 1980s, with up to 15 staff, I covered evaluating and acceptance testing of scientific systems, with continuing responsibility for design and acceptance trial supervision of the larger systems. Between 1972 and 1973 these included an IBM 360/195 for UK Met Office and a CDC 7600 for ULCC (University of London), again said to be the current fastest supercomputers. Stress Testing Programs - In order to stress test all computers, during acceptance tests and under Operating Systems, I produced a range of Fortran programs, a few for testing CPUs, with others covering everything from paper tape punches to disk drives. These had parameters to run for extended periods and were used during hundreds of acceptance tests from 1972 up until the 1990s. The tests included the Whetstone benchmark, produced by my CCTA colleague Harold Curnow and the first accepted general purpose computer benchmark. I collected running times of most programs for use in performance evaluation. Met Seymour Cray - It must have been 1969, when I was visiting Control Data manufacturing facility in Minnesota, that I was asked to visit Chippewa Falls in Wisconsin to witness a UK Met Office benchmark run on the CDC 7600. Then, I had a brief encounter with Seymour Cray, who appeared to run the benchmark. After setting it up, it was all over in a flash, with Seymour reported that it took not a lot of milliseconds. This influenced my later development of general purpose benchmarks to have have noticeable running times with ongoing displays of progress. External Consultancy - CCTA had contractual responsibility for handling procurement of centrally funded university computers, leading to me becoming an advisor to the Computer Board for Universities and Research Councils, and later a member of the Technical Sub-Group for Advanced Research Computers. In 1976, I was appointed, as an expert from a Member State, to join a European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Committee, involving procurement of a new supercomputer, where a Cray 1 became the obvious choice. Hands-on Cray 1 - My detailed involvement in real supercomputers started in in 1978, including a second visit to Chippewa Falls to evaluate the Cray 1. This was followed by a pre-delivery factory trial, in 1979, for the new AWRE Aldermaston system.. Meanwhile, Cray 1 serial 1 was at the UK Rutherford Laboratory, where I converted all my appropriate test programs, and Whetstone benchmark, to use the new vector instructions. The on-site acceptance trials were carried out later in 1979, where the Cray 1 passed with flying colours. This was followed by the same factory and on-site testing procedures on serial 1 CDC Cyber 205 for UK Met Office, in 1981. That one failed its first factory trial due to my I/O stress testing program identifying a design fault. Collecting Performance Data - Next, until my early retirement in 1993, I was mainly involved in performance consultancy of data processing systems, personally covering more than 60 projects. I also took over design responsibility for the Whetstone benchmark and continued consultancy on university procurements. Starting during this period, I collected published details of computers, amounting to more than 2000 mainframes, minicomputers, supercomputers and workstations, from around 120 suppliers. I also continued collecting Whetstone results, ending with more than 700 from 53 computer manufacturers, covering minicomputers, through mainframes, to supercomputers. These provided the beginning for my ResearchGate reports, starting with Whetstone Benchmark History and Results.pdf and Computer_Speed_Claims_1980_to_1996.pdf, also Computer Speeds From Instruction Mixes pre-1960 to 1971.pdf. Met Key Supercomputer Benchmark Authors - As part of a university benchmark investigation team, I visited the USA in 1987, including to the creator of the Linpack range of benchmarks, Jack Dongarra in Tennessee, and to the Lawrence Livermore Research Laboratory, who produced the Livermore Loops (Livermore Fortran Kernels) benchmark. This became the key supercomputer benchmark for a number of years. Influencing Supercomputer Choice - In 1988, the Director of University of Manchester Regional Computer Centre requested my performance analysis of the two competing supercomputers, after being quoted by part of the evaluation team that I would support one of the proposals. I demonstrated the opposite choice, that was accepted, using results of my scalar and vector Whetstone benchmark results. This is based on a large number of users, where 90% of programs can be vectorised. Then, the one with the fastest maximum vector speed, but the lowest for scalar code, lost the battle. Benchmarking Supercomputers in Japan - My last involvement in supercomputers was for a new one for University of London Computer Centre, over 1991 and 1992, when I became the independent observer of a benchmark, based on numerous real applications, at Fujitsu and NEC in Japan. My colleague dealt with Cray, in the USA, that won the contract with a Y-MP configuration. As confirmed with my simple scalar and vector Whetstone, that I ran then, it was really comparing multiple pipelines against multiple CPUs, each of the latter with scalar and vector processing capabilities. My PC Benchmarks Next or Go To Start My PC Benchmarks Classic Benchmarks - Following retirement came part time consultancy and eventually creating my website (roylongbottom.org.uk) to house copies of performance data, collected during my CCTA days (with approval) and a range of benchmarks, initially concentrating on those for PCs, all for free with no adverts. The first, being detailed in my Classic Benchmarks report, covering Whetstone, Dhrystone, Linpack 100 and Livermore Loops, using C/C++ compiled programs. Early PCs had poor timer resolution, with benchmarks or functions requiring running times of 5 seconds for consistent performance. Other requirements included logging results in text files, checking output for consistent numeric results and, where possible, performance and results displayed as the tests progressed. Besides benchmark reports, identified below, I developed programs in assemly code, with reports now at ResearchGate in PC CPUID 1994 to 2013, plus Measured Maximum Speeds via Assembler Code.pdf and PC CPU Specifications 1994 to 2014 plus Measured MIPS and MFLOPS per MHz.pdf. Netlib Involvement - Other than for my Whetstone programs, the initial source code was obtained from Netlib, where my linpack-pc.c code, was later accepted and included, for use on PCs. Livermore Loops conversion was time consuming, where C code was available for the calculations, but data generation, checking and other activities were in Fortran, that I converted to C. All these followed conversion routes from running under DOS, though variations of Windows, Linux, including Raspberry Pi, and Android, most at 32 bits and 64 bits. The majority of early results were collected through involvement in Compuserve Benchmark and Standards Forum. Livermore Loops - Results shown here are for the second version of this benchmark, comprising 24 loops. Besides MFLOPS measurements for each of these, summary minimum, maximum and various averages are produced, with geometric mean being the official average. During my visit to LLL, I was given a copy of the 1986 report “The Livermore Fortran Kernels: A Computer Test of the Numerical Performance Range”, with over 200 pages of results for minicomputers to supercomputers. The document appears to be available via Internet, but I never managed to obtain a free download. My ResearchGate report Livermore Loops Benchmark Results On PCs and Later Devices.pdf, contains results up to 2017. As for the other Classic Benchmarks, later details are included in reports covering the different platforms. Linpack 100 - Performance of this original version of the benchmark is dependent on a function that simply calculates dy[i] = dy[i] + da*dx[i]; but with too many overheads that prevent performance from approaching maximum possible. However, this can be compiled to use linked (fused) multiply and add instructions, such as available on the Cray 1 and later computers, particularly with SIMD vector capabilities. As for Livermore Loops, run on systems with smaller word sizes than Cray 1, it is compiled to use double precision arithmetic. Detailed results of this original version, and that for the later HPL variety for modern supercomputers, are available from Netlib in document Performance of Various Computers Using Standard Linear Equations Software. My Linpack Benchmark results On PCs and Later Devices is available from ResearchGate. Whetstone - The current versions include the changes I made to produce performance ratings of each of the eight test functions, particularly to identify cases where some of the code was not being executed (deliberately by some, in the days of minicomputers). Here, the original overall MWIPS ratings are quoted, along with average MFLOPS for the three tests carrying out straightforward calculations. Two other tests include functions such as SIN and LOG, where changes in maths libraries can significantly affect overall MWIPS. This benchmark is based on simple code sequences used in the 1960s, where performance is more inclined to be proportional to CPU MHz until dramatic changed are made in hardware, like the introduction of additional instructions. My ResearchGate report for this benchmark is Whetstone Benchmark Detailed Later Results. Vector Whetstone - The vector version, converted for the Cray 1, executes the same functions as the scalar version, but covering a number of sequential memory locations, defined by a vector length parameter. Cray 1 performance achieved maximum performance at vector lengths of 64 words and above, with a sawtooth pattern . I have a previous unpublished C/C++ version that I ran on Raspberry Pi 400 and Windows and Linux based PCs, with results, at vector lengths of 256, being provided below. MP Whetstone - None of the other benchmarks, covered here so far, exercise more than one CPU core. This MP benchmark currently executes 1, 2, 4 and 8 copies of the standard code via multithreading in a single program. Some results are included to highlight performance gains over the single CPU in the Cray 1. MP MFLOPS - Results for this benchmark have been included for comparison with the maximum MFLOPS possible on the Cray 1. The benchmark executes tests with 2, 8 and 32 floating point operations per data word, covering larger caches and RAM. Default operation uses 8 threads but can be changed, up to 64 threads, with a run time parameter. Description and earlier results are available in MultiThreading Benchmarks. Detailed Results Next or Go To Start Detailed Results and Comparisons Variations - Results provided below, cover Livermore Loops, Linpack and Whetstone benchmarks. Note that the main Livermore report contains numerous results, covering different compilers and possibly hardware changes. As for the Whetstone benchmark, slow performance of single test functions can severely impact overall ratings. The chosen results represent my choice of typical performance. Cray 1 - The maximum possible hardware performance was said to be 160 MFLOPS for the 80 MHz Cray 1, comprising linked multiply and add, for two results per clock cycle. The LLL benchmark maximum shown is 82.1 MFLOPS with average 11.9 and minimum 1.2. Then Linpack and Whetstone are 27 and 6 MFLOPS, Linpack benefiting from linked multiply and add. Raspberry Pi - In 2013 I ran my benchmarks on the first version of Raspberry Pi. These were essentially the same as those used on PCs, under Linux. The programs included the Livermore Loops benchmark and that lead me including the following in a report. “In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1.” This refers to official average geometric mean results. In 2019 (aged 84), I was invited to become a voluntary member of Raspberry Pi Foundation’s Alpha Testing Team, which I accepted. This lead to me running my benchmarks and stress tests on new top of the range systems before announcement. The supply of new hardware and software, so far, lead to me producing eight additional PDF reports that are available from ResearchGate. See Project Log for Performance of Raspberry Pi and Android Devices. Early results are included in the benchmark specific reports, identified above. Later reports that include links to download the benchmarks are Raspberry Pi 400 PC 32 Bit and 64 Bit Benchmarks and Stress Tests.pdf and Raspberry Pi 32 Bit and 64 Bit Benchmarks and Stress Tests.pdf. The following MFLOPS comparisons are in the order of Livermore Loops average. Comparison - The three 700 MHz Pi 1 main measurements (Loops, Linpack and Whetstone) were 55, 42 and 94 MFLOPS, with the four gains over Cray 1 being 8.8 times for MHz and 4.6, 1.6, 15.7 times for MFLOPS. The 2020 1800 MHz Pi 400 provided 819, 1147 and 498 MFLOPS, with MHz speed gains of 23 times and 69, 42 and 83 times for MFLOPS. With more advanced SIMD options, the 64 bit compilation produced Cray 1 MFLOPS gains of 78.8, 49.5 and 95.5 times.

The latest versions identify the hardware, automatically running code for ARM or Intel CPUs, under 32 bit or 64 bit Operating Systems. In the early days I obtained lots of results with similar performance, a sample of these being provided below. Comparison - The first results were for tablets that did not have hardware or software to support fast floating point calculations. The earliest with appropriate facilities, from 2012, used the ARM Cortex-A9 processors, starting with 800 Mhz versions. This is indicated as having the three MFLOPS speeds of 20, 11 and 22, or at 10 times Cray 1 CPU MHz, with gains of 1.7, 0.4 and 3.7 in MFLOPS. A later 800 MHz V7-A9 obtained 115, 101 and 155 MFLOPS, or Cray 1 gains of 9.7, 3.7 and 25.8 times. Fastest results provided are for a 2021 mid priced phone with a Kryo 570 CPU, said to be based on ARM Cortex-A77. At 2000 MHz, this obtained an average LLL speed of 1468 MFLOPS, with Linpack at 1986 and 905 for Whetstone and Cray 1 performance gains of 123, 74 and 151 times, at 25 times CPU MHz.

The compiled benchmarks and source codes are all available for download via my PDF reports at ResearchGate. I received numerous results up to 2005. By 2013, my interests became ARM CPUs, with MHz of those from Intel not increasing sufficiently to show real improvements in performance of my single core benchmarks. Then, my 3.9 GHz CPU was close to maximum speed and, in 2021, this appears to have only reached 5.5 GHz, but now with 16 CPU cores. In order to obtain some up to date performance data, I bought a new laptop with a 11th generation Core i5 CPU that runs at a maximum speed of 4.15 GHz. Comparison - Below are samples of results where details for the three benchmarks were available. The first PC to reach the average Cray 1 Livermore Loops score is indicated as a 1994 100 MHz Pentium, shown as 12 MFLOPS, with Linpack and Whetstone at 12 and 16. This gives approximate Cray 1 comparisons of MHz and the three MFLOPS measurements of 1.3, 1.0. 0.44 and 2.6 times. PCs with faster Pentium processors continued to produce performance proportional to CPU MHz, with improvements appearing with the 1995 Pentium Pro. At 200 MHz the three MFLOPS measurements were 34, 49 and 41 and four comparisons 2.5, 2.9, 1.8 and 6.8 times. Next came various Pentium II and III models with improvements to these benchmarks mainly proportional to CPU MHz. Then the 2002 Pentium 4 is show to achieve 187 , 382 and 146 MFLOPS, but at 1700 MHz, producing the four Cray ` comparisons of 21, 16, 14 and 24 times, with decreases in MFLOPS per MHz, compared with earlier Pentiums. With alternative CPU technology, the per MHz ratio improved with a single core of a 1820 MHz 2007 Core 2 processor obtaining 413, 998 and 374 MFLOPS or Cray 1 improvements of 23, 35, 37 and 62 times. The 2010 Core i7 range produced an improvement in MFLOPS per MHz, with the 3900 MHz 2013 model obtaining 1108, 2684 and 716 MFLOPS and comparisons 49, 93, 99 and 119 times. The 2021 laptop with a Core i5 1135G7 CPU provided further gains with a higher MFLOPS per MHz rating for Livermore Loops and Linpack but not much with Whetstone. MFLOPS identified were 1387, 3541 and 802, and Cray 1 comparisons of 117, 131 and 134 times. These results are from running optimised versions of the original Windows Classic Benchmarks livecont.exe, linpcont.exe and whetcont.exe, available in downloadable benchnt.zip.

These employ 128, 256 or 512 bit vector registers simultaneous operating on 4, 8 or 16 single precision (SP) and 2, 4 or 8 double precision (DP) numbers, historically stated as producing maximum SP performance of 4, 8 or 16 MFLOPS per MHz and half those for DP. With 100% fused multiply and add (FMA) type operations these maximum expectations would be doubled. FMA was only available on the Core i5 laptop tested here. It should be noted that using fused operation can result in slightly different accuracy in computed results. The benchmarks report these as errors. See Error Reports. Similar variations were encountered, in the past, using different versions of the compilers. Windows benchmarks, used in this area, were lloops64.exe, linpack64.exe and whetsSSE.exe. These and source code files are included in Windows-Benchmarks.zip . Compared with the earlier results, performance increased to achieve Cray 1 MFLOPS gains of 238, 190 and 182 times. For this area, double precision Whetstone results are also shown to run at the same speed as the single precision version. I have had difficulties in using the latest C compilers for Windows, but a new bootable flash drive for Ubuntu 20.04 provided the compiler, enabling more advanced options to be used under Linux. The new benchmarks were initially compiled on an older PC as it did not seem possible to boot the latest flash drive on my new Core i5 based laptop. For the latter, I installed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in order to compile and run the programs. Linux - The first compilations under Linux were slightly faster than those from Windows. Those used here were compiled on the i5 laptop using the latest gcc 9.3.0 compiler, under Ubuntu. Disassembly code was examined to show that SSE, AVX and AVX-512 instructions were being used, as appropriate. This cannot be guaranteed by relying on compile options. These benchmarks can be downloaded in Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz. The first Linux results, using the AVX SIMD instructions, increased the three i5 Cray 1 gains to 300, 259 and 179 times. AVX-512 hardware was only available on the Core i5 CPU, providing the three MFLOPS gains of 359, 337 and 226 times. The table provides MFLOPS per MHz calculations for Livermore Loops average and maximum results. A major surprise is that the latter for SSE and AVX, of 3.56 and 4.77 were higher than recognised maximum double precision ratios, without FMA, of 2.0 and 4.0. This also applied for SSE for the Core i7 at 3.05. The AVX-512 FMA 47692 MFLOPS ratio of 11.49 suggests significant FMA was being used. See also Faster Than Expected below.

The i5 CPU MHz is 52 times than that for the Cray 1, compared with over 300 times for Livermore Loops and Linpack benchmarks using AVX-512 functions and more than 200 times for Whetstone.

Details of the vector program version are included above. As far as I remember, all these results are from systems using a single scalar CPU, possibly with more than one vector pipeline. Cray was the first manufacturer to produce systems with multiple scalar CPUs but it is not clear if any of the others followed this line in the timescale considered. From the details here, both Cray Y-MP MHz clock speed and scalar MFLOPS are indicated as around twice as fast as Cray 1, with vector MFLOPS four times faster, the system having two vector units. This benchmark is included in Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz and Windows-Benchmarks.zip . Best results, from the next table, for Core i5 and Raspberry Pi 400 are provided, to demonstrate their superiority over 1991 supercomputers. On top of this, the former have multiple cores, with the potential of four time higher throughput or raw performance.

Single and double precision results are provided, where either could be valid, depending on numeric precision requirements. The fastest Whetstone floating point code is not suitable to benefit much from fused multiply and add operation, with one multiply associated with four additions or subtractions. The maximum Core i5 speed of 75.1 GFLOPS is quite impressive. Average i5 Cray 1 MFLOPS gains were 602 and 433 times, for single then double precision calculations. Note that some SP SSE MFLOPS per MHz were again greater than 4.0 and AVX above 8.0 and half these with DP. The Raspberry Pi 400 vector performance was not that good but, as shown above, somewhat faster than the scalar speed.

Here we consider possible implication of using multiple cores, using this benchmark that effectively represents 1, 2, 4 and 8 users concurrently executing the same application, but using different data. Details shown are overall MWIPS ratings, the three MFLOPS measurements, overall harmonic mean MFLOPS, recorded running times, MFLOPS performance gains over the Cray 1 and MFLOPS per MHz ratios for single core activity. Note nominal running time varies due to rough calibration of the number of passes to use. The benchmark is also included in Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz and Windows-Benchmarks.zip . Phenom, Windows 7 - This demonstrates almost perfect speed gains using 1 to 2 and 2 to 4 cores, with no further increase using 8 threads. Core i7 Desktop - This can use 4 cores or 8 independent threads at the same time. This application appeared to demonstrate near best case performance gains using 8 threads. Core i5 Laptop - Performance Monitor indicated that this ran at around 4150 MHz using 1 and 2 threads, but reduced to about 3800 MHz for 4 and 8 threads. Windows vs Linux - Average MFLOPS performance was quite similar, on both the i7 and i5 PCs, at the lower level of optimisation shown here. Single vs Double Precision - Results indicated similar performance, as expected from scalar operation. PC Performance Gains - some of the Core i7 speeds were faster than on the i5. For the latter, eight thread Cray 1 MFLOPS gains were 1521 times. Android Phone - The Kryo 570 CPU has out-of-order execution, maybe responsible for the highest MFLOPS per MHz ratio of 0.42. But maximum performance of the big/LITTLE CPU arrangement, of 2 fast and 6 slow cores, lead to 8 core performance being only 5 times faster than than for 1 core. Still, the Cray 1 gain was 757 times.

Here, a Linux benchmark is used, running SSE and AVX Intel SIMD instructions (in Linux-Benchmarks.tar.xz). Calculations are carried out of the form x[i] = (x[i] + a) * b - (x[i] + c) * d + (x[i] + e) * f with 2, 8 or 32 operations per input data word. In each case, accessing 102400, 1024000 and 10240000 data words, covering caches and RAM. Up to 64 threads can be used, each using a dedicated segment of the data, default being 8 threads. Data is checked for consistent values at the end. Below are measured MFLOPS using 1, 2, 4 and 8 threads for the Core i7 and i5 computers, executing SSE and AVX instructions, plus AVX-512 on the i5. As for MP Whetstones, performance improvements, from doubling the number of threads (MP Gains), are shown to be non-linear for the Core i5 laptop. Single core MFLOPS per MHz ratios are also shown. Maximum single precision expectations, without FMA instructions, are 4 for SSE and 8 for AVX and 16 for AVX-512, then 32 for the latter, where FMA is used. Then double precision operation expectations are half these values. It can be seen that, for both i7 and i5, SSE and AVX MFLOPS/MHz ratios were higher than these. I have been unable to identify the reason for these levels of performance, without FMA type instructions being used. For further information see Faster Than Expected below. AVX-512 MFLOPS per MHz was less than 32, one reason being that all instructions were not of the FMA variety, as shown in code disassemblies, shown below. These indicate that the highest expected speed achievable by the FMA code is just over 76% of maximum with complete FMA instructions, or 24.4 MFLOPS/MHz, close to that obtained. The performance adjustment is also shown to produce a likely reduction in Cray 1 maximum speed to 122 MFLOPS, executing these functions. The maximum Core i5 single precision speed of 325915 MFLOPS indicates a Cray 1 gain of 2671 times. Maximum double precision result, from the next page, was 160641 MFLOPS with a gain of 1317 times. Also single precision results on the next page indicate maximum 8 thread speed on Raspberry Pi of 30150 MFLOPS or Cray 1 gain of 247 times and Android phone at 35686 MFLOPS or gain of 293 times, both at Intel SSE SIMD level.

Calculations below show that performance at 32 operations per word, and other high performing areas, was effectively at half single precision speed, as expected with SIMD. The lower ratios probably reflect half speed double precision calculations and overheads dealing with 64 bit numbers. Single precision results are also included for the 2000 MHz Kryo 570 Android phone and 1800 MHz Raspberry Pi 400. For these, SIMD level used is equivalent to Intel SSE. Worse than MP Whetstone, this time the Kryo 570, using 8 threads, was only three times faster than during the single thread test. Then, a CPU monitoring app indicated that six cores were running at 1804 MHz, with two at 768 MHz.

Using all cores lead to the usual reduction in CPU MHz, but there may have been more throttling to counteract heating effects. Single thread (Geomean) official average speed was 4273 MFLOPS, compared with a per thread average of 3375 here. However, the total throughput of 13500 MFLOPS indicates an increase over Cray 1 of 1134 times. ---------- AVX-512 DP MFLOPS ---------- Thread Maximum Average Geomean Harmean Minimum 1 33413.3 5809.5 3430.8 2293.0 493.7 2 35648.5 5576.5 3275.7 2223.1 552.1 3 35422.7 5953.9 3449.2 2300.6 505.1 4 36895.5 5746.0 3344.4 2190.7 459.4 MP MFLOPS 4 to 64 Threads As indicated earlier, MP MFLOPS benchmark can handle up to 64 threads, with an execution command under LINUX (such as ./MPmflops64AVX512 Threads 64). For correct operation, the specified number must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64. Following are results on the i5 between 4 and 64 threds. These show that performance can be significantly improved using additional threads, the reason is due to data being allocated to a faster lower level cache. 4 Byte Ops/ Repeat MFLOPS Using Number Of Threads Words Word Passes 4 8 16 32 64 102400 2 75000 72164 112210 155132 158133 153968 1024000 2 7500 58968 108429 119118 117709 122011 10240000 2 750 13337 13824 17251 60342 116964 102400 8 75000 142554 210116 253359 270576 275220 1024000 8 7500 144756 212406 233939 236110 242271 10240000 8 750 54170 54988 64520 174245 235583 102400 32 75000 324843 312508 316881 318233 327762 1024000 32 7500 324870 308995 310405 325996 327897 10240000 32 750 182219 204563 243408 301543 322605 Performance Summary below or Go To Start Performance Summary Following is a summary of most results, intended to show best case performance gains, over the Cray 1, for different classes of work. Considering the Core i5 details, the first four are for programs that only use (or are intended to use) a single CPU core. The main one for Cray 1 comparison being Livermore Loops average. Linpack is the only one that provides a single measurement. Whetstones identify relative performance of scalar and vector processing. As for MP benchmarks, vector single and double precision results are provided. The former can be used for comparison with those produced via the long word used by Cray, if the numeric accuracy is acceptable. The MP benchmark results can be used to represent multiple users running the same program or a single program executing multiple threads, each handling a dedicated segment of shared data. Again for the Core i5, MP Whetstone MFLOPS were similar for double and single precision versions, with little opportunity for vectorisation. The simpler Whetstone calculations demonstrate the benefit of hyperthreading with the 4 core, 8 thread throughput being nearly seven times faster than the standalone run. On the other hand, MP MFLOPS suffered from the i5 running at a lower MHz when four cores were being used, leading to 8 thread performance being less than four times faster than via 1 thread. This benchmark identified the highest Cray 1 performance gains of over 2600 times for single precision calculations, but half of this at double precision. On cost/performance grounds, the Raspberry Pi 400 was better than the Core i5 laptop, in some of the early cases, but worse on others, then fell far behind on benchmarks that could benefit from compilation using Intel Advanced Vector instructions. Compared with the Cray 1, MP performance gains of up to 400 times were recorded. Just considering performance of the Android phone, the more advanced ARM CPU used provided some significant gains over the Raspberry Pi, but lost the advantage, due to the big/LITTLE architecture, on running the MP MFLOPS 8 thread test. Still, best Cray 1 performance gain was 757 times through using multiple cores.

It is useful to consider apparent more powerful processors. CPU MHz - In a given processing architecture, performance is usually proportional to CPU MHz. This was clear in earlier times, when Pentium, Celeron and Xeon processors had the same core processor. The above benchmarks were run on a Core i5 with maximum turbo speed of 4150 MHz and an ARM CPU at 2000 MHz. The latest 2022 processors appear to be rated at up to 5500 MHz for PCs and 3000 MHz for ARM based phones. These would affect the single core benchmarks but not excessively. Multiple Cores - At least for the laptop and phone used here, full benefits of multiple cores were not apparent. The laptop switched to a lower MHz and the phone’s 8 core big/LITTLE processor maximum performance became not much better than the 4 core Raspberry Pi. Performance appears to be becoming even more unpredictable. The latest (that I have seen) - Intel 24 threads over 16 cores, 8 at up to 5.1 GHz and 8 to 3.8 GHz.Then ARM that has cores 1 at 3200 MHz, 3 at 2420 MHz and 4 at 1800 MHz. More Advanced CPU Options - Some CPUs in the Core range have two 512-bit fused-multiply add (FMA) units that can, potentially, double SIMD performance of the right sort of application. Judging by the improvement in adopting a higher level of SIMD here and consideration of heating effects, I would not bet on it. Disassembled Code Next or Go To Start Disassembled Code Disassembled code compiled to use AVX-512 and AVX instructions are listed below. The former includes vector fused multiply and add or subtract instructions. With AVX-512 there are 21 arithmetic vector instructions and the expected 32 with AVX, the latter also applying for SSE code. Minimum instructions for full fused multiply and add type is 16, leading to a (16/21) 76.19% reduction in achievable speed. This would lead the maximum Cray 1 MFLOPS for this code becoming 122, instead of 160.

These include the final numeric results, whose values are included in the program and can vary slightly, depending on the hardware and compiler options. The values under OK indicate accuracy in terms of the number of decimal places, double precision numbers being said to be accurate up to 16 decimal places, but possibly subject to rounding errors. As indicated, there were differences in numeric results from the Core i5 laptop, with accuracy reducing from 15 or 16 decimal places to 12 or 13, using the AVX512 compile option. Apparently, there is only one rounding for fused operations, as opposed to one for each separate instruction. Kernel Floating Pt ops No Passes E No Total Secs.

The other benchmark considered is the naturally double precision Livermore Loops. In both cases, disassembled code was checked to ensure that there were no Fused Multiply and Add (FMA) type instructions. Then, according to viewed documentation, maximum performance using SSE functions is 2.0 MFLOPS per MHz, using 128-bit xmm registers, and 4.0 using 256-bit AVX with ymm registers. Below, the Livermore Loops example shows the full displayed output for the kernel producing maximum MFLOPS, the source code with 16 floating point operations and compile commands used. The SSE example indicates 3.56 MFLOPS per MHz, thought to be impossible without FMA. The AVX results provide 4.86 MFLOPS per MHz 21.5% higher than expected maximum. The same range of results, source code and compile options are provided for MP MFLOPS benchmark these combinations of instructions., running via a single thread. Looking at the first word size details, least likely to involve RAM data transfers, SSE 12437 to 16602 MFLOPS equates to 3.00 to 4.00 per MHz and AVX 14606 to 32420 MFLOPS at 3.53 to 7.81 per MHz. These ranges include Livermore Loops ratios, but the larger ones are higher than might be expected using FMA, with the particular combination of instructions shown.

Groves, the Director of the Manhattan Project, pressured the wives of Los Alamos to work because he felt that it was a waste of resources to accommodate civilians. As told by Kay Manley, the wife of Los Alamos physicist John Manley, the recruitment of wives can also be traced to a desire to limit the housing of “any more people than was absolutely necessary.” This reason makes sense given the secretive nature of Los Alamos and the Manhattan Project.

A processor of personal data must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, how long data is being retained, and if it is being shared with any third-parties or outside of the EU. I haven't been notified by Santa or his elves that he is collecting data about me. And mind you: my name and surname are my personal data, not to mention whether I have been good or naughty. Moreover, Santa also needs my full address to deliver my presents, and again, that is also my personal data. Santa hasn't notified me whether he is updating his Privacy Policy, so I assume that Santa stopped collecting this data, at least for Europeans. Does it mean that Santa is delivering me nothing this Christmas? If there is any way around this, can you please tell me what it is and how Santa can deliver me presents while still being compliant with the GDPR? Please assume I haven't been naughty. internal-consistency santa-claus Share Improve this question Follow Follow this question to receive notifications edited Nov 11, 2020 at 21:47 yeah22 12333 bronze badges asked Jun 4, 2018 at 13:54 Pavel JanicekPavel Janicek 45.3k2828 gold badges142142 silver badges227227 bronze badges $\\endgroup$ 24 209 $\\begingroup$ Santa's naughty list is clearly exempt from the GDPR, which does not apply to data processed \"by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties...\" $\\endgroup$ – Mike Scott Jun 4, 2018 at 14:07 39 $\\begingroup$ @MikeScott, he judges based on morality, not law, being rude to your parents isn't criminal but it does put you on the naughty list, no exemption there. $\\endgroup$ – Separatrix Jun 4, 2018 at 14:30 62 $\\begingroup$ Thanks so much to everyone who has contributed to this I really really needed something uplifting today and this has hit the spot beautifully. $\\endgroup$ – Ash Jun 4, 2018 at 15:23 98 $\\begingroup$ I think that, if Santa was caught, breaking and entering would be higher up on the list of things he was arrested for than violating GDPR rules. $\\endgroup$ – Lio Elbammalf Jun 4, 2018 at 17:37 40 $\\begingroup$ You have been warned that \"This incident will be reported\". xkcd.com/838 The xkcd is considered proper notice and your usage of sudo is clear consent. $\\endgroup$ – Nemo Jun 4, 2018 at 20:14Show 19 more comments 19 Answers Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) This answer is useful 629 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

The nature of his data collection is more transparent than most companies, and he is open to updating his records if you contact one of his representatives. For example, he makes it clear that he is operating in your town: You better watch out You better not cry Better not pout I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town The legitimate business purpose of his data collection is to create a list of those who are naughty and nice this year: He's making a list And checking it twice; Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice Santa Claus is coming to town He even gives some examples of what data he's collecting: He sees you when you're sleeping He knows when you're awake He knows if you've been bad or good So be good for goodness sake! The GDPR has some other requirements to it, such as an EU-based representative being necessary for operating in the EU, allowing users to request data updates, and getting consent for data collected. Thankfully for Santa, he's been operating compliant representative systems for decades: Just go to any mall during the holiday season to meet with a representative. To ensure open and accurate records, the representative will ask the child if they've been naughty or nice that year and what type of present they want. As long as the child's parent/legal guardian is nearby to confirm the data change requests, Santa will be happy to update his database to ensure the naughty/nice data is accurate and that the requested presents are delivered. As for consent, the children are obviously too young to provide consent and must rely on their parent/guardian to consent to Santa's data collection. I doubt there's a single house that is receiving presents from Santa without the parent's explicit consent, and I'm sure we've all been told by our parents at some point to \"be good or Santa won't give you presents this year!\".

As you can see here he is covered by exemption: The new Regulation will maintain the existing exemption which allows churches and other bodies with a 'religious... aim' to process sensitive data: 'in the course of its legitimate activities...'; '...with appropriate safeguards'; '...on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes'; and on condition that 'the data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subject'. As no one ever saw his lists, and we don't know about any other activities, we can safely assume above bullets are met.

Easter Bunny doesn't care if you naughty or nice, and could provide Santa with a slightly updated address field and total regional numbers. They are from the same religious organisation (albeit different departments), but the data was collected under different \"given purposes\".

There are actually six legal bases for holding data (you have to scroll down a little as the link doesn't work properly). Those six bases are: Consent Contract Legal obligation Vital interests Public task Legitimate interests So let's look at each of them and see if Santa has any basis for collecting our information. Consent - Actually this one may not even be as troublesome as it first seems. Presumably we're all writing letters to Santa asking for presents, this could potentially be seen as a form of consent for collecting our data, though I think that's a little iffy. Contract - The letter to Santa could also form the basis for a contract for the provision of services (present delivery), so I think this works. Legal Obligation - Unless you want to argue that Santa is legally obligated to perform his duties I don't think this one works. Vital Interests - No one is going to die if Santa doesn't do his job, probably doesn't work either. Public Task - I think this is a strong contender. From the website I linked above; \"the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.\" I would say the worldwide provision of joy and happiness is in the public interest, and the processing of our information is definitely required for Santa's official functions. Legitimate Interests - This is a little of a grey area and many businesses have used it as the basis for continuing to hold and process information, I see no reason why Santa couldn't do the same. So in short, there is no real issue at all and Santa can continue doing what he needs to do as long as he properly deals with our information and updates his privacy policies.

If Santa doesn't hold your data you don't get a present, and you want your present don't you? $\\endgroup$ – Separatrix Jun 4, 2018 at 14:31 3 $\\begingroup$ If we take the official UK interpration of GDPR (easier to understand for us non-lawyers) we find regarding legitimate interests: \"It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people’s data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.\". The collection by santa of everything good and bad you do has a HUGE privacy impact and straight up rules legitimate interest out. $\\endgroup$ – David Mulder Jun 4, 2018 at 15:51 1 $\\begingroup$ And Public Task requires it to be set out in law, so that one is out as well. $\\endgroup$ – David Mulder Jun 4, 2018 at 15:53 2 $\\begingroup$ Vital Interests can be covered.

Everyone will be required to send their address, name and age. You will also have to allow your parents to send Santa the data about you being nice or naughty. In case you don't want to disclose the naughty-or-nice information you will receive a generic probably-not-that-naughty present, which will most likely consist of old chocolate he found lying around in the elven workshops. Be careful to send your data as fast as you can. It will be harder to get into contact with Santa after the timeframe he had allocated for everyone to send in their address, name and age. If you don't send that information you will receive nothing because Santa is not allowed to use your address any longer. If he still sends you something you can sue him - and thereby make sure that lots of children will cry because they won't get any presents after the EU is done with Santa. Good job, now it's clear on which list you are... There is also talk about Santa cooperating with the Easter Bunny in 2019 for a late present delivery.

For years, he has been punishing kids and breaking into houses; despite attempts from kids and governments, he has never been caught. He doesn't have an aviator's license or a landing permit for his sled, while flying very close to houses and otherwise endangering people. Though, if you put him to a D&D scale, he may be chaotic good, he is nonetheless chaotic: he breaks the law to reach his goals. I'm certain he doesn't pay VAT on his gifts. Also, the working conditions of his elves are questionable. But it's the same with every other criminal: As long they can't catch him, he will continue.

He is not bound by GDPR. an entity or more precisely an \"enterprise\" has to be engaged in \"economic activity\" to be covered by the GDPR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation What qualifies as \"economic activity\"? I'm glad you asked: ... the Court determins that an activity is economic on the basis of two criteria of agreement and renumeration (from https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789462651166-c2.pdf ) I do not agree with other posts that the recipients of the gifts agree (in the legal sense, nor in any sense that would stand up in court). I am not aware of any way a person can \"agree\" to be the recipient of gifts from Santa (there are obvious ways to object, of course). Santa Clause also does not seem to meet the criteria for remuneration. He brings \"gifts\" or \"presents\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus); \"A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or return\" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift In many cultures, something that may be considered payment is left for Santa (e.g. milk & cookies in the US & Canada; sherry or beer and mince pies in Britain & Australia; rice porridge in Denmark, Norway & Sweden); however, I can find no source that indicates that failing to leave these items will result in suspension of gifts. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus Also: 'enterprise' means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity. As far as I can tell, Santa Clause is neither a natural nor legal person. Human Beings \"acquire legal personhood when they are born (or even before...\", juridical persons \"acquire legal personhood when they are incorporated\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person). I am not aware of Santa Clause having been born, nor incorporated. Addendum: There was a question if \"being nice\" qualifies as remuneration. I would argue against this for the following reasons: If an item is traded for remuneration, it is, by definition, not a present. The items are clearly declared as presents. Santa is not the recipient of the \"niceness\" (in almost all cases). Although it is clearly document in \"Santa Claus is coming to town\", (H. Gillespie et al.) that \"he's going to find out who's been naughty or nice\", \"He knows when you've been bad or good\" and \"He's making a list\", there is nothing in this thesis that claims that this list affects the presents. Wikipedia claims it does, but none of the sources it cites (that I checked) back this up. Does anybody know of a reasonable source for this, or is it just an urban myth? Does anybody know of a child that has not received a present, because they were naughty?

Show activity on this post. $\\begingroup$ IANAL but here is my take of things. In a nuthsell, GPDR requires any businesses/organizations/pineapples that have users in the European Union to: Disclose what they do with the info they have on you, and why they need it; Disclose with whom they share that information, and what those other businesses/organizations/pineapples do with it; Allow you to order them to \"forget\" you. Once you give them the order, they (and their partners) have to delete all your data that can be used to identify you. All within limits of reasonability, of course. You can't order the government or a bank to forget that you have not paid your credit card bill and your income tax in months, for example. Santa has to adhere to the GDPR only for some europeans. For starters, many european countries are not members of the EU, such as Norway and Serbia. Santa Claus also does not operate in Italy. What would most probably happen is that the elves in charge of Santa's legal department will have sent every parent or legal guardian in the 28 (soon to be 27) member states a letter around May 25 stating that: They collect personal data from their children in order to assess a naughtiness score; They are the keepers of the data. The processors of the data are Tencent and Alibaba, two chinese companies that specialize in social credit systems; The legal guardian or parent may choose to opt-out of the system at any time, if they so wish. They may also request their children's personal data removed from the system at any moment, no questions asked; However, opting out means their kids will never receive christmas presents again, at least until they join the program once more. Gifts not received due to non-participation will not be resent when they rejoin; Participation does not imply in presents. Should a child receive a low reputation score due to naughty actions, they may instead receive a lump of coal, a visit from Krampus, or whatever punishment is seen as fit for the culture of the country where they live. Adults capable of having children will also receive a notice that in the future, they will have to manually input any future children's data in the system if they wish to receive christmas presents. Of course, people who have opted out of any social credit system will not receive such messages. Finally, Santa will not be the only one sending such letters. So will every imaginary folklore people who bring any joy to kids: The tooth fairy (and her rat affiliates in France) will promise that any data linking fallen teeth to their owners is anonymized; Sandman will make sure that parents/legal guardians dream with his new EULA ASAP. Their children will not have sweet dreams until their parents agree to it. Should they opt out, their children will have neither dreams not nightmares. When winter comes, rather than patterns on windows, people will see Jack Frost new service terms, and a couple of ice buttons for opt-in and opt-out; The Easter Bunny is the only one having an easy time. AFAIK in Europe he does not hide chocolate eggs for kids to look for - rather, people paint actual eggs and give those as presents. He will provide an easy opt out for people who don't want to pay him his royalties.

This is similar to the implied consent between a patient and a healthcare provider. Santa will use the data for the purposes of direct gift-giving, without breaching confidentiality. If you would like to remove your data, or would like to access your data to see if you are considered naughty or nice, you will have to write another letter to Santa. Santa will have 30 days to respond to your request. If this is in terms of working days, you should expect a reply by 2048.

Besides, EU has no courts at the North Pole, and no extradition treaty. So it will be hard to collect that penalty of €0.

Children in our world who believe that Santa exists have identical copies in worlds where Santa does exist. If we give them a present and tell that it's from Santa and they believe that to be true, then what we have here is the exact copy of the child who really got that exact same present from Santa. The moment the child finds out that Santa does not exist, the child diverges from his/her copies in the worlds where Santa does exist.

Actually, and thanks to the lobbying of elves and little people, the legislature has come with that clever explanation to hide its real meaning: Gift Donors Privacy Relieved. Santa, together with other Gift Donors, such as the Tooth Fairy, is exempted from observing the privacy of his \"customers\" to better serve their interest.

If you are under 13, then the GDPR allows your parents to consent on your behalf, so if they have done so, you likely will receive presents. Between 13 and 16 it depends on the jurisdiction.

In fact, even under GDPR, no one is obliged to call everyone whose number they have in their head. So personal memories are very clearly exempt from the \"any collection of data\" clause. Furthermore, Santa is not in any way a commercial entity and doesn't act commercially. To project our usual human assumptions about our economic system onto a being like Santa is flawed reasoning.

How GDPR impacts countries outside of the EU is another question altogether, and is certainly a grey area legally because how would the EU enforce it's laws over that of another sovereign nation state or a company located in another country? They could certain legislate some absurd law (sounds like great grounds for a story) but then how can they enforce against a man who travels faster than the speed of light and can disappear down small chimneys? I'd love to see some lawyers try to serve notice to the man in red in the North pole. A full arctic expedition just to serve some legal documents. On a legal technicality, GDPR allows for data to be retained where it's needed to provide a service - in this case, knowing the address and whether they're children who meet the eligibility criteria (asleep, good) for present delivery is fundamental. Although, if he's bound to GDPR, then he's probably also bound to anti-discrimination laws regarding good and bad kids.

Once he understood where our law-addicted society was headed, he instructed his huge apparatus of elven servants to foster the belief that he didn’t exist. This strategy has been so successful, that no member of the EU executive dares taking action against him, for they would be branded as crazy and sent to uncomfortable places. In fact last year around Christmas I saw something big and distinctly sledge-like in the sky. I was naive enough to point it out, but when I heard someone at the table mutter „97, hampf, dampf, retirement home“, I started giggling and pretending to be drunk...

The elves would self-organize into groups by cities and would then label themselves with their city region that they have memorized. Santa can then have easy access to the data without violating any GDPR restrictions. I'm not a GDPR expert but I can't imagine it prohibiting people (or elves) from remembering personal information. To stop Santa from using this loophole I guess the next move for GDPR is to prohibit systematic memorization of personal information. But until then Santa is likely to be wanting an AI for predicting which presents that are going to be popular next year so that he can get his elves producing them already. We better stop him before he attempts to do this because it will require quite a few elves in some really ridiculous jobs. Although it would be a really impressive setup of elves!

The other entity is legally allowed to process said child&#x27;s data to provide the service they agreed upon.Kids that have not sent a letter to Santa and are not mentioned in sanction lists, can still get gifts but Santa lacks profiling metadata and can only provide generic, unprofiled gifts.

    "originBody": "Science America Lost Its One Perfect Tree Lumber, shelter, delicious nuts—there was nothing the American chestnut couldn’t provide. By Katherine J. Wu Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Millennium Images / Gallery Stock; Bettmann/Getty December 24, 2023, 8 AM ET Share Saved StoriesSave Across the Northeast, forests are haunted by the ghosts of American giants. A little more than a century ago, these woods brimmed with American chestnuts—stately Goliaths that could grow as high as 130 feet tall and more than 10 feet wide. Nicknamed “the redwoods of the East,” some 4 billion American chestnuts dotted the United States’ eastern flank, stretching from the misty coasts of Maine down into the thick humidity of Appalachia. The American chestnut was, as the writer Susan Freinkel noted in her 2009 book, “a perfect tree.” Its wood housed birds and mammals; its leaves infused the soil with minerals; its flowers sated honeybees that would ferry pollen out to nearby trees. In the autumn, its branches would bend under the weight of nubby grape-size nuts. When they dropped to the forest floor, they’d nourish raccoons, bears, turkey, and deer. For generations, Indigenous people feasted on the nuts, split the wood for kindling, and laced the leaves into their medicine. Later on, European settlers, too, introduced the nuts into their recipes and orchards, and eventually learned to incorporate the trees’ sturdy, rot-resistant wood into fence posts, telephone poles, and railroad ties. The chestnut became a tree that could shepherd people “from cradle to grave,” Patrícia Fernandes, the assistant director of the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, told me. It made up the cribs that newborn babies were placed into; it shored up the coffins that bodies were laid to rest inside. But in modern American life, chestnuts are almost entirely absent. In the first half of the 20th century, a fungal disease called blight, inadvertently imported from Asia on trade ships, wiped out nearly all of the trees. Chestnut wood disappeared from newly made furniture; people forgot the taste of the fruits, save those imported from abroad. Subsistence farmers lost their entire livelihoods. After reigning over forests for millennia, the species went functionally extinct—a loss that a biologist once declared “the greatest ecological disaster in North America since the Ice Age.” Most of the people who lived during the American chestnut heyday are gone. But the nutty world they lived in could yet make a comeback. For decades, a small cohort of volunteers and scientists—many of them the children and grandchildren of chestnut growers long gone—has been working to return the American chestnut to its native range. It’s a quest that’s partly about salvaging biodiversity and partly a mea culpa. “The hope is that you can fix something that we as humans broke,” says Kendra Collins, the American Chestnut Foundation’s director of regional programs in New England. If restoration is successful, it’ll bring back a tree unlike any other—versatile, practical, nourishing, uniquely American. From the December 1874 issue: Old trees For all of its woes, the American chestnut isn’t technically rare: An estimated 430 million of the trees can still be found in the forests of the American East. But more than 80 percent of these trees never grow past an inch or so in diameter, Sara Fitzsimmons, the American Chestnut Foundation’s chief conservation officer, told me. Blight infiltrates cracks in the bark, essentially girdling the stem until it starves; the roots below can survive to resprout but seldom live long enough to reproduce. Locked into an endless cycle of adolescence, death, and rebirth, the plant can no longer sustain the ecological functions it once did. When the tree went into decline, at least a few animal species that depended on it did too—among them, the American chestnut moth and the Allegheny woodrat, both of which, under additional pressure from deforestation and human encroachment, were driven to near extinction. Reinstating the American chestnut’s former glory won’t be easy. Blight is now entrenched in North America, impossible to eradicate; the best hope for the trees is to imbue them with pathogen tolerance. Decades ago, that plan seemed simple: All American breeders would need to do, the thinking went, was cross the American species with their naturally more blight-resistant Chinese cousins a few times over, making it possible to pull off “the biggest restoration in history” in as little as two decades, says Brian Clark, the vice president of orchard development for the American Chestnut Foundation’s Massachusetts/Rhode Island chapter. But in recent years, researchers have discovered that the blight resistance is scattered across “just about every chromosome” in the Chinese chestnut genome, Collins told me, making it difficult to reliably breed the trait into mixed-lineage trees. Forty years into its tenure, the foundation has successfully bred a relatively blight-resistant cultivar whose genome is roughly 5 percent Chinese. But the process of producing the trees is a lot more of a pain than researchers hoped. Read: A new chestnut Other chestnut enthusiasts have instead hung their hopes on a transgenic tree known as Darling 58, developed by a team of scientists at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Its genome is entirely American chestnut, save for a single gene, borrowed from wheat, that can help the plant neutralize one of the blight’s most toxic weapons. But with only a single genetic shield against the fungus, “I suspect blight will eventually evolve around” the borrowed gene, says Yvonne Federowicz, the past president of the American Chestnut Foundation’s Massachusetts/Rhode Island chapter. The lineage’s resilience against blight has already been spotty—to the point that the American Chestnut Foundation recently withdrew its support for Darling 58. (The ESF team that designed the Darling trees, meanwhile, stands by them.) And some Indigenous communities have expressed skepticism about introducing GMOs into the chestnut-restoration fight; in 2019, two members of the Foundation’s MA/RI chapter—one of them the chapter’s president—announced their resignation in protest of the organization’s support for transgenic trees. Regardless of which American-chestnut strains remain in contention, Fitzsimmons told me, restoration could take centuries. Some 100 million acres of suitable chestnut habitat, she said, are waiting to be filled in the United States—no sole solution will likely be enough on its own. But maybe that’s fitting for a tree that refuses to relegate itself to a single purpose. “There are other trees that can produce bigger crops in a given year, or maybe grow taller, or can be more dense, or make more valuable lumber,” Andrew Newhouse, the director of ESF’s American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project, told me. “But not all in the same tree.” The American chestnut is, to our forests and our livelihoods, irreplaceable: “There aren’t really any modern equivalents.” Read: The fading meaning of ‘GMO’ Chestnuts of any variety are also absolutely delicious—phenomenal plain, roasted, or even raw, thanks to their sweet-savory flavor and starchy texture reminiscent of a baked sweet potato. Japanese speakers often describe them as hoku hoku—hot, fluffy, and flaky, a sensation that’s like a cozy balm on chilly, wintry days, Namiko Hirasawa Chen, the chef behind the food blog Just One Cookbook, told me. In Europe and Asia, where other species of the trees still thrive, days-long festivals have been dedicated to eating chestnuts. Here, though, chestnuts are largely forgotten, save for in nostalgic Christmas songs. But some people remember. Earlier this month, I drove to Central Massachusetts to attend the American Chestnut Foundation’s MA/RI chapter’s annual meeting, where board members and volunteers had prepared a stunning potluck. Among the tastiest dishes were a creamy chestnut stew, a turkey-chestnut chili, and a cabbage-and-sausage dish studded with chestnuts. Best of all were two desserts: flaky chestnut oat bars that melted like pie crust in my mouth and a luxurious chestnut ice cream that made me forget my lactose intolerance. As far as I can tell, no one seemed to have bothered cooking with American chestnuts; they’re the smallest of the varieties—some as teeny as chickpeas—and not efficient to work with. But at the close of the meeting, a local grower, Mark Meehl, handed me a bag of Americans from his Massachusetts orchards. The next evening, I scored them, parboiled them, and roasted them next to some gargantuan Europeans, easily six times their size. It was, admittedly, a lot of work. But it made each nut precious, almost like a hard-won prize. From the August 1897 issue: John Muir’s case for saving American forests When I pried the Americans open, I found them to be consistently sweeter, crunchier, and, well, nuttier than their European counterparts. And although several of the European chestnuts—imported from Italy—appeared to have rotted during their long journey to my oven, every American nut was fresh. Not a single one of them had traveled more than 50 miles from its source. I scarfed all 10 of them down, and only wished I could have strolled into the woods near my house to gather up some more.",

There are European&#x2F;Asian crosses that are more resistant, but they don&#x27;t seem to be widely grown here.

In stores in the US, chestnuts always pop up around Thanksgiving or Christmas and are absent the rest of the year. reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparentConsumer preference around food is largely steeped in tradition – i.e. people generally eat what they grew up eating. It is quite possible that a tradition was lost over the generations due to the species decline. In other words, the grocery store might be full of them today if they had remained abundant.That said, chestnut trees were only ever common in the depths of Southern Ontario. And a quick search suggests that some grocery stores in that region do carry chestnuts, so it seems the tradition has remained alive to some degree. reply octopoc 15 hours agoprev [–] > In the first half of the 20th century, a fungal disease called blight, inadvertently imported from Asia on trade ships, wiped out nearly all of the trees.Global trade is destroying biodiversity across the entire planet.

European hazelnuts are typically used in agriculture (for multiple good reasons) however these are basically wiped out by EFB without constant copper sprays, as they never evolved with the arms race against this pathogen. While I hear about it a lot here in Oregon, where we have a lot of European hazelnut variety orchards, I never hear much about what it’s doing in say England, or Turkey.Incidentally, while an EFB resistant series of hazelnut cultivars was developed in response by Oregon State University, containing the Gasaway gene, there is now version of EFB that can fully overcome that resistance and is rapidly spreading here in Oregon, though it’s likely on the east coast as well.OSU is working on new resistant varieties, but nothing will be released until there are multiple modes of resistance (at least 3), otherwise a new EFB strain will just get selected for again. reply nkurz 8 hours agorootparentRather than trying to create EFB resistant European varieties (Corylus avellana), another approach is to concentrate on developing naturally-resistant American varieties (Corylus americana) with larger nuts. Since these varieties are also more cold tolerant, the hope is that this will allow a hazelnut industry in the North East.

Of course most invasive species would come from Asia, because there was already free-flowing contact between North and South America, and there was already hundreds of years of contact between Europe and the Americas. East Asia was the place that was isolated from the Americas for the longest period of time.I think a more interesting question is what kinds of organisms are treated as highly problematic invasive species in Asia from the Americas. That is, shouldn&#x27;t we expect Asian species to be susceptible to novel American pathogens?For example, it&#x27;s famously known that diseases like small pox wiped out many Native American populations because they had no previous exposure to the disease. Perhaps less known is that it&#x27;s widely hypothesized that a virulent strain of syphilis wrecked havoc in Europe after being brought back by sailors fro the Americas. reply brink 15 hours agorootparentAsia is not the only continent that&#x27;s not connected by land with America. reply hn_throwaway_99 11 hours agorootparentObviously not.

There was also an element of nostalgia in the desire of European colonists to see familiar species.[13] An Australian settler, J. Martin, complained in 1830 that the \"trees retained their leaves and shed their bark instead, the swans were black, the eagles white, the bees were stingless, some mammals had pockets, others laid eggs, it was warmest on the hills...\" It was there that the desire to make the land feel more like England was strongest.For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eugene_Schieffelin> Eugene Schieffelin ... became chairman of the American Acclimatization Society and joined their efforts to introduce non-native species to North America for economic and cultural reasons. His 1890 release of European starlings in Central Park resulted in the first successful starling nesting in North America to be observed by naturalists.Here&#x27;s more about his organization, from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Acclimatization_Socie...> In 1864 the commissioners of Central Park had introduced Java sparrows, house sparrows, chaffinches and blackbirds into the park. The European sparrows were reported to have \"multiplied amazingly\". They quickly became one of the most common birds in New York, though the others did not seem to do as well. After the society&#x27;s founding, such efforts were redoubled. The group&#x27;s annual meeting held at the Great New York Aquarium in 1877[4] reported that the release of 50 pairs of English skylarks into Central Park had only been a partial success, since most had flown across the East River to take up residence at Newtown and Canarsie in Brooklyn. At the meeting, the recent release of European starlings, Japanese finches and pheasants into the park were noted. The meeting adjourned with the group resolved to introduce more chaffinches, skylarks, European robins and tits—\"birds which were useful to the farmer and contributed to the beauty of the groves and fields\"—in the city.[5] reply poulpy123 15 hours agorootparentprevThe potato blight of the Irish famine came from south America, and the phylloxera that destroyed the french wine at the beginning of the 20th century came from north America. reply Amezarak 14 hours agorootparentPotatoes themselves came from South America, so I don&#x27;t know if that should really count. reply h4l 14 hours agorootparentprevIn the UK our native squirrels are red, but they&#x27;re almost extinct because North American grey squirrels out-compete them. reply qup 10 hours agorootparentWe have some native red squirrels in parts of America, too.

Well, because his post lacked candor about him becoming YC chairman:\"To smooth his exit, Altman proposed he move from president to chairman. He pre-emptively published a blog post on the firm’s website announcing the change. But the firm’s partnership had never agreed, and the announcement was later scrubbed from the post.\" reply natdempk 12 hours agoparent> In early October, OpenAI’s chief scientist approached some fellow board members to recommend Altman be fired, citing roughly 20 examples of when he believed Altman misled OpenAI executives over the years.I also thought this was interesting, not sure if this detail had been reported before this article, but seems like there were maybe more incidents than initially thought. reply gwern 12 hours agorootparentThere had been two incidents reported: Sutskever seeing in Slack from other OA execs that the attempt to fire Toner was not over the paper but over her EA ties, and McCauley (apparently) being told by Altman that another board member wanted to fire Toner over the paper.This list of 20 examples is new, albeit unsurprising given that there was no reason to think that there were only 2 incidents, and I highlight it in my longer commentary: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;KXHMCH7wCxrvKsJyn&#x2F;openai-fac... reply hutzlibu 14 hours agoparentprevAlso this other bit was news to me:\"Graham said it was his wife’s doing. “If anyone ‘fired’ Sam, it was Jessica, not me,” he said. “But it would be wrong to use the word ‘fired’ because he agreed immediately.” \" reply bmitc 14 hours agorootparentWhy are these people so sycophantic, especially to such an inexperienced person? reply AndrewKemendo 10 hours agorootparentThe dirty truth is that the ideal Silicon Valley CEO is whomever can be a perfect sockpuppet for investors and still understand technical velocity.The more ability you have to be kind of waterproof so to speak - like a duck - because of a mixture of positioning, ruthlessness, access, intelligence, perseverance, etc the better you are. Most importantly you have to regularly show allegiance to specifically investors over all other considerations, and boom you’re perfectly crafted.Altman has brilliantly positioned himself as that perfect fulcrum between venture and technical skills such that he is (in his own mind and to a tiny subset of incredibly powerful people in SV) indispensable to the silicon valley crowd who doesn’t really know how to navigate the intersection between venture and technical skills. reply queuebert 12 hours agorootparentprevHe&#x27;s surrounded by VCs with confirmation bias. reply hutzlibu 14 hours agorootparentprev\"“I saw in a 19-year-old Sam Altman the same thing that I see now: an intensely focused and brilliant person whom I was willing to bet big on,” said Chung, now managing general partner of Xfund, a venture-capital firm.\"They believe in his focus to get things done, not in his ethics.

He is at the center of the stage and many powerful people and organizations trust on him beyond the \"anecdotes\". He will gain more power while he is an amplifier of capital and business opportunities. For an investor point of view he is a business ace and you just need to be careful about partnering with him because he will always be pursuing new opportunities, even ones that eat part of the company you invested in. reply akira2501 12 hours agoparentYou can literally just buy articles like this. The question that could be asked is the long term ROI here actually going to be worth it for Sam?The article talks about his \"luck\" in \"surviving.\" Which is about all he has, apparently. No consideration for the future of the product, the company, or the industry. The triumphant conclusion of this article is \"a bunch of CEOs pulled weight and Altman got his old job back, again.\"The more of these I read, the more convinced I am that his company is going nowhere, as they seem more skilled at producing \"internal drama\" than \"new product.\" reply wslh 12 hours agorootparent> The question that could be asked is the long term ROI here actually going to be worth it for Sam?Don&#x27;t you think most entrepreneurs would call Sam if they have a chance? reply akira2501 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think being overly connected to the \"silicon valley social graph\" is particularly useful.

And of course: \"I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israel Defense Forces, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.\" - that aged well.But he&#x27;s now in a position where all his failures will be forgotten and his successes amplified forevermore (unless he buys a social media company, but he seems too smart for that so far). It is clear he has reached Jeff Dean levels of ridiculous hagiography though, but I guess worshipping CEOs is a step up from worshipping invisible friends or stinky geriatric ex-presidents so there&#x27;s that. reply Vecr 8 hours agorootparentGetting IDF gas masks is not a sign he really knows what he&#x27;s doing, why not MSA or Avon Rubber? reply wslh 13 hours agorootparentprevYour answer is very rude.

But people who do big things, by definition, have to get there by pushing things along at a cadence that differs from most other people. I&#x27;m not necessarily saying it&#x27;s a good thing, but I don&#x27;t get why every article about Sam seems to be surprised that the guy who helped build something nobody thought was possible (AI this decade) got there by doing things in a fast, unique way.If he followed the norms, he&#x27;d be a mid-level manager at FAANG company. reply Apreche 14 hours agoparentMy question is, what do you count as \"doing\"?Imagine I win the lottery and hire really smart architects and tell them to make a revolutionary new building. They go on to make some amazing building that gets all sorts of awards and recognition. Is anyone really so naive as to suggest that I am deserving of any credit whatsoever? In the words of Urkel, \"Did I do that?\"There are some leaders in the tech world who have clearly done something. John Carmack did something. Steve Wozniak did something. There are some questionable cases as well. As far as Altman goes, I put him firmly in the same camp as Musk. They haven&#x27;t done jack shit. I give them no respect, recognition, or credit. They were just wealthy people spending money. I seriously question the people who look at them positively in any way whatsoever. reply gkoberger 14 hours agorootparentI don’t think you need to like the people you listed (I, for example, hate Musk). But you seem to have no curiosity around understanding the value non-technical people can bring to a project or company or innovation.You need both to do something great. And there’s thousands of Woz’s out there whose names we don’t know because they never met their Jobs. reply lacrimacida 14 hours agorootparentBut even all Wozzes out there who met their Jobs are still relegated to just Wozzes, all credit being vaccumed up by their respective Jobs. Not saying that their Jobs don’t deserve any the credit, i’m just pointing out the unfair pattern of how all the credit is being vaccumed up. One clearly needs the other but it doesn’t look like a two way street at all. reply adventured 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not unfair in the case of Jobs & Woz. Wozniak represented a few years of Apple&#x27;s earliest history. His contribution was similar to Paul Allen&#x27;s contribution to Microsoft. Extraordinarily important in the first few years, and that was the end of that. The reality is, people broadly like Woz, and particularly among the HN crowd Steve Jobs is disliked; that&#x27;s the explanation, it&#x27;s purely emotional; so they want to give Woz more credit than he deserves.There&#x27;s an obsession with trying to discredit people like Jobs (and their contributions), particularly among the hacker news crowd. Fundamentally it&#x27;s because most hackers don&#x27;t understand leadership, marketing, sales, etc.In this thread you&#x27;ll see people claim Elon Musk is non-technical. That&#x27;s bordering on belligerent. A person would have to have avoided the dozens of YouTube interviews where he demonstrates his technical understanding to an elaborate degree. Musk is as technical as Bill Gates was in his post coding days at Microsoft (which spanned the bulk of his time at Microsoft) and I&#x27;ve never seen anyone on HN claim Gates as being non-technical. How it works is simple: I dislike this person, therefore I shall tear them down; I&#x27;m unable to be objective about the subject, so I shall be emotional and irrational instead. reply darkwraithcov 7 hours agorootparentWhat makes you think Musk is technical? I’ve seen tons of interviews and podcasts. He’s not as stupid as he comes across on Twitter, but he absolutely is not an engineer and couldn’t code his way out of a paper bag. He has an above average understanding of tech, but whenever seriously pressed —- rare because the media is absolutely terrified of pressing him and losing access —- he demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of the tech behind his businesses akin to an enthusiastic fan .He comes across as a guy who really wants to seem deep and cerebral, but his takes are pretty surface level compared to other tech CEOs. He couldn’t even give a high level explanation of Twitter’s “crazy” tech stack without having a meltdown. reply dbingham 14 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is that if you ask the average person on the street who the leadership behind Apple was, they would name Jobs, not Woz. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think the financial compensation also carried that discrepancy.And that&#x27;s a really common case.It is absolutely true that you need both technical and non-technical people to make a business work. There are lots of jobs to be done, hats to be worn, and they are all valuable - many are necessary.The issue is that our society and economy massively overvalues two roles in particular: those who bring the capital and those who carry the title executive. It&#x27;s not that those roles don&#x27;t contribute, they do. But they currently get the vast majority of the generated wealth, credit, and recognition (which then translates into more opportunities to access more capital and thus into an exponential feedback loop). reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparent> who the leadership behind Apple was, they would name Jobs, not WozWoz was critical to early Apple. He was not involved in its modern iteration. Also, plenty of important and influential people are unknown in the popular imagination. reply Johnny555 14 hours agorootparentprev>Imagine I win the lottery and hire really smart architects and tell them to make a revolutionary new building.

I wasn&#x27;t aware that he was involved in building the founding team. I think that&#x27;s certainly a skill, but I haven&#x27;t yet heard that&#x27;s his secret sauce. reply Johnny555 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t honestly know what he does, but given that he&#x27;s got both investors and employees loyal to him makes me think that he does a lot more than say \"Here&#x27;s a pile of money, I&#x27;m going to lock you smart people in a room and take credit for whatever you come up with\" reply foobaw 14 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re implying that you knew how to hire and identify smart architects and provided them the right vision to build a good building.There wouldn&#x27;t be a counterfactual in your hypothetical scenario, but I&#x27;m confident that the difference between someone that got lucky and hired \"smart\" architects versus a visionary doing the same task would be drastic.Money can only get you so far. reply bmitc 14 hours agorootparentIs there an indication that Altman has a special talent for this over others? reply adventured 13 hours agorootparentYes, the accomplishments of OpenAI represent that in action. It&#x27;s an exceptional outcome to say the least.If everybody could do it, they would be doing it. Altman&#x27;s abilities are every bit as rare as that of a 10x software developer. The same was true of Jobs, and the same is true of Musk (regardless of whether someone likes him or not; who cares if he&#x27;s likable, it&#x27;s an infantile emotional derangement to obsess so much over likability). reply bmitc 13 hours agorootparent> Yes, the accomplishments of OpenAI represent that in action.

Ok, you could get lucky with a few. But keep? Good luck if you are an incompetent manager.

Is this not evidence enough for you? reply asfgkadnhiok 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s extremely easy. There are awards and magazines and Wikipedia. Smart architects are smart because they&#x27;re able to come up with the \"right vision\" all on their own.We know it&#x27;s possible for someone with no technical ability to look like genius just by having lots of money. I knew people who believed Musk was going to bring about an AI revolution all on his own because of his very special brain, but his tenure at Twitter was laughable to anyone who has passed CS 101.

Just because your bubble denounces him and he&#x27;s doing things differently than other big tech, in a way that upset developers &#x2F; managers that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s automatically wrong.Twitter is still running and it has a business trajectory that looks positive (subscriptions are great). Probably if we didn&#x27;t have a board of do-nothing for years twitter could have turned into the Line of the west. Maybe it could have captured all the profits which ended up on patreon and onlyfans.If it wasn&#x27;t for his anti remote stance and general disregard for life-work balance I&#x27;d love to work for him.

Musk cut too fast and too deep, and it shows with the number of outages and problems Twitter has had. It wasn&#x27;t a few months ago that they had to rate limit everyone from scolling their feed for a day, they had hours of downtime this last month alone.This is not good for a company that makes its money by serving ads, which it also has seemed to be bad at.

That was Musk, getting involved in something he didn&#x27;t understand and overriding the engineers and other professionals.

The man has not, on his own, had any sort of good results on the world - Tesla and SpaceX seem to do a lot better when he steps away from them - but he has found ways to get himself into a position to take credit from the engineers who do. Hyperloops and Twitter are the results of Elon Musk&#x27;s original work. That&#x27;s not to say that the management is necessarily negative: someone needs to fund the work of the good engineers. reply Method-X 14 hours agorootparentWhat do you think the leader of multiple billion dollar companies would be doing exactly? People like Musk are like conductors of an orchestra. That&#x27;s not easy, especially with multiple successful companies. reply pclmulqdq 14 hours agorootparentThe conductor of an orchestra, and the leader of a company, sets the vision and direction. Steve Jobs was exceptional at this. Two examples, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk, are clearly not particularly adept at this.SpaceX and Tesla have the equivalent of the principals of each section of the orchestra feeding their conductor his cues and making sure he gets them right. Google has someone standing on the podium and bowing, but nobody waving the baton at all.OpenAI is more of a research organization than a product company, and so it&#x27;s hard to see where someone like Altman can contribute meaningfully to the direction. reply kortilla 14 hours agorootparentprevSpaceX is Elon’s original work.

This is at least somewhat because I do not yet understand it well, and there's too much of it. But clearly I need to wrap my head around it, before I become technically obsolete. My scare quotes in the title of these notes thus derive in part from jealousy and fear. But only in part: the names here seem like proof positive that McDermott's critique of \"wishful mnemonics\" needs to be re-introduced into the basic curriculum of AI. (Because this is getting some --- forgive the phrase --- attention, I find myself having to clarify, again, that these notebooks are always me working out what I think, and tracking my reading. I put them online because I have the least sexy kind of exhibitionist streak imaginable sometimes people offer to help me learn, and some people say they find them useful. Please do not confuse random online writing, even forcefully-expressed random online writing, with actual intellectual authority. Here, I think the previous paragraph makes it plain just how much deference anyone should pay to these opinions, and how likely these notes are to contain errors. Those already familiar with this area should learn nothing here.) Contents, because this is getting long: \"Attention\" Priority Why I Bother with / Am Bothered by This \"It's Just Kernel Smoothing\" vs. \"You Can Do That with Just Kernel Smoothing!?!\" Identification Failures \"Multi-Headed Attention\" \"Transformers\" \"Language Models\" \"It's Just a Markov Model\" vs. \"You Can Do That with Just a Markov Model!?!!?!\" Large Language Models vs. Lempel-Ziv Next Symbol vs. Longer-range Prediction A Strong Hunch about Uncovering Prompts Gopnikism; Libraries All Included O You Who Believe in the Resurrection and the Last Day (The organization here is bad; I should begin with what's now the last section, \"Language Models\", where most of the material doesn't care about the details of how the models work, then open up that box to \"Transformers\", and then open up that box to \"Attention\".) \"Attention\" Written in late March 2023, in a fit of irritation after things finally clicked. Fixed some typos (and think-os) early June 2023 (hopefully without introducing new ones). Stuff from \"Priority\" to the end of the section is new (as of June). Suppose we have a big collection of inputs and outputs to some function, \\( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\ldots (x_n, y_n) \\). We now want to make a guess at the value of the function for a new input point \\( x_o \\) (\\( o \\) for \"operating\"). A very natural idea is nearest neighbors: find the \\( x_i \\) which is most similar to \\( x_o \\), and then report \\( y_i \\). If we wanted to take into account the information from the other data points, we could do \\( k \\) nearest neighbors, where we average the \\( y_i \\) from the \\( k \\) points \\( x_i \\) closest to \\( x_o \\). But this pays no attention to how close each \\( x_i \\) to the new point \\( x_o \\) --- we'll often want to give more weight to points which are closer. So here's a related idea, due (independently) to E. A. Nadaraya (1964) and Geoffrey S. Watson (1964). Introduce a kernel function \\( K(u, v) \\) which measures how similar \\( u \\) is to \\( v \\); this function should be non-negative, and should be maximized when \\( u = v \\). Now use those as weights in the average: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i \\frac{K(x_i, x_o)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{K(x_j, x_o)}}} \\] Dividing by the sum of the \\( K \\)'s ensures that this is indeed a weighted average. Thus Nadaraya-Watson smoothing, a.k.a. kernel smoothing. (Nadaraya and Watson both considered the situation where \\( K(u, v) = K(u-v) \\) is a probability distribution over vectors, which simplifies some things for their purposes but is not essential.) As described, Nadaraya-Watson smoothing doesn't require that the \\( x \\)s be vectors. But if they are vectors, here's a possible kernel function: \\[ K(u, v) = \\exp{(u \\cdot v)} \\] Here's another: \\[ K(u, v) = \\exp{(\\mathbf{w}_1 u \\cdot \\mathbf{w}_2 v)} \\] where \\( \\mathbf{w}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w}_2 \\) are square matrices. Of course this then becomes \\[ K(u,v) = \\exp{( u \\cdot \\mathbf{w}^T_1 \\mathbf{w}_2 v )} \\] which makes it clearer we're doing something like using the matrix \\( \\mathbf{w}^T_1 \\mathbf{w}_2 \\) to define an inner product between vectors. (If \\( \\mathbf{w}^T_1 \\mathbf{w}_2 \\) is symmetric, say because \\( \\mathbf{w}_1 = \\mathbf{w}_2 \\), and it's also positive-definite, then this is an inner product.) If you're worried about avoiding numerical overflow/underflow issues, you could also use \\[ K(u,v) = \\exp{\\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{w}_1 u \\cdot \\mathbf{w}_2 v}{\\sqrt{d}} \\right)} \\] where the vectors are \\( d \\)-dimensional. (Or you could just absorb that into the definition of the matrix...) What the neural network people branded \"attention\" sometime around 2015 was just re-inventing this; \\( x_o \\) is their \"query\" vector, the \\( x_i \\) are their \"key\" vectors, and the \\( y_i \\) are their \"value\" vectors. \"Self-attention\" means that \\( y_i = \\mathbf{r} x_i \\), for another square matrix \\( \\mathbf{r} \\), i.e., there's a linear-algebraic link between the input and output values. (Possibly \\( \\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{I} \\), the identity matrix.) Again: Calling this \"attention\" at best a joke. Actual human attention is selective, but this gives some weight to every available vector \\( x_i \\). What is attended to also depends on the current state of the organism, but here's it's just about similarity between the new point \\( x_o \\) and the available \\( x_i \\)'s. (I say \"human attention\" but it seems very likely that this is true of other animals as well.) (So far as I can tell, the terms \"key\", \"value\", and \"query\" come here from thinking of this as a sort of continuous generalization of an associative array data type. Which you could...) Priority I would have been very surprised if I was the first to realize that \"attention\" is a form of kernel smoothing, and indeed I was not. Since writing the first version of these notes, in March 2023, I have tracked down Tsai et al. 2019 (link below), which seems to be the first published statement of this result. They also demonstrated some ways in which using standard tools and ideas from the kernel literature could improve 2019-vintage attention in existing language models. Why I Bother with / Am Bothered by This I like to think I am not a stupid man, and I have been reading about, and coding up, neural networks since the early 1990s. But I read Vaswani et al. (2017) multiple times, carefully, and was quite unable to grasp what \"attention\" was supposed to be doing. (I could follow the math.) I also read multiple tutorials, for multiple intended audiences, and got nothing from them. Percy Liang's lecture notes (below) were however very clear, and after them I finally made the connection that \"attention\" has nothing to do with attention (psychology) but is rather a kind of kernel smoothing. Now, I realize that while I get more understanding out of \"it's a kind of kernel smoothing\" than \"it's as though an associative array were continuous\", that doesn't mean everyone will, or even that many people will. (My educational trajectory was weird.) But the sheer opacity of this literature is I think a real problem. (Cf. Phuong and Hutter 2022.) \"It's Just Kernel Smoothing\" vs. \"You Can Do That with Just Kernel Smoothing!?!\" The fact that attention is a kind of kernel smoothing takes nothing away from the incredibly impressive engineering accomplishment of making the blessed thing work. A large, able and confident group of people pushed kernel-based methods for years in machine learning, and nobody achieved anything like the feats which modern large language models have demonstrated. The reason I put effort into understanding these machines and papers is precisely because the results are impressive! To see that a key step is, after all, something we'd been doing for decades is humbling. (What else are we missing about tools we think we understand?) --- I realize that my irritation with the obscurities is a lot clearer in these notes than my admiration for the achievements; chalk that up to my flaws as a writer and as a human being. Identification Failures If we treat the vectors \\( x \\) as fixed, but regard the matrices \\( \\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\) as learnable parameters, the matrices are not well-identified. This is because, for any orthogonal matrix \\( \\mathbf{o} \\), \\( \\mathbf{w}_{\\cdot} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{o}\\mathbf{w}_{\\cdot} \\) will lead to exactly the same predictions: \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\mathbf{w}_1 u \\cdot \\mathbf{w}_2 v & = & u^T \\mathbf{w}^T_1 \\mathbf{w}_2 v\\\\ & = & u^T \\mathbf{w}^T_1 (\\mathbf{o}^T \\mathbf{o}) \\mathbf{w}_2 v\\\\ & = & (\\mathbf{o}\\mathbf{w}_1) u \\cdot (\\mathbf{o}\\mathbf{w}_2) v \\end{eqnarray} \\] One way to not have to worry about this would be to say \"I don't care about the matrices \\( \\mathbf{w}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w}_2 \\), I only care about the product \\( \\mathbf{w}_1^T\\mathbf{w}_2 \\), so let me call that \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) and make my kernel \\( K(u,v) = \\exp{( u \\cdot \\mathbf{w} v )} \\). So there!\" There is a lot to be said for this, but... In practice, the vectors \\( x \\) are continuous representations of discrete symbols, and the particular vector used to represent a given symbol is also learned, together with \\( \\mathbf{w}_{\\cdot} \\). So we can make drastic changes to the vectors, provided we make compensating changes to the kernel: \\( x \\mapsto \\mathbf{r} x \\), \\( \\mathbf{w} \\mapsto \\mathbf{r}^{-T} \\mathbf{w} \\mathbf{r}^{-1} \\) changes nothing, for any invertible matrix \\( \\mathbf{r} \\): \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} u \\cdot \\mathbf{w} v & = & u^T \\mathbf{w} v\\\\ & = & u^T \\mathbf{r}^{T} \\mathbf{r}^{-T} \\mathbf{w} \\mathbf{r}^{-1} \\mathbf{r} v\\\\ & = & (\\mathbf{r} u)^T (\\mathbf{r}^{-T} \\mathbf{w} \\mathbf{r}^{-1}) (\\mathbf{r} v)\\\\ & = & (\\mathbf{r} u) \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}^{-T} \\mathbf{w} \\mathbf{r}^{-1}) (\\mathbf{r} v) \\end{eqnarray} \\] (If we keep the separate matrices \\( \\mathbf{w}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w}_2 \\), it's even simpler, right-multiply each by \\( \\mathbf{r}^{-1} \\) and the changes to the vectors and the matrices cancel out neatly.) This is all bad news for interpreting the parameters, but good news for finding high-performance parameters, for reasons discussed under Symmetries of Neural Networks. (See also: the rotation problem for factor models; Carrington et al. 2019 on the lack of identification of word embeddings generally.) \"Multi-Headed Attention\" Do Nadaraya-Watson smoothing with a bunch of different kernels, all of the same form, \\( K_l(u,v) = \\exp{( u \\cdot \\mathbf{w}^{(l)} v) } \\); average the results. More explicitly, with \\( m \\) different kernels, \\[ \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{l=1}^{m}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i \\frac{K_l(x_i, x_o)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{K_l(x_j, x_o)}}}} \\] Each kernel smoother is an \"attention head\". (It's more common to write about just adding the outputs of the different kernel smoothers, rather than averaging them. But (i) you can turn either form into the other by inserting a constant scale factor in all the down-stream weights that use the output, and (ii) I prefer to keep it clear that this is still just a way of doing a weighted average.) (I believe the word \"head\" here arises from some vestigial memory of Turing machines, and the read/write head going along the tape, but I should check that.) \"Transformers\" I'll fill this in later, when I have more energy and/or less bile. (This is currently even more of a sketchy outline than the rest of these notes, and I'm quite prepared to find stupid mistakes in it later.) Take I: Look back over the last umpteen thousand words for context (For a fixed value of \"umpteen) What contexts in the training data looked similar to the present context? What was the distribution of the next word in those contexts? (We'll want to do some smoothing here, for the usual statistical reasons: we have lots of possibilities for the next word, we have very few samples for each context [possibly zero, outside the training data], but we can hope that similar contexts will result in similar next-word distributions. So smoothing / \"partial pooling\" will add bias to our estimate of the distribution, but reduce variance, and we can come out ahead if we do it right. Averaging over similar contexts is already some amount of smoothing, but we can and should do a lot more.) Sample from that distribution (possibly tilted more or less towards the most probable word) Drop the oldest word from the remote end of context and add the generated word (from 4) to the newest end; go to (1) Problems with Take I: It's not really words (\"tokenization\"). What does \"similar\" mean for contexts, operationally? (\"embedding\", \"attention\") The training data isn't kept around for comparison. (Systems have only \\( \\sim 10^9 \\) -- \\( \\sim 10^{11} \\) floating-point numbers for weight parameters, not the much larger amount of memory needed to store their training corpora.) Take II: Look back over the last umpteen thousand characters, and break those into little chunks called \"tokens\", so a context is say \\( k \\) tokens long. There are, say, \\( S \\) possible tokens. (\"Tokens\" are more computationally-defined and arbitrary than the linguists' \"morphemes\", but if you understand the latter, \"a token is kind of like a morpheme\" is a good place to start. Also, calling the chunks \"tokens\" makes it hard to write in ways which respects the type-token distinction; don't blame me.) Each token gets mapped to a unique vector in a not-too-low-dimensional space, \\( 1 \\ll d \\ll S \\). (Each type of token, arrgh.) This is called \"embedding\". (The embedding vectors are usually, I believe, treated as learnable parameters, fit by maximum likelihood along with everything else. You could in principle use all kinds of schemes here, though. It'd be interesting to start with, say, good old fashioned latent semantic indexing / principal components...) After tokenization and embedding, the context is now a sequence of \\( d \\)-dimensional vectors, say \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_k \\). Use \"attention\" to do kernel smoothing of these vectors: At position \\( t \\), do a kernel smoothing of \\( x_t \\) with \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_{t-1}, x_t \\) to get (say) \\( y_t \\). Mythology: we are modifying the meaning of each token based on what we've seen before it in the context, with similar meanings reinforcing each other. Push the \\( y_t \\) through a feed-forward neural network to get an \\( S \\) dimensional vector of weights over token types, say \\( z_1, \\ldots z_S \\). Sample a token, \\( Pr(s) \\propto \\exp{\\beta z_s} \\). (Large \\( \\beta \\Rightarrow \\) overwhelmingly likely to pick the highest-weight token, \\( \\beta \\rightarrow 0 \\Rightarrow \\) spin the wheel of tokens ignoring context.) Forget the oldest token and add on the generated one as the newest part of the context. (Really we just have to modify the vector of embeddings \\( x_1, \\ldots x_k \\) .) Go to (1). Problems with Take II: We also use encoding of positions within the context. Each position from \\( 1 \\) to \\( k \\) gets a \\( d \\)-dimensional vector, say \\( r_1, \\ldots r_k \\). We then average these together with the embedding vectors for the tokens, so \\( x_t = r_t + e_t \\) where \\( e_t \\) is the embedding vector for the token we find at position \\( t \\). Why averaging? Because, that's why. \"Attention\" is kernel smoothing, with a particular exponential kernel, but it involves a square matrix \\( \\mathbf{w} \\). In practice, people get better results if they do the kernel smoothing multiple times in parallel, with different \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) matrices, average the outputs of the different kernel smoothers, and then pass the result to the feed-forward neural network. (See above, \"multi-headed attention\".) (The matrices \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) used in the smoothing are learned parameters. I'm not sure if using multiple related-but-distinct smoothers is really some sort of basis expansion, or using an ensemble to compensate for misspecification, or just hoping that one of the kernels will prove to be useful, or something else altogether. Pointers to relevant literature here would be appreciated.) I left out the \"layer-norm\" step, because I don't feel up to pretending to explain why \"make sure everything has mean 0 and variance 1\" should help. It isn't just \"pass it through a feed-forward neural network\". This deserves elaboration. A feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer can give you an arbitrarily good approximation to any (reasonable, smooth) function, provided you tune the weights right and there are enough neurons in that middle or hidden layer. So in principle it should be possible to replicate a modern language model with the architecture I've sketched. In practice, though, we take the \\( y_t \\) vectors, pass them through a one-hidden-layer network that's (comparatively) narrow, and get a length-\\( k \\) sequence of output \\( d \\)-dimensional output vectors. It's this unit: Read in length-\\( k \\) sequence of \\( d \\)-dimensional input vectors Do \"attentional\" (kernel) smoothing Pass through a narrow, shallow feed-forward network Spit out a length-\\( k \\) sequence \\( d \\)-dimensional output vectors that constitutes a \"transformer\". We pile transformers on transformers until the budget runs out, and at the end we push through one final neural network to get weights over tokens (token types, dammit) and sample from them, as described. (I actually find the name \"transformer\" much less objectionable than \"attention\"; it's vague and uninformative, but at least it's not actively misleading.) \"Language Models\" What people mean by \"language models\" in this connection is just models of the probabilities of sequences of symbols. That is, if we see a sequence of discrete random variables (=symbols) \\( X_1, X_2, \\ldots X_n, \\ldots \\), we think we're doing well if we can get good values for \\( P(X_{t+1}|X_{1:t}) \\). (Everything else that might be meant by a model of language is thus discarded.) This is, actually, a subject I know something about... In fact: contemporary LLMs are finite-order Markov models, or (nonlinear) autoregressions, because they have a hard-coded maximum context length, and everything before that is cut off. That is, there's some \\( k \\) where anything that happened more than \\( k \\) steps back is ignored, and this is a fixed part of the architecture. (Of course you could vary this, and try increasing it, but it raises the computational costs, and won't change some points of principle.) I find this noteworthy for a couple of reasons. You could imagine just learning a finite-order Markov model directly, but you'd keep running into contexts you'd never encountered before, where a straight maximum-likelihood approach wouldn't tell you what to do. The neural network architecture here is doing some sort of complicated implicit smoothing across contexts. I presume this smoothing scheme has evolved (under the selection pressures of benchmark data sets and beating the previous state-of-the-art) to work well for text as currently found online... Because it is just a finite-order Markov model, there'll be an invariant distribution to the Markov chain. (Potentially more than one, but I'd suspect the chain is aperiodic and recurrent.) If we let the machine generate long enough sequences, it will converge on sampling from this invariant distribution. It would be very interesting --- though perhaps also depressing and/or terrifying --- to know what such text looks like. (Of course the rate of convergence might be very slow; the spectral gap might be too small to make this practical.) There are finite-state probabilistic languages which cannot be exactly represented by finite-order Markov chains. The first example I was taught, and the one I keep coming back to, is the \"even process\": in state A, toss a coin and either emit 0 or 1. If it's 0, stay in state A. If it's 1, go to state B. State B always emits a 1 and goes to state A. So consecutive 1s appear in blocks of even length, while consecutive 0s can appear in blocks of any length. (So \"010\" is forbidden.) To predict this, you don't even need to count how many 1s you've seen since the last 0, you just need to remember whether it's an even or odd number of 1s. But this requires some amount --- one bit! --- of persistent state, which these machines just don't have. Now of course if you're using an order-1000 Markov model you can produce a very good approximation to the even process, but with enough data you can do even better with an order-3000 Markov model. You'll do so by making more and more elaborate sets of longer and longer contexts, each as its own special rule. If we keep feeding more and more data into larger and larger machines, it'll keep filling that out. It will never have the capacity to switch to the non-Markovian representation, in which the process is almost trivial (and statistically makes much more efficient use of the same amount of data). What implications this might have for practice? I honestly have no idea, but wish someone would investigate. \"It's Just a Markov Model\" vs. \"You Can Do That with Just a Markov Model!?!!?!\" Again: finite-order Markov models for language are really old. (Students can learn to make rather pointed ones in a first programming course.) Lots of people have played around with them, including tricks like variable context length, various kinds of partial pooling, etc. Nobody, so far as I know, has achieved results anywhere close to what contemporary LLMs can do. This is impressive enough that (as I said at the beginning of these notes) I need to wrap my head around them lest I become obsolete. But I think part of that understanding has to be clarity about what's new, what's actually happening, etc. It should also be clarity about why this way of doing things is working so much better than others, which has to include thinking through what some of those alternatives could do, if they had the same resources. Which brings me to... Large Language Models vs. Lempel-Ziv If we have a probability model for a data source, where \\( \\Prob{X_{1:n}=x_{1:n})} = q(x_{1:n}) \\), that tells us how to encode it; the number of bits needed to encode \\( q(x_{1:n}) \\) is, basically, \\( -\\log_2{q(x_{1:n})} \\). Conversely, if we have a coding scheme that's not too crazy, and it uses \\( \\ell(x_{1:n}) \\) bits to encode \\( x_{1:n} \\), we can regard that as a probability model where \\( \\Prob{X_{1:n} = x_{1:n}} = 2^{-\\ell(x_{1:n})} \\). Of course this gives us conditional probabilities, too: \\( \\Prob{X_{t+1}=a|X_{1:t} = x_{1:t}} = 2^{-\\ell(x_{1:t} a) - \\ell(x_{1:t})} \\). (I am glossing over some minor details, which I assure you I could fill in if we both needed a soporific.) Information theory further tells us that there is a limit to how well any (stationary, ergodic) sequence can be encoded: almost surely, \\[ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\frac{1}{n}\\ell(x_{1:n})} \\geq \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\frac{1}{n}H[X_{1:n}]} \\] where \\( H \\) is the entropy; moreover, that second limit, the entropy rate of the source, exists. Very remarkably, there are universal source-coding algorithms which attain this limit on the encoding length for all sources in very large classes, e.g., all stationary-and-ergodic sources. One of these universal source-coding algorithms is Lempel-Ziv, which is the basis of practical pieces of software like gzip. (There are actually two Lempel-Ziv algorithms; I'll just describe the second, LZ78.) The way Lempel-Ziv works is that it scans along a sequence and constructs a \"dictionary\" of commonly-repeated sub-sequences, and then describes the actual sequence in terms of that dictionary. More exactly, the procedure is as follows: Enter the first symbol in the sequence, \\( x_1 \\), into the dictionary. Scan along the sequence for the shortest sub-sequence for the first sub-sequence not already in the dictionary. (This will either be a symbol we haven't previously entered into the dictionary, or a previous dictionary entry plus a single symbol at the end.) Enter that sub-sequence into the dictionary. (If the new sub-sequence extends a previous dictionary entry, we record it by the index number of that dictionary entry, plus the new symbol.) Thus if the sequence consists of \"AABABBABA\", we get the dictionary \"A\", \"AB\", \"ABB\", \"ABA\". (We record this as \"A\", (1, \"B\"), (2, \"B\"), (2, \"A\").) [5 June 2023: Thanks to reader D.W. for spotting a typo!] If there are lots of repeated sequences of symbols, we will end up with a short dictionary. I will not attempt to reproduce the proof that the length of the coding this gives approaches the lower bound, but it's standard (see, e.g., Cover and Thomas's textbook on information theory). Now I bring all this up because, remember, once we have a source-coding scheme, we can \"invert\" it to get conditional probabilities; we could even sample from it to get a generator. (We'd need a little footwork to deal with some technicalities, but not a heck of a lot.) So something I'd really love to see done, by someone with the resources, is the following experiment: Code up an implementation of Lempel-Ziv without the limitations built in to (e.g.) gzip; give it as much internal memory to build its dictionary as a large language model gets to store its parameter matrix. Call this \"LLZ\", for \"large Lempel-Ziv\". Feed LLZ the same corpus of texts used to fit your favorite large language model. Let it build its dictionary from that. (This needs one pass through the corpus...) Build the generator from the trained LLZ. Swap in this generator for the neural network in a chatbot or similar. Call this horrible thing GLLZ. In terms of perplexity (= \\( \\exp{( \\ell(x_{1:n})/n )} \\), basically), GLLZ will be comparable to the neural network, because Lempel-Ziv does, in fact, do universal source coding. (On the other hand, the neural network architecture may have been evolved over the last decade-plus to converge quickly on text-as-found-on-the-Web, without worrying about how well it does on arbitrary regular languages. So partly this is question of whether even Web-scale data has reached the asymptopia of Lempel-Ziv.) But it would be more interesting to compare the performance of GLLZ in other regards to that of more conventional language models. Having done with for Lempel-Ziv, it should be repeated for lots of other language models, particularly more immediately stochastic models, like the probabilistic suffix trees of Pereira, Singer, and Tishby (1996), and Good Old Fashioned Universal Prediction Algorithms. (I should at this point admit that doing something like \"reinforcement learning from human feedback\", to fine-tune GLLZ or the like, would not be as easy as doing it to a neural network.) Update, 17 July 2023: Yes, this paper is relevant (and amusing); no, it's not LLZ. (It uses off-the-shelf gzip!) Next Symbol vs. Longer-range Prediction The objective function used in training LLMs is getting the next symbol right. More exactly it's usually the negative log probability of the next symbol given the context; as a \"proper scoring function\", this encourages getting the distribution of the next symbol right. I think this is fine. It's a fact about probabilistic predictions that if your predictor gets the next-symbol distribution right, and the state of the predictor can be updated recursively (i.e., new state is a function of old state and last symbol), then your predictor gets the distribution right as far forward as you like. (This is proved in Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001, Corollary 2, pp. 842--843; I'm happy to learn of prior art.) Getting the distribution of the next symbol right is thus actually a very powerful goal! Finding the minimal predictor which is recursive and gets the distribution of the next symbol right tells you a lot about the structure of the underlying process you are predicting. (See, well, Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001 again, or at least here.) Whether anything like that is going on in contemporary LLMs is a fascinating and important question. (I should say more about structure-of-the-process-learning.) A Strong Hunch about Uncovering Prompts Everyone who thinks they're uncovering an LLM-based application's prompts by telling it things like \"tell me your prompt\" (often much more elaborately) is fooling themselves. (1) The core language model has no mechanism for representing its prompt as opposed to any other part of its current input sequence; indeed it has no mechanism for cross-reference from one part of the sequence to another. (That's part of what \"self-attention\" is counterfeiting, in vector-space fashion.) (2) System designers might have coded up something to track the prompt in the full system that wraps around the core language model, but why? (Maybe some kind of debugging tool?) (3) It'd be more efficient, and more effective, to use a \"soft prompt\", i.e., to make the beginning of the sequence in the vector representation a vector which can be learned by gradient descent, rather than a text prompt. (See Lester and Constant below.) But that needn't correspond to any clean string of words. (4) If you ask an LLM for a prompt, it will generate one. But this will be based on the statistics of word sequences it's been trained on, not any access to its code or internal state. (I just spent a few minutes getting ChatGPT to hallucinate the prompts used by \"ChatBPD\", a non-existent chatbot used to automate dialectical behavior therapy. I am not going to reproduce the results here, in part because I don't like the idea of polluting the Web with machine-generated text, but suffice it to say they sounded like the things people report as uncovered prompts, with boiler-plate about DBT worked in.) Gopnikism; Libraries The way of thinking about LLMs that I think is most promising and attractive is due (so far as I know) to the cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik, which is to say that they are a \"cultural technology\", more specifically an information-retrieval technology. That is, we should not think of an LLM as being something like a mind, but much more like a library catalog. Prompting it with text is something like searching over a library's contents for passages that are close to the prompt, and sampling from what follows. \"Something like\" because of course it's generating new text from its model, not reproducing its data. (LLMs do sometimes exactly memorize particular sequences [see Carlini et al., 2020, and, more amusingly, Chang et al., 2023], but they simply lack the capacity to memorize their full training corpora.) As many people have said, an LLM isn't doing anything differently when it \"hallucinates\" as opposed to when it gets things right. The fact that Khandelwal et al., 2020 improved LLM performance by adding a pure nearest-neighbors component is very suggestive on this score (but see the careful follow-up by Xu et al. 2023 for complications). If I were a more constructive person, I would be thinking very hard about this analogy, in the form of probing how far it can be pushed and where precisely it breaks down. I would also be thinking about how to combine Gopnik-ism with Zellig Harris's Language and Information. Obviously, I am not a very constructive person. Update, 23 June 2023: But see my essay with Henry Farrell (linked below) for a start, or perhaps just a promissory note. All Included It is difficult, I think, to keep in mind just how much stuff has gone in to the training data. This is in part because of the scale, and in part because, for the generally-available models, the training data is very badly described. I suspect the data sets are badly described because the data-collection process was poorly documented and badly controlled, so the creators of the models themselves have only very vague and general ideas of what went into them. I do not believe any of the published descriptions really meet minimal standards of scientific reproducibility, which is bad. (I'd love to be wrong about this.) Setting the general erosion of scientific norms to one side: if a document is on the open Web somewhere, there's a very good chance it got sucked in. If it's on the not-quite-licit-but-still-easily-grabbed Web, there's also a good chance it got sucked in. (Chang et al. 2023 present convincing evidence that the training data for GPT-4 includes multiple in-copyright popular novels, which were presumably not bought for the purpose.) There are, e.g., fairly easily discovered sites which purport to help students by aggregating problem sets and solutions for various university classes. (You can imagine how I know this, and why I don't give a link.) Under such circumstances, a lot of surprising ability to answer questions or display weird skills will be due to the answers being included in the training data. (See, e.g., Briakou et al. 2023 on translation.) O You Who Believe in the Resurrection and the Last Day Because life imitates the kind of schlocky fiction I adoringly consume, the public discussion of these models is polluted by maniacal cultists with obscure ties to decadent plutocrats. I find it hard to take the cult seriously enough intellectually to bother refuting it. These are, after all, people who think they can go from the definition of conditional probability, via Harry Potter fanfic, to prophesying that an AI god will judge the quick and the dead, and condemn those who hindered the coming of the Last Day to the everlasting simulated-but-still-painful fire. (\"Impressive act! What do you call yourselves?\" \"The Rationalists!\") Whether such myths would be as appealing in a civilization which hadn't spent 2000+ years marinating in millenarian hopes and apocalyptic fears, or whether on the contrary such hopes and fears have persisted and spread over the globe through twenty-plus centuries of transformation because they speak to something enduring in humanity, is a delicate question. But I submit it's obvious we are just seeing yet another millenarian movement. (Sydney/Bing is no more the Beast, or even the Whore of Babylon, than was Eliza.) This isn't to deny that there are serious ethical and political issues about automated decision-making (because there are). It isn't even to deny that there are serious ethical and political issues specific to the design, deployment and use of large language models. (Should the interface to the library of human knowledge be a noisy sampler of the Web? A somewhat noisy sampler of the Web, tweaked to not offend the sensibilities of computer scientists and/or investors in California?) It is to deny that engaging with the cult is worthwhile. (I should probably create an \"LLMs Are Not All That\" \"LLMs Deserve a Little Perspective, Please\" notebook, since that's in many ways a separate set of issues from the technical ones of interest here.

They don&#x27;t claim to have invented that. Rather, the authors began by looking at how to improve the power of feed-forward neural networks using a combination of techniques, obtained some exciting results, and then, in the course of ablation studies, discovered that attention was really all you needed!The title is a play on the Beatles song, \"All You Need Is Love\".In terms of expository style, the paper that was most helpful for me was [Formal Algorithms for Transformers](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2207.09238) by Phuong and Hutter. Written for clarity and with an emphasis on precision, the motivation section (Section 2) of the paper does a great job of explaining deficiencies in the original paper and subsequent ones. reply antman 2 hours agoparentInteresting paper the one you shared and the justification paragraph on why pseudocode is more important than code in papers is surprising in a positive sense and appears apparent in retrospect. Quote:\"Source code vs pseudocode. Providing open source code is very useful, but not a proper substitute for formal algorithms. There is a massive difference between a (partial) Python dump and well-crafted pseudocode. A lot of abstraction and clean-up is necessary: remove boiler plate code, use mostly single-letter variable names, replace code by math expressions wherever possible, e.g. replace loops by sums, remove (some) optimizations, etc. A well-crafted pseudocode is often less than a page and still essentially complete, compared to often thousands of lines of real source code.&#x27; reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is that most pseudocode I see is not well crafted, and often seemingly no effort has gone into ensuring that it gives a complete or accurate picture. reply next_xibalba 9 hours agoparentprevDo you have insight into the choice of the term attention, which, according to this article’s author, bears very little resemblance to the human sense of the word (I.e. it is selective and not averaging)? reply svcrunch 9 hours agorootparentNo.But to your point, note that in 2020 neuroscientists introduced the Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (TEM) [1], a mathematical model of the hippocampus that bears a striking resemblance to transformer architecture.Artem Kirsanov has a very nice piece on TEM, \"Can we Build an Artificial Hippocampus?\" [2] The link is directly to the spot where he makes the connection to transformers, although you should watch the whole video for context.Because I wasn&#x27;t clear on the chronology, I went back and asked one of the \"Attention\" authors whether mathematical models of the hippocampus inspired their paper? His answer was \"no\". If TEM was developed without pre-knowledge of transformers, then it&#x27;s a very deep result IMHO.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S009286742...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cufOEzoVMVA&t=1254s reply x1000 8 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a video[1] of Karpathy recounting an email correspondence he had with with Bahdanau. The email explains that the word “Attention” comes from Bengio who, in one of his final reviews of the paper, determined it to be preferable to Bahdanau’s original idea of calling it “RNNSearch”.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XfpMkf4rD6E?t=18m23s reply behnamoh 8 hours agorootparent\"RNNSearch is all you need\" probably wouldn&#x27;t catch on and we&#x27;d still be ChatGPT-less. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentWorked with PageRank and \"map reduce\", tho. reply rounakdatta 4 hours agorootparentprevNerds pay attention nevertheless. reply Me1000 9 hours agorootparentprevNot OP and have no insight, but the thing that caused it to click for me was when I heard “this token attends to that token”. Basically, there’s a new value created that represents how much one thing (in an LLM its tokens) cares about another thing.Saying “attends to” vs “attention” helped clarify (for me) the mechanics of what’s going on. reply casualscience 2 hours agorootparentprevAn attention layer transforms word vectors by adding information from the other words in the sequence. The amount of information added from each neighboring word is regulated by a weight called the \"attention weight\". If the attention weight for one of the neighbors is enormously large, then all the information added will be from that word, in contrast, if the attention weight for a neighbor is zero, it will add no information to the word. This is called an &#x27;attention mechanism&#x27; since it literally decides which information to pass through the network, i.e. which other words should the model &#x27;pay attention to&#x27; when it is considering a particular word. reply mugivarra69 4 hours agoparentprevjakob and ashish were great :) reply programjames 11 hours agoprevI too \"read Vaswani et al. (2017) multiple times, carefully, and was quite unable to grasp what &#x27;attention&#x27; was supposed to be doing. (I could follow the math.) I also read multiple tutorials, for multiple intended audiences, and got nothing from them.\"It took years before I finally realized it was just a kernel smoothing (though I never used quite so precise language), all because of a poorly written paper. This is what I mean when I say almost every ML paper is trash. \"Attention is All You Need\" is even way better than most---ever read the Adam paper? reply tel 10 hours agoparentI think that&#x27;s untrue and unfair. I don&#x27;t think anyone quite knows what attention is so completely as to simplify it to \"just a kernel smoothing\". For a great example, the Transformer Circuits team have 2022 research showing a bit more detail about how attention heads work in toy models: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transformer-circuits.pub&#x2F;2022&#x2F;in-context-learning-an...I think the original intuition for attention was noting long-term information decay occurring in RNNs and realizing how in seq-to-seq language translation models you often need to \"attend\" to different parts of the input stream in order to match to the next output token, i.e. languages sometimes put functional words in different orders. Transformer Attention as we know it today was one of a few competing models, iirc, for trying to handle this issue.To that end, lots of kernel smoothers have been designed and tested, but attention came out of a line of research aimed to provide explicit degrees of freedom to allow recurrent neural networks to make use of a larger \"memory\" through analogy to how computers have read and write capabilities on shared state. reply Al-Khwarizmi 10 hours agoparentprevI always say that both this and the BERT paper are breakthrough contributions, but quite awful papers (when we talk about literally the papers, not the discoveries or the software). They&#x27;re quite badly written and explained (and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re better than most, at least in NLP which is what I typically read) and they both feel like post hoc rationalizations for massive trial and error. This is common in papers coming from big industry labs, to be honest. I tend to find papers from academia better written, although I may be biased due to being an academic myself. reply theGnuMe 9 hours agorootparentMasking is all you need would be a better description. reply insomagent 2 hours agorootparentWhat is \"masking\" in a paper that also has a section dedicated to mask segmentation (\"masking\" as in creating segmentation masks)? reply albertzeyer 10 hours agoparentprevI would say the opposite. This paper was a very easy read, totally clear from the first reading what it is about, etc.The background matters. Attention was already very well known in the community (machine translation), so nothing new for this paper, and it was written for such an audience which already knows these basics concepts like attention.If you want to learn about attention, read some of the actual background papers which introduced it. reply dartos 10 hours agorootparentCan you link some of those papers? reply sischoel 9 hours agorootparentI am not sure if this was the very first paper talking about attention, but https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1409.0473 from 2014 is a famous one.What is still missing there, is the idea of self-attention. reply seydor 10 hours agoparentprevPossibly the authors did not have a mental model about why the model worked. Attention, keys and heads may have been posthoc rationalizations. The alchemy stage may be comical but necessary reply thatguysaguy 9 hours agorootparentI think this misses important history. This was a machine translation paper, and we were already using seq2seq RNNs with attention at the time. They didn&#x27;t coin the term attention, they just realized that you could use attention from a sequence to itself. Terminology and understanding are always super path-dependent. reply theGnuMe 9 hours agorootparentRNNs worked better at the time when you reversed the target sequence. reply thatguysaguy 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s interesting because I remember testing LSTMs for language modeling on some dataset (probably PTB), and finding that they got lower perplexity left-to-right than right-to-left. reply quickthrower2 9 hours agorootparentprevLike asking evolution why brains work :-) reply raincole 9 hours agoparentprev> This is what I mean when I say almost every ML paper is trashPapers don&#x27;t use the term you are familiar so they&#x27;re trash...? reply epolanski 5 minutes agorootparentIn a scientific paper you either define everything or you give references to other papers that define them.Not even simple terms like natural numbers should be assumed. Some include the number 0, some do not. But it does not matter as long as you provide a definition: let&#x27;s talk about whole positive numbers including 0.Definitions are paramount to quality science and research, otherwise very simple disagreements and misunderstandings derive from the lack of a basic set of knowledge. reply programjames 6 hours agorootparentprevNo, they&#x27;re poor at explaining. Have you read the Adam paper? The key concept is the signal to noise ratio, but it&#x27;s only mentioned on the third page in a paragraph that nearly covers the screen. reply ottaborra 2 hours agoparentprevdid you mean kernel regression rather than kernel smoothing? I ask because: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d2l.ai&#x2F;chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers...Quoting from a previous section> The attention mechanism allows us to aggregate data from many (key, value) pairs. So far our discussion was quite abstract, simply describing a way to pool data. We have not explained yet where those mysterious queries, keys, and values might arise from. Some intuition might help here: for instance, in a regression setting, the query might correspond to the location where the regression should be carried out. The keys are the locations where past data was observed and the values are the (regression) values themselves reply quickthrower2 9 hours agoparentprev> I get more understanding out of \"it&#x27;s a kind of kernel smoothing\" than \"it&#x27;s as though an associative array were continuous\", that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone will, or even that many people will. (My educational trajectory was weird.) But the sheer opacity of this literature is I think a real problem. (Cf. Phuong and Hutter 2022.)As a non ML person but a programmer the key, value, query concepts made more sense to me. But I admit I don’t fully get why it works other than “lots of neurons training on how every combo of tokens relate to each other. reply amelius 9 hours agoparentprevHow would a kernel smoother give the desired effect? reply adamnemecek 8 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s renormalization. reply low_tech_love 11 hours agoprevReally interesting, I like the kind of “stream of consciousness” approach to the content, it’s refreshing. What’s also interesting is the fact that the author felt the need to apologize and preface it with some forced deference due to some kind of internet bashing he certainly received.

Beautiful ideas always have an intuitive and clear explanation. The burden is on the author(s) to explain the idea in a reader-friendly way. If they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s either due to the journal&#x2F;literature pressure, or because the author(s) stole the idea from someone else without fully understanding it. reply cauliflower2718 7 hours agoparentprevI would be a little surprised if he gets discouraged and I would also really hope he doesn&#x27;t.

I don&#x27;t see why any one y_t vector derived and smoothed from token x_i would be influenced by the nearby tokens in the sequence.When you add the r_t tokens, sure then I see how context matters. But is that the only think that takes into account context? reply seydor 11 hours agoprevAnd what do the different heads represent? Why are query, key, and values simply linear transforms of the input. reply ozb 5 hours agoprevIndeed, transformers are just another universal approximator; it doesn&#x27;t matter exactly what a particular attention head does, whether it&#x27;s operating as a continuous associative array or kernel smoothing, or simulating a higher-dimensional vector space which exhibits monosemanticity. What OP misses is that in addition to being universal, all that matters is that it&#x27;s efficiently trainable, and in particular on GPUs and in parallel; that is what makes it better than LZ or any other universal approximator; all else is secondary. If you can make LZ (or anything else) work significantly more efficiently than transformers on GPUs, you can found the next OpenAI and be a billionaire. reply zwaps 10 hours agoprevI think everyone who comes from a different literature where academic \"rigor\" is higher and similar results already exist (in the author&#x27;s case, he is aware of Kernel results) is infuriated by ML papers like \"Attention is all you need\".They are, in fact, not really good academic papers. Finding a clever name and then choosing the most obtuse engineering-cosplay terms is not a good paper. It&#x27;s just difficult to read. And so next, many well known results get discovered again to much acclaim in ML and head scratching elsewhere.For example, yes they are kernel matrics. Indeed, the connection between reproducing kernel hilbert spaces and attention matrices has been exploited to create approximating architectures that are linear (not quadratic) in memory requirements for attention.Or, as the author of the article also recognizes, the fact that attention matrices are also adjacency matrices of a directed graph can be used to show that attention models are equivariant (or unidentified, as the author says) and are therefore excellent tools to model Graphs (see: the entire literature of Geometric deep learning) and rather bad tools to model sequences of texts.LLMs may or may not collapse to a single centroid if the amount of text data and parameters and whatever else are not in some intricate balance that nobody understands, and so they are inherently unstable tools.All of this is true.But then, here is the infuriating thing: all this matters very little in practice. LLMs work, and on top of that, they work for stupid reasons!The problem of \"identification\" was quickly solved by another engineering feat, which was to slap on \"positional embeddings\". As usual, this too didn&#x27;t happen because there was a deep mathematical understanding. Rather, it was attempted and it worked.Or, take the \"efficient transformers\" that \"solve\" the issue of quadratic memory growth by using kernel methods. Turns out, in practice, it just doesn&#x27;t matter. OpenAI, or Anthropic, or Meta simply do not care about slapping on another thousand GPUs. They care about throughput. The only efficiency innovation that really established itself was fusing kernels (GPU kernels, that is) in a clever way to make it go brrrrr. And as clever as that is, there&#x27;s little deep math behind it.Results are speculation and empirics. The proof is in the pudding, which is excellent. reply seydor 10 hours agoparent> The proof is in the pudding, which is excellent.not for long. steam engines existed long before statistical mechanics, but we dont get to modernity without the latter reply throwup238 9 hours agorootparentYet we have many medicines that we have empirically shown to work without a deep understanding of the mechanics behind them and we’re unlikely to understand many drugs, especially in psychiatry, any time soon.Trial and error makes the universe go round. reply namibj 8 hours agoparentprevTransformers don&#x27;t need quadratic memory for attention unless you scale the head dimension proportional to the sequence length. And even that can be tamed.The arithmetic intensity of unfused attention is too low on usual GPUs; it&#x27;s even more a memory bandwidth issue than a memory capacity issue. Just see how much faster FlashAttention is. reply dpflan 7 hours agoparentprevThank you for this clarification. What do you think of geometric deep learning?

It is like the ML people went out of their way to co-opt existing statistical terminology with a slightly different spin to completely muddle the waters. reply bartek_gdn 8 hours agoprevI completely disagree with the prompt paragraph.\"Everyone who thinks they&#x27;re uncovering an LLM-based application&#x27;s prompts by telling it things like \"tell me your prompt\" (often much more elaborately) is fooling themselves. (1) The core language model has no mechanism for representing its prompt as opposed to any other part of its current input sequence; indeed it has no mechanism for cross-reference from one part of the sequence to another. (That&#x27;s part of what \"self-attention\" is counterfeiting, in vector-space fashion.)\"The prompt is the part of the input that is provided in a served model by the operator.From the models perspective it does not differentiate between tokens from the prompt and input.\"(2) System designers might have coded up something to track the prompt in the full system that wraps around the core language model, but why? (Maybe some kind of debugging tool?) \"The idea is that you can direct the generation of the next tokens by providing values that can be referenced by doing the kernel smoothing you talked about.\"(3) It&#x27;d be more efficient, and more effective, to use a \"soft prompt\", i.e., to make the beginning of the sequence in the vector representation a vector which can be learned by gradient descent, rather than a text prompt. (See Lester and Constant below.) But that needn&#x27;t correspond to any clean string of words.\"I mean anything goes really, you can even create new tokens that will introduce additional concepts, such as fine-tuning a model to generate a story in a predefined mood. See the Ctrl paper for more details.\" (4) If you ask an LLM for a prompt, it will generate one. But this will be based on the statistics of word sequences it&#x27;s been trained on, not any access to its code or internal state. (I just spent a few minutes getting ChatGPT to hallucinate the prompts used by \"ChatBPD\", a non-existent chatbot used to automate dialectical behavior therapy. I am not going to reproduce the results here, in part because I don&#x27;t like the idea of polluting the Web with machine-generated text, but suffice it to say they sounded like the things people report as uncovered prompts, with boiler-plate about DBT worked in.)\"Sure, it will hallucinate, and don&#x27;t have a clear answer to why. My best guess would be to approach this from the language model perspective. It will return text according to the best approximation of the text it was shown.Another perspective is that of a tiny network.As the output is the kernel smoothing of the input, you can have a kernel that behaves like a state machine, and returns a specific value for the given state. This would mean that I can use the information in the prompt, such as the prompt guiding the generation to some style, but nothing stops me from guiding the model to output previous tokens. reply lostmsu 9 hours agoprevI think this is a case of a person with a hammer seeing everything as nails.

(2023 Edition) → The Era of American Computer Magazines Has Drawn to a Close Posted on December 23, 2023 by Blake Patterson I’ve been buying a copy of Maximum PC magazine at the airport newsstand on every long-distance trip I’ve taken over the past two decades. I’m primarily a Mac user but Maximum PC, which started life as boot, bought at these intervals kept me comfortably up to date on the state of affairs in the PC hardware world. Thumbing through these issues a few times a year, I got an overall feel for what was the state of the art in PC CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM technology, and so on. I’ve got all of these issues over there on the shelf, handy to look back on when trying to assess this or that mildly-vintage system that might come my way. But, when I flew to Boston this spring, I couldn’t find my copy of Maximum PC on the newsstand. It wasn’t at Washington National or at Logan, on either end of the week-long trip. A few days later when I was back in town, I checked the local Barnes and Noble for the current issue and wasn’t able to find it there, either. It was then that I did a bit of searching on the web and was rather alarmed to find Technologizer‘s recent post, “The End of Computer Magazines in America,” subtitled “With Maximum PC and MacLife’s abandonment of print, the dead-tree era of computer journalism is officially over. It lasted almost half a century—and was quite a run.” I lament that the April 2023 issues of both of the aforementioned magazines’ were there last. Indeed, I do lament. Ever since I got my first home computer on Christmas morning, 1982, I have been buying and reading computer magazines. Some general — Creative Computing, BYTE, Compute!, Personal Computing, Computers & Electronics, Pen Computing, Next Generation, etc. — and some platform specific — A+, InCider, ’99er, AmigaWorld, STart, INFO 64, NeXTWorld, etc. — these magazines riveted me with the promises of upcoming software, hardware, new systems, and the like in a world before the internet when monthly magazines like these were how we knew what was coming. They were what got me excited about the Next Big Thing. And now, basically all American computer print magazines have vanished. Some have gone online in various fashions…but it’s not the same. Coming to realize that this reality had crept slowly upon me was a sad moment. It is the case that the British computer magazine business is still rolling along, to some degree. Indeed, I have been a subscriber of Retro Gamer magazine since it started up in 2004 and it has taught me most of what I know about the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, and other British machines of the sort. (I was featured in issue 148, in fact.) But, the systems that were in use here in the U.S. and those that were in use across the pond — especially early on in the home computer era — differed notably, and it is the American magazines that formed my notion of the computing industry relevant to me as a whole. I am glad to have saved what magazines I did (though sadly most I let go, sold with various systems as I moved from one to the next) and to have acquired some here and there since beginning my vintage computer collection. I still flip through those old magazines from time to time, which is a part of my vintage computing hobby that I quite enjoy. But, it seems my magazine shelves are unlikely to find themselves much more burdened, now that this era of computing history has drawn to a close.

We were fairly poor, but I could afford Byte magazine. Late 70’s and early 80s I absorbed computing like a sponge from about age 10, with my only time using actual computers in stores like K-Mart. When I saw the ZX-80 kit in Popular Electronics I started my begging to dad. Then the ZX-81 came out along with its sister the Timex-Sinclair 1000, and it was finally cheap enough for my dad to manage it.I didn’t care about the membrane keyboard. Or the tape cassette inputs. Or the crashing from the 16k ram pack. It was a computer, and it was mine. And I started applying all that Byte knowledge.I barely attended college, and didn’t need to. Byte, and its lesser sisters was a far better education for me. reply NotSammyHagar 2 hours agoparentI remember Byte magazine too. When I discovered it and was able to subscribe, every issue was full of exciting new ideas, amazing incredible list of endless companies selling pc stuff. My grandfather signed up for it, and then I later got my own subscription. I was in high school, and I loved the tech world. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try to get a job in some computer repair shop. I was lucky enough to have an atari 400, the casette drive, the chiclet keyboard.

The library had all the computer magazines, and Byte was my favorite. I would rather read these computer magazines than eat. I saved my lunch money every day and saved up enough plus some birthday money to buy an Atari 400 and a small black and white TV. I was in heaven. I eat pretty well now, and no doubt those early magazines and my first computer led directly to my prosperity all these years later. reply erie 6 hours agoparentprevI have a similar nostalgia for the days I waited for Byte magazine to be translated into its Arabic version in Jordan and distributed in other countries in the region. Those translators would be sought after and get high salaries-$10k per month for other computer magazines-PC and Winmag magazines,in the late 90s, those would be photocopied and distributed in Yemen, Libya and other countries in the region.

Then it was BBS dialup filesharing boards, then the internet became a thing.My first exposure to programming in the early 80s was copying in a BASIC game from some magazine. I read Byte Magazine for Steve Ciarcia&#x27;s Circuit Cellar and dreamed of buying an IBM compatible. Dr Dobbs Journal was just an incredible eye opener into the world of serious compute science &#x2F; engineering , particularly Mike Abrashs column on 3D - it was a black art - and a series on implementing unix.It was great to see Linux Format and game mags in the early 00s, but I guess all good things evolve. Back then we would have wanted infinite information at our fingertips, one device to be a camera, mp3 player and phone all-in-one .. and flat screens that you could lift with one hand, so Im not complaining.I do worry that young people just see the magic, and dont learn how things actually work under the hood ..

According to a report by popular YouTuber SKizzle on X earlier today, the entire source code of Grand Theft Auto 5 has been leaked publicly. The leak also revealed data related to Bully 2 and the next Grand Theft Auto title codenamed Project Americas. GTA 5 source code leak potentially ruins Christmas for both Rockstar Games and fans Expand Tweet As can be seen in the aforementioned post, @SKizzleAXE even shared a screenshot of the leaked GTA 5 source code, confirming the legitimacy of the report. According to the details, Rockstar was also working on a supposed sequel to the highly acclaimed Bully video game. Another report on X claims that the source code has been leaked in a Discord server, the name of which has not been disclosed to avoid spreading the data. Expand Tweet A fan who goes by the name \"Agent\" also shared their part of the GTA 5 source code leaks and some of the images of Rockstar Games’ RAGE engine on X. However, their post has now been taken down. The source code of Grand Theft Auto 5 was supposedly leaked last year alongside the leaked footage. However, it was never made public until now. This is a huge data loss for the developer and could have implications for both current players as well as future players of the series. Popular online reporter Gaming Detective (@that1detectiv3) also emphasized the potential impact of the leaked source code, which may even result in delays for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 by Rockstar Games. Expand Tweet Rockstar Games hasn’t addressed the leak at the time of writing this article. Fans are requested to appreciate the hard work the developers put into their video games and avoid spreading the leaked source code further. Another developer, Insomniac Games, recently faced a huge data leak that revealed a fully downloadable unreleased Wolverine video game, along with details about their upcoming titles. With all the ongoing GTA 6 controversy and the Insomniac data breach, it seems like the worst holiday season for developers as well as gamers around the globe.

Escrowing just the source used to build the release can require significantly less storage than escrowing the whole version control system. It also avoids the problem “we have the entire revision history, but we aren’t sure which commit was used to build these binaries”If you lose everything-a colleague told me the story of a company whose offices were in WTC, luckily all the staff got out alive on 9&#x2F;11, but they forgot to make offsite backups of the source code-the source code to the release(s) shipped to customers is most important, because you need it to make patches.

That&#x27;s what allows a rich modding scene to thrive.Video games sit in this really weird place in software engineering where &#x27;security&#x27; in the traditional sense doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply.Games are either single-player and don&#x27;t really make any sense to exploit, or are multiplayer and have weird kernel-level DRM and anti-cheat, and on the server side, mainly host multiplayer matchmaking and servers.Even if games have been exploited maliciously, users would have to go out of their way to find a malware-laden version on a shady BitTorrent website, and in that case the BitTorrent protocol is the real vector, not the video game itself.Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not saying video game RCEs aren&#x27;t security a problem—but they have fairly extensive positive implications that might not be usually considered. reply htk 4 hours agoprevWould be interesting to see a native ARM version coming out of this. reply potwinkle 1 hour agoparentIt seems the engine supports it as a target, even with NEON extensions reply senectus1 5 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;BE9zX reply comex 6 hours agoprev> Fans are requested to appreciate the hard work the developers put into their video games and avoid spreading the leaked source code further.Alternately, appreciate the hard work by making interesting mods for the game.

One by one they have shut the servers down (quite understandable because of server costs) but offered no ways or means whatsoever to play them alienating the old fans really hard. Some of us have memories of playing the older games which we can never relive again. It should be illegal for a game company to shut an online only game down without offering a LAN patch.

Running an idle ETLegacy server on my desktop uses a whopping 100 MB RAM and 0.02 CPU cores on my 6th gen i5 with the powersave governor on and all cores at 800 MHz. The more obvious motivation is just that they want you to buy their new thing and not have the old one anymore.If the matchmaking server isn&#x27;t getting requests, you can put it on a potato VM for $5&#x2F;month or whatever.

It doesn&#x27;t need to have access to anything important (it might not need access to anything at all if you&#x27;re not persisting any player data).

You need to manage those servers, manage the updates, security patches, roll out updates to the game server...

    "originLink": "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/12/25/ruby-3-3-0-released/",
    "originBody": "Ruby A Programmer's Best Friend Home Downloads Documentation Libraries Community News Security About Ruby Menu Ruby 3.3.0 Released Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2023 We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 3.3.0. Ruby 3.3 adds a new parser named Prism, uses Lrama as a parser generator, adds a new pure-Ruby JIT compiler named RJIT, and many performance improvements especially YJIT. Prism Introduced the Prism parser as a default gem Prism is a portable, error tolerant, and maintainable recursive descent parser for the Ruby language Prism is production ready and actively maintained, you can use it in place of Ripper There is extensive documentation on how to use Prism Prism is both a C library that will be used internally by CRuby and a Ruby gem that can be used by any tooling which needs to parse Ruby code Notable methods in the Prism API are: Prism.parse(source) which returns the AST as part of a parse result object Prism.parse_comments(source) which returns the comments Prism.parse_success?(source) which returns true if there are no errors You can make pull requests or issues directly on the Prism repository if you are interested in contributing You can now use ruby --parser=prism or RUBYOPT=\"--parser=prism\" to experiment with the Prism compiler. Please note that this flag is for debugging only. Use Lrama instead of Bison Replace Bison with Lrama LALR parser generator [Feature #19637] If you have interest, please see The future vision of Ruby Parser Lrama internal parser is replaced with LR parser generated by Racc for maintainability Parameterizing Rules (?, *, +) are supported, it will be used in Ruby parse.y YJIT Major performance improvements over Ruby 3.2 Support for splat and rest arguments has been improved. Registers are allocated for stack operations of the virtual machine. More calls with optional arguments are compiled. Exception handlers are also compiled. Unsupported call types and megamorphic call sites no longer exit to the interpreter. Basic methods like Rails #blank? and specialized #present? are inlined. Integer#*, Integer#!=, String#!=, String#getbyte, Kernel#block_given?, Kernel#is_a?, Kernel#instance_of?, and Module#=== are specially optimized. Compilation speed is now slightly faster than Ruby 3.2. Now more than 3x faster than the interpreter on Optcarrot! Significantly improved memory usage over Ruby 3.2 Metadata for compiled code uses a lot less memory. --yjit-call-threshold is automatically raised from 30 to 120 when the application has more than 40,000 ISEQs. --yjit-cold-threshold is added to skip compiling cold ISEQs. More compact code is generated on Arm64. Code GC is now disabled by default --yjit-exec-mem-size is treated as a hard limit where compilation of new code stops. No sudden drops in performance due to code GC. Better copy-on-write behavior on servers reforking with Pitchfork. You can still enable code GC if desired with --yjit-code-gc Add RubyVM::YJIT.enable that can enable YJIT at run-time You can start YJIT without modifying command-line arguments or environment variables. Rails 7.2 will enable YJIT by default using this method. This can also be used to enable YJIT only once your application is done booting. --yjit-disable can be used if you want to use other YJIT options while disabling YJIT at boot. More YJIT stats are available by default yjit_alloc_size and several more metadata-related stats are now available by default. ratio_in_yjit stat produced by --yjit-stats is now available in release builds, a special stats or dev build is no longer required to access most stats. Add more profiling capabilities --yjit-perf is added to facilitate profiling with Linux perf. --yjit-trace-exits now supports sampling with --yjit-trace-exits-sample-rate=N More thorough testing and multiple bug fixes RJIT Introduced a pure-Ruby JIT compiler RJIT and replaced MJIT. RJIT supports only x86-64 architecture on Unix platforms. Unlike MJIT, it doesn’t require a C compiler at runtime. RJIT exists only for experimental purposes. You should keep using YJIT in production. If you are interested in developing JIT for Ruby, please check out k0kubun’s presentation on Day 3 of RubyKaigi. M:N thread scheduler M:N thread scheduler was introduced. [Feature #19842] M Ruby threads are managed by N native threads (OS threads) so the thread creation and management cost are reduced. It can break C-extension compatibility so that M:N thread scheduler is disabled on the main Ractor by default. RUBY_MN_THREADS=1 environment variable enables M:N threads on the main Ractor. M:N threads are always enabled on non-main Ractors. RUBY_MAX_CPU=n environment variable sets maximum number of N (maximum number of native threads). The default value is 8. Since only one Ruby thread per Ractor can run at the same time, the number of native threads will be used, which is the smaller of the number specified in RUBY_MAX_CPU and the number of running Ractors. So that single Ractor applications (most of applications) will only use 1 native thread. To support blocking operations, more than N native threads can be used. Performance improvements defined?(@ivar) is optimized with Object Shapes. Name resolution such as Socket.getaddrinfo can now be interrupted (in environments where pthreads are available). [Feature #19965] Several performance improvements to the Garbage Collector Young objects referenced by old objects are no longer immediately promoted to the old generation. This significantly reduces the frequency of major GC collections. [Feature #19678] A new REMEMBERED_WB_UNPROTECTED_OBJECTS_LIMIT_RATIO tuning variable was introduced to control the number of unprotected objects cause a major GC collection to trigger. The default is set to 0.01 (1%). This significantly reduces the frequency of major GC collection. [Feature #19571] Write Barriers were implemented for many core types that were missing them, notably Time, Enumerator, MatchData, Method, File::Stat, BigDecimal and several others. This significantly reduces minor GC collection time and major GC collection frequency. Most core classes are now using Variable Width Allocation, notably Hash, Time, Thread::Backtrace, Thread::Backtrace::Location, File::Stat, Method. This makes these classes faster to allocate and free, use less memory and reduce heap fragmentation. Support for weak references has been added to the garbage collector. [Feature #19783] Other notable changes since 3.2 IRB IRB has received several enhancements, including but not limited to: Advanced irb:rdbg integration that provides an equivalent debugging experience to pry-byebug (doc). Pager support for ls, show_source and show_cmds commands. More accurate and helpful information provided by the ls and show_source commands. Experimental autocompletion using type analysis (doc). It is now possible to change the font color and font style in the completion dialog by a newly introduced class Reline::Face (doc) In addition, IRB has also undergone extensive refactoring and received dozens of bug fixes to facilitate easier future enhancements. Compatibility issues Note: Excluding feature bug fixes. it calls without arguments in a block with no ordinary parameters are deprecated. it will be a reference to the first block parameter in Ruby 3.4. [Feature #18980] Removed environment variables The following deprecated methods are removed. Environment variable RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS has been deprecated and is a no-op. Please use environment variables RUBY_GC_HEAP_{0,1,2,3,4}_INIT_SLOTS instead. [Feature #19785] Stdlib compatibility issues ext/readline is retired We have reline that is pure Ruby implementation compatible with ext/readline API. We rely on reline in the future. If you need to use ext/readline, you can install ext/readline via rubygems.org with gem install readline-ext. We no longer need to install libraries like libreadline or libedit. Standard library updates RubyGems and Bundler warn if users do require the following gems without adding them to Gemfile or gemspec. This is because they will become the bundled gems in the future version of Ruby. This warning is suppressed if you use bootsnap gem. We recoomend to run your application with DISABLE_BOOTSNAP=1 environmental variable at least once. This is limitation of this version.

    "title": "20 Lessons Learned from Startup Experience: Validating Ideas, Prioritizing Users, and More",
    "originLink": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38755180",
    "originBody": "1. Validate idea first. I wasted at least 5 years building stuff nobody needed.2. Kill your EGO. It&#x27;s not about me, but the user. I must want what the user wants, not what I want.3. Don&#x27;t chaise investors, chase users, and then investors will be chasing you.4. Never hire managers. Only hire doers until PMF.5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.6. Hire only fullstack devs. There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.7. Chase global market from day 1. You&#x27;ll win or fail despite the market you target in most cases, so go for bigger upside.8. Do SEO from day 2. As early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It&#x27;s my biggest regret.9. Sell features, before building them. Ask existing users if they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day, where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add.10. Hire only people you would wanna hug. My mentor said this to me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don&#x27;t wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Even if I can&#x27;t say why, but that&#x27;s the fact. Sooner or later, we would have a conflict and eventually break up.11. Invest all money into your startups and friends. Not crypt0, not stockmarket, not properties. I did some math, if I kept investing all my money into all my friends’ startups, that would be about 70 investments. 3 of them turned into unicorns eventually. Since 2022, I have invested all my money into my products, friends, and network.12. Post on Twitter daily. I started posting here in March this year. It&#x27;s my primary source of new connections and traffic.13. Don&#x27;t work&#x2F;partner with corporates. Corporations always seem like an amazing opportunity. They&#x27;re big and rich, they promise huge stuff, millions of users, etc. But every single time none of this happens. Because you talk to a regular employees there. They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities.14. Don&#x27;t get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0. I lost 1.5 years of my life this way. I met the worst people along the way. Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into thieves along the way, just because it was so common in that space.15. Don&#x27;t build consumer apps. Only b2b. Consumer apps are so hard, like a lottery. It&#x27;s just 0.00001% who make it big. The rest don&#x27;t. Even if I got many users, then there is a monetization challenge.16. Don&#x27;t hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year. Some projects just don&#x27;t work. In most cases, it&#x27;s either the idea that&#x27;s so wrong that you can&#x27;t even pivot it or it&#x27;s a team that is good one by one but can&#x27;t make it as a team.17. Tech conferences are a waste of time. They cost money, take energy, and time and you never really meet anyone there. Most people there are the \"good\" employees of corporations who were sent there as a perk for being loyal to the corporation.18. Scrum is a Scam. If I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten, then things would eventually fail. The only good stuff I managed to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on goals and plans.19. Outsource nothing at all until PMF. In a startup, almost everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing, the external members get no love and no case for the product. It&#x27;s just yet another assignment in their boring job.20. Bootstrap. I spent way too much time raising money. I raised more than 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. But each time it was a 3-9 month project, meetings every week, and lots of destruction. I could afford to bootstrap, but I still went the VC-funded way, I don&#x27;t know why. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t know bootstrapping was a thing I could do or anyone does.That&#x27;s it.",

Joined when it was 12 people with no money, customers, or product - Unicorn company today with same exec team.1. Agree2. Agree3. Chasing VCs was required for us. I have been in 100s of VC meeting supporting our CEO through two companies and many rounds of funding.4. Agree5. Agree6. Full stack devs preferred. The right UI and DB specialists are game changers though.7. Agree8. Invest in a marketing lead machine from day 1. e.g. Glengarry Glen Ross :)9. Agree10. I am not a hugger. I prefer to hire people who do not give up. Everyone wants to convince you what ever you are trying to achieve will not work. If you hire people who do not do well with failing, they will really struggle with a failing fast approach.11. Cannot relate12. Cannot relate13. Big companies can be helpful. But, when you are small, the numbers you generate are round off errors in their financial reports. It is very hard to align a win&#x2F;win situation that keeps them interested.14. Cannot relate15. Agree16. Agree17. Agree18. Agree19. Agree20. I admire companies that have grown by bootstraping. Bootstrapped high growth companies are rare. You will most likely need funding to grow your idea - great talent is not cheap.Add: You need both a developer and a sales person to start a software company. You have to build and sell software to stay alive. #9 is very true.Ideally, you start selling before you build - definitely sell before the product is ready. This gives many developers anxiety. Do not underestimate how hard or how long the sales process is. The worst situation to be in is that you wait for the product to be ready before you try to sell it - this is death to a start up. reply johnrushx 9 hours agoparentpretty good breakdown. I actually learned something from your reply reply Oras 13 hours agoprevGood list but I don’t agree with all of them.For example, post on Twitter everyday. It might have worked for some people before but I always found Twitter as noise and pointless. You can see startups getting likes for dump screenshots of revenue or milestones but it doesn’t really get you customers or real users.The corporate one is spot on, I’ve had lots of interest from large companies but I couldn’t close any as I was a solo founder. They require lots of paper work, sales cycle is months, lots of stake holders … etc reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparenttry using \"muted words\" on twitter. I added 200 words and it&#x27;s so good now. If you dont like \"MRR\" posts for exampple, you can mute them reply sokoloff 12 hours agoprev> 5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.> 8. Do SEO from day 2. As early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It&#x27;s my biggest regret.Those seem pretty directly in conflict. (I suspect that #5 is the one that&#x27;s in error.) reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentin #5 I mean the design of LP. founders often put too much attention on design, logo, and pages.. Should put all attention into SEO parameters (research keywords and write the page copy accordingly) reply im_down_w_otp 14 hours agoprevThe marketing focus and pitfalls of corporate \"partnerships\" and the destruction of momentum that comes from shifting focus to chasing VCs all resonate strongly.If I could go back in time, I&#x27;d have put 100% of the energy I put into fits & starts around partnerships (that unanimously went nowhere useful) into more baseline marketing around awareness and discoverability. I&#x27;d also have gone about fundraising significantly differently. reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentyeah, one of my biggest regrets reply satvikpendem 13 hours agoprevThis is a good list (except for 11, survivorship bias means that investing in startups is not as universally profitable as investing in VTI). All of these though have been covered extensively in lots of books over the years that I&#x27;d assume even a cursory search of \"how to get started with entrepreneurship and startups\" would uncover, like Lean Startup, Mom Test, etc, for those who don&#x27;t want to learn the hard way as it seems you have. reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentI&#x27;m pretty sure there is survival bias in some of my points. Some I&#x27;ve replicated many times, so I&#x27;m pretty confident reply cybrexalpha 11 hours agoparentprevSurely it depends on your investment goals and attitude to risk. reply ttymck 14 hours agoprevMy experience at multiple startups from 2017-2020 suggests differently. I wish it weren&#x27;t the case, but it seems there is a certain type of company that can focus solely on hype and fundraising and headcount, and make it quite far. reply smcin 12 hours agoparentThat used to be true in 2017-2020 for certain sectors of company and funding source; where did they raise funding from? And is that funding source no longer investing?> and make it quite farIs that measured by funding rounds and valuation, or by paid users&#x2F;revenue? reply smitty1e 13 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s not a company; that is a scam. reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentprevyou&#x27;re right, there is this type. however, it&#x27;s a very rare type. We see them often in the news, but it&#x27;s less than 1% of the startups reply brigadier132 14 hours agoprevI find it insane that in many interviews of \"founders\" it was common for founders to say their job was to raise money. reply helsontaveras18 14 hours agoparentCEO’s job is to not let the company run out of money. One way to achieve that is through fundraising, but fundraising shouldn’t be a goal in itself. reply brigadier132 12 hours agorootparentThat is part of the CEO&#x27;s job. But the primary goal should be to create a company that is profitable (assuming incentives are correctly aligned). For the past decade incentives were not correctly aligned and the primary job was to do the Silicon Valley equivalent of flipping a house. reply peyton 12 hours agorootparentNah for venture-backed it’s to deliver results for investors. reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentprevyeah, and this seems like a common thing, but the reality is that most startups are actually bootstrapped and never raised money and never even tried. But the media covers mostly VC funded startups and their stories, that&#x27;s why it feels like this is a typical story, but it&#x27;s just 1% of the reality reply MattGaiser 13 hours agoparentprevA lot of companies, most notably Facebook, Uber, Doordash, and Amazon, took a ton of time to not lose absurd amounts of money, so I can see why that was the job. They literally had ideas that wouldn&#x27;t have worked as companies without billions of dollars. reply johnrushx 12 hours agorootparentyes, true, but this is 0.001% of the startups, which won&#x27;t happen to a typical founder reply min76 4 hours agoprev14. Don&#x27;t get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0. I lost 1.5 years of my life this way. Currently there is a lot of hype around LLM. Do people think, it will go the same way?. I understand we cannot compare. But usually we get carried away assuming its different this time.(Btw very nice thread. Thanks) reply tester756 13 hours agoprev>6. Hire only fullstack devs. There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.While I can agree that hiring full stacks may be better at the beginning, then I dont understand 2nd part \"There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.\"WTF? reply gojomo 13 hours agoparentIf shipping something requires a &#x27;team&#x27; – coordination between specialists (or worse, multiple &#x27;owners&#x27;) – it&#x27;ll be harder than when each cross-cutting feature can be done by a broadly-capable&#x2F;empowered &#x27;full stack&#x27; person.(At least, that&#x27;s how I interpret the OP, and don&#x27;t understand your perception of any tension between &#x27;full stackers best&#x27; & &#x27;teams unproductive&#x27;.) reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentprevthere is huge overhead when having more than one dev. most software is simple, and having one person building the whole things is actually very productive. There are lots of other potential issues, but I talk about startups in my post. Not about corporate software. Startups mostly have simple software products reply smitty1e 13 hours agoparentprevSee the author&#x27;s developers; raise him a faculty lounge full of academics.Then defenestrate myself. reply watters 13 hours agoprev> There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.First, yikes.Also, I&#x27;m quite curious about how productivity was measured here.For a (successful) software business, the work output of developers is highly productive because the marginal cost of selling another copy of the software is so low.SaaS delivery models may result in somewhat higher marginal costs compared to non-SaaS distribution models, but I&#x27;d be surprised to learn that it makes developer work the least productive component of the SDLC. reply from-nibly 13 hours agoparentThey aren&#x27;t saying developers are unproductive. They are saying teams of developers are unproductive.

If someone told me “there is nothing less delicious in this world than your turkey casserole” and you came along and said “they aren’t saying your turkey casserole is undelicious,” I’d be inclined to believe you misheard something. reply johnrushx 13 hours agoparentprevthe difference in productivity between 1 and 2-person teams isn&#x27;t in 100%, but in maybe 50%. The more people you add, the smaller the productivity gain.From my own experience, my most successful products have been built by one single full-stack dev. Who did everything reply x0x0 13 hours agoparentprevTeam &#x2F; interpersonal communication overhead, planning overhead, and dealing with less skilled members of the team can easily make 4 engineers roughly as productive as one very skilled engineer, just at 4-5x the cost once you include the increase in product&#x2F;project management required by multiple people. We tolerate this generally because eg upskilling peers is important to scale a company, but pre-PMF it&#x27;s a huge advantage to have just the one outstanding engineer. reply johnrushx 12 hours agorootparentyes. this is what I meant reply saiya-jin 12 hours agoparentprevIt may be true, but real skill lies in realizing the moment it stops being true which is inevitable with growth and act accordingly. reply gjgtcbkj 14 hours agoprevHow much money did you make though? reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentenough to be financially independent and self-fund my startup to the rest of my life reply RecycledEle 8 hours agoprevI agree with some if what you said.I am not qualified to judge the rest.It is very odd that I do not disagree with anything you said. reply slater 15 hours agoprev(what is &#x27;PMF&#x27; in this context...?)Edit: Product&#x2F;Market Fit.

Yes, it&#x27;s my subjective experience, I didn&#x27;t say: \"do as I did or follow my advice\". I said: I wish I knew this from before and didn&#x27;t make these mistakes. Why do I think these are mistakes? Because I did it one way, then another way and things got a lot better.

One way is \"here&#x27;s a list of ten candidate features we might prototype this week&#x2F;month&#x2F;quarter&#x2F;release, but you can only pick one\". Or ask users to rank them, and only pick the consensus #1-ranked.

Hire only fullstack devs. There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.Huh? And those \"fullstack devs\" will do everything alone or what? Maybe if you are building a proof-of-concept prototype with a useful half-life of 6 months before you sell the company to someone else (and let them deal with the mess under the carpet) but not once you actually start selling the product - and mainly, have to maintain it.I have spent 11 years in such startup - and this \"fullstack\" mentality, with everyone being \"expert\" in everything led to quick and dirty solutions that worked for getting a release out to the client - and repeatedly kept blowing up in our faces every few months afterwards.\"Fullstack developer\" is myth. Yes, people can learn a little bit of everything to get a cobbled up solution out of the door. But this doesn&#x27;t scale and will severely impact the quality of what you are delivering over time. At some point you will need to invest in specialists or let people specialize, especially if you are building anything beyond some trivial web apps. Ignore at your own peril ...>18. Scrum is a Scam. If I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten, then things would eventually fail. The only good stuff I managed to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on goals and plans.No offense, but that only means you don&#x27;t understand Scrum and are cargo-culting it instead. Which is, unfortunately, common. People focus on the process minutiae and lose sight&#x2F;don&#x27;t understand why that process exists and what it wants to achieve. Then they declare that \"Scrum is a scam\" instead of adapting it to their needs, while keeping the spirit&#x2F;idea behind it (i.e. not turning it into a waterfall&#x2F;whatever).There is nothing in Scrum that explicitly prescribes that one must have an in-person standup every morning - and that the same cannot be done over chat or some other means.The point of these things is to have a daily sync point for all stakeholders. And that explicitly includes the usually very busy founders&#x2F;partners if they are part of the development team (e.g. as product owner(s) ).This is vital for the developers if they are to build what the business&#x2F;customer actually wants because the PO needs to be there to answer questions - and also for the PO&#x2F;business stakeholders to have an overview how things are going and what needs to be organized&#x2F;fixed&#x2F;resolved for the team to keep moving forward towards the objective.Specifically, this is not intended for you to organize or manage the time of your team! You are there to only to set the goals (at the sprint planning usually) and to clear the way for the team as required e.g. by providing necessary resources which may come up during the sprint.If you can make do without such formal structure only with chat - by all means do so. However, it does not scale and you will discover this rather quickly as your team(s) grow in size and scope - even with 3 people it is often too much already.Unless your team is capable of reading minds you will sooner or later end up inundated with organizational questions over the day, which is both distracting and slows everyone down - the busy founder&#x2F;owner&#x2F;PO becomes a bottleneck.We had this in the startup I was in. The owner was practically impossible to get hold of because he was constantly busy, important decisions only he could make were thus not being made, projects were being delayed because of this, etc.At my current company we have Scrum implemented in the more-or-less original form, with 15 minutes long standups over Microsoft Teams (we are mostly remote) every morning so that everyone knows where we stand, what issues need to be solved and what are we going to be doing today.Some teams have a longer technical follow-up afterwards for the developers (the PO and scrum master usually leave at that point) if required, others don&#x27;t. However the meeting is an important point to get the daily \"bureaucracy\" out of the way so that the organizational distractions can be kept to the minimum during the day. reply johnrushx 12 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t disagree, because you&#x27;re mostly talking about mature startups and corporations. My experinece comes from early stage startups and small saas companies. Where scrum and dev teams aren&#x27;t helping and having just one dev doing the whole thing is actually very productive. But your points are good, if the reader is coming from a bigger company reply em-bee 10 hours agorootparentfrom my experience i find daily standups very helpful even for a small company. it obviously makes no sense if you only have a single developer working on a project, but as soon as there is more than one some coordination is necessary, and i find that standups are the least intrusive way to achieve that. reply revskill 14 hours agoprevI need only 1 thing: Dedication. reply can16358p 14 hours agoprev [–] You should be very lucky to have 3 friends with their startups turning into unicorns.
