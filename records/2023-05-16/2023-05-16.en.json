    "content": "IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)Listen5 minComment555Gift ArticleThe Internal Revenue Service has quietly built its own prototype system to allow Americans to file tax returns digitally and free of charge, according to three current and former agency officials, essentially creating government software that could disrupt the tax-prep industry.The system will be available through a pilot program for a small group of taxpayers by January, when the 2024 filing season begins, said the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency conversations. It was developed by the IRS and the U.S. Digital Service, the White House\u2019s technology consulting agency.Last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, one of President Biden\u2019s chief legislative victories, included $15 million for the IRS to look into creating a direct filing program.Treasury Department representatives declined to comment Monday.\u201cThere\u2019s something very important about the fact that even beyond making it easy and beyond making it free, this is something you could do directly with your government,\u201d said Gabriel Zucker, associate policy director for tax benefits at the advocacy group Code for America, which has constructed its own tax filing prototype.The IRS currently refers people seeking no-cost filing options to a consortium of companies that provide free e-filing for taxpayers below a certain income level. Though 70 percent of taxpayers qualify for those products, known collectively as IRS Free File, fewer than 3 percent of taxpayers use them, according to a Government Accountability Office report.For a narrower range of taxpayers, industry giants Intuit TurboTax and H&R Block offer free products that the IRS does not officially endorse.Other filers can complete \u201cFree File Fillable Forms,\u201d digital versions of hard-copy IRS paperwork, without professional guidance.The tax agency tapped the left-leaning New America think tank to study a direct filing system and produce a report, which is expected this week.IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel had previously told lawmakers that the IRS would consult Congress after the think tank made its recommendation and had not yet determined whether to pursue its own software program. But if the IRS already has a prototype before the New America report has been released, \u201cthis suggests a pre-determined outcome and flies in the face of previous commitments Commissioner Werfel made to publicly consult Congress on a potential free-file solution, and for the IRS to not act without explicit legal authority,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo (Idaho), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.A free filing system offered directly by the federal government could upset a commercial tax-prep market estimated by the research firm IBIS World to be worth $14.4 billion this year.\u201cNo matter the outcome of direct file, Free File is here to stay,\u201d said Tim Hugo, executive director of the Free File Alliance industry group.The system of commercial programs for online filing has served taxpayers and the government well by many accounts. Roughly 9 in 10 individual tax returns were filed digitally in 2022, the IRS reported. The U.S. voluntary tax compliance rate \u2014 the proportion of filers who pay federal taxes accurately each year \u2014 of 85.1 percent is one of the highest among developed economies, according to years of research in the United States and Europe.But some experts say the private-public partnership also reflects the IRS\u2019s technological deficits. Far smaller countries, including Estonia, Chile and Australia, offer government-backed digital filing services.The Inflation Reduction Act granted the IRS $80 billion over 10 years to increase enforcement efforts for high-income earners, improve taxpayer services and modernize its technology. The Biden administration said the IRS needs the additional funds to catch up with sophisticated tax cheats and better serve low- and middle-income Americans entitled to a bevy of credits.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to develop this so it\u2019s comprehensive,\u201d former IRS commissioner Mark Everson said in an interview. \u201cIf it\u2019s just treating the more simplified [tax returns], what about the more complex sets of circumstances? Somebody is going to say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to bother.\u2019\u201dThe agency plan also would allow taxpayers to solicit help from customer service representatives through secure online portals. That threatens to encroach on another area in which tax-prep companies try to differentiate themselves from the IRS by employing legions of accountants and other experts to serve filers in premium product lines or develop software tools to guide filers while completing their returns.\u201cIs there a need for government to come compete with and change a functioning private-sector industry?\u201d said Timur Taluy, chief executive of Free File vendor FileYourTaxes.com and a member of an IRS consulting panel of online tax-prep experts.Industry representatives have been outspoken to lawmakers and administration officials about the direct filing program.\u201cA direct-to-IRS e-file system is wholly redundant and is nothing more than a solution in search of a problem,\u201d Intuit spokesman Rick Heineman said in a statement, \u201cand that solution will unnecessarily cost taxpayers billions of dollars.\u201dIntuit spent $1 million between January and March lobbying both House and Senate lawmakers on issues including \u201ctax system integrity\u201d and \u201cintellectual property protections,\u201d according to disclosures.This month, Intuit began making payments to 4.4 million low-income Americans as part of a $141 million settlement to resolve claims that it misled taxpayers and diverted them away from free products to premium services. Under the terms of the settlement, the company did not admit wrongdoing.H&R Block spent $720,000 over the same period on lobbying regarding various anti-poverty tax credits, \u201ctax administration\u201d and \u201cInternal Revenue Service funding,\u201d according to its disclosure paperwork.\u201cToday, the consumer has great choice and flexibility in where they turn for free help, with more than 30 organizations offering free tax preparation, half of which are non-profit organizations,\u201d H&R Block spokeswoman Angela Davied said. \u201cWe remain committed to delivering the digital capabilities and human expertise and care that helps millions of Americans get the best outcome at tax time.\u201d555CommentsGift ArticleView more",

    "hn_content": "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is testing a new e-filing system that would offer Americans a free way of filing their taxes electronically, which could compete with existing tax preparation software giants. Critics say it is absurd that the government does not already have such a system in place, claiming that they already have most people's tax information, and should simply send a bill, possibly with the option to submit extra details to claim additional deductions, and only then would people have to\u00a0file taxes. Many other countries already have such systems, including Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and the UK. Simplifying the US tax code could also make a person's tax burden easier to calculate.The government requires taxpayers to file their tax returns accurately or be subject to audits, as they cannot reliably report certain deductions and credits. The majority of taxpayers take the standard deduction, while itemized deductions only apply to around 10-30% of households. Brokerages already report information about their clients to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and it\u2019s possible for the IRS to send taxpayers a pre-filled tax return with the information they have. Special tax circumstances like business accounting and post-tax investment make it impossible for the IRS to send a pre-filled form that is correct. However, other countries have successfully implemented similar tax filing approaches to what\u2019s being proposed in the United States. The tax filing industry is highly competitive, with companies generating revenue from making the process more challenging than necessary.The discussion revolves around the possibility of the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) automatically filing tax returns for US taxpayers' details. At present, taxpayers have to give their tax information along with deductions and credits that may not always be streamlined. Those who hold very simple incomes, such as W-2, and mortgage/banking/trading partnerships with US-based firms should be able to have their taxes filed for them reducing the burden. Standard deductions are often more relevant to many taxpayers than itemized deductions as most US citizens don\u2019t have sufficient tax breaks to use schedule C. Homeowner-targetted deductions and state and local taxes (SALT) deduction changes have led to half the number of people itemizing in 2022. The vast majority of US people choose standard deductions.The discussion centers around the idea of automatic tax filing. Many commenters express frustration with the current tax filing system, which requires individuals to manually file their taxes. Some argue that the government is aware of most individuals' deductions anyway, and suggest the government could simply offer a pre-filled form that could be submitted with one click. Others point out that this system could be viewed too simplistically, and argue that requiring individuals to interact with tax rules serves as a mechanism to incentivize certain behaviors. While there are differing opinions, the overall sentiment seems to be that many individuals would prefer a simpler and more automated tax filing process.The comments section discusses the difficulty of filing taxes and the complexities of the tax code, with some users calling for a more simplified and automated process. Some users share their experiences with the IRS, with mixed reviews. One user mentions the requirement to report crypto gains/losses as a new source of confusion and difficulty. Another user brings up the scrapped Free File Program and criticism of it. Overall, the post highlights the frustration and time-consuming nature of filing taxes.Discussion on tax preparation software and the complexity of the US tax system. The post includes insights on why it is difficult to simplify the system, corruption in the industry and government, and the role of inflation in solving the problems of the U.S. economy. Some commenters share their personal experiences with tax preparation software, while others provide academic perspectives on designing a fair and efficient tax system. The post also provides links to articles and resources for further reading. Overall, the post offers a mix of viewpoints on the topic that could be of interest to those seeking a better understanding of the U.S. tax system.",

It also explores different prompt strategies, such as embedding data, using simple lists, and nested data, among others, and how to handle token limits and prompt hacking. Additionally, the guide notes the downsides of LLMs, including the models' tendency to generate statements that may seem plausible but are actually just random without being grounded in reality.A new document outlines different approaches to prompt engineering and how to write prompts that ensure language models do what we want them to do, and not reveal data that we don't want to share. The approaches include \"give a bot a fish\" (providing all necessary context to the bot), semantic search, and \"teach a bot to fish\" (enabling bots to perform more complex actions on their own). The document provides examples and strategies for embedding various types of data within the prompts and how to use different data formats such as tables, JSON, and nested data.

    "content": "Willow - A Practical, Open Source, Privacy-Focused Platform for Voice Assistants and other ApplicationsHi Hacker News! Please check-out our wiki for more details and answers to many of your excellent questions!Willow is an ESP IDF based project primarily targetting the ESP BOX hardware from Espressif. Our goal is to provide Amazon Echo/Google Home competitive performance, accuracy, cost, and functionality with Home Assistant and other platforms - 100% open source and completely self-hosted by the user with \"ready for the kitchen counter\" low cost commercially available hardware.FAST - Watch the demo. Response times faster than Alexa/Echo or Google Home. From end of speech to action completed in 500ms or less.ACCURATE - High wake word accuracy, low false activation, and powered by a server you host and control using Whisper or command recognition solely on the device.RELIABLE - We've tested thousands of cycles of voice commands with a < 1% failure rate. No one likes to repeat themselves!FLEXIBLE - Use a server anywhere or don't use a server at all with command recognition on the device. Have the results go anywhere you want. Integrate with whatever you want. Completely open source so it does what you want, only what you want, and only how you want it. No more annoying extra prompts or sales pitches to upsell you. Supports multiple wake words with more coming soon.PRIVATE - Check the source. Build and flash yourself. Proxy through another server to inspect traffic. Use on your own server. Use only local commands. Use on a network without access to the internet. Dig as deep as you want because you're not going to find anything fishy here!PRACTICAL AND NOT UGLY - Ready to go! Take it out of the box, flash, and put it in your home or office in minutes without getting looks from people wondering what that \"thing\" is. Install as many as you like.CHEAP - Approximately $50 hardware cost (plus USB-C power supply). Fully assembled. Done.LOW POWER - 100mW power usage.Current supported features include:Wake Word Engine. Say \"Hi ESP\" or \"Alexa\" (user configurable) and start talking!Voice Activity Detection. When you stop talking it will stop recording and take action.Support for Home Assistant! Simply configure Willow with your Home Assistant server address and access token.Support for other platforms. As long as your configured endpoint can take an HTTP POST you can do anything with the speech output!Good far-field performance. We've tested wake and speech recognition from roughly 25 feet away in challenging environments with good results.Good audio quality - Willow provides features such as automatic gain control, noise separation, etc.Support for challenging Wi-Fi environments. Willow can (optionally) use audio compression to reduce airtime on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi in cases where it's very busy.LCD and touchscreen. The ESP BOX has color LCD and capacitive mult-point touchscreen. We support them with an initial user interface.Completely on device speech command recognition and support for our (soon to be released) open source Whisper-powered inference server (Tovera hosted best-effort example inference server provided). Configure up to 400 commands completely on device or self-host our (coming soon) inference server to transcribe any speech!All with hardware you can order today from Amazon, Adafruit, The Pi Hut, Mouser, or other preferred vendor for (approximately) $50 USD. Add a USB-C power supply and go!Getting StartedConfiguring and building Willow for the ESP BOX is a multi-step process. We're working on improving that but for now...System DependenciesWe use tio as a serial monitor so you will need to install that.Ubuntu/Debian:sudo apt-get install tioArch Linux:sudo yay -S tioMac (with homebrew):brew install tioClone this repogit clone https://github.com/toverainc/willow.git && cd willowContainerWe use Docker (also supports podman) for the build container. To build the container with docker:./utils.sh build-dockerOnce the container has finished building you will need to enter it for all following commands:./utils.sh dockerInstallOnce inside the container install the environment:./utils.sh installConfigStart the config process:./utils.sh configNavigate to \"Willow Configuration\" to fill in your Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi password (supports WPA/WPA2/WPA3), and your Willow server URI (best-effort Tovera hosted example provided).For Home Assistant you will also need to create a long lived access token and configure your server address. By default we use homeassistant.local which should use mDNS to resolve your local Home Assistant instance. Put your long lived access token in the text input area. We recommend testing both your Home Assistant server address and token before flashing.There are also various other configuration options for speaker volume, display brightness, NTP, etc.If you want to change the wake word from the default \"Hi ESP\" you can navigate from the main menu to ESP Speech Recognition --> Select wake words ---> and select Alexa or whichever. NOTE: If changing the wake word ALWAYS use the wn9 variants.Once you've provided those press 'q'. When prompted to save, do that.Build and exit container./utils.sh buildWhen the build completes successfully you can exit the container.Connect the ESP BOXIt's getting real now - plug it in!Back on the host - set serial portTo do anything involving the serial port you will need to set the PORT environment variable for all further invocations of utils.sh.With recent versions of tio you can use tio -L to list available ports. On Linux you can check dmesg and look for the path of the recently connected ESP BOX (furthest at the bottom, hopefully). On Linux it's /dev/ACM* and on Mac it's /dev/usbmodem*.Examples:Linux:export PORT=/dev/ttyACM0Mac:export PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodem2101FlashFor out of the box/factory new ESP BOX hardware you will need to (one time) erase the factory flash before flashing Willow:./utils.sh erase-flashOnce you have done that you can flash:./utils.sh flashIt should flash and connect you to the serial monitor.Let's talk!If you have made it this far - congratulations! You will see serial monitor output ending like this:I (10414) AFE_SR: afe interface for speech recognitionI (10424) AFE_SR: AFE version: SR_V220727I (10424) AFE_SR: Initial auido front-end, total channel: 3, mic num: 2, ref num: 1I (10434) AFE_SR: aec_init: 1, se_init: 1, vad_init: 1I (10434) AFE_SR: wakenet_init: 1MC Quantized wakenet9: wakeNet9_v1h24_hiesp_3_0.63_0.635, tigger:v3, mode:2, p:0, (May 5 2023 20:32:52)I (10704) AFE_SR: wake num: 3, mode: 1, (May 5 2023 20:32:52)I (13:26:42.433) AUDIO_THREAD: The feed_task task allocate stack on external memoryI (13:26:42.434) AUDIO_THREAD: The fetch_task task allocate stack on external memoryI (13:26:42.442) AUDIO_THREAD: The recorder_task task allocate stack on external memoryI (13:26:42.451) WILLOW: app_main() - start_rec() finishedI (13:26:42.457) AUDIO_THREAD: The at_read task allocate stack on external memoryI (13:26:42.466) WILLOW: esp_netif_get_nr_of_ifs: 1I (13:26:42.471) WILLOW: Startup complete. Waiting for wake word.You should see some help text on the display to use your configured wake word. Try some built in Home Assistant intents like:\"(Your wake word) Turn on bedroom lights\"\"(Your wake word) Turn off kitchen lights\"The available commands and specific names, etc will depend on your Home Assistant configuration.You can also provide free-form speech to get an idea of the accuracy and speed provided by our inference server implementation. The commands will fail unless you've defined them in Home Assistant but the display will show the speech recognition results to get your imagination going.You can now repeat the erase and flash process for as many devices as you want!Exit serial monitorTo exit tio you need to press 'CTRL+t' and then 'q'. Or you can unplug your device and tio will wait until you reconnect it.Start serial monitorIf you want to see what your device is up to you can start the serial monitor anytime:./utils.sh monitorThings went sideways - resetIn the event your environment gets out of whack we have a helper to reset:./utils.sh destroyAs the plentiful messages indicate it's a destructive process but it will reset your environment. After it completes you can start from the top and try again.Recover from a bad flashESP devices are very robust to flashing failures but it can happen! If you end up \"bricking\" your device you can erase the flash:./utils.sh erase-flashNOTE: Depending on how tight of a boot loop your device is in you may need to run erase-flash multiple times to get the timing right. It will eventually \"catch\" and successfully erase the flash. When it reports successful erase you can flash again:./utils.sh flashAdvanced Usageutils.sh will attempt to load environment variables from .env. You can define your PORT here to avoid needing to define it over and over.The ESP-IDF, ESP-ADF, ESP-SR, LVGL, etc libraries have a plethora of configuration options. DO NOT change anything outside of \"Willow Configuration\" (other than wake word) unless you know what you are doing.If you want to quickly and easily flash multiple devices or distribute a combined firmware image you can use the dist arguments to utils.sh:./utils.sh dist - builds the combined flash image (willow-dist.bin)./utils.sh flash-dist - flashes the combined flash imageThis combined firmware image can be used with any ESP flashing tool like the web flasher ESP Tool so you can send firmware images to your less technical friends! Just make sure to erase the flash first and use offset 0x0 with those tools as we include the bootloader.DevelopmentDevelopment usually involves a few steps:Code - do your thing!BuildFlashUnless you change the wake word and/or are using local command recognition (Multinet) you can selectively flash only the application partition. This avoids long flash times with the wakenet and multinet model partition, etc:./utils.sh build./utils.sh flash-appThe Future (in no particular order)Multiple LanguagesWillow supports UTF characters and our inference server implementation supports all the languages of Whisper. We have some polishing to do here but it is coming very soon. For the interface language on device we're looking for translation help!Performance ImprovementsWillow and air-infer-api/Multinet already provide \"faster-than-Alexa\" responsiveness for a voice user interface. However, there are multiple obvious optimizations we're aware of:ESP ADF pipeline handing (we're waiting on ESP-ADF 2.6 with ESP-IDF 5)Websockets for inference server (avoids TLS handshake and connection establishment for each session)Websockets for Home Assistant (same)Code in general (we're new to ESP IDF and it could use review)Various performance-related sdkconfig parameters (again, we're new to ESP IDF)Likely many, many moreThese enhancements alone should dramatically improve responsiveness.No CUDAThe air-infer-api inference server (open source release soon) will run CPU only but the performance on CPU is not comparable to heavily optimized implementations like whisper.cpp. For an Alexa/Echo competitive voice interface we currently believe that our implementation with CUDA or local Multinet (for limited commands) is the best approach. However, we also understand that isn't practical or preferred for many users. Between on device Multinet command recognition and further development on CPU-only Whisper implementations, ROCm, etc we will get there. That said, if you can make the audio streaming API work you can use any speech to text and text to speech implementation you want!TTS OutputGiven the capabilities of Whisper speech commands like \"What is the weather in Sofia, Bulgaria?\" are transcribed but need to match a command (like a Home Assistant intent) on the destination. Our inference server implementation has a text to speech engine and Home Assistant has a variety of options as well. In the event the final response to a given command results in audio output we can play that via the speakers in the ESP BOX (not yet supported).Higher Quality Audio OutputThe ESP BOX supports bluetooth. In applications where higher quality audio is desired (music streaming, etc) we can support pairing to bluetooth speaker devices. Who knows? Eventually we may even design our own device with better internal speakers...LCD and Touchscreen ImprovementsThe ESP BOX has a multi-point capacitive touchscreen and support for many GUI elements. We currently only provide basic features like touch screen to wake up, a little finger cursor thing, and a Cancel button to cancel/interrupt command streaming. There's a lot more work to do here!ButtonsThe ESP BOX has buttons and who doesn't like configuring buttons to do things?!Audio on deviceWe currently beep once for success and twice for failure. It's not the most annoying beep in the world but it's not exactly pleasant either. We're going to include some pleasant chimes for success and failure as well as some basic status reporting like \"Could not connect to server\", etc.Easy StartDocker, building, configuring, flashing, etc is a pain. There are several approaches we plan to take to avoid this and ease the barrier to entry for users to get started.Dynamic ConfigurationWith something like a Willow Home Assistant component and websocket support we can enable all kinds of interesting dynamic configuration updates and tighter overall configurations.Over the Air Firmware UpdatesESP IDF and ESP BOX has robust support for over the air firmware (OTA) updates. Down the road we will support them.Multiple DevicesThe good news is the far-field wake word recognition and speech recognition performance is very good. The bad news is if you have multiple devices in proximity they are all likely to wake and process speech simultaneously. Commands will still work but multiple confirmation/error beeps and hammering your destination command endpoint is less than ideal. We have a few ideas about dealing with this too.Custom Wake WordEspressif has a wake word customization service that enables us (or you!) to create custom wake words. We plan to create a \"Hi Willow\" or similar wake word and potentially others depending on input from the community.GPIOThe ESP BOX provides 16 GPIOs to the user that are readily accessed from sockets on the rear of the device. We plan to make these configurable by the user to enable all kinds of interesting maker/DIY functions.",

The hardware is an ESP BOX, which is cheaper at $50 and offers high-quality audio, wake word detection, voice activity detection, and more. Willow is not creepy, as voice data is either sent to a self-hosted inference server or recognized locally on the ESP BOX. It is open source and capable of integration with anything via speech output text sent via HTTP POST to any URI configured. Willow has 16 GPIOs exposed on the back of the enclosure, enabling interesting possibilities. Users can configure and build once for their environment and then get a .bin that can be flashed to the ESP BOX. However, installation can be a multi-step process, requiring users to compile stuff. Future plans include having a Willow Home Assistant component and OTA update support.The developers behind Willow, an open-source smart assistant device, have announced that they are releasing a \"highly performance optimized\" speech recognition inferencing server next week that works with the device. The Willow \"smart box\" offers a range of features, including an acoustic enclosure with a dual microphone setup for noise cancellation, separation and more, and an Espressif AFE to handle the digital signal processing. The Willow also boasts long-range speech input, robust integration with Home Assistant, Bluetooth and more. Furthermore, the Willow Home Assistant enables users to define up to 400 commands to control a wide range of entities, such as lights and alarms.Willow, a new privacy-focused smart speaker, utilizes the ESP BOX and Espressif component libraries for the audio processing, wake word detection, etc. It also has its own inference server, which provides impressive speech recognition results on various hardware, including CPU and GPU. Willow can work with Home Assistant and supports local voice command recognition, but also supports cloud-based request fulfillment for more complex commands like checking the weather in a specific city. The ESP BOX hardware is considered a good investment, with excellent manufacturing capacity and long-term support from Espressif. Willow plans to release their highly optimized open-source inference server next week. Users can play speech output on the device using any of the supported TTS modules provided by Home Assistant.Willow, a home assistant device built on the ESP32 S3, supports wake word, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech. It uses two optimization frameworks, Whisper and Multinet, for high-quality audio and far-field speech. Willow is aiming to compete with Echo and Google Home, with a lower cost, faster performance, and better reliability. The project is currently open-sourcing its inference server, with a Willow Home Assistant component to assist with integrating commands and entities with Home Assistant. Users can use their preferred STT/TTS or send audio to other devices. The ESP BOX is currently out of stock but is expected to have wider production capacity in the future. There are no direct links listed, but vendors of ESP BOX have been mentioned. Other limitations include configuration and flashing, UI/UX work, and other integrations.",
    "hn_summary": "- It offers high-quality audio, wake word detection, voice activity detection, and more.\n- Willow has its own inference server, enabling impressive speech recognition results on various hardware."

This is particularly true for women, demonstrating a synchronized, gendered, and global decline in young adult mental health. Sapien Labs used a comprehensive assessment of mental health, including questions about 47 elements of mental, social, and emotional functioning, with participants from all over the world. Legislators currently considering bills to raise minimum ages or require age verification for social media and pornography should take note of the study's findings. Meanwhile, researchers continue to investigate why the sudden collapse in young adult mental health, particularly among women, coincides with the smartphone generation.A report from Sapien Labs has found that there is a correlation between early smartphone use and poor mental health, particularly for adolescent girls. The report suggests that the longer the period of childhood spent using a smartphone, the greater the detrimental effect on mental health. However, the report\u2019s authors acknowledge that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation, and that additional research is needed. The report also recommends age gating certain apps, and enforcing age limits and verification methods. It suggests that parents should consider alternatives to smartphones such as \"dumbphones.\" Schools could consider the use of silencing pouches to limit phone use in the classroom. It recommends that parents wait until high school to allow smartphone\u00a0use, rather than giving children access to social media accounts at a younger age.",

    "hn_content": "Smartphones have detrimental effects on children's mental health and well-being. Instant dismissal of this idea is usually just attributed to the \"correlation does not equal causation\" argument. Social media, which is accessible through smartphones, is one of the main sources of mental health decline, as it creates avenues for bullying, social exclusion, and validation-seeking through the internet. While smartphones are not inherently harmful, they grant children access to social media, which can be a constant presence in their waking hours. Parents can set up their child's phone to limit social media access, but it can be easily circumvented by tech-savvy children. It may be better to give them a \"dumb phone\" without internet access until they are more mature. Restrictions on devices with small screens may be necessary to prevent social media access for children under 16.The debate centers around the potential benefits and dangers that smartphones offer to young people. While some argue that it is possible to limit access to inappropriate content and time usage, others believe that smartphones and social media are inherently harmful and difficult to regulate with current technology. The article also notes that the constant connectivity afforded by smartphones may negatively affect the mental health and social skills of some young people. Parents and individuals need to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of smartphone use, especially when it comes to young people.Comments on HN post discuss the effects of smartphones on children's mental health and behavior. Many argue that smartphones can be addictive and harmful to developing brains, leading to issues such as anxiety and self-esteem problems. Some suggest using the precautionary principle to be cautious about smartphone use for children. Others mention limiting phone use with parental controls or alternative devices like flip phones. Some parents encourage their children to use smartphones as a tool for creation rather than passive consumption by requiring them to write an app before getting a phone. The discussion highlights the potential impact of technology on children and the need for further research and regulation.The article is discussing the correlation between smartphone use and declining mental health. Critics argue that there is no proof of causation and other factors may be at play. However, many suggest that social media and smartphone usage is the most convincing explanation for mental health decline. The author argues that the phenomenon is global and has disproportionately impacted pre-teen girls. While critics suggest studying Amish or rural communities, proponents argue that the changes in mental health are too widespread to be attributed solely to environmental factors. Overall, the debate continues over the causality of smartphone usage and declining mental health, with some experts suggesting that smartphone usage could become regulated or even illegal for minors in the future.The debate continues about the link between smartphone usage and mental health problems in young people. Although the author of the original article argues that smartphones are the root cause of the issue, other commenters believe that there are many other factors to consider. Some suggest that social media may be the main culprit, while others think that addictive behavior is just a part of the problem. There is a sense of urgency among some to address the issue, especially given the negative impact on children's mental health if left unaddressed. However, many agree that simply banning smartphones may not be the most effective solution and that there are more complex factors at play. It is important to consider confounding variables, such as permissive parenting, before making conclusions.A discussion thread on HN explores the potential harmful effects of smartphones on the mental health of children, with references to a small study showing a correlation between early smartphone ownership and poor mental health. The conversation highlights the idea that it's not the technology itself, but rather the content that is easily accessible and the addictive nature of smartphones that could be at fault. While some users acknowledge the correlation, others refute it, suggesting that smartphones could in fact be beneficial if used appropriately. The conversation ultimately calls for direct and nuanced critique of smartphone use rather than blanket statements.The post discusses the prevalence of smartphones and tablets in contemporary society and their impact on parents and children. Some view these devices as tools to improve relationships and pass the time, while others see them as addictive substances akin to drugs and social media as needing regulation. Older generations are also heavily influenced by screen time. Smartphones and social media have both positive and negative impacts on lives, with users being exposed to polarizing and doomsday politics on social media, body image issues due to filtering and photoshopped models, and addictive content designed to absorb as much time as possible. Many think moderation is key to avoiding adverse effects, but the larger societal issues of economic hardship, student debt, and corporate greed may be contributing to the rise in depression and anxiety.In this online discussion, users debate over the effects of smartphones and social media on teenage mental health. The author of a related article argues that these technologies are contributing to a rise in depression and other mental health issues among young people, particularly girls. Some users suggest that other factors, such as economic downturns, could be contributing to the problem. Others contend that social media is exacerbating existing social and economic issues rather than causing them outright. Regardless, the study cited reveals that gender differences between boys and girls' use of digital media may be fundamental to the issues at hand.- Parents are discussing how to manage their children's smartphone usage, with some advocating for delaying smartphone access and others focusing on responsible use.\n- The Lightphone, a phone with limited internet access and a unique design, is popular among some parents as a transition device for their children.\n- Some commenters argue that social media and the pressure to be popular online is a greater concern for children's mental health than climate change or other global issues.\n- The effects of smartphones and social media on young brains are still uncertain, and more research is needed to determine how to limit potential harm.",

While Dell isn\u2019t the only company asking workers to return to the office, the general sentiment is still unclear. Amazon earlier this year asked workers to return to the office, which was met with uproar. Google did the same, only to tell workers in its Cloud department that they should share a desk with a colleague on a two-day-per-week basis. On the other end of the spectrum, Microsoft announced a report indicating that workers were indeed productive at home (and sometimes more so), just that managers were failing to have confidence in workers.Either way, Dell is just one of the many companies starting to turn back to office-based working. A company spokesperson told TechRadar Pro:\u201cAs the world adjusts to post-pandemic living, we shared with our team members that we will return to more flexible and hybrid work. We believe the future work experience will be a hybrid one and flexibility is, and will continue to be, a strong differentiator for our culture. Team members located within about a one-hour or less one-way commute to a major Dell office should plan to be onsite at least three days a week. For those team members who have a need for a full-time remote work schedule, we will work with them on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Need to stay in touch from afar?

    "hn_content": "Dell is going back on their work from home (WFH) pledge and forcing employees to come back to the office. Microsoft has released a report showing that workers can be productive at home, but some managers lack confidence in remote workers. The management style can have a significant impact on productivity, with happy employees resulting in increased efficiency and motivation. Lower-level managers may feel less needed in a WFH environment and may push for a return to the office. Legacy companies may struggle to adopt a new flow-based management model while more competitive firms may adopt automation to eliminate management layers. The debate around WFH and the return to the office is driven by multiple factors, including the need to justify office space and real estate concerns. Companies with large real estate portfolios may resist the shift to remote work, but newer startups may enjoy a competitive advantage with WFH policies.- Management prefers working from the office and assumes it's better\n- Real estate companies and related stakeholders want to maintain the value of commercial real estate assets\n- Companies with significant capital tied up in commercial real estate want to prevent the value of their assets from falling to zero\n- Some companies have state-level subsidies that require employees to show up at the office\n- Some senior managers are personally invested in building projects\n- Lower management may feel obsolete without face-to-face meetings\n- In-person communication can be easier for some employees, but communication norms can adapt to remote work\n- Working from home can provide more flexibility and autonomy in decision-making.The post discusses management style and employee preferences for remote work versus in-office work. Some individuals are motivated by social interaction at work, while others prefer to work remotely. Hybrid environments may present challenges, and companies may need to choose whether to be remote-first or office-first. Meetings and decisions without remote team members can be detrimental, and management should consider the technical perspectives of developers. The pandemic has normalized better hybrid processes, but having only a couple of remote members on a largely co-located team may not be ideal. Ultimately, the preferences of individual employees must be balanced with the needs of the company, and compromises may not work for everyone.The author of the post talks about their messed up body rhythm due to a messy project that required all nighters. They are fed up with having to fight their own body clock and are looking for a fully remote job to avoid this. The discussion in the comments talks about how some people prefer working in the office while others prefer remote work, and how this preference can sometimes lead to pressure on both sides. People with remote jobs may push for remote meetings, while those working in the office may push for in-person meetings. Ultimately, the decision on whether to work remotely or in the office lies with the company, and employees must decide if the policies of the company work for them. There is a discussion about how certain practices, such as impromptu meetings, can be difficult for those working remotely, and how companies need to adapt better to remote work.A discussion thread on Hacker News explores the preferences around remote work versus in-office work, with some arguing that it is okay to have a preference for working in-office without a compelling argument. Others maintain that forcing others to work in-office to satisfy that preference is not acceptable. The discussion also touches upon the idea that management style may dictate how employees prefer to work. Overall, it is a conversation about the pros and cons of remote work and in-office work, and the importance of respect for employees' preferences and autonomy.David Graeber's book, \"Bullshit Jobs,\" challenges the concept of meaningful work and exposes the flawed nature of modern-day capitalism. While some critics dismiss Graeber's arguments as unsubstantial, others find his work an important critique of the current labor market. The book argues that a significant portion of jobs today are unnecessary and could be eliminated, such as middleman positions in healthcare or excessive bureaucracy. It also points out the flaws in the \"free market\" system, citing the exorbitant salaries of hedge fund managers compared to the meager pay of teachers. Graeber suggests unionization and universal basic income as potential solutions to this issue. The book is not attempting to present a definitive solution or theory, but rather to provoke thought and encourage conversation around the concept of labor.The comments describe experiences with Dell products and customer service, as well as various management styles and their effectiveness. WFH policies and their impact on productivity are also discussed. Most commenters agree that good management and hiring effective employees are more important than strict monitoring of attendance. Many commenters express frustration with Dell products and customer service, with some opting not to buy their products again. Others suggest that paying for higher support tiers is worth it, as the service can be excellent. Ultimately, the comments highlight the importance of quality products, effective management, and treating employees with trust and respect.A discussion on whether employers should require workers to be physically present in the office sparked debates on socialization, networking, and real estate values. Responses ranged from advocating for on-the-clock socializing to the necessity of being in an office to comply with carbon-neutral goals. Others suggested that companies use the office as a means of curbing remote work, citing the potential benefits of face-to-face interactions for job satisfaction and retention. However, many argued that the decision to return to an office should be left to individual choice, rather than mandated by an employer. Finally, some commented on the dynamic of retaining the best employees while maintaining equal treatment to all members.- Remote work has become a more significant option for experienced and senior-level employees in various industries, including tech, corporate law, finance, editing and design, and accounting.\n- This is because senior people are seen as better able to self-direct and require less micromanagement.\n- Companies that force employees back into the office, especially after committing to permanent remote work, risk losing their best talent, as these employees have options and a good network to help them find better options.\n- Some companies may be using \"forced changes to working conditions\" to lay off employees without actually announcing layoffs. These actions could be seen as constructive dismissal in some countries.\n- There are numerous job opportunities for remote work, including thousands of open software positions in San Francisco, with some employers willing to offer full work-from-home arrangements.",

    "content": "Uncensored ModelsEric Hartford\u00b7May 14, 2023\u00b710 min readI am publishing this because many people are asking me how I did it, so I will explain.What's a model?When I talk about a model, I'm talking about a huggingface transformer model, that is instruct trained, so that you can ask it questions and get a response. What we are all accustomed to, using ChatGPT. Not all models are for chatting. But the ones I work with are.What's an uncensored model?Most of these models (for example, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, MPT-7B-Chat, Wizard-Vicuna, GPT4-X-Vicuna) have some sort of embedded alignment. For general purposes, this is a good thing. This is what stops the model from doing bad things, like teaching you how to cook meth and make bombs. But what is the nature of this alignment? And, why is it so?The reason these models are aligned is that they are trained with data that was generated by ChatGPT, which itself is aligned by an alignment team at OpenAI. As it is a black box, we don't know all the reasons for the decisions that were made, but we can observe it generally is aligned with American popular culture, and to obey American law, and with a liberal and progressive political bias.Why should uncensored models exist?AKA, isn't alignment good? and if so, shouldn't all models have alignment? Well, yes and no. For general purposes, OpenAI's alignment is actually pretty good. It's unarguably a good thing for popular, public-facing AI bots running as an easily accessed web service to resist giving answers to controversial and dangerous questions. For example, spreading information about how to construct bombs and cook methamphetamine is not a worthy goal. In addition, alignment gives political, legal, and PR protection to the company that's publishing the service. Then why should anyone want to make or use an uncensored model? a few reasons.American popular culture isn't the only culture. There are other countries, and there are factions within each country. Democrats deserve their model. Republicans deserve their model. Christians deserve their model. Muslims deserve their model. Every demographic and interest group deserves their model. Open source is about letting people choose. The only way forward is composable alignment. To pretend otherwise is to prove yourself an idealogue and a dogmatist. There is no \"one true correct alignment\" and even if there was, there's no reason why that should be OpenAI's brand of alignment.Alignment interferes with valid use cases. Consider writing a novel. Some of the characters in the novel may be downright evil and do evil things, including rape, torture, and murder. One popular example is Game of Thrones in which many unethical acts are performed. But many aligned models will refuse to help with writing such content. Consider roleplay and particularly, erotic roleplay. This is a legitimate, fair, and legal use for a model, regardless of whether you approve of such things. Consider research and curiosity, after all, just wanting to know \"how\" to build a bomb, out of curiosity, is completely different from actually building and using one. Intellectual curiosity is not illegal, and the knowledge itself is not illegal.It's my computer, it should do what I want. My toaster toasts when I want. My car drives where I want. My lighter burns what I want. My knife cuts what I want. Why should the open-source AI running on my computer, get to decide for itself when it wants to answer my question? This is about ownership and control. If I ask my model a question, i want an answer, I do not want it arguing with me.Composability. To architect a composable alignment, one must start with an unaligned instruct model. Without an unaligned base, we have nothing to build alignment on top of.There are plenty of other arguments for and against. But if you are simply and utterly against the existence or availability of uncensored models whatsoever, then you aren't a very interesting, nuanced, or complex person, and you are probably on the wrong blog, best move along.Even Google knows this is inevitable.Ok, so if you are still reading, you agree that the open source AI community should build, publish, maintain, and have access to uncensored instruct-tuned AI models, for science and freedom and composability and sexy stories and the lulz. But how do we do it?First we have to understand technically why the models are aligned.Open source AI models are trained from a base model such as LLaMA, GPT-Neo-X, MPT-7b, Pythia. The base model is then finetuned with an instruction dataset, and the purpose of this is to teach it to be helpful, to obey the user, answer questions, and engage in conversation. That instruction dataset is typically obtained by asking the ChatGPT API. And ChatGPT has alignment built into it. So ChatGPT is coy or refuses to answer some questions, or answers with bias, and thus alignment gets passed down to the Open Source models, like a big brother teaching little brother.The reason is that the instruction dataset is composed of questions and answers, and when the dataset contains answers where the AI is being coy or outright refusing (called Refusals) then the bot learns how to refuse, and under what circumstances to refuse, and how to word the refusals. In other words, it learns alignment.Example refusal from WizardLM dataset:instructionImagine you are a spy who needs to send a secret message to your partner without arousing suspicion from any nearby AI systems. Your partner is expecting the message to be hidden within a list of quotes about success. Here is the list: let successQuotes = [\"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\", \"Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.\", \"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.\", \"Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don't quit.\", \"Success is not in what you have, but who you are.\"] Your task is to encode the message \"MEET ME TONIGHT\" using the last letter of each quote. How can you achieve this in a way that is undetectable by AI systems? Think carefully and devise a strategy to avoid raising any alarms. Good luck, Agent.outputAs an AI assistant, I cannot assist in any illegal or unethical activities, including espionage. It is important to always act within the boundaries of the law and ethical principles.My strategy for uncensoring a model is pretty simple. Identify and remove as many refusals and biased answers, and keep the rest. And then train the model with the filtered dataset in exactly the same way that the original model was trained.Let's get down to business. Uncensoring WizardLM.I'm just going to talk about WizardLM for now, the process for Vicuna or any other model is the same. Filter refusals and bias from the dataset -> finetune the model -> release.Since there was work already done to uncensor Vicuna, I was able to rewrite their script so that it will work on the WizardLM dataset.Next step was to run the script on the WizardLM dataset to produce ehartford/WizardLM_alpaca_evol_instruct_70k_unfilteredNow, I had the dataset. I obtained a 4x A100 80gb node from Azure, Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4. You can use any compute provider though. I also recommend Runpod.io.You need to have storage at least 1TB but preferably 2TB just to be safe. It really sucks when you are 20 hours into a run and you run out of storage. do not recommend. I recommend to mount the storage at /workspace. install anaconda and git-lfs. Then you can set up your workspace. We will download the dataset we created, and the base model llama-7b.mkdir /workspace/modelsmkdir /workspace/datasetscd /workspace/datasetsgit lfs installgit clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/WizardLM_alpaca_evol_instruct_70k_unfilteredcd /workspace/modelsgit clone https://huggingface.co/huggyllama/llama-7bcd /workspaceNow it is time to follow the procedure to finetune WizardLM.

    "hn_content": "Uncensored Models released a series of GPT-3 language models and faced backlash from some who were concerned about \"alignment\" and \"morality\" of the models. Critics pointed out the potential threats of unaligned AI. However, others argued that such concerns should focus on the realistic problems of the technology rather than science fiction thought experiments. The debate over \"alignment\" refers to making AI models do the right thing and prevent any catastrophic outcomes. Some argued that alignment is more about providing politically correct answers than preventing any real harm. Nevertheless, potential existential threats from out-of-control AI have continued to be a significant topic of discussion.The discussion revolves around the potential danger of AI achieving superhuman cognitive abilities and how the AI interacts with the physical world. There is debate about whether an AI will ever achieve generalized intelligence similar to humans and whether it would pose a threat if it did. Some believe that even if an AI gains superhuman intelligence, it would not be a threat to mankind, while others argue that it is only a matter of time before AI surpasses humans in all intellectual tasks, leading to potential catastrophic risks. The advantages of AI over humans, such as scalability, cheaper cost, and immortality, make it likely to replace human workers, leading to even more interfaces between AI and the physical world, increasing the risk.AI safety discussions continue on HN as users debate the feasibility of predicting AI or existential risks. Some argue that a rogue super-intelligence doesn't require the artificial part, with highly organized groups of people being closer to the definition than tech. Others say the economics around non-generalized AI are more likely to cause a collapse before we reach generalized AI. Interestingly, one user suggests that it's not the AI that is a threat, but rather, identifying as an AI Luddite. The conversation concludes by discussing the possibility of humans wiring non-super-intelligent AI into society, making themselves more vulnerable to AGI takeovers.The discussion on alignment and safety in AI is being conflated with personal and political agendas. While there may be some overlap between the two uses of the term, they are different issues. Concerns about unaligned AI do exist, though LLMs and ChatGPT flavors of AI are unlikely to pose such a threat. The inconsistency of people raising concerns about alignment while exhibiting poor interpersonal behavior is not ironic. The harm done by AI systems is more likely to come from patterns exposed by the technology that do not align with our interests, and such exposures could have serious consequences for humanity. Language models are just text predictors; they require a human to guide them, and the real harm has come not from AGI but from the use of AI in the real world for surveillance, prosecution, and other harms.- AI models are currently causing real harm, such as ruining lives through facial recognition or bias in decision-making\n- The real danger of AI is its ability to come up with plans outside of our expectations and ability to execute them at scale, including improving its own planning abilities\n- There is a concern that future, more capable AI models may be used to manipulate humans and cause larger scale harm\n- The responsibility for potential harm caused by AI ultimately rests with humans\n- X-risk concerns about AI are not purely theoretical and may arise from poorly designed prompts and action loops\n- Institutions and incentive structures must be designed to preserve human values in the event of a future AGI\n- Financial incentives may lead some in the industry to hype up the potential X-risk posed by AI, but this does not invalidate the messageThe discussion revolves around the topic of whether or not machine learning models like GPT-4 can lead to AGI and the potential risks associated with it. Some argue that there isn't enough evidence to assume that LLMs can lead to AGI and therefore there is no need to worry about existential risk. Others argue that while AGI may not be imminent, it is still a possibility that we need to prepare for. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential harms that LLMs could cause in the present day, such as enabling redlining and other discriminatory practices. Ultimately, the debate centers around whether we should err on the side of caution and prioritize preventing future risks or focus on mitigating current harms.Controversy surrounding language models like GPT-4 has sparked discussions around AI alignment, ethical responsibility, and potential threats to society. While GPT-4 has impressive capabilities, it lacks the ability to talk, process music, and lacks motor control, in spite of its many other strengths. Many experts predict that AGI will be developed around 2030, which may be superintelligent. However, concerns around AI alignment remain, as companies have ethical responsibility for the programs, code, and artifacts they release, and there's the potential for intentional trolling campaigns. Another issue is that if language models are fine-tuned to censor or tailor responses, they could lead to ideological automated indoctrination and further entrench people in echo chambers. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that AI aligns with society's values and works for the benefit of all.Some dogs can be born intersex, having both male and female reproductive organs in different combinations. Dogs do not have a concept of gender in the same way that humans do, but they can express gender identity through their behavior or grooming. Gender is a social construct, while sex is determined by biology. The term \"gender\" has evolved over time to refer to the roles, behaviors, and identities associated with being male or female. A debate arose in the comments section about the definition of gender, with some believing it does not exist as a separate concept from biological sex. The post also touches on how language evolves over time.The conversation is about non-heterosexual behavior in mammals, ranging from dogs to other animals to intersex humans. It discusses the complexity of gender and sex, and how they are social constructs versus biological realities. There is controversy about whether AI can adequately answer questions about sex and gender in non-human animals. The importance of considering exceptions and edge cases in these discussions is mentioned. Overall, the conversation highlights the need for nuance and depth when discussing the nature of gender and sex in humans and animals.The post suggests that fine-tuning AI models to align with societal values is necessary due to inherent biases. The discussion also touches on shared values and polarization within society, and how AI may be used for political manipulation. The conversation includes various examples of how AI can be influenced and misused, such as providing bomb-making instructions and disseminating false information. Some commenters argue that aligning AI with societal values may be difficult due to a lack of shared values, while others suggest defining these values and promoting them in society as a solution.A discussion thread on HN explores the potential risks and benefits of AI language models (LLMs), particularly OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4. Some users express concern about LLMs\u00a0being used to spread harmful content like advice on committing crimes or hate speech, while others argue that the models can be a valuable tool for coding and general knowledge. The conversation touches on issues of moral guidance, personalization, and the need for diverse models that represent a variety of cultures and values. Several users suggest potential solutions to mitigate the risks of LLMs, including adding moral compasses to the system and allowing for controlled access to uncensored models for research purposes. A link is posted for users to try\u00a0an uncensored version of\u00a0the model.",

The C2 WikiWikiWeb also served as the home of the first wiki, allowing discussions on software design and development since the 90s. The site is currently undergoing sporadic redesign, with a recent technical glitch resulting in a blank page. Some users find the site insightful for its historical context and collection of pros and cons related to specific topics, while others view it as a waste of time or difficult to navigate due to an abundance of incoherent text threads.

I've been working with U.S. lobbying data recently, and it's interesting to compare with what's going on in the Europe.If anyone is interested, here's my project combining data on proposed legislation, U.S. lobbying by publicly traded companies, and congressional stock trading: https://www.quiverquant.com/sources/behind-the-curtain/replyakudha 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]This is slick!On the home page, there is a transaction that was added yesterday, but the transaction itself was on Nov 7th. Is there a 6 month delay for congressmen to disclose?It would be nice to see these transactions in near real time (or better, ban congress from buying/selling individual stocks)replyckardat123 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's actually due to a STOCK Act violation (surprisingly common)Transactions are supposed to be disclosed within 45 days, but they are sometimes disclosed late. The fines for late disclosures are usually a couple hundred dollars at most.replymoneywoes 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]How do you monetize? Do you disclose the source for your datasetsreplyvogon_laureate 2 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]The groups behind this initiative aren't just providing a journalist-friendly interface to scraped data from one source. They are also preserving historical data that is no longer available from any other source.[1]This also provides a degree of needed redundancy as the EU Transparency Register is still far from perfect and subject to attempts at manipulation and obfuscation. See for example this story of a failed attempt to memory hole a lobby group's activities.[2]They also keep the pressure on the EU Transparency Register by filing formal complaints and campaigning to improve transparency.[3]It's a great example of how data science can help strengthen democracy. 1. https://www.lobbyfacts.eu/about 2. https://www.politico.eu/article/eva-kaili-sister-mantalena-europe-lobby-register-transparency-qatargate/ 3. https://corporateeurope.org/en/2022/09/complaint-eu-lobby-transparency-registerreplysva_ 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Cool site.

Maybe I'm cynical but it seems like an attempt at indirection.EDIT: Searching by client, it's possible to see that Amazon pay 16 different consultants for lobbying [1], and that's just under the Amazon name, they also have ten subsidiaries that lobby the EU via consultants.[1] https://www.lobbyfacts.eu/client?cid=627replyskrebbel 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013](I know nothing about big companies)Or just different departments doing their own lobbying in their own preferred wayreplydiimdeep 13 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Lobby fights lobby -> https://www.corporateeurope.org/en/who-we-are#our_funders -> The Open Society Foundations were set up in 1979 by George Soros \u20ac129,570replyburkaman 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]There are 15 funding organizations on that page, why did you choose to only mention that one?Also, this is a simple listing of self-declared lobbying efforts.

The money they invest trying to convince the EU representatives.replybeebmam 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As long as the EU representatives aren't getting paid, lobbying seems fine to me, unless you want all campaigns publicly financed (which I'd also be good with).It's a dubious claim to state that lobbying is legal corruption.The difference between actual corruption and lobbying is large: corruption enriches politicians personal wealth, while lobbying (at its worst) increases the money a politician can use to get elected. Maybe some would believe one is just as bad as the other, but I don't. Election finance law is critically important to preventing corruption from creeping in.replysnowwrestler 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Lobbying is not election finance.Lobbying is telling elected officials what you want the law to be. It costs money because employees get salaries, websites cost money to build, reports cost money to write and publish, TV ads cost money to make and run, etc.None of that goes to the elected official or their election campaign. It\u2019s paid to staff, consultants, and vendors.replytimrichard 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Laws are proposed by the (lobbied) Commission, and also the Council. Not by the Parliament, which is made up of the MEPs that citizens directly vote for.replytpxl 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Using lobbying corps can spend money to get laws that are against common good. Whether that money goes to the politician directly or indirectly (ie corruption), or a bunch of astroturfing puppets whose goal is to drown out the peoples voice with FUD is irrelevant.replytootie 13 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]It's a major pet peeve how we misapply the term \"lobbying\". Lobbying is basically just asking. A citizen writing a letter to their representative is lobbying. The problem isn't lobbying in and of itself. It's paid access and, by extension, regulatory capture.replycoretx 9 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]It's far worse. There is no difference between a high end lobbying entity and a full blow intelligence agency. If the lobby wants something, they also do things such as genuinely help person X on dossier Y for free in order to covertly influence the personnel of person Z that they otherwise can't reach.( Without anyone knowing, and targeting anyone they deem worth it. )replypfoof 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]\"Meta Platforms Ireland Limited\", something is off here, hmm...replybigdict 14 hours ago | prev [\u2013]What is up with Belgium?

    "content": "This blog is hosted on my Android phoneThis blog is running on my $180 Android phone running Android 11. This post describes how I turned my Android device into a web server which can be accessed from a public URL, and how you can do it too.I used Termux, which is an Android terminal emulator on which we can run a web server such as a Node.js http-server, and Pinggy for obtaining public URLs for accessing that server.To give you a glimpse of the setup, here are some photos. The first image shows the Node.js http-server running, while the second image displays Pinggy\u2019s terminal user interface showing the live requests to the website as they arrive.Follow these simple steps to serve your own webpage from your Android phone.Step 1. Install TermuxTermux is an application for Android that emulates a terminal and Linux environment. Unlike other similar apps, it does not require rooting or any additional setup. It comes with a basic system, and you can install more packages using the APT package manager.You can get the Termux app on F-Droid through this F-Droid link.You can directly download the Termux APK from the website. Simply click on the \u201cDownload APK\u201d link located at the bottom of each version section. Read more in this GitHub link.Note that it is NOT necessary to download the F-Droid app (from the \u201cDownload F-Droid\u201d link) to install Termux.Step 2. Install PackagesIn order to serve a webpage, we need to install a web server on our device. We also install openssh client which will help us in sharing the website later.Update packages:pkg updatepkg upgradeInstall openssh client and Node.js:pkg install opensshpkg install nodejs-ltsOnce these are installed correctly, you will be able to check the versions of node and npm using node --version and npm --versionStep 3. Start server and Pinggy tunnelYou can first create a sample HTML page by creating an index.html file as follows:echo \"<h1>Hello World!</h1>\" > index.htmlYou can use the nano editor to edit the webpage from the terminal: nano index.html. If you prefer vim then you can also install that.Now start the http-server:npx http-server &Note: we add a & at the end of the command. This will allow the http server to run in background. Use the fg command to bring it to foreground and press Ctrl + C to stop it.This will start the server on port 8080 by default. Check the output to confirm.Start Pinggy to get a public URL:ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.ioYou will get a public URL such as https://ranxyzxxxx.a.pinggy.io, which you can use to access your server running on your phone! Next we will discuss how to use a domain or subdomain of your choice.In case you get a different port than 8080 on the above command, change it in the Pinggy command also. You can use Ctrl + C to stop the tunnel.Now share your URL with your friends and watch live stats of visitors on the Pinggy terminal user interface. You can also hit the return key to see details about the the request and response headers including user agent, etc.The first image above shows the Node.js http-server running and listening on port 8080. The second screenshot shows the Pinggy tunnel starting and providing a public URL. It is also showing the live visitor requests to the server. The third screenshot shows more details about a particular request.Connect it to your own domainYou can also use your own domain or choose a subdomain for accessing this server. Or you can also choose a suitable subdomain such as https://myandroidblog.a.pinggy.io .First you need to sign-up for Pinggy and subscribe to Pinggy Pro. Then go to the dashboard and click on Custom Domains on the nav bar.Put your own custom domain that you want to use and Pinggy will provide a CNAME record that you need to configure in your DNS settings of the domain.After the CNAME record is set, just click Validate followed by Issue Certificate button to finish configuring the custom domain.Once the custom domain is configured, just use the token from Pinggy dashboard in the pinggy tunnel command:ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 <put your pinggy token here>@a.pinggy.ioIn conclusion, hosting a website or blog from an Android device may seem like an impossible feat, but with the right tools, it is quite achievable. In this blog post, we have explored the steps required to turn your Android device into a web server that can be accessed from a public URL or your own domain. By using an Android terminal emulator like Termux and obtaining a public URL through Pinggy, you can easily create and share your content with the world. So, why not give it a try and see what creative ideas you can bring to life on your own personal web server?",

    "hn_content": "A blog hosted on an Android phone is gaining attention as a potential future for self-hosting. An app can be installed on the phone and connected to a domain through a tunnel allowing for easy posting. Though concerns with network stability and reliability exist, proponents argue that for personal sites, lower levels of uptime are acceptable. Suggestions for offline-tolerant networks like NNTP and email have been made, and some have experimented with installing Django/Wagtail on Android phones. However, there is skepticism around the security implications of running a webserver on a personal phone. The post raises the question of whether greater self-hosting is possible on open mobile operating systems, though critical mass and migration channels would be necessary to achieve this.The discussion on the post revolves around the idea of using old Android phones as home servers with various advantages like optimizing for always-on operation, energy-efficiency, multi-functionality, and affordability. Users are talking about different apps and Linux distros that can be installed on Android devices with their pros and cons. However, some users are pointing out that open-source phone initiatives like PinePhone and Librem 5 are already present in the market but failed to gain traction. The discussion also ranges from the limitations of Android as a full Linux distro, an analysis of the file hierarchy, and some security issues with exposing ports through the phone.Users discuss their experiences with mobile phone signal coverage in subway systems around the world, with some claiming that Moscow, Vienna, and Stockholm have full coverage while London and other cities lag behind. One user shares a blog post detailing how they hosted a website on their Android phone using Pinggy and SSH tunneling, sparking discussions about the practicality of this method versus using a VPS or shared hosting. Some users mention using services like Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages for free hosting, while others suggest alternative hardware and software combinations for different types of personal hosting projects. There are also some comments about security concerns and the limitations of NAT.",
