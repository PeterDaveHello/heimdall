    "content": "Alex CharltonWorkAbout / ContactDe-stressing Booking.comA commentary on the overuse of persuasion tactics in e-commerce, and a Chrome Extension to reduce them.Project: Opinion piece, Chrome browser extensionRole: Concept development, product design and engineeringDate: 23rd July 2019Update April 16th \u2013 Hello HN readers!Today this article was shared on Hacker News and the post is gathering some fantastic comments \u2013 thanks to everyone who's clicked through! For those who started here first, here's the HN link.Illusions of scarcityI use Booking.com quite a lot. Since moving to the Netherlands my family, friends and often my work are an overnight stay away. And it's great\u2013 there are a huge range of options, and a simple booking process. I'm pretty reliant on it a lot of the time.But using Booking.com makes me stressed, because regardless of how far in advance I'm planning, how many hotels are actually available or how off-season I might be, messages like the one above do their very best to make me feel like I'm dangerously close to sleeping on a bench for my forthcoming trip to Munich unless I click the button NOW! NOW! NOW!I'm sure it didn't start like this. Airbnb for example also uses messages to indicate how busy a certain destination is looking, but theirs tend to feel factual and informative, not deliberately stress-inducing. I guess it started this way at Booking.com too and in fact some of the messages shown on their site are kind of helpful...Though alarming, this message on Booking.com is useful. I can see there are two rooms left, and the last booking was less than a day ago. I need to get my skates on if I want to book this one.A more straight-forward message from Airbnb.comBut somewhere along the line perhaps these informative messages proved too effective in raising conversion rates to resist pushing further. They started to move into a darker territory, deliberately attempting to create a sense of scarcity where there really wasn't.Consider this one:What are we saying here, Booking.com? Some properties were just booked in Yamanouchi. Ok, when? For the same dates as me? And properties like the one I'm looking at have been booked. So not the one I was looking at, just one like it.This is not helpful data, it's a tenuous statistic dressed up to make me think my accommodation options are running out.The HTML code on the page marks out many of the messages using CSS classes the developers have named 'persuation' (sic).This doesn't feel like a healthy way of selling. Apart from raising my anxiety levels during what should be the enjoyable process of planning a trip, if I'm being presented not with clear availability stats but unqualified red-alert scarcity warnings then I start to mistrust the site.Of wider concern is that this approach is being increasingly emulated across the web, and various marketeers can be found applauding Booking.com for the effectiveness of their methods, touting their use to increase conversion rates.Unqualified high-demand fluff on Easyjet.comLast booked 3 minutes ago, but for what dates?Outside of the travel industry, Chain Reaction Cycles provides an example of the same tactic in creating a sense of urgencyBegone, stressy messagesI decided it was time to fix Booking.com, at least for my own purposes.I had been experimenting with Chrome Extensions for a while, and proudly launched a previous extension called Cole, which pulls objects from the V&A museum's collection, by using the new tab event trigger.Handily, Chrome extensions can also be used to manipulate the content of the web page you're currently on, and herein lay the solution. Booking.com's CSS tags in the page's code are often named for their purpose, and called things like 'persuasion', 'urgency', 'scarcity' etc. This made them easy to find and through some simple CSS overrides, hide from the page.One of the site's CSS class names, 'motivate-messages', and the CSS override in the Extension code which hides it.Hiding the horrorsIt took a few days of using Booking.com to note down all of the different nudges, alerts, notifications, pop-ups, etc (in the end there were 35 different class names across three pages, and multiple instances of each one) and get them hidden. Along with this, hotels that are already sold out for your chosen dates are hidden altogether, and various 'great value today' notices are silenced to further reduce noise.A more positive tone of voiceThe next step was to tweak some of the wording on the more useful items. Some of the language is unnecessary, scolding even. Look at this one, which appears if you hesitate on the check-out page for just a few seconds:Relax, I'm about to book!No red alerts here, but the page manages to squeeze in a notice that someone just looked for the same dates, and like a parent warning their child not to eat all the candy in one sitting, we are told \"when it's gone, it's gone\". Not helpful and not very pleasant either, especially on a page where I'm probably about to book anyway. So we can make this a bit nicer:The 'calm' emoji marks out any text that's been manipulated by the extension, so the user is awareThe red warnings that are presented when a certain room type has gone were also improved, as were items like \"See our last available rooms\" on CTAs, which was changed to a more positive \"See available rooms\".Throwing out the bathwater, not the babyAs we've said, some of Booking.com's messages are useful, if a bit alarmist. How then to allow the helpful notices to get through, while still filtering out the unhelpful ones?Taking the view that the 'x rooms left' notices are probably the best indicator of actual scarcity, I began looking at a way to allow messages to be shown if only one of a particular room was left. Unless I'm looking at the Ritz Piccadilly at New Year, knowing that there is more than one room available is probably enough for me not to panic-book.However, that might depend on a few different factors, and personal preference. The answer then, might be to provide a user-setting to set the level of filtering.4 levels of filtering are available: 0 means no 'x rooms left' notices are shown, and 4 means all are shownThis was achieved with Chrome Extension Settings, with Chrome Storage used to capture the preference. With a lot of fiddling and some Regex magic, certain notices were now allowed through depending on the level of filtering set. The warnings themselves however still looked alarmist, so a bit of work on tone of the voice and the visual was needed here too. The end result is a lot calmer and more positive:BeforeAnd afterAn overall more pleasant experienceThe De-stresser is now live and if you're using Chrome, you can add it to your browser right now, fire up Booking.com and give it a spin.It will turn your Booking.com pages from this:into this:And from this:into this:Try it out!I really don't want to see all shopping sites go down the same path, and end up in a world where conversion is king at all costs, where dark patterns are ubiquitous and shopping online leaves with me a headache and a raised heart rate.I encourage you to have a go with the extension and see how Booking.com could be, and how differently you might feel about the site once all the red alerts have gone and the 'motivational' language has been toned down.I've been using the De-stresser routinely for a while now, and I'm a much happier, calmer booker \ud83d\ude0c\u200dGet the De-stresser extension here\u200dThanks for reading. If you've any comments, suggestions, or if you find a warning on Booking.com that the De-stresser has missed, please do reach out.

    "hn_content": "Urgency messaging used by Booking.com to drive incremental business is internally hated by employees; a checkbox proposal to opt-out was made but never tried. A/B testing to increase revenue has long-term negative effects and fails to measure the impact on customer loyalty. Booking.com's pop-ups caused one user to reconsider their trip to Paris. Similar issues were had with Lyft's prompt encouraging riders to accept faster, more expensive options. Netflix's \"everyone is watching\" category is repulsive and trivially incorrect. The problem lies not with A/B testing but with a company's values. Short-term metrics overrule long-term concerns in many companies, even those with good values. Holdbacks for long-term impact measurement exist but are not always effective.HN users debate A/B testing and user experience on Booking.com, with some commenters criticizing the site's tactics and others discussing the challenges of balancing metrics and brand vision. Some HN users suggest that Booking.com's management team is largely responsible for the negative user experience, while others argue that A/B testing can lead to dark patterns on websites. Some commenters explain the limitations of A/B testing and the importance of incorporating empirical evidence without taking it as gospel. HN users also discuss the usefulness of information provided by Booking.com, with some arguing that it is often inaccurate or misleading.Users discuss Booking.com's user experience and potential use of dark patterns, with one user claiming to have found UBlock filters to make the site more bearable. The discussion touches on issues of long-term impact measurement, over-reliance on data-driven decisions, and 'poisoning the well' effects. While some users defend A/B testing, others argue that deep-seated cultural shifts and ethical considerations should not be swamped by short-term gains.Comments on Hacker News shed light on questionable practices by hotel booking site, Booking.com. Users reported manipulative techniques, such as misleading prompts about available rooms and price points, that appear designed to generate fear, urgency and doubt in customers. While some countries have implemented regulations to monitor these dark patterns, others suggest that this falls short of what is necessary given the influence of billion-dollar companies involved. Although there are some existing tools available to protect personal data and thwart dark patterns, users may require increased technical literacy to fully protect themselves.Booking.com receives mixed reviews from users, with some praising its customer service and others criticizing it for overbooking and not honoring loyalty points or reservations. Some users recommend booking directly with hotels for better dispute resolution options, while others prefer booking through the platform for convenience and guaranteed logging. One user points out that hotels, not Booking.com, are responsible for overbooking. The comments provide anecdotal evidence on both positive and negative experiences with the platform.A Chrome extension has been developed to remove booking.com's \"nudge\" tactics - which use inaccurate claims about the number of available rooms for instance - from its user interface. The extension has been welcomed by some, who find the messages manipulative, but other users are ignoring warnings or feel they are immune to such strategies. Arguments for and against the use of sites such as booking.com, against hotel group chains or personal dealings with local hotels in the mediation of travel still fill the debate's comment thread.Booking.com is a reliable aggregator that provides excellent user experience with its inventory, favorable cancellation policies and reasonable prices, though it does use high-pressure sales tactics to increase conversion rates, but to a lesser extent than in the past. The website has significantly improved its services by avoiding unremarkable web design, and offering a minimum amount of required information, displaying actual prices, and not requiring an account to create bookings. Some of the old sales tactics have been categorized as illegal in Europe. Comparatively speaking, Booking.com is better than other aggregators, though hotel owners and employees don't prefer to work with Booking.com.An HN user discusses the hotel booking experience and popular platforms such as Booking and Expedia. Some users stated that Booking.com does not have the necessary information available to them to provide reliable or factual information such as the \"x room left\" message. Many individual users said that using Google Travel to find hotels is better f followed by booking directly, as Google was just for research. TravelPerk, a website, was discussed by an HN user because it is much more user-friendly than Booking, but is only available to business clients. Finally, a Firefox version of Booking.com was requested by many users.Major global hotel booking sites are owned by only two companies, Booking Holdings and Expedia Group, and corporate travel agents and agencies. Customers booking via third-party sites pay a commission of around 10-12% on top of the hotel's price, but often receive the same rate as direct customers do. Room availability, staff service, and everything else is virtually identical regardless of whether people book directly or via a third party. There is space for small niche sites, but all are owned by one of the top two parents. Loyalty programs from hotels are generally not a scam, as a profitable guest can pay as little as one-quarter of other guests.Hotel chains offer loyalty programs to capture the inelastic demand for accommodations from frequent business travelers. While the rewards program may offer game-ified methods to regulars, it also addresses many tax issues. Hotel loyalty programs incentivize customers to book with them directly instead of large third-party booking services. Beyond dark pattern discounts, some hotels may offer better rates through loyalty programs compared to online third-party booking services. Booking.com does offer customer service, but other travelers have shifted booking directly with hotels, airlines, and car rental companies to get issues resolved.Third-party booking sites may offer better rates if the hotel allows variable pricing to capture more willingness-to-pay. Commission rates for booking sites have varied over time and can be boosted in different ways to drive up revenue. Book directly with hotels but be aware that the experience may not be as good as with booking sites. Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) offer good research, but booking directly with hotel is ideal. OTA bookings can have risks with multiple carriers and codeshare combinations, and independent tickets can be problematic in case of delays. Big brand hotels are the exception to the quality of booking directly with hotels. BDC and Expedia have bought most of their former competitors. Hotels.com has been reported as better than Booking.com for some travelers. Google Maps may offer better deals, but the UI is buggy and deals can be outdated or sold out. Booking.com has nigh-unbeatably good SEO, followed by Expedia. A few mechanisms were used to drive up commission, but this applied only to the default search results order, not to orders placed by price. Hotels can control and boost their search results at a cost, but non-preferred search didn't allow for boosting of search results.",
    "hn_summary": "Booking.com is facing criticism over its use of high-pressure sales tactics, including urgency messaging and pop-ups that can deter users. Critics argue that this approach prioritizes short-term metrics over long-term customer loyalty. Users report having found ways to work around these tactics, including using extensions to block or filter them. Meanwhile, HN users debate the merits of A/B testing, with some pointing to its potential to create \"dark patterns\" on websites. Despite these concerns, many users continue to use booking aggregators like Booking.com and Expedia, either for convenience or because they offer favorable prices and cancellation policies. Some experts caution that booking directly with hotels can offer better dispute resolution options, while others point out that commission rates for booking sites can vary widely depending on the hotel. Nevertheless, loyalty programs from hotels can provide significant benefits to frequent travelers."

Dreambooth is a fine-tuning technique for text-to-image diffusion AI models that allows for full creative control over visual outputs. The author trains a Dreambooth model on photos of their dog and provides detailed instructions on how to build a training set, run the Dreambooth training on Replicate, and generate images. The article includes examples, technical information, and community projects related to the topic.A writer experimented with a neural network model to generate dog portraits and found success with artificial intelligence-generated artwork of his dog, Queso. He discovered the outpainting technique, using OpenAI's Dall-E 2 to generate seamless extensions on his chosen artwork's top and bottom portions, but he found the results too cartoony. Other outpainting tools failed, so he resized and used automatic inpainting to fix issues and add details. The writer expressed that the project was difficult but worthwhile in the end, and Queso's portrait became a high-quality art print.An artist shares their AI-based post-processing journey, using upscaling to blow up small images for high-quality prints. Real-ESRGAN 4x+ upscaling model is preferred, although not all settings are created equal with varying degrees of compression and loss of detail. Finally, the artist sends the final image to a printer using velvet fine art paper, resulting in a professional-grade art print. Stable Diffusion, the tool used by the artist, is expected to be a game-changer for artists of all backgrounds in the world of text-to-image generative art.",

    "hn_content": "A user on Hacker News used Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth to create an art portrait of their dog, with comments offering feedback on Workflow and software used. There is pushback against AI art from the art community due to unfairness, others argue it adds value and leads to conversation around copyright, licensing and fair use. Technical progress requires adaption and people who were bad at drawing can now make pictures on a scalable level; while most art-related technology is not necessary, it is fun. Stable Diffusion base models cannot be used to imitate the styles of other artists reliably, resulting in different images to that of the prompt.Some artists who use AI to create art oppose compensation as a condition for their work because they do it purely for creative expression. However, others argue that the process of creating AI art is quite taxing and requires more effort than creating art using conventional media. Some individuals seem to dislike AI art because of fears that it undermines traditional artists' value. The fact that AI art can be created using copyrighted training data prompting potential lawsuits is yet another criticism. Nonetheless, debates surrounding the subject excite artists and make them drawn to AI.Online AI image generation tools are becoming popular for creative purposes since they don't require expensive hardware, but just basic browsing capability. Stable Diffusion and Automatic1111 are free AI tools that help improve style by releasing creative works. AI generative art creates a complicated question legally, but can be resolved by hiring good lawyers, according to the HN user quadcore. The primary readers of this post are experts who don't want to read the same thing they already know.The use of generative AI for art prompts questions about copyright law and fair use, with opinions being split on how it applies. Some argue that AI-generated art without the artist's permission constitutes copyright infringement but others point out that the training sets used for generative AI art already contain works from numerous artists. Discussions also include thoughts on the quality of AI-generated art and its potential impact on traditional artists. Despite this, the technology utilized in AI-generated art is considered a milestone and is expected to lead to further innovation in the field.An AI art generator called Stable Diffusion has been receiving criticism for using uncompensated stolen artwork as its training data. However, some critics have pointed out that the algorithm was specifically trained to produce aesthetically pleasing images, regardless of the communicative or artistic value. The discussion also compares this type of AI-generated art to that of human artists researching other works of art or taking inspiration from them. It has been noted that the model may capture specific parameters of the training data but not exact replicas of them. Additionally, clarification has been sought over whether DALL-E, another AI art generator, used licensed data. There is also some discussion about the ethics of drawing or replicating copyrighted characters.The legal status of AI-generated art as a derivative work subject to copyright is being tested in ongoing lawsuits against Stability AI. Some argue that it falls under fair use, as AI-generated images are not exact replicas of their source inputs, while others have challenged this notion. Users are split on whether AI art should be considered derivative or what should be done about the issue of copyright infringement. AI-generated art enthusiasts argue that AI-tools are not different from other art tools; meanwhile, detractors are concerned that AI art may harm the livelihoods of human artists, especially if fair use rules are weakened.An AI-generated art piece of a colorful dog has caught the attention of HN users, with some discussing the tools and resources used to create the image. While some praise the unique capabilities of Stable Diffusion and generically specific models to fine-tune the AI, others have criticized the use of copyrighted images and advocated for more respect towards the intellectual property of artists. Responses to the post include side projects inspired by the original artwork and alternative resources for creating AI-generated pieces. Overall, the discussion highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the ethics of AI-generated art and the importance of copyright laws.A user has trained an AI model, Dreambooth, to generate a portrait of his dog using 40 images. The model successfully captured the look of the dog's eyes and facial expressions, with around 30% of the generated images not resembling the dog. People can tune AI-generated outputs they wouldn't otherwise create themselves. The end result has impressed readers, although some felt other images in the author's assortment were better. The benefits of having local clients for an iterative process are highlighted. Dreambooth is available on Github.Users discuss the technical specifications needed to use dreambooth and the generative creative process, as well as the cost associated with it. One user asks about running the software on a Linux machine, and another user notes that all except one of the mentioned software runs on Linux. The post does not provide new information, though readers appreciate the process write-up.",

Fast.com was created by Netflix to provide a more realistic measurement of performance compared to speed test sites, which are usually prioritized by many ISPs. The post includes comments discussing the state of net neutrality and streaming services, the importance of testing sites, and the use of edge content caches by Netflix. Some users in Asia pay for streaming services via their carrier/ISP.Users report discrepancies in internet speed tests between fast.com and Cloudflare's tool provided by their ISP, likely because ISP's have direct peering with Netflix. Confusion between MB and Mb units still exists among some sales reps. Discussion mentions potential for ISPs to differentiate fast.com traffic by sniffing SNI hostname or temporarily elevating bandwidth limits. TLS traffic snooping is debated. Fast.com loads from nflxvideo.net with a speed-test path. VPN use is suggested to fix network manipulation by ISPs.An ex-employee of a company claims to have collected data on how Company X throttled bandwidth. The data analysis was used in court via charts presented to lawyers. The article mentions the case proceeding as if it is ongoing. The post includes comments from other Hacker News users relaying stories of ISP mismanagement and shady practices. One user suggests filing an FCC complaint, while another proposes that having one's own equipment is the best solution to ISP issues.ISPs are blaming customers for issues with their equipment, but some have had success in escalating the issue to CEOs. Net Neutrality has been a long-fought battle, with ISPs still finding ways to throttle traffic. A user has developed a high-performance metaverse client, but questions whether 5G can handle the data. Customers are wary of ISPs' use of the term \"unlimited,\" with limits often imposed. Traffic shaping may be the cause of slow internet speeds in some cases.An HN user suspects shaping in response to a post about throttled internet speed, but it's not entirely clear; they suggest several other possible causes. Another user provides analysis via Wireshark and concludes it is shaping, but suggests further testing. The post generates discussion of various wireless carriers and their performance. One user suggests trying a different APN to potentially change traffic shaping, and this ends up resolving the throttling issue, but with unknown causes.Users on Hacker News are discussing different phone carriers, with some preferring AT&T for its travel services, while others recommend T-Mobile for its international roaming capabilities. One user suggests Google Fi as a travel option, but others raise concerns about priority traffic and network management. The discussion also touches on data downscaling and the availability of eSIMs and add-on SIMs for watches. Overall, users recommend considering carrier plans carefully based on individual needs and regularly checking for updates and new options.AT&T is suspected of throttling certain traffic, such as video and Cloudfront requests. Some users have reported that their websites have been affected by this, causing loading issues. It is suggested that AT&T may be incorrectly identifying certain IP addresses as serving predominantly one type of data and throttling by destination IP, causing collateral damage. Some HN users propose solutions such as rate limits or throttling video CDN ISP/ASN's. T-Mobile is collaborating with certain video providers to downgrade video quality to preserve data allocation, which could raise privacy concerns.AT&T internet users are reporting issues with bandwidth throttling, particularly for streaming video content on CloudFront. VPNs can be used to bypass the throttling, and some users have suggested that AT&T may be intentionally throttling Netflix. While AT&T may be using traffic shaping techniques, it's noted that identifying and throttling specific types of data via deep packet inspection is much harder than it used to be due to the widespread use of encryption. In addition, there are claims that AT&T has been heavily moderating discussion of the issue on its forum.A post on Hacker News discusses potential ISP throttling of Netflix traffic, with some commenters suggesting the use of alternative DNS resolvers or changing APNs to improve performance. The post includes testing and documentation of the issue, and updates may be forthcoming. Some commenters expressed skepticism about potential nefarious intent behind the throttling, while others suggested that the issue may be due to poor routing or website optimization.

Visitors express nostalgia for the early, human version of the internet before it became a stream of unending content. Some conversation points emerge, including the loss of the community-organic way of navigating related sites and articles in the era before social algorithms. Other commenters discuss the distinction between Wikipedia and Fandom in terms of notability and writing in-universe, respectively.HN users reminisce about the simplicity and content focus of 1990s websites compared to the mass-produced, uninspired rectangles of modern sites, with responsive design being the culprit; some suggest adopting mobile-only or desktop-only sites instead of trying to satisfy both, while others believe people are realizing that not every site needs to work on mobile. A thread about responsiveness giving users headaches also led to a discussion on cookie consent popups, with a few users proposing workarounds like Consent-O-Matic, blocking unvetted JS, and selecting which cookies you want.Users discuss the mobile design and readability of a site linked in the post, with some mentioning the importance of fluid reflowable design and others expressing nostalgia for the simplicity and pixel-perfection of old school web design. While one user notes the lack of SEO and ads on sites from the late '90s, others point out that some still had ads and primitive SEO tactics. Overall, the site's consistent updates and design are praised, with some users expressing awe at the longevity of both.HN users discuss the unique charm of classic websites from the early days of the internet, with their original and creative designs that felt new and personal. They contrast these with modern websites, which have become too standardized, noisy, and focused on engagement and monetization. Some users long for more creative and aesthetic media landscapes, hoping for a return of artistic beauty and individuality online. Others argue that modern browsing requires efficiency and ease of use, and that websites owe us nothing. A few recommend neocities.com and other websites for those who miss old-school internet design.Hacker News users discuss the design of a classic website that has been updated since 1999, appreciating its nostalgic and cyberpunk feel. Some comments point out the use of older web design techniques such as image maps and cut-up layouts. The website's updates spanning multiple decades are also noted.

The dishwasher is set to perform the wash and dry cycle. The salmon is broiled, steamed and baked.[1] An advantage of the method is that cooking is odorless.[2] There is nothing preventing one from washing the dishes at the same time, provided that the package is tight enough.[1]Safety[edit]Dish washers do not have temperatures as consistent as stoves so there is a risk the fish will not cook completely.[3] How to Cook That tested a similar recipe, placing the salmon in a jar of broth instead of foil packets, and the dishwasher did not heat the fish to a high enough temperature.[4]History[edit]Originating in the United States, this preparation of fish was demonstrated by Vincent Price in 1975 when appearing at The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Price presented the dish as \"a dish any fool can prepare\".[5][6]Preparation of the dish has been presented in the Canadian show The Surreal Gourmet hosted by Bob Blumer in 2002.[7][8] Reports about the dish have been published by The Wall Street Journal,[9] NBC,[10] BBC,[11] Vogue[12] CHOICE[13] and CBS News which interviewed Kym Douglas about the book The Black Book of Hollywood Diet Secrets where the dish is presented.[14]References[edit]^a b c Woodford, Riley (2010-08-19). \"Dishwasher Salmon\".

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post about cooking salmon in a dishwasher is gaining attention. Some users debated the safety of the cooking method, with one user citing a YouTuber's investigation on the topic. The debate involved the safety of the temperature of the dishwasher and whether it aimed to kill parasites that may be present in raw fish. However, users in the food safety industry undermined some claims from the YouTuber's experiment. One called out the government's role in overcooking food, and another stated that restaurants generally follow their suppliers' guidelines on food safety. Ultimately, the safety of dishwasher cooking depends on multiple factors, but it appears to be safe in certain conditions.Freezing fish is not always about destroying parasites, it is mainly done to prevent microbe risk, and the FDA has a guideline on the temperature fish must be frozen down to. Ahi Tuna and farmed Atlantic salmon have low to no parasite risk, but it's not advisable to eat wild salmon sashimi without freezing. Most salmon-related illnesses come from processed salmon due to cross-contamination. You don't need to cook salmon to any temperature as they don't inherently have food-borne pathogens, and people eat it raw. Ann Reardon's channel and how she pivoted from baking to debunking fake recipe videos. Youtube is not a reliable source according to Wikipedia, but exceptions are sometimes made. Salmon needs to be at least 63\u00b0C for 15 seconds to kill bacteria, and eaten soon after cooking to mitigate spores that may grow days after.A recent discussion on Hunter News included a debate about cooking salmon to a safe temperature without overcooking it. While the standard safe temperature is 65\u00baC, bacteria die off at much lower temperatures, but the rate of bacterial death increases with higher temperatures. Users recommended curing the salmon overnight before cooking, or researching food temperature charts to measure safe cooking times. Some varieties of salmon are sashimi-grade, but not all, and it is recommended to avoid raw freshwater fish. The best cooking advice for new kitchen tools such as dishwashers is to cook on the side of safety.Some Hacker News users discuss the preparation of raw fish for sushi and point out that FDA guidelines require most fish (except for tuna) to be frozen to kill bacteria and parasites. Some users mention that a solution of brine or vinegar can also help to reduce bacteria. Some users also discuss the storage of eggs, with some stating that eggs do not necessarily need to be refrigerated if they are stored properly, although others point out that American eggs are often prepared differently from eggs elsewhere in the world. Finally, one user suggests taking Ivermectin or other parasite killers once or a couple times per year to prevent parasitic infections.Raw fish safety explained in comments on Hacker News. Farmed salmon, tuna, and mollusks are generally deemed safe due to FDA controls, but other fish carry potential risks depending on one's personal risk tolerance. Flash freezing and proper preparation techniques can mitigate risk when eating raw fish. Certain exceptions, including tuna and farm-raised fish, do not require freezing. Some raw fish can contain parasites and must be either cooked or frozen. Raw meat can be safe but carries risks. Household water filters can effectively remove bacteria.An HN user discusses the efficiency of filters for tap water, noting that improving something from good to excellent requires a lot of work, resources, and specialized equipment. Another user comments on the safety of mixing formula with water that isn't hot enough, citing different sources and debates on the issue. Lastly, some users share anecdotes and opinions on unrelated topics such as heating food for babies and the smell of bitumen heaters.An HN user leaves a sarcastic comment about the smell of progress being linked to exposure to dangerous chemicals, to which other users respond with their own comments about cooking methods and farm dangers. No central argument or factual presented.Sous vide cooking is a method that involves vacuum sealing food and cooking it in a water bath at precise temperatures. An HN user points out that the vacuum sealing is for temperature control. The reverse sear method mimics temperature control but is done in an oven. Some users explore why Eastern Europeans overcook their meat, citing quality and safety concerns. There is also discussion of different cooking methods and their nuances, though the practical application of cooking under a vacuum is called into question.Food can tolerate imprecise temperatures in cooking, and the default dishwasher program is too hot for farmed salmon. However, it can be used as a poor man's sous vide. Additionally, applications for YC Summer 2023 are now open.",

The thesis is available here and should answer most of the design decisions behind the engine.Where do I start?Check out the Blender tutorials on creating your own game worlds. The main.cpp file contains a general overview of the game and engine. The most important Pico3D feature is going to be the render_triangle() function. This function basically does all of the hard work of transforming a triangle (in world space) and pushing it into the renderer (no deep engine/graphics knowledge needed!).See the test models and the render_model_16bit functions for an example on how to put in your own meshes.How big can the world be?The included game has a grid size of 12x12 chunks (each chunk is 10x10m in size -> world size of 120x120m).Right now the chunk cache uses an 8 bit int for each direction limiting the world size to 256x256 chunks (2.56x2.56km). This can be extended if needed.Unless heavy use of repeat/procedurally generated chunks is made use of the binary is also likely to exceed 16MB. Plenty of creative procedural tricks are possible to get around this issue as well however if you want the next Daggerfall.How are the NPCs loaded in/out?Right now the game simply simulates all 50 NPCs and 50 zombies at the same time since that is pretty cheap compared to the actual rendering.It's also more realistic that way and uncovers any big issues in the self-made RNG ;).Rendering is optimized with distance and view frustum culling.What is the Gamescom version of the game?This version was used to demonstrate the engine at Gamescom and replaces the zombies with balloons to conform to USK ratings. It is left in the codebase to show how to make a possible variant of the game for developers.What were the inspirations for the game world?The city itself was inspired heavily by Cyberpunk 2077 and the Yakuza series of games. The outskirts have a Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild influence.Why are there so many redundant functions in certain code areas like the zombie logic?Divisions are relatively expensive on the RP2040 if performed in quick succession such as when interpolating vertices for mesh blending.Performance can be tested by changing the NPC or Zombie walk animations to a non power of 2 number such as 127, forcing the compiler to apply actual divisions instead of cheaper bit shifts.As the compiler does not know during compilation time if a variable will be a power of 2 or not, it will simply apply divisions regardless if the value is not fixed as it is now.There are likely ways to improve on this code redundancy but I have not taken the time to think of one yet (don't forget, function calls themselves are relatively expensive).",

    "hn_content": "A new 3D game engine called Pico3D has been developed for the RP2040 microcontroller, which has a 120x120px display. One Hacker News (HN) user notes that a per-triangle scanline rasterizer method might be more performant, but sorting up to 1500 triangles for each scanline may have its own drawbacks if many are tiny. Another HN user points out RP2040 Doom, which can run Doom on the RP2040. Despite not having the floating point support, neither does it matter much. The PicoSystem device that houses the RP2040 lacks enough memory and video RAM, but it renders one line of output and DMA's it to the display. Other comparisons with specs of earlier PCs and available alternatives are also made but often do not match the quality of the PicoSystem's ergonomics, form-factor, and quality of the controls. The SDK is well thought-out and simple and has a unified API - micropython, c/c++.The RAM chips on Raspberry Pi Picos have a frame buffer that swaps with VSync, allowing an application processor to write into the frame buffer. Hackers are enthusiastic about creative ways to use the Pico/RP2040, and the Analogue Pocket may be one of them. Limited hardware being pushed to its limits is a fan favorite, making this project ideal for the front page of Hacker News. The unique application of RAM chips in the frame buffer makes this article stand out on the tech site.",

    "content": "Joanne Jacobs2 days ago2 min read'Algebra for none' fails in San FranciscoThe goal was equity. The result: Meh.Frustrated by high failure rates in eighth-grade algebra, San Francisco Unified decided in 2015 to delay algebra till ninth grade and place low, average and high achievers in the same classes. The goal was to improve achievement for black and Hispanic students, preparing more for advanced math.That didn't happen, concludes a study by a team of Stanford professors. \"Large ethnoracial gaps in advanced math course-taking . . . did not change.\" Black students aren't more likely to enroll in AP math; Hispanic enrollment increased by 1 percentage point. Overall, there was no change in the number of students receiving credit for advanced math classes, or the number taking math in 12th grade. A proposed new California math framework encourages other districts to copy San Francisco's math reforms, for which the district claimed success, writes Sarah Schwartz in Education Week. Math reformer Jo Boaler, a Stanford education professor and advocate of the new framework, co-authored a commentary, How one city got math right, in the Hechinger Report. Test data from 2015 to 2019 shows that racial \"achievement gaps have widened,\" wrote Tom Loveless last year. The district \"is headed in the wrong direction on equity.\" Black and Hispanic 11th-graders in San Francisco earned \"appalling\" scores on the state math test, \"about the same as or lower than the typical fifth-grader\" in the state. The district had bragged that algebra failure rates had dropped. Families for San Francisco, a parent group, analyzed the data: Failure rates dropped after the district dropped the end-of-course exam. \"Algebra for none\" made it harder for achievers to succeed without helping low achievers, writes Fordham's Jeanette Luna. Families face a \"nightmare of workarounds\" to get their high-achieving children on track for advanced math, write Rex Ridgeway and David Margulies in a San Francisco Examiner commentary. \"Families with resources turn to fee-required online algebra 1 courses in eighth grade, outside the public school system, or enroll their kids in private schools,\" they write. Those who can't afford it must take a compression class that combines advanced algebra and pre-calculus or take a year of double math to get on track for AP Calculus.The district \"will take credit for my granddaughter\u2019s mathematical success as proof their policies work,\" one of the authors writes. \"In reality, this took two of her summers and nearly $2,000.\"A group of parents have filed a lawsuit against San Francisco Unified charging the math policy violates state law by denying access to advanced math to disadvantaged students, reports Allyson Aleksey in the San Francisco Examiner. SFUSD \u201ckids with privilege can advance in mathematics, and those without privilege cannot advance,\" said lead petitioner Annesa Flentje. \"Ironically, SFUSD made these changes in the name of equity, but putting in barriers to accessing (advanced courses) is not equitable. . . . those with privilege are opting into private school.\u201d On Feb. 6, Judge Carrie Zepeda ruled in favor of Palo Alto parents who brought a similar lawsuit. detrackingalgebraSan Franciscoequityachieversmath reform0 views0 commentsPost not marked as liked",

An HN user suggests incentivizing academic and extracurricular success by linking it to financial reward to teach valuable lessons about finance and tie action and achievement to positive outcomes. However, others argue that this could be abused by households with irresponsible parents and that subsidizing higher education through credit systems to pay for college later would be a better solution. Some wealthy suburbs are also cutting advanced courses, but many argue that colleges expect students to take the most advanced curriculum available.High schools in Palo Alto are dropping advanced math courses like linear algebra, which HN users say help students understand real-world applications of math. This has led to criticism of school district policies, which some see as sacrificing education for equity. Some HN users suggest that students should be allowed to directly enroll in college, rather than waste time on classes they find useless. There is a belief that advanced math is not hard, but rather a tool that must be mastered. Some high schools provide for dual enrollment courses, but others hope to end formal support of the program.San Francisco's policy based on critical theory is increasing inequality. Resources are scarce, and those without it aren't receiving any new benefits. Increasing resources can also widen the inequality gap. SF is not offering Algebra, causing poor Black and Hispanic students to lack in math in the future. The rich can fund education for everyone, but unless the school system changes, not everyone will benefit. Not belonging to any of the identity groups makes it harder to leave poverty. Some students need to be left behind. Russian School of Math is a popular after-school activity for ambitious parents. Bureaucracy is crudely affecting the pathological cultural factors, and California cannot solve such problems. Californian families face a \"nightmare of workarounds\" to get their children on track for advanced math.A judge ruled in California that schools must allow all students to learn math, receiving mixed reactions. An HN user pointed out how the Berkeley math system works with advanced math classes. There is a debate surrounding San Francisco's \"reform\" approach to math compared to Berkeley's method. One HN user shared a personal experience with common core math leading to bad outcomes. It was noted that Berkeley's math education scene is celebrated despite having a terrible reputation. Demographics and socio-economic factors make it difficult to compare math outcomes accurately. Accelerated paths are comparably easy to access.High school physics courses vary in their use of calculus; some offer calculus-based physics courses such as AP Physics C, while others use algebra instead of calculus. However, calculus can be easily taught as part of a physics course. There are differing opinions on the role of parents in education, with some believing the education system should be designed to not rely on parental support. Some suggest solutions such as offering tutoring and paying students to tutor others. Ultimately, the need for math education goes beyond basic arithmetic to include skills such as understanding compound interest for financial management.A thread on Hacker News debates the usefulness of traditional math education in K-12 curricula. Some commenters argue that traditional math education focusing on memorization of equations doesn't teach real-world applications of math concepts or foster curiosity, while others argue that math education provides a base for using math outside of maths itself, e.g. for studying physical sciences or engineering. Another commenter points out that the education system only ever had political goals, which have shifted over time, and that there is no mechanism for non-superficial reform. However, some commenters argue that we need to present math as a game that's actually fun to do, rather than a series of seemingly arbitrary rules to memorize.A user asks how to develop abstract thinking skills, using the example of measuring a boulder to be moved. Another user argues against \"backwards policies\" of removing advanced classes in California public schools in the name of equity, leading to parents moving their kids to private schools. Some users discuss the funding implications of students moving to private schools. A user asks how to keep track of what's being taught in schools, and others suggest talking to principals and other parents. A debate about the importance of algebra and calculus education ensues, with some arguing it fosters abstract thinking skills and logical thinking, while others argue it's too focused on calculation rather than deeper understanding.A Hacker News thread discusses the usefulness of traditional mathematical training and suggests that teaching of mathematical reasoning and understanding is more important; an HN user mentions a powerful AI tool that is able to assist with complex mathematical problems but struggles with basic arithmetic; a user also mentions that algebra should not be dropped from curriculums as it is a necessary foundation for more advanced math; discussions ensue about whether or not equity in mathematics education can be achieved and what the root causes of divergent outcomes are; Lockhart's Lament proposes very small class sizes for effective teaching of mathematics; some users suggest teaching math through engineering problems.A discussion on the ineffectiveness of increasing funding to shrink class sizes in schools leads to a debate on the benefits of smaller classes and their impact on student achievement. Some users mention studies that show that smaller class sizes do not necessarily improve student outcomes, while others argue that reducing class sizes can give teachers more time to provide personalized instruction. One user suggests that the root cause of the problem may be a lack of math expertise among k-12 teachers. Another user accuses policymakers of ignoring evidence-based research in their pursuit of political ideology. Finally, there's an interesting discussion on the benefits of online education and how it has helped students receive quality education from good teachers across the world.San Francisco Unified School District's decision to delay algebra until ninth grade and place low, average, and high achievers in the same classes has been controversial, with some criticizing the move as detrimental to students' math skills. Comments express concerns that students who excel at math are at a disadvantage, and suggest that instead of pushing data analysis and statistical modeling, fundamental concepts like algebra and polynomials should be taught as early as the fifth or sixth grade. There are queries about the K-12 syllabus of the former Eastern Bloc and how they taught mathematics teaching concepts early on. A tutoring system, Russian Math, teaches reasoning and abstraction and has been successful. There were links provided to a news report of a private-tutor ban implemented in China.The fear of unemployment due to scarcity of opportunities causes a rat-race, with the well-off managing with workarounds. The city of Hangzhou offers a reward for tips on illegal tutoring. Delaying algebra until grade 9 despite passionate students is illogical. The abandonment of meritocracy leads to the natural conclusion faced today. Comparisons to Harrison Bergeron are made. Some people take lessons from fiction, necessitating pushing for equality across the board. Hacker News comments reveal some users\u2019 racist behaviors. Comments on the site are anonymous and a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d The cultural impact of Harrison Bergeron and 1984 is discussed.",

    "content": "FSF Slams Google Over Dropping JPEG-XL In ChromeWritten by Michael Larabel in Free Software on 16 April 2023 at 06:46 AM EDT. 61 CommentsLast October Google engineers decided they would deprecate JPEG-XL support in Chrome over some debated rationale for the move. Even amid the community uproar they went ahead to drop the JPEG-XL support. The Free Software Foundation has finally commented on the matter.This past week the Free Software Foundation finally commented on Google's decision to deprecate JPEG-XL and the FSF says it emphasizes the need for browser choice and free media formats.Greg Farough of the FSF wrote:\"While we can't link to Google's issue tracker directly because of another freedom issue -- its use of nonfree JavaScript -- we're told that the issue regarding JPEG-XL's removal is the second-most \"starred\" issue in the history of the Chromium project, the nominally free basis for the Google Chrome browser. Chromium users came out of the woodwork to plead with Google not to make this decision. It made it anyway, not bothering to respond to users' concerns. We're not sure what metric it's using to gauge the interest of the \"entire ecosystem,\" but it seems users have given JPEG-XL a strong show of support. In turn, what users will be given is yet another facet of the web that Google itself controls: the AVIF format.As the response to JPEG-XL's deprecation has shown, our rallying together and telling Google we want something isn't liable to get it to change its mind. It will keep on wanting what it wants: control; we'll keep on wanting what we want: freedom.\"Those interested in the Free Software Foundation post in full can find it on FSF.org.61 Comments",

    "hn_content": "The Free Software Foundation has criticized Google for dropping JPEG-XL in Chrome due to lack of interest from the ecosystem, despite adoption by major image editors. An HN user points out that JPEG-XL was an experimental format added to Chrome in April 2021 and had better support at the time of its removal than HEIC. However, some users believe old PNG and JPEG are good enough for most purposes, with little downside to using them, while others prefer codecs like AVIF or Webp for video, with JPEG-XL's general-purpose format lacking such incentive. Industry support and interest in JPEG-XL were noted, but adoption relies on all major browsers supporting it, which was not the case for Apple.Google is defending themselves from criticism after removing JPEG XL support from Chrome, which was partly derived from Google Technologies. A few commenters argue against Google being singled out for not pushing forward file formats, and mention that no OS supported it natively. JPEG XL is a general-purpose image format, whereas WebP has one specific purpose: web delivery of ephemeral images. Despite the capabilities of modern browsers, nice general-purpose image formats are being relegated to individual vendor-centric ecosystems, preventing widespread interop.An HN user is advocating for browsers to provide basic range-mapping color transfer function tools and pan-zoom viewing mode for high bit-depth images in an image tag natively. A debate arises regarding Google not supporting JPEG XL, with some arguing that Google should evaluate and pick better formats, while others defend Google's right to choose what to support. Several companies like Adobe, Facebook, Intel, and Shopify have advocated for JPEG XL inclusion in Chromium, while others argue that there was not enough interest for it. The FSF and some engineering teams accuse Google of being anticompetitive regarding image codecs. Some users question Google's argument that there wasn't enough interest in JPEG XL, as it was always behind an optional flag.FSF has a tendency to make extreme statements, which can end up harming their cause overall, according to some HN users. Rather than persuading people on one issue, they also feel the need to include their stance on other unrelated issues, which turns people off. The FSF seems to cater to true believers and not the general public, even though they may agree with them on certain issues. While the FSF has some great principles, their communications don't seem to be calibrated for the average reader, and they lack optimization on reaching a larger audience. FSF's uncompromising idealism, while respected, can also leave them out of touch with current issues in the tech industry, such as how to deal with SaaS models. Some HN users question the usefulness of implementing licenses or best practices to deal with web-based software. Google's market dominance is causing many to block Google's code, which FSF supports. FSFE, EFF, and EDRI are organizations that are deemed more relevant than FSF.Comments on the website design highlight the use of intrusive code, but some users question if non-intrusive browsers are acceptable to access JavaScript sites. The FSF supports JavaScript as long as it is properly licensed, unlike proprietary software. The debate shifts to Stallman's objection to taxes, which he solves by using xournal for filling in PDF forms, but the use of printing stores with non-free software is questioned. The discussion moves to whether PostScript has the same copyright and freedom issues as JavaScript, and how sites with JS blobs are not open for modification. Users suggest scrapers or reverse-engineered free software clients as solutions. Lastly, the article deals with the claims against AVIF, which are questioned because Google is not the sole member of the Alliance for Open Media.MPEG charging high fees for H.265 led to companies seeking out a free alternative, resulting in the development of AVIF and JPEG XL. AVIF's limitation to 4K image sizes is a significant drawback, while JPEG XL supports larger image sizes up to 1,073,741,823x1,073,741,824. Despite this limitation, AVIF does support up to 12 bits per channel and 65,536x65,536 dimensions. MPEG has attempted to build standards for royalty-free video encoding, but their standardized codecs are not actually royalty-free.AVIF supports 12-bit encoding and most of the AV1 software decoder implementations, with 65k x 65k and 36-bit color as the limit. Despite JPEG XL having greater capacity, AVIF is still suitable for most end-user uses. There have been complaints of JPEG XL spreading misinformation about AVIF, leading to dev drama. JPEG XL is under an open patent license, but Google is more likely to defend AVIF as it contributed significantly to its development. FSF has criticized proprietary JavaScript in various bug tracker links, and Mozilla took a while before supporting webp. JPEG is currently patent-free. Passionate JPEG-XL supporters can use the format on their sites using the jxl.js bundling approach, but it comes with added time and bandwidth costs. All in all, AVIF has features and advantages that make it more desirable for most end-users.Google discontinues support for AVIF and WebP in Chrome, leading to criticism from the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Some users argue that Google's JPEG-XL approach is not sufficient and that the format has its downsides, including issues with direct linking and impractically slow transcoding. HN users point out that JPEG-XL is not solely a Google creation and that the AOM avif specification does not even include Google. Overall, the debate centers around the viability and adoption of new image formats in the ecosystem.",
    "hn_summary": "Google faces criticism from the Free Software Foundation for discontinuing support for JPEG-XL in Chrome despite its adoption by major image editors. Some users argue that older formats like PNG and JPEG are sufficient, while others prefer codecs like AVIF for video.
