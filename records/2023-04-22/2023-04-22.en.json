        "content": "ESPA\u00d1OLIn a free society, people should not have their private correspondence constantly examined. U.S. lawmakers, we would hope, understand that individuals have the right to a private conversation without the government looking over their shoulder. So it\u2019s dismaying to see a group of U.S. Senators attempting for a third time to pass the EARN IT Act (S. 1207)\u2014a law that could lead to suspicionless scans of every online message, photo, and hosted file. In the name of fighting crime, the EARN IT Act treats all internet users like we should be in a permanent criminal lineup, under suspicion for child abuse. TAKE ACTIONPROTECT OUR PRIVACY\u2014STOP \"EARN IT\"What The New \u201cEARN IT\u201d DoesThe EARN IT Act creates an unelected government commission, stacks it with law enforcement personnel, and then tasks it with creating \u201cbest practices\u201d for running an internet website or app. The act then removes nearly 30-year-old legal protections for users and website owners, allowing state legislatures to encourage civil lawsuits and prosecutions against those who don\u2019t follow the government\u2019s \u201cbest practices.\u201d As long as they somehow tie changes in law to child sexual abuse, state lawmakers will be able to avoid longstanding legal protections, and pass new rules that allow for criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuits against websites that don\u2019t give police special access to user messages and photos. Websites and apps that use end-to-end encryption to protect user privacy will be pressured to remove or compromise the security of their services, or they\u2019ll face prosecutions and lawsuits. If EARN IT passes, we\u2019re likely to see state lawmakers step in and mandate scanning of messages and other files similar to the plan that Apple wisely walked away from last year. There\u2019s no doubt the sponsors intend this bill to scan user messages, photos, and files, and they wrote it with that goal in mind. They even suggested specific scanning software that could be used on users in a document published last year. The bill also makes specific allowances to allow the use of encryption to constitute evidence in court against service providers. Bill Language Purporting To Protect Encryption Doesn\u2019t Do The JobUnder pressure, the bill sponsors did add language that purports to protect encryption. But once you take a closer look, it\u2019s a shell game. The bill clearly leaves room to impose forms of \u201cclient-side scanning,\u201d which is a method of violating user privacy by sending data to law enforcement straight from user devices, before a message is encrypted. EFF has long held that client-side scanning violates the privacy promise of end-to-end encryption, even though it allows the encryption process to proceed in a narrow, limited sense. A 2021 paper by 10 leading technologists held that client-side scanners are a danger to democracy, amounting to \u201cbugs in our pockets.\u201d The Chat-Scanning Software Being Pushed By This Bill Doesn\u2019t WorkBut the available evidence shows that scanning software that looks for Child Sexual Abuse Material, or CSAM, is far from perfect. Creators of scanning software say they can\u2019t be fully audited, for legal and ethical reasons. But here\u2019s the evidence so far: Last year, a New York Times story showed how Google\u2019s CSAM scanners falsely accused two fathers of sending child pornography. Even after the dads were explicitly cleared by police, Google kept their accounts shut down. Data being sent to cops by the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)\u2014the government agency that will be tasked with analyzing vastly more user data if EARN IT passes\u2014is far from accurate. In 2020, the Irish police received 4,192 reports from NCMEC. Of those, only 852 (20.3%) were confirmed as actual CSAM. Only 9.7% of the reports were deemed to be \u201cactionable.\u201d A Facebook study found that 75% of the messages flagged by its scanning system to detect child abuse material were not \u201cmalicious,\u201d and included messages like bad jokes and memes. LinkedIn reported 75 cases of suspected CSAM to EU authorities in 2021. After manual review, only 31 of those cases\u2014about 41%\u2014involved confirmed CSAM.The idea of subjecting millions of people to false accusations of child abuse is horrific. NCMEC will export those false accusations to vulnerable communities around the world, where they can be wielded by police forces that have even less accountability than law enforcement in the United States. False accusations are a price that EARN IT supporters seem willing to pay. We need your support to stop the EARN IT Act one more time. Digital rights supporters sent more than 200,000 messages to Congress to kill earlier versions of this bill. We\u2019ve beaten it twice before, and we can do it again.There are currently dangerous proposals that could mandate client-side scanning schemes in the U.K. and European Union, as well. But we don\u2019t need to resign ourselves to a world of constant surveillance. In democratic nations, supporters of a free, secure, and private internet can win\u2014if we speak up now. TAKE ACTIONPROTECT ENCRYPTED MESSAGING\u2014STOP \"EARN IT\"",

        "hn_content": "A bill called EARN IT has returned, which seeks to introduce message and photo scanning. Many people argue that the \"you have nothing to hide\" argument is a fallacy because people can abuse their power. Some examples of the abuse of power have been given, such as NSA staff using spy tools on their spouses and police accessing Ring cameras without a warrant. People have also raised various questions about the storing of data and its potential misuse, such as how it will be accessed and who will be responsible, as well as the impact on individual rights and society's ills. The bill is being justified by the protection of children, but people question the effectiveness and burden of proof. The focus is on policy and legislation, rather than technical defence.No meaningful content to provide a summary.The post contains various comments about privacy and the use of technology for illegal activities, including the use of crypto. Commenters argue that the \"I have nothing to hide\" argument is flawed, that privacy is a fundamental human right, and that giving up privacy can be dangerous. They express concerns about potential abuse of power by government and organizations, and the unfairness of one-sided data collection. The post does not contain any new or exciting tech developments or releases.The comment thread discusses the importance of privacy as related to government control and data collection. Various examples are given to illustrate the importance of privacy and the potential for abuse. The consensus is that privacy and security are closely linked, and individuals should be cautious with their personal information. Snowden's quote is mentioned, and the importance of a robust security system is highlighted. The conversation invites readers to think about their own personal privacy concerns and what they would be willing to tolerate from the government.Privacy and security are not the same thing, despite overlapping in some ways. Examples of privacy concerns include moving to a new place and starting over, anonymity in public spaces, and the ability to recover after being punished for breaking the law. It's possible to advocate for privacy for its own sake, but it's important to recognize that privacy and security are also related. Some argue that less privacy can lead to greater security for large groups of people, but this can create trade-offs between security and privacy. Manipulated leaked data can be very dangerous.\nThere is no meaningful content in this post.Comments on a tech news article express concerns over government surveillance and erosion of privacy. \n\n- Many people express dissatisfaction with constant attacks on privacy \n- Users reminisce about the \"good old days\" when major websites would blackout over privacy-related legislative proposals \n- Some users suggest that large social media companies may benefit from new privacy laws as it may isolate smaller competitors \n- Others suggest that vigilance, push back, and counter-proposals are critical \n- Many express concern that new generations are being conditioned to not care about privacy \n- Discussion of historical cycles emerged in the comments, with some disagreeing, while others referring to Social Cycle Theory\n- Some users suggest that we must stop purchasing from companies that are not privacy-compliant \n- Lastly, it is noted that for-profit companies prioritize shareholder value over fighting privacy battles.No meaningful content.Online discussions about the EARN IT Act resulting in arguments over the freedom of speech and government control; many suggest complete transparency for government officials and their financial dealings; criticism of US 'patriotism' and government waste.A group of senators introduced a bill called the \"EARN IT Act,\" which critics claim will undermine privacy and encryption. Commentators have taken issue with the bill's potential impact on the Fourth Amendment and argue that it is being pushed by politicians who are themselves ignorant of the technology. Some have called for\u00a0a mandatory retirement age for politicians, while others suggest building alternative communication networks that cannot be easily surveilled. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, one of the bill's co-sponsors, has been criticized for her lack of knowledge about encryption technology.The post discusses various topics related to politics in the United States, including the election process, incumbents, age limits, and the role of technology in politics. There is no new or exciting information or releases in this post. The article discusses the reasons behind not having policies regarding age limits in politics and the drawbacks of incumbency. It also highlights the cognitive dissonance in government leaders' stance on data privacy and encryption measures versus cybersecurity concerns. There is also a discussion around the need for more tech-oriented people to enter politics.Senators Diane Feinstein, Lindsey Graham, and Richard Durbin have introduced a new bill, the EARN IT Act, which aims to force internet companies to prove they are taking online child sexual abuse seriously. The act threatens to take legal protection from internet companies if they are found not to be taking adequate action to prevent online child abuse. Critics of the bill claim that it could undermine encryption, as it would enable law enforcement to bypass encryption to tackle online child sexual abuse. There are also concerns that the legislation would enable an infringement on free speech.Recent discussion on a forum centered around why Californians are increasingly complaining about the state's elections, infrastructure problems, and related issues. The causes are largely policy decisions made decades earlier that are now manifesting as problems. A variety of perspectives were shared, including that California is somewhat unique in its ability to function as a one-party state, and the problems faced in the state have contributed to a nascent tech boom in Miami. Despite partisan differences, it was generally agreed that recognizing and addressing issues is preferable to pretending they don't exist.A group of bipartisan long-time congresspeople are sponsoring a new bill, urged on by intelligence agencies, that would force all providers of email or cloud services to scan and filter every message in their systems for images of \"child sex abuse\". Members are disappointed to see some of their favorited sources of potential campaign funding left off the list of sponsors, and some question the effectiveness of such measures in actually reducing child sex abuse. Meanwhile, readers are encouraged to apply to Y Combinator's summer 2023 batch.",

SOURCE: CATLSHARETWEETIn one of the most significant battery breakthroughs in recent years, the world\u2019s largest battery manufacturer CATL has announced a new \u201ccondensed\u201d battery with 500 Wh/kg which it says will go into mass production this year.\u201cThe launch of condensed batteries will usher in an era of universal electrification of sea, land and air transportation, open up more possibilities of the development of the industry, and promote the achieving of the global carbon neutrality goals at an earlier date,\u201d the company said in a presentation at Auto Shanghai on Thursday.CATL\u2019s new condensed battery will have almost double the energy intensity of Tesla\u2019s 4680 cells, whose rating of 272-296 Wh/kg are considered very high by current standards.CATL chief scientist Wu Kai says the condensed battery integrates a range of innovative technologies, including the ultra-high energy density cathode materials, innovative anode materials, separators, and manufacturing processes, offering excellent charge and discharge performance as well as good safety performance.He says the new technology breaks the limits that have long restricted the development of the battery sector and will open up a new era of electrification centred on high safety and light weight.During the presentation, CATL said its working with partners on the development of electric passenger aircraft practicing aviation-level standards and testing in accordance with aviation-grade safety and quality requirements.In addition to aircraft, CATL says it will soon launch the automotive-grade version of condensed batteries which it says will also go into mass production within this year.Batteries with 500 Wh/kg will enable electrification of passenger aircraftIn 2020 Elon Musk said \u201celectric flight starts to get interesting once you hit 400wh/kg\u201d. At the time he predicted that this would become possible by 2023.The announcement this week confirms and even exceeds Musk\u2019s prediction that this level of energy density would be commercially possibly by now.Earlier this month Argonne announced a new battery technology with an energy density of 1200 Wh/kg although that technology is not yet ready for bas production.\u201cWith further development, we expect our new design for the lithium-air battery to also reach a record energy density of 1200 watt-hours per kilogram,\u201d said Argonne scientist Larry Curtiss. \u201cThat is nearly four times better than lithium-ion batteries.\u201dWhile there have been many high-density battery breakthroughs in recent months, many of these technologies are only in their infancy and will take many years to reach mass production (if they ever achieve it at all).What makes CATL\u2019s announcement this week truly groundbreaking is that the condensed battery will go into mass production this year.Daniel BleakleyDaniel Bleakley is a clean technology researcher and advocate with a background in engineering and business.

The forthcoming technology outperforms current batteries by almost two times, represented a major leap forward in battery production. The announcement is significant because CATL is already a major battery producer, lending credibility to their claim, and the company has the expertise to scale production, so there is every chance the technology could be widely adopted. In contrast, many other previously announced breakthroughs have failed to pass the initial stages of development.CATL, a Chinese battery manufacturer, has announced the production of a new lithium-ion battery which has an energy density of 500 Wh/kg. The battery will be available in mass production by the end of 2021, making it a significant development in the field of energy storage. Currently, most lithium-ion batteries measure between 100 and 300 Wh/kg, making this latest development a significant leap forward. With a higher energy density, the new battery will increase the efficiency of electric vehicles and enable them to travel significantly further on a single charge.There is a discussion on whether ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles will become obsolete with the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). Some argue that the infrastructure for gasoline vehicles won't disappear quickly, and that EVs may remain impractical for some. However, others point out that incentives, legislation, and technology may rapidly shift the market in favor of EVs. Sales of EVs, mostly produced in China, are expected to increase exponentially, and governments worldwide are passing legislation to phase out ICE vehicles. Moreover, the ability to drive further with EVs will likely improve as battery technology continues to develop.- Gas stations may add fast charging stations but many will close as people charge at home, while dense areas may offer charging in mall-like areas.\n- Banning fossil fuels may accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, but people may still be able to run ICEs on synthetic fuels.\n- Most places aren't thinking of banning ICE sales within five years, but long-term projections suggest that ICE sales will become very low in 15 years in certain areas.\n- Battery and energy storage industries are advancing rapidly and new chemistries are emerging, potentially decreasing the reliance on rare earth materials.\n- Recently announced Sodium Ion batteries could make Lithium no longer the only viable battery chemistry at scale, opening up more options for energy storage.- The use of e-fuel versus electricity will depend on individual needs and preferences, such as long-distance travel, practicality of refueling, and comfort with internet-connected vehicles. \n- Long-distance EV travel and charging are already possible, with current technology and infrastructure, and will continue to improve over the next few years. \n- E-fuel vehicles can also run on traditional fuels, but e-fuel production costs are much higher, and availability is limited. \n- Bans on ICE cars will likely face opposition from those who prefer traditional cars, but the transition to EVs is expected to happen gradually over the next few decades. \n- Niche uses for ICE vehicles and fuels may persist beyond 2050-2060, but replacing ICE vehicles with EVs is necessary for environmental reasons.The tech community discusses the potential economic impact of a ban on internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Many believe that electric vehicles (EVs) need to be cheaper, faster, and have longer battery life before ICE bans can be imposed. Others suggest that taxing or pricing gasoline according to its carbon footprint could be a solution. Some worry about the lack of gasoline stations if ICE cars are banned or phased out, but there are ways of producing alternative fuels like ethanol. Existing ICE vehicles won't be banned, only future sales, so expect a long transition period.The comments section mainly discusses the challenges of implementing EVs, including limited infrastructure for charging, the need for batteries with higher energy density, and the cost of EVs. Some believe that cost will decrease as the price of batteries goes down. Others mention the need to target big polluters instead of individuals. There is also a discussion about the impact of ICE bans on poor people, with some suggesting that poor people don't buy new cars anyway, while others believe that used EVs will become more affordable over time.Many comments discuss the cost of owning a car, with some arguing that it is a burden on the poor. Some commenters note that car culture is not universal, and other countries' populations may not be dependent on cars to the same extent. Additionally, the discussion touches on proposed bans on ICE cars; some argue that they disproportionately affect the poor, while others believe that such bans are necessary to mitigate the effects of climate change. One commenter notes that the ban may make used EVs a more economically feasible choice, however.- Argument against forceful bans on ICE car sales in favor of improving battery technology \n- Criticism of modern ecologism for only focusing on making a \"nice walled garden\" for voters \n- Discussion on the environmental impact of producing products in one location versus locally \n- Reminder that ICE cars and gasoline production are also polluting \n- Concerns about the effects of heavy-handed mandates and curtailing people's freedoms \n- Debate about the noise pollution of electric cars and individual freedom of choice \n- Reminder that personal freedom must be limited when it impacts othersLithium and cobalt mining cause extensive environmental damage, but EVs are not to blame. Cobalt mining is largely done in the Congo where people work for only $3 a day. Although getting rid of car dependence seems like a better solution, there are still challenges because public transport in some parts of Europe and the US is inconvenient, and EVs are still expensive. However, the prices of EVs may become cheaper than gas-powered cars if manufacturers move down-market and the used EV market grows. There are also hopes that increasing production and recycling can ease the issues related to the rare elements required.CATL, a major Chinese battery manufacturer, has announced the development of a new lithium-ion battery with an energy density of 304Wh/kg, which is 1.8 times the density of current batteries. However, concerns have been raised about the cost and practicality of producing and transitioning to this new battery technology. Additionally, reports have surfaced that the new battery technology from CATL is a mix of sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, rather than 100% sodium-ion as claimed. The announcement has sparked discussion about the potential impact on the electric vehicle industry and the challenges of scaling up battery production.",

Users have pointed out that the tool is reproducing code verbatim, leading to concerns about copyright infringement. GitHub has acknowledged using public code for training but does not appear to be concerned about licensing. As more developers use this new tool, there may be wider repercussions for copyright and open source projects. Some have suggested using copyright traps to identify imitators in court. Still, others argue that copyright law may be insufficient in protecting intellectual property in the age of AI.The discussion centers around copyright and the idea of \"fair use\" for code snippets.

The discussion also touches on the legal risks of including copyrighted code in Copilot-generated codebases and how FOSS community rights could be laundered away via LLMs. Lastly, they talk about how the law examines creativity and the few reasonable ways to achieve a goal in a particular field before determining the eligibility of code for copyright protection.AI-generated code is raising legal questions around licensing and attribution, with some suggesting the development is essentially laundering copyrighted material for commercial use without recognition of creators or usage restrictions. Concerns have been raised around the difficulty in attributing the code produced, with some questioning if it\u2019s possible with LLMs. Other legal issues related to training on permissive licences and the requirement for attribution could limit available data for training such platforms. The hype around \u201crogue\u201d AI and singularity fails to address these concerns, and may be driven by the commercial interests of companies operating LLMs.The discussion revolves around the potential dangers of an AI-generated code writing tool, Copilot. Some argue that it would replace human programmers, others that it would lead to legal issues, such as the GPL licensing conflict, or that it would enable plagiarism in the industry. Additionally, there are concerns about AI taking over the world, and the potential damage it could cause. Finally, it is suggested that companies will still be careful to avoid violating copyright laws, even when using AI-generated code.Experts on a discussion thread talk about limitations in AI with respect to continued exponential growth in technology, citing the end of Moore's Law, resulting in less significant improvements with each additional generation. However, they mention that not all types of AI need external training data, and while super intelligent AI does not have to conform to human values, its self-replication path will decide its future. The discussion also debunks claims that any model would work in AI, discussing the importance of the quality and size of the training dataset\u00a0rather than the model. Finally, they bring in the concept of goals in AI, with the importance of training AIs not to reproduce creative training examples but to learn facts and skills.- AI training has a goal, defined by humans who created the calculations\n- LLMs are becoming more prevalent and free, making monetization incipient\n- Concerns about copyright arise when AI-generated content is used for code generation\n- Companies can own the copyright on AI-generated content if there is substantial human input\n- Microsoft's stance on Copilot is unclear, but Amazon is encouraging the use of CodeWhisperer at workMicrosoft's CodeWhisperer has built-in protections to prevent existing code from being generated without attribution. There are concerns about whether Microsoft included their own internal code in the training set. Copyright laws have always used a \"color of your bits\" argument, which complicates the legal framework for determining infringement in the context of generated code. It is necessary to know the applicable licenses of the emitted code, including MIT and GPL licenses. OpenAI's ChatGPT emitted LGPL code without attribution or license, raising questions about legal liability.Microsoft's programming assistance tool, Copilot, has replaced its training data to eliminate GPL-licensed code after potential violations. The tool relies on code from partners like OpenAI and training data curated from GitHub repositories. The GNU General Public License (GPL) requires derivative products to be made available to everyone with the source code, but lawyers for OpenAI and GitHub have claimed that because Copilot is creating new code rather than derivative software, it does not violate the GPL. Removing GPL code from training data may signal companies' reluctance to risk violating GPL.Microsoft's Code Copilot, an AI tool that suggests code for developers, has been raising concerns about its use of open-source code and how it relates to the GPL license, sparking discussions about fair use and copyright infringement. While some argue that Copilot violates the GPL license, others claim that as long as it is fair use, the license does not matter. Some suggest using the Unlicense if one wants their code to be usable by tools like Copilot. However, the broader conversation revolves around the impact AI could have on open source licensing and the legal issues that may arise.GitHub Copilot's user agreement includes a provision on defense of third-party claims; users must have reasonable policies and practices in place, including using all available filtering features, to prevent the use of suggestions generated by Copilot that may violate the rights of others. While Microsoft appears uninterested in the rights of rightsholders, anyone using Copilot must stay away until fair use questions are settled. Copilot matches snippets of public code with different licenses (including NOASSERTION, MIT, and GPL) and file references from unknown licenses that predate the GPL code in question, so it remains unclear who owns the code.",
        "hn_summary": "- GitHub Copilot has been criticized for emitting GPL code, causing concerns over copyright infringement.\n- There is a debate over whether AI-generated code should be considered copyright infringement and how FOSS community rights could be laundered away via LLMs.\n- Legal issues related to training on permissive licenses and the requirement for attribution could limit available data for training such platforms."

Censorship demands originating from the Indian government are nothing new, and Twitter boss Elon Musk has thus far agreed to grant them, blocking the material from view within India.This is in line with Musk\u2019s faulty understanding of \u201cfree speech\u201d as a simple reflection of an individual country\u2019s laws, no matter how oppressive.But this time, Twitter did something different: It blocked the tweets not just within India, where Indian law applies, but everywhere. As with many of Twitter\u2019s moves of late, it\u2019s unclear if this decision is a result of Musk\u2019s personal directives; understaffed teams; slipshod, off-the-cuff policy making; or all three. Twitter has yet to offer an explanation, despite requests from the journalist whose tweets were blocked.\u201cSpin the wheel and see what political expression is next on the chopping block. It might just be your own.\u201dTwitter\u2019s international application of local law is worrying enough on its own. But it looks as if Twitter\u2019s global block may not just be a concerning isolated incident, it may instead be part of a deeply troubling trend of tech companies willingly choosing to allow the most authoritarian diktats to guide content moderation.Midjourney, another San Francisco-based company, is part of that trend. It quickly rose through the ranks as one of the most popular AI image generators today, likely best known for being used to create the infamous images of Pope Francis clad in a Balenciaga puffer coat. But perhaps Midjourney should be known more for what images it won\u2019t produce, instead of what it will.ADVERTISINGMidjourney CEO David Holz announced last year that his program would explicitly forbid users to create images of China\u2019s Xi Jinping. Users who attempt to do so are threatened with a ban. \u201cPolitical satire in china is pretty not-okay,\u201d Holz posted on Discord, according to The Washington Post. He added that \u201cthe ability for people in China to use this tech is more important than your ability to generate satire.\u201dThe Problem With Banning Russian DisinformationFREE SPEECH HELPS UKRAINEJacob MchangamaTech companies\u2019 desire to remain accessible to the Chinese market will surprise no one, but Midjourney goes further than most of its peers. Instead of restricting political expression for the program\u2019s users in China, it restricts such expression for all of its global users. Not only does Xi Jinping get to censor what\u2019s said behind the Chinese internet\u2019s Great Firewall but, on Midjourney at least, he gets to control what\u2019s said right here in the U.S.At the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), where I work, we combat threats to the First Amendment and freedom of expression in the United States every day. Unfortunately, business is booming. But while we combat the \u201cfree speech recession\u201d blooming within our own borders, we can\u2019t ignore the challenges that seep in from outside them.Imagine the future of the global internet if tech companies and social media platforms continue this trend, making local censorship laws into international content moderation guidelines.Today it might be tweets about Indian government officials and satirical images of Xi Jinping. But what words will be hidden from the global internet tomorrow: Criticism of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia? Endorsement of the anti-compulsory hijab protests in Iran? Opposition to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine?Spin the wheel and see what political expression is next on the chopping block. It might just be your own.Crackdown on Royal Protests Makes U.S. Free Speech Look GoodNOT MY KINGJacob MchangamaBut this does not have to be the future. We can and should expect more from companies operating in free countries and creating the platforms we use to express ourselves online.Authoritarians wield an array of tools\u2014from brute force to heavy-handed laws to subtle threats\u2014in their campaigns to silence dissent and opposition arising within their own borders. Tech companies in free countries should not arm them any further. They already control not just the voices of their own subjects, but now increasingly what anyone, anywhere can say about them.That\u2019s a recipe for disaster in a world that tragically continues to grow less free by the day.Sarah McLaughlin is senior scholar for global expression at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).",

        "hn_content": "Tech bosses are allowing dictators to influence what the American population sees. Propaganda has always been used to control information, and while people have been encouraged to trust experts, they need to learn the skills needed to objectively classify information. The average person is better off knowing less than believing all information for sale. Individualism is not taught in the culture, leading to people blindly following expert advice. The public needs to recognize when experts speak inappropriately and not blindly believe them. Specialization in one area can be rewarding to gain a limited understanding of reality.The discussion revolves around the difficulty of verifying information and the need to remain critical of news sources. It is challenging to become an expert in any field, and even experts know that they barely know anything. The US political system encourages polarized thinking, which makes it harder to find trustworthy information sources. Reliable news institutions are not profitable, and capitalism makes it challenging to nurture them. Fox News is an example of a news source that misleads its audience. The importance of remaining critical of reputable news sources is highlighted, and one should not rely on a single source for information.No meaningful content to summarize.A discussion on how news sources and social media can influence public opinion and the dangers of allowing monopolies and authoritarian control. The need for critical thinking and multiple sources of verification is emphasized. Some comments criticize the power dynamics of corporations and suggest dissolving or nationalizing them when they become harmful to society. The discussion also touches on the potential benefits and drawbacks of Twitter's new paid subscription system and the role of American culture in dictating what is considered acceptable content on social media. Suggestions for decentralized censorship are proposed.A discussion of censorship on social media platforms leads to suggestions of who should be responsible for censorship strategies and tools. The failure of free trade and globalism is cited as a reason US-based companies have become reliant on trade with oppressive regimes, leading to bowing to censorship instead of promoting human rights. Some forum users suggest that filters should be administered by individual users, while others argue that moderation is necessary to avoid creating an overwhelming volume of offensive content. One user suggests this could be addressed through a global treaty on internet governance.No meaningful content to provide a summary.The article discusses the idea of censorship by powerful entities, including governments and tech companies, and the potential dangers of free speech absolutism. Examples of censorship by entities such as Sony, Hollywood, and Disney are cited, as well as the issue of speech by elected officials that may contribute to violence. The thread includes comments both advocating for and against censorship, as well as discussions on the potential for censorship to be abused by those in power. The article highlights the importance of the ongoing debate surrounding free speech and censorship in modern society.Some comments discuss the use of laws to thwart foreign attacks on America, while others criticize the inconsistency in government enforcement. There is debate about the legality of foreign election interference, the registration of NGOs as foreign agents, and censorship by tech companies. Some comments suggest the risk of a slippery slope, where tech companies increasingly censor speech to cater to foreign governments. Overall, the post highlights the complexities and potential risks involved in the intersection of politics, technology, and free speech.Twitter has blocked a tweet worldwide in response to a request from India. In response, users debate the tradeoff of international censorship and the effects on American democracy. Some suggest that there is no universal truth when it comes to news and information. Others argue that allowing foreign control over US media has negative consequences on politics and human rights. The conversation turns towards the role of social media platforms in US democracy and whether they will become increasingly moderated to align with dictators or anti-democratic agendas. Some users suggest that legislation should be enacted to stop this censorship from affecting Americans.There is a discussion in the comments about the nature of axioms in mathematics, questions about universal truth, and debates about internet censorship and global power dynamics. Some comments express concerns about corporations dominating the world and controlling information. There is a debate about the role of the CCP in Chinese society, and a discussion around the responsibilities of private platforms regarding free speech. Overall, the comments reflect a wide range of perspectives on complex issues related to censorship, power, and control of information.The discussion revolves around censorship and bias in the media industry, particularly in the US, China, and India, with references to Hollywood and journalism. The impact of foreign censorship laws on tech companies is also brought up. The post touches on the responsibility of companies to openly assess technology's impact on society, governments' power over personal rights and freedoms, and the notion of commercial franchises and incentives. There is a call for openness and fairness for all, free speech, and treatment of every human being worldwide with the same respect. The discussion concludes with an acknowledgement of human tendencies to forget privileges, and the importance of reflecting on how lucky we are.The text is a collection of comments ranging from personal anecdotes about working conditions to opinions on the Chinese government. There is no meaningful content to provide a summary on.A survey reveals that only 11.3% of Chinese people are \"very satisfied\" with their local government. The root cause is a closed, authoritarian regime that convinces its citizens that the central government is good and the local government is bad. But authoritarianism is bad at all levels. Xi Jinping is a weak leader who has convinced himself that he is the only one capable of leading China, leading to a corrupting influence of authoritarianism. In an open society, members have more autonomy and can choose for themselves. Countries always seek to extend their influence, and the US and China play the same game with different tactics. The problem arises when the customs of others infringe on the customs of others, with some places insisting that they can control how technology is accessed and used everywhere.The conversation among several users argues national continuity and cultural experience, with the US and China used as examples. One user argues that China's progress has come through Westernization and that the Western model is superior. Another user criticizes the oppressive actions of authoritarian regimes and argues for liberal democracy and the rule of law. The conversation then shifts to a discussion on the legality of political satire and voter suppression, with some users citing examples of politically motivated prosecutions.No meaningful content in the text provided.",

        "content": "The Cool Blog4-20-23: Windows on btrfsHello and Welcome back to The Cool Blog here on The Cool Site.So for the past year and a half or so I've been using the fantastic Windows btrfs driver for easily sharing files between my Windows and Linux dualboot. The driver works great and basically fully supports everything that both operating systems could ever want (and let me tell you transparent compression and copy on write on Windows is so fucking nice). If you dualboot Windows and Linux I highly recommend using this for external drives instead of using NTFS with Linux.Anyway maharmstone, the creator of the driver, has also been working on another project called Quibble. Quibble is an open source reimplentation of the Windows bootloader that has the incredibly awesome feature of allowing one to boot Windows off of other filesystems. It can boot it off of anything that it has an EFI driver for and that Windows can read. Theoretically nothing is stopping you from booting Windows 11 off of FAT32 (Although I'm sure that Windows would have some issues with that as XP was the last version that let you boot off of FAT32)Quibble has been something that I had previously messed with in the past but could never get to work. The last release had been from 2021 and I never cared enough to actually compile the much newer source sode. A few weeks ago though there was a new release so I though fuck it and decided to try it. I downloaded the latest release of Quibble, stuck it in my EFI partition, used their ntfs2btrfs tool to convert my existing Windows partition to btrfs, edited the Quibble config file to point to the right partition and rebooted... and immediately forgot this laptop's dumbass UEFI doesn't let me pick an EFI file to boot from. After 10 minutes of me trying to remember how to use efibootmgr I was able to add it to the boot options and actually reboot.The Quibble boot menuThe boot menu of Quibble looks like if you took grub, made it HiDPI aware, and added nicer fonts. Considering my failed attempts in the past where it would never find the partition I wasn't expecting much when I selected Windows.Holy shit it actually fucking worked.I really wasn't expecting it to work. Well since we're at the login screen I signed in and was immediately hearing error sounds even before the desktop loaded. I forgot to take screenshots but it was the AMD stuff from the Microsoft Store failing to launch. This takes us into the one downside (or feature depending on how you see it). \"Windows 10 apps\", basically things you would get from the Microsoft Store don't work. Your first thought might be \"who cares nobody gets anything from the Microsoft Store\" but this means that Windows Terminal doesn't work and you're stuck with the shitty default powershell and command prompt apps and I can't play Minecraft Bedrock.Oh well...Anyway with it seemingly working perfectly I rebooted into Arch Linux so I could do transparent compression on this. This was when I realized that the ntfs2btrfs program didn't do things perfectly. Immediately when I tried to write anything to it dmesg was filled with errors and the filesystem remounted as read only. As I am an idiot I didn't really know how I could fix this at the moment. Btrfs check said everything was fine.I decided to make a new btrfs partition and just copy over all the files and see if that would boot. I was shocked to see that it did and now that I had a clean and uncorrupted filesystem it was time for the incredibly dumb idea I had.There are no directories in the Windows and Linux roots that share the same name so you should be able to boot them both from the same partition without any file conflicts. After a reboot into Linux, installing Arch with pacstrap, and fucking with grub.I see absolutely no way that this could go wrong /sThis kinda just works. The btrfs driver for Windows is incredibly solid so once you get past the bootloader there really isn't anything weird. It just does its thing. One final thought of mine is that since Quibble supports booting Windows from a btrfs subvolume if you wanted to not have to worry about splitting up your SSD for a dual boot you could have Windows and Linux on one partition on separate subvolumes. Honestly that sounds like something I might do (Assuming Windows Update doesn't break this).Anyway that's all I have this time. This was just a dumb thing I ended up doing tonight and I really needed something to write about.I don't know how to end things.Follow me on MastodonBack",

Some readers suggest that such projects have long existed but lack interest, given the narrow usage niche and difficult technical problem. Meanwhile, some users continue to find dual-booting useful, particularly for gaming. Paragon offers a third-party solution, but some caution against its use. Overall, the post provides an interesting discussion on cross-platform data storage and the challenges associated with it.No meaningful content to be summarized.Users discuss the feasibility and stability of running Windows and Linux on the same system. They mention past experiences with installing Linux on Fat32 inside a parallel directory with Windows 95 and talk about features such as WSL and UWF. They mention the modularity of the filesystem layer in Windows and discuss different storage drivers for Docker. Some users mention the stability of the btrfs filesystem, with mixed experiences on data corruption bugs. Overall, the discussion revolves around using different filesystems and ways of partitioning for optimal performance and compatibility.Windows users discuss the use of Btrfs, ZFS, and other file systems as alternatives to NTFS on Windows. Some users report issues with case sensitivity and corruption on Btrfs in RAID configurations, while others praise the modularity of Windows' file system stack and the flexibility of Btrfs's snapshot management. There are mentions of a ZFS port for Windows and an upstream kernel driver for NTFS on Linux. Overall, there is interest in using alternative file systems, but concerns about compatibility with third-party software and the lack of native encryption support. No benchmarks or performance tests are provided.The WinBtrfs project allows Windows to boot from a Btrfs partition, which is commonly used in Linux systems. Although the project has a long way to go, some users are already using it as their primary OS. While performance comparisons are required, users liked the fact that the WinBtrfs project allows for dual-boot Windows from a subvolume without having to deal with partitions or separate drives. File system compatibility is critical between OSes, and given the issues with using ZFS in Linux, it is not surprising that ReFS was developed by Microsoft. Despite some potential threats, the custom bootloader is expected to remain safe amidst regular Windows Updates.Windows users are experimenting with changing their main partition to Btrfs, a newer file system with features like compression and copy-on-write. The switch is forcing users to learn more about how Windows works on unexpected conditions, which could prove useful in troubleshooting future issues. Some appreciate the idea of having a unified storage system, allowing easy expansion of storage capacity by simply adding another drive. Others note that Btrfs is similar to the ZFS file system and may not be as light on overhead as ext4 or f2fs. Some users are also experimenting with Linux running on NTFS with the new kernel driver.",

Besides migrating to a newer and more actively developed GUI framework version, this will help to significantly improve the performance of the user interface and the canvas (in particular OpenGL).However, the migration is a complex endeavour and will change hundreds of files in our codebase. For this reason, it is imperative to perform the migration as quickly as possible, because all other work that touches the user interface during the migration time will face conflicts.For this reason, the development team has decided to accelerate the migration in a two-fold way: a GTK expert, i.e. a senior C++ developer with GTK experience, will be hired and bring expert knowledge about GTK to the table. At the same time, an Inkscape expert will be hired for the same duration, bringing expert knowledge about Inkscape\u2019s internal workings to the table. Those two will form a powerful team to drive the GTK4 migration. Additionally, multiple senior Inkscape developers are available to consult the migration process as a whole.Job posting: Senior C++ developerThe Inkscape project is looking for a senior C++ developer with experience in gtkmm.They will perform some of the essential steps of the GTK4 migration for Inkscape including ensuring that the C++ bindings (gtkmm, pangomm, cairomm, etc.) are adequate, over a four month time period.What we expect from candidates:Significant experience in gtk / gtkmm, ideally some experience in GTK4.Ability to work in an asynchronous setting / working across time zones, generally available during US or EU time zones.Ideally, experience with FOSS development.The candidate will perform essential steps in the GTK4 migration (see https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html). Knowledge of GTK4/gtkmm4 is advantageous.They will work closely together with an Inkscape expert with intimate knowledge of the Inkscape codebase. Thus, no knowledge of Inkscape is required. A record of contributing to upstream projects is preferred.Duration:The project is scoped to fit a 16-week full time schedule. The first 8 weeks of the project will serve as an evaluation period for both sides. Depending on the progress, the project may be extended to up to 16 weeks (with additional compensation). The schedule may be shifted in order to accommodate part-time candidates. Work is expected to start June 01, 2023. Payment terms: Net 30 and can pay in USD or Euro.Application documents:CVPortfolioAnswers to the following questions (one paragraph each):Summarize your experience with gtk / gtkmm, and other related projects.Motivation to work on this project.

The open-source vector graphics editor has been praised by users for its functionality, but criticisms of its UI persist, with some suggesting it adopt a key-matching configuration similar to Blender or Adobe's Illustrator, to provide familiarity for employees who previously used those platforms. Further, it was suggested that Inkscape did not offer a clear delineation between being an SVG editor and a more fully formed vector editor, leading to an unclear SVG hierarchy and ineffective management of SVG content.Inkscape, a popular open-source vector graphics editor, is seeking a Senior Developer to work on features like PDF editing and native macOS support. Some comments express frustration at using outdated tools, while others defend the value of native apps. The post generates discussion about job postings and hiring processes. One suggestion is to build a web-based version of the software using canvas or other libraries. Another comment highlights the importance of supporting FOSS projects by hiring developers to maintain and improve them.The discussion centers around the potential of running Inkscape in a browser or as a web application. Some people express concerns about performance of such applications on slow computers, while others point to recent improvements in SVG rendering in WebKit. There's also some discussion around software preferences and differences in native applications versus browser-based ones. Some users report issues with Inkscape's UI performance on macOS, but there are tips recommended in a video to improve performance.A discussion thread on HN about Inkscape, a vector graphics editor, prompted a range of comments such as its reliability, stability, features, and updates. Some praised its performance, while others criticized it for being slow to release new versions, lacking scripting or plugins, and crashing frequently. The conversation also touched on broader topics such as the popularity and cross-platform compatibility of GTK, the challenge of migration, the mindset of software developers, and privacy concerns related to the referer header. Overall, the thread offers a glimpse into the diverse perspectives and experiences of users and developers in the graphic design and open-source communities.The comments in this post contain various discussions about issues within the GTK/GNOME desktop environment and associated toolkits. Some users are experiencing difficulty migrating between versions due to incomplete migration paths and API changes. Others are frustrated with changes made to user-facing features without providing a proper migration path. There is also discussion around window state and positioning, with disagreements between who is responsible for managing these aspects. Overall, the post highlights the challenges that can occur within open-source development and the importance of considering the needs of all users, including developers.- A discussion on whether it's the app's or the OS/DE/WM's job to save and restore the window state\n- The potential issues of storing window size information and the added dependencies on displays, IO, and parsing\n- The macOS keyboard shortcut system and its support in Gimp and Inkscape using Gtk2 and Gtk3\n- The limitations and falling behind of GTK2 and the difficulty of keeping up with GTK3/4 for open source projects that use it\n- Some users' disappointment with Ardour's decision to stick with GTK2 and not support native WaylandInkscape, an open-source vector graphics editor, is hiring a GFX developer for a 16-week project. Users have commented on the issues with the GUI/canvas and the slow performance when using GTK versions. The latest release from 2022-2023 has also caused problems for Windows users with the text tool. However, users are generally happy with the recent transition to GTK4, which has improved performance, especially on macOS. Some commenters debate the value of upgrading to GTK4 and the pricing of hiring developers for specific skills. At least one user wishes Inkscape had the resources to hire a UX designer.- Inkscape, a popular open-source vector graphics editor, is moving to GTK4 toolkit to accelerate porting to a new version\n- Some users complain about Inkscape's performance issues, particularly on Mac, and hope the switch to GTK4 will improve it\n- Users express interest or concern about spot color support, the choice of toolkit, the port of C++ to gobject and C, and the funding behind the project\n- No significant new features or releases are mentioned in the discussions",
        "hn_summary": "- Inkscape is hiring a Senior Developer to work on PDF editing and native macOS support, and a GFX developer for a 16-week project\n- Users have concerns about Inkscape's UI performance, particularly on macOS, and hope the switch to GTK4 will address this issue\n- Discussions include the challenges of migrating between different versions of GTK, the potential of running Inkscape as a web-based application, and the importance of supporting FOSS projects through hiring developers"

        "content": "The weird world of Windows file pathsBy Erik J\u00e4levik on 20 March 2023File system paths on Windows are stranger than you might think. On any Unix-derived system, a path is an admirably simple thing: if it starts with a /, it\u2019s a path. Not so on Windows, which serves up a bewildering variety of schemes for composing a path.When I implemented the path autocompletion feature in Fileside 1.7, I needed to take a closer look at this to make sure I had all bases covered. This blog post shares my findings.At a glanceAbsolute path formatsName ExampleDrive path C:\\Program Files\\HAL 9000UNC path \\\\Media\\Pictures\\Worth\\1000 wordsDevice path (literal) \\\\?\\D:\\Plans\\MarshallDevice path (normalized) \\\\.\\D:\\Projects\\Human GenomeRelative path formatsName ExamplesCurrent directory-relative .\\Manhattan, ..\\PlansCurrent drive-relative \\PactsDrive\u2019s current directory-relative D:WarsawDisallowed charactersCharacters Validity< > \u201d / \\ | ? * Never allowed. Disallowed as final character: Disallowed except for with data streamsLength limitsItem Maximum lengthPath 32,767 (or 260) charactersFile or directory name 255 charactersWindows path schemesThere are three different kinds of absolute path, and three different kinds of relative path on Windows.Absolute pathsAbsolute, or fully qualified, paths are complete paths, that on their own uniquely identify a location in the file system.Drive pathsDrive paths are the good old-fashioned paths we all know and love, consisting of a drive letter and a sequence of directories.D:\\Doughnut preferences\\With jam inUNC pathsUNC stands for Universal Naming Convention and describes paths that start with \\\\, commonly used to refer to network drives. The first segment after the \\\\ is the host, which can be either a named server or an IP address, like so:\\\\Work\\Hard\\\\192.168.1.15\\HardUNC paths can also be used to access local drives in a similar way:\\\\localhost\\C$\\Users\\Andrew Fletcher\\\\127.0.0.1\\C$\\Users\\Alan WilderOr by using the computer name:\\\\Pipeline\\C$\\Users\\Martin GoreUNC paths have a peculiar way of indicating the drive letter, we must use $ instead of :. Furthermore, accessing drives in this way will only work if you\u2019re logged in as an administrator.Note that \\\\Pipeline is not a valid directory path in itself, as it only identifies a server. The name of a share must be appended to arrive at an actual folder.Device pathsA device path starts with either of these two beauties:\\\\?\\\\\\.\\They can be used to address physical devices (disks, displays, printers etc) in addition to files and folders. Not something you\u2019ll ever use in day-to-day file management, but useful to know about if you come across one in the wild.The syntax for accessing a local folder using a device path is either of:\\\\?\\Z:\\Animals\\Cute\\\\.\\Z:\\Animals\\CunningIf you really want to get obscure for the sake of it, you can also substitute an equivalent device identifier for Z::\\\\?\\Volume{59e01a55-88c5-411f-bf0b-92820bdb2548}\\Animals\\CrypticHere, Volume{59e01a55-88c5-411e-bf0a-92820bdb2549} happens to be the identifier for the disk volume on which Z: resides on the computer on which I\u2019m writing this.There\u2019s also a special syntax for representing UNC paths as device paths:\\\\?\\UNC\\localhost\\Z$\\Animals\\CuriousWith device paths, the bit that comes after the \\\\?\\ or \\\\.\\ is a name defined in Windows\u2019s internal Object Manager namespace. For those curious to explore what\u2019s available in this namespace, you can download the WinObj tool and take a look.Normalised and literal device pathsSo what\u2019s the difference between \\\\?\\ and \\\\.\\, you ask.Normally, when you pass a path to Windows, it starts off by cleaning it up before using it. This process is referred to as normalisation. But more about that later.A \\\\?\\ path skips this cleaning step, while a \\\\.\\ path doesn\u2019t. Hence, we can refer to \\\\?\\ paths as literal device paths, and \\\\.\\ as normalised device paths.Say you, for whatever incomprehensible reason, need to access a file named .., which would normally be resolved to the parent directory during normalisation, you can do so via a literal device path.Relative pathsRelative paths are incomplete paths, that need to be combined with another path to uniquely identify a location.Paths relative to the current directoryThese are paths that use the current directory as their starting point, e.g. .\\Torquay refers to a subdirectory of the current directory, and ..\\Wales refers to a subdirectory of the parent of the current directory.In Fileside, the current directory is taken to mean the folder shown in the pane where you enter your path.Paths relative to the root of the current driveIf you start a path with a single \\, it\u2019s interpreted relative to the root of the current drive. So, if you\u2019re currently anywhere on the E: drive and type in \\Africa, you\u2019ll end up in E:\\Africa.When the current directory is accessed via a UNC path, a current drive-relative path is interpreted relative to the current root share, say \\\\Earth\\Asia.Paths relative to a drive\u2019s current directoryLess commonly used, paths specifying a drive without a backslash, e.g. E:Kreuzberg, are interpreted relative to the current directory of that drive. This really only makes sense in the context of the command line shell, which keeps track of a current working directory for each drive.This is the only type of path that Fileside does not support, as it has no concept of a current directory per drive. Only panes have a current directory.NormalisationAs alluded to above, all paths except literal device paths go through a normalisation process before they\u2019re used. This process consists of the following steps:Replace forward slashes (/) with backslashes (\\)Collapse repeated backslash separators into oneResolve relative paths replacing any . or ..Trim trailing spaces and periodsIt\u2019s thus generally possible to specify Windows paths using forward slashes as well.Windows naming rulesNow we\u2019ll turn our focus to the individual segments that make up a path. There are a number of restrictions on what names you can use for files and folders.Disallowed charactersYou can\u2019t use any of the following characters in a name:< > \" / \\ | ? *Any non-printable character with an ASCII value below 32 is equally out of the question.The cunning colonFor the most part, : is also banned.However, there is an exotic exception in the form of NTFS alternate data streams. It is a little known fact that you can store a hidden piece of data inside a file in certain contexts by appending a suffix preceded by a colon to its name.The perilous periodA . is fine anywhere within, or at the start of, a name, but is disallowed as a final character.Leading and trailing spacesCuriously, Windows allows spaces at the beginning of names, but not at the end. As a name with spaces around it often looks identical to one without, these are generally a terrible idea, and Fileside automatically trims them off when you rename or create files.Disallowed namesFor historical reasons, you can\u2019t use any of the following names either:CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM0, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT0, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.That includes usage with an extension tacked on. If you call a file COM1.txt for example, it gets converted into \\\\.\\COM1\\ internally, and gets interpreted as a device by Windows. Not what you want.Case sensitivityFor the most part, Windows doesn\u2019t make a distinction between lower- and upper-case characters in paths.C:\\Polish hamlet, c:\\polish Hamlet, C:\\Polish Hamlet, or C:\\POliSh hAMlET are considered exactly the same thing.However, since the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, NTFS file systems do have the option of enabling case sensitivity on a per-folder basis.Length limitsWe\u2019re not quite done yet, the lengths of things have limits too.PathsTraditionally, a path on Windows could not exceed a total of 260 characters. Even today, this is still the case for some apps, unless they have taken care to implement a workaround.This workaround consists of transforming every path into a literal device path under the hood before passing it Windows. Through doing so, we can bypass the 260 character limit, and increase it to a much more generous 32,767 characters instead. Fileside implements this workaround.NamesIndividual file and folder names cannot be longer than 255 characters.So many ways to say the same thingArmed with all this knowledge, we realise that we can construct an almost unlimited number of different path strings that all refer to the same directory.C:\\CHAMELEONc:\\chameleonC:\\/\\\\//\\\\\\///ChameleonC:\\Windows\\..\\Users\\..\\Chameleon\\\\localhost\\C$\\Chameleon\\\\127.0.0.1\\C$\\Chameleon\\\\?\\C:\\Chameleon\\\\.\\C:\\Chameleon\\\\.\\UNC\\localhost\\C$\\Chameleon\\\\?\\Volume{59e01a55-88c5-411e-bf0a-92820bdb2549}\\Chameleon\\\\.\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolume4\\Chameleonetc.That\u2019s what sticking to a policy of total backwards compatibility for several decades gets you!",

        "hn_content": "A post on Hacker News discusses the strange world of Windows file paths and the challenges of building file management on different operating systems. The comments discuss various quirks and design decisions of different OSs, including the use of backslashes on Windows and the benefits of PowerShell. Some comments also touch on the history of computing and the evolution of CLI interfaces. Overall, the post highlights the complexities and idiosyncrasies of computer systems and the ongoing debates about the best ways to manage files and interact with the command line.Microsoft's open-source PowerShell, licensed today under MIT, is now available across multiple platforms, including Linux and Windows. PowerShell aims to act as an alternative to POSIX's sh or Python, providing a more flexible option for consistent scripts that cater for a variety of systems quirks. The problem with PowerShell lies in the management of errors during script execution, leading to manual error handling of frequently changing executables. Nevertheless, PowerShell's cross-platform capabilities will offer new functionalities and may be an appealing option for developers who need to target several operating systems simultaneously.The comments on this post predominantly focus on different aspects of Windows, including its I/O weirdness and legacy limitations, as well as its differences with Unix-like operating systems. Discussion also touches on issues surrounding USB-serial adapters and Windows registry management.The post is a discussion of annoyances related to working with serial devices on Windows in an industrial automation environment. One commenter has a PowerShell script for reapplying network interface controller settings, and another deletes accumulated COM ports in device manager. There is a debate about drive letter assignment in Windows, with some commenters pointing out it originated from IBM's CMS system. There is also discussion around file paths, with commenters giving examples from Unix and Acorn/BBC computers. Raymond Chen provides an explanation for some of the COM port issues on Windows.This post delves into technical intricacies related to file paths and naming conventions on modern macOS and Windows systems. It covers the use of forward slashes and colons as path separators, UNC paths and administrative shares, and how Windows keeps track of current directories. It also highlights some common misconceptions about file naming conventions and alternate data streams on Windows systems. Overall, this post is a valuable resource for software engineers seeking a deeper understanding of file system operations and syntax.- A stream name in NTFS can contain any Unicode character except for \\ / : and control character 0x00, and must be no more than 255 characters in length.\n- There can be multiple data streams for a file, including a default (primary) stream and alternate data streams (ADS).\n- ADS can store information that should not affect the file contents and have been used in the past to hide malicious software.\n- Windows API, NTFS, and Windows tools have different restrictions on file paths, and normalization of file names can vary.- Windows allows the use of forward slashes in place of backslashes as a path separator.\n- UNC paths utilize the dollar sign to indicate hidden shares, with the C$ share providing root level access to the system drive.\n- Windows file paths have multiple layers, with the Win32 paths serving as an emulation layer for the NT kernel paths.\n- NT kernel paths allow for filenames such as \".\" and \"..\", but the filesystem driver determines what is a valid filename.\n- Windows allows for the use of unusual characters and names in file paths and filenames, which can cause problems with some programs and functions.The post discusses the use of illegal characters in Windows file names and notes that while some characters are officially disallowed, others are functionally allowed by the NTFS file system. The discussion also includes mention of how different programs handle Windows paths, difficulties in integrating Windows paths with other tools, and complications that arise from translations of file system paths between English and non-English languages. The article concludes with a pitch for an alternative file management tool, Fileside.\u2022 Windows file paths are complex, with different rules for naming conventions and special characters. \n\u2022 Paths on Unix-derived systems are simpler, starting with a '/'. \n\u2022 However, Windows 10 now supports Unix-style file paths, too. \n\u2022 Illegal characters and names can be created on Windows, but may cause issues with certain utilities or programs. \n\u2022 Fileside is a potentially innovative Explorer/Finder alternative that offers a customizable grid of directories, though it is not for minimalists.- Microsoft maintains compatibility with even obsolete technologies\n- Some older Microsoft employees feel young Microsoft isn't taking compatibility as seriously\n- Electron apps may have difficulty with spaces in file paths on Windows\n- Some people have had issues with whitespace in file paths, while others use it frequently without any problems\n- PowerShell users should be aware of the limitations with using special characters such as [] in file names\n- There are workarounds for escaping these special characters in PowerShell, but they can be complicated for non-expertsThe comments section of an article on \"The Tech Times\" discusses the challenges of handling spaces, quotes, encodings, and special characters in scripting languages, particularly PowerShell and GNU Make. Some commenters suggest using quotes to handle spaces in filenames and directories, while others warn of potential issues with different types of quotes and UTF-8/ANSI encoding. Some also mention workarounds like using desktop.ini files to localize folder names. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of careful handling of special characters and spaces in script development.",

Yet demand for energy is expected to keep growing. Higher energy prices reverberate throughout the entire economy, and arguably where oil prices go, there go prices for everything since over 6,000 daily products emanate from petroleum derivatives.Given this situation, one thing is very clear: only nuclear power is carbon-free and able to meet growing U.S. calls for electrification and global needs for basic economic growth. Nuclear power works to alleviate the dependence on oil and gas, since it is abundant, energy dense, and can be a tool against Middle East geopolitical mechanisms used against whatever U.S. president is in office.America is Investing in NuclearWashington is cognizant of this necessity. In April 2022, two senators introduced the International Nuclear Energy Act of 2022 to enable a \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d strategy for U.S. global leadership in civil nuclear technologies, including advanced nuclear technology (ANT). Nuclear power is now at the forefront of safe, reliable, emission-free ways to produce electricity and thermal heat. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, approximately 70 small modular reactors (SMRs) concepts are currently under research and development.Globally, there are roughly nine different types of SMR designs. These are fluid projections since new Generation IV (Gen IV) technologies are rapidly changing. For the United States, companies such as NuScale Power\u2019s VOYGR SMR design to Kairos Power\u2019s Fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor; and Westinghouse\u2019s eVinci Heat pipe-cooled microreactor are leading the way for ANT.Gen IV reactors and SMRs offer financial benefits and improvements from Generation III-III+ reactors with their ability to produce electricity at a lower operational cost over the life of the power plant. Moreover, SMRs offer lower initial capital investment, greater scalability, and sitting flexibility for locations unable or unwilling to accommodate larger light water reactor power plants. The potential for enhanced safety and security compared to previous designs makes advanced reactors desirable moving forward. This drives economic growth and high-paying professions in the nuclear industry.Alternatives to Nuclear Aren\u2019t EnoughUnfortunately, nuclear power has been demonized, and many believe it should be fought against at all costs. Nothing could be further from the truth. Approximately 200 people have died of radiation from nuclear accidents in over sixty years. These numbers are inclusive of accidents at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima. Counting cancer diagnoses among people exposed to radiation from these accidents, the harm from a nuclear power plant compared to the effects of coal pollution or methane emissions from natural-gas-fired power plants is definitive proof why nuclear power is the best choice for energy and electricity when all factors are considered.Speaking of coal, the recent dramatic increase in coal use numbers more than echo the call for greater nuclear power. Despite global promises, 2022 witnessed \u201cthe coal fleet grow by 19.5 gigawatts, enough to light up around 15 million homes.\u201d New coal plants were predominantly added in China and India, then Indonesia, Turkey, and Zimbabwe. If nuclear power were deployed instead of coal, global emissions would have declined instead of growth in the United States and abroad.But what about the counter-argument of using renewables? The wind and the sun are always free, and no matter what OPEC, the international oil cartel, conjures up the change in energy prices can be countered with natural resources.If only that were true. Renewables use enormous amounts of materials compared to nuclear and fossil fuels. It is a misnomer to say renewables are carbon-free compared to nuclear power. Whereas nuclear power accounts for all materials through the decommissioning phase\u2014and surprisingly, 90 percent of all materials from a nuclear power plant can be recycled\u2014compared to old wind and solar platforms, which generate millions of tons of waste. The International Renewable Energy Agency calculates that old solar panel disposal to meet 2050 Paris Accords \u201cwill more than double the tonnage of all of today\u2019s global plastic waste.\u201dOf course, nuclear power plants themselves require enormous amounts of steel, rebar, concrete, wiring, plastics, and other materials. But a nuclear power plant reliably performs and isn\u2019t intermittent, unreliable, or variable. As an example, a typical wind turbine demands \u201c900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of nonrecyclable plastic\u201d to function. Solar power requires even more metals, cement, steel, and glass. Renewables have their uses in non-grid applications, some microgrids, and remote applications, but to build enough wind turbines and solar panels to supply at least half the electricity needed for global consumption \u201cwould require two billions tons of coal to produce the concrete and steel, along with two billion barrels of oil to make the composite blades. [And] more than 90% of the world\u2019s solar panels are built in Asia on coal-heavy electrical grids.\u201dNuclear power plants do not run into heavy fossil fuel conditions nor do they need to be replaced within a mere ten to twenty years the way industrial solar and wind farms need replacement under current technology. A nuclear power plant does not warrant nearly the amount of land renewables confiscate, and this is where the greatest advantage lies. True, coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants also do not require significant amounts of land. But it is the land-use issue that is crucial for why nuclear power can solve global and environmental energy woes. Nuclear will play a leading role in mitigating the effects of high land-usage renewables on the grid, and growing populations in India, Africa, and Asia gaining carbon-free electricity according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Nuclear\u2019s Time Has ComeThe United States\u2019 nuclear industry has had a tough stretch, but the biggest obstacle to advanced reactor progress, lower emissions, and geopolitical stability is the modern environmental movement. What once was meant for good has taken on the stench of Malthusianism. Nuclear can also solve that woe.Todd Royal is the Senior Project Analyst for E4 Carolinas, a non-profit energy advocacy firm located in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he is working on a three-year grant for the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration focusing on a value chain study for the advanced nuclear technology sector (Generation IV reactors, SMRs, and advanced reactors).

        "hn_content": "The article discusses different scripts used across space and time, and the varying levels of difficulty in learning them. Examples of interesting scripts are provided such as Boustrophedon, Egyptian, and hieroglyphs. The alphabetic, nonpictographic languages, such as those in English, are easier to learn compared to pictographic ones that require rote memorization of thousands of pictographs and their modifiers. However, Chinese writing uses radical-phonetic compounds where one component indicates the general meaning of the character while the other hints at the pronunciation. English is also compared to other written languages, pointing out the conflicts between the spelling of a word and its pronunciation. Hangul, the Korean alphabet, is phonetic but lacks the ability to represent all phonetic sounds of a language. Hangul also requires an understanding of meaning to pronounce correctly. While English is highly phonetic, it suffers from a large lexicon filled with homophones, resulting in inconsistent spelling rules. More pictographic languages like Chinese are highly contextual and can convey a lot of meaning with a small number of characters. Mongolian script used to be horizontal and has since switched to vertical writing. Mirrored forms of letters, such as B and D, can be used interchangeably in certain contexts.The discussion in the comments section revolves around the various ways of writing and reading languages, including right-to-left, top-to-bottom, and left-to-right. Some comments describe how children's brains process information and how they are good at interpreting it quickly. It is noted that having to learn to recognize letters and words in both directions could be a significant expense. Finally, a term called \"boustrophedon,\" meaning \"writing as the ox plows,\" is introduced.The discussion revolves around different writing scripts and the difficulty of reading them. Some users share their experience with Mongolian script, which has Arabic and Syriac influences and rotates 90 degrees. The article explores the advantages and disadvantages of alternating scripts and whether they are more challenging to read than uniform scripts. The discussion also touches on the fall of Baghdad under Hulagu Khan and the historical relationship between Mongolian and other cultures. One user complains about the touchpad scrolling functionality on the website, while another suggests making a Chrome plugin to read alternate forward and mirror/backward lines.Discussion on the usage of Mongolian script, and its history with Cyrillic and traditional Mongolian script. Mongolian education in China, and the printing of Mongolian script on Chinese currency. Technical discussion of the use of vertical-lr writing mode and text-orientation property for displaying Mongolian script on websites. Some comments express admiration for the efficient use of screen space and well-designed website. Some discussion on language and script politics, including comparisons to other regions like Romania and the Soviet Union. Some technical issues with accessing and displaying the page. Some humor and sarcasm in the comments.No meaningful content.",
