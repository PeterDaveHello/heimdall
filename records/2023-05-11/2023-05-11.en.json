    "hn_content": "A Hacker News article on the \"fascinating\" process of seeing a webpage fetch itself byte by byte over TLS has inspired reminiscences from some readers on their early experiences with telnet, SMPT, and TCP in the late 1990s. One reader notes that \"being even somewhat conversant in some of the more popular protocols is like a superpower.\" Another surmises that today's SSH and HTTPS have reduced the chances of new users having such experiences, but also acknowledges that developer tools such as browser developer tools may help with learning about the web. In a related comment, someone else discusses encryption in QUIC as a way to bridge the current gap. Finally, the thread also touches on the pros and cons of text-based versus binary-based formats for the web, with one reader making a back-of-the-envelope calculation on how much CO2 would have been saved if HTML had been a binary format.Experts discuss the benefits and drawbacks of compressing text vs. binaries. While text compresses well, binary formats can still benefit from compression. Some argue that human readability justifies the extra size of text formats like HTML. The discussion also touches on the CO2 emissions saved by more efficient coding practices and by moving away from HTML to a well-engineered binary format. The challenges of version negotiation in binary protocols are discussed, with TLS 1.3 used as an example. Additionally, the benefits of binary-formatted game development, such as client-side prediction and lag compensation, are explained. The post highlights the complexities involved in network communication but also points out the incredible speed with which computers can perform these operations.Developers discuss technical details, including CPU clock limitations and the intricacies of TLS 1.3 key exchange. One user shares a helpful resource for understanding TLS connections. The conversation touches on issues of security and privacy in protocol design.- Developer created a TLS playground called subtls for exploring CAs, Cert Issuance, Client Certs, and other related services.\n- Users can point the playground at any domain to debug TLS-related issues.\n- Although there are no additional features, people find this tool helpful in understanding TLS debugging issues.\n- The loading of subTLS is client-side, so the annotations will not continue forever.\n- There is a discussion on TLS 1.3 compatibility mode and whether requiring back-compatibility is still needed.\n- QUIC could solve some problems by circumventing the middleboxes, but it has its own problems.\n- NEL and Report-To headers\u2019 purpose is explained on a link shared by another user.\n- A few users had issues loading the page due to network or proxy problems but resolved it eventually.\n- Some users found the tool reminiscent of using Wireshark to reverse engineer protocols.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News thread seeks information on modern developments in algorithms and data structures, positing that AI/ML seems to dominate the conversation today. A response points to conflict-free replicated datatypes (CRDTs) as an interesting topic and links to papers and references on the subject. The author of Diamond types discusses some of the problems with CRDTs, including using (random agent id, sequence number) as unique IDs for operations, which can result in troublesome bugs. They also pose the question of how to efficiently build a system that can query by hash without storing all of the hashes and how to enable users to permanently delete inserted text. Finally, discussion revolves around domain-specific CRDTs tailored to specific applications or a schema system for generic types that applies rules when merging.The discussion revolves around the efficiency and tradeoffs associated with CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) and storing hashes on disk. Diamond types library reduces the number of items processed by internally encoding the metadata, hence taking up only 0.1 bytes on disk per inserted character. For rolling back operations, adding junk data to every batch can solve the guessability problem. For efficient archival of data, cryptographic erasure techniques or salting with a public salt stored outside the DAG may be used to delete data, but the challenge is how to optimize network bandwidth and storage. FireSync is mentioned as a new collaborative editing alternative to Google Docs.A developer is building a scalable Yjs compliant backend on top of PostgreSQL with FireSync, and is open to feedback and feature requests. There has been an increase in the use of equivalency classes and e-graphs for optimization in compilers as well as extensions to Datalog programming with semilattice types for computing dataflow-type queries. The field of Approximate Nearest Neighbor search (ANN) has undergone advancements in data structure, with companies like Weaviate and Pinecone exploiting this. Two practical algorithmic advances include the Swiss Table for hash tables and pdqsort (Pattern-Defeating Quicksort) for internal unstable sort. There is- A person has been working on a problem related to sorting for around a decade, and has found a relatively simple solution that is expressible in a functional setting.\n- There have been new breakthroughs in cryptography and distributed algorithms, including improved zero-knowledge proofs/arguments and consensus protocols.\n- Refinement types are a formalized subset of precondition contracts that can be checked statically, and can be used to solve combinatorial problems.\n- Optimization algorithms are useful in various real-world applications such as marketing, finance, supply chain, and logistics, and can provide optimality bounds.\n- Parsing and casting to strings efficiently is still an open problem, with Ryu and Dragonbox standing out for float to string.\n- Capabilities, such as hyperloglog and other datasketch, have seen incremental progress.- Prometheus histograms may need hyperloglog treatment to improve on buckets \n- Prometheum \"native\"/\"sparse\" histograms are experimental, and seem to be a massive improvement \n- ddsketch and tdigest may be useful in the prom use case \n- Adaptative radix tree is a promising data structure \n- Algorithms with predictions study- The past few years have brought practical improvements to graph isomorphism algorithms.\n- Merkle trees and state tries have become increasingly important in resource-constrained environments.\n- Some individuals are re-studying data structures and algorithms for interviewing purposes, and may be interested in whether whiteboarding will become a thing of the past.\n- There may be new data structures and algorithms in progress to assist with machine learning training efficiency.",

    "hn_content": "A user on Hacker News has suggested the creation of an \"ai.txt\" file on websites which would contain basic information about the site to make it easier for AI crawlers to understand what the site is about. Some commenters have criticized the idea, stating that using robots.txt as a model for anything doesn't work and adding an ai.txt file would be meaningless. Others have discussed the broader issues of copyright law and its relationship to AI as well as the nature of creative expression and its ownership. There are no new or exciting developments related to technology discussed in the post.The discussion revolves around the impact of copyright law and how it affects creativity and competition. The lengthening of copyright terms has led to the consolidation of a few giant companies that own and control the vast majority of American culture. Brands built on IP dating back to the 1920s, such as Disney, have a strong edge over their competitors, thanks to the manipulation of laws to enhance the value of their IP. Some argue that reducing copyright term extensions can restore creativity and competition to the economy. However, more significant issues like AI and legal predation require similar attention to make meaningful change.Copyright laws and their impact on creativity and the economy are being discussed. The expiry of copyright can have benefits, such as increasing competition and passing wealth-generating potential to society. However, the length of copyright terms is controversial, with some arguing for shorter terms to encourage the creation of new works. There is also a debate regarding the use of works for AI training, with some advocating for the use of extended metadata such as ai.txt to signal the copyright holder's intention. It is important to recognize that robots.txt is a legal requirement for data mining in some countries, including Germany.The post discusses the idea of using an \"ai.txt\" file as a model for AI systems to use websites, similar to how \"robots.txt\" files help crawlers navigate sites. There is debate about the effectiveness of robots.txt files, with some arguing that they are merely a polite request with no legal weight. There is also discussion about the tension between stricter copyright laws for AI and calls for shorter copyright terms, with some suggesting that AI is being used for copyright laundering. There are suggestions for serving fake \"garbage\" content to distinguish bot traffic from real users, but disagreement over the effectiveness of such tactics. Overall, the post raises important questions and controversies regarding the intersection of AI and copyright law.The article discusses the idea of creating an \"ai.txt\" file, similar to the \"robots.txt\" file, to help websites communicate with AI-powered crawlers. Some commenters suggest that the crawlers may not trust the information provided in the file and that improving context recognition could be a more effective solution. Others argue that the current system of copyright and licensing is sufficient and adding more restrictions may have unintended consequences. There are also concerns about the use of AI training data and copyright violations, but some commenters suggest that creating licenses or terms of use for AI could help address these issues.The legal status of AI models trained on unlicensed content is uncertain, with potential lawsuits ongoing. A proposed ai.txt file could inform AI models not to train on certain content, but current solutions like robots.txt are already in place. Some suggest using existing conventions like security.txt or readme.txt. Adding restrictive licenses to software may not be enforceable. Some express concern that corporations are benefiting from free use of smaller content creators\u2019 platforms. Prompt injection in websites to disrupt current AI models is also being considered. However, a solution that blocks search engine crawlers may not be feasible. There may be potential for signed records with W3C Verifiable Credentials, although this requires further exploration.The comments discuss the idea of creating an \"ai.txt\" file on websites to provide information for AI training, in the same way that \"robots.txt\" specifies crawling rules for web crawlers. Some commenters argue that existing meta tags and structured data already provide this information, while others express concerns about potential misuse or misunderstanding of the information. There are also discussions about the meaning of the term \"robot\" and the potential for \"ai.txt\" to be used for micro-payment or licensing purposes. Overall, the idea of \"ai.txt\" is debated, with some seeing it as a useful tool for improving AI training and others questioning its utility and potential drawbacks.",

    "content": "2023-05-10The Leverage of LLMs for IndividualsDisclaimer: This article is not meant to provoke anxiety or exaggerate the power of GPT. It is merely my personal observation after using ChatGPT/GPT-4 intensively for the past six months. It is definitely not applicable to the vast majority of people. This article is for those who wish to create something and have no expectations of \u201cforeseeable returns\u201d on an individual level.GPT-4, not ChatGPTFirst of all, GPT-4 and ChatGPT are two different entities.If at this point in time (2023.05.10), there are still media outlets boasting or belittling GPT while using ChatGPT as an example instead of GPT-4, then it is not worth reading. You can see the benchmark from OpenAI\u2019s official website.https://openai.com/product/gpt-4As a Chinese person, looking at the recently released SuperCLUE large Chinese model benchmark, GPT-4 and other models have a chasm-like difference in professional capability, which also reflects the gap between them indirectly.https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/SuperCLUEBoundless CreativityI have never written front-end code before, but after 48 hours of conversation with GPT-4, I built a podcast search website. The website is open-sourced with a GPT-4.0 License to express my gratitude.PodFind - Acquire New Knowledge with PodcastsA few days later, I wanted to skip certain timestamps when watching videos on web pages. Without any experience in developing Chrome extensions, I followed the instructions by GPT-4 to create files, paste, and drag and drop, and achieved it in less than 15 minutes. I did not put it on the store, and it became a tool serving only me.TimestampXWhenever I have a new idea, I ask GPT-4 to write the most basic version, I provide feedback, it apologizes, and we iterate until we reach the 1.0 version I have in mind. I use up my GPT-4 quota (25 entries/3 hours) multiple times a day. With the support of GPT-4, I feel unstoppable. The overnight surge in productivity is intoxicating, not for making money or starting a business, but for the sheer joy of continuously creating ideas from my mind, which feels like happiness.More importantly, it gives me the courage to dream and attempt things beyond my current abilities. I even plan to create a 3D game.Recently, the two most frequent tasks I have used GPT for are:Copying and pasting documentation and APIs to GPT-4, asking it to write interfaces based on them. Current documentation is written for human reading, with a mix of text and code blocks that makes copying a poor experience. Perhaps soon, documentation and APIs will become GPT-friendly first.Having GPT write interfaces based on GPT official documentationTranslation and product localization. Even in the age of DeepL, longer sentences can still reveal machine translation traces. However, based on my experience, the translation capability of GPT(whether 3.5 or 4) is far surpasses DeepL. I can localize my products into dozens of other languages at once.Using GPT for localization in a dozen languagesUsing GPT to create product preview pages in other languagesWithin 5 months, I single-handedly launched 5 iOS apps.Individual, not CompanyLarge language models are a leverage that can amplify the abilities of each user.If you are an individual developer, the leverage it provides might be 10 times greater, but when you work for a company, that number might be only 2. So, even knowing the current economic downturn and wave of layoffs, for those who want to achieve ideas and create, I still want to express this bold opinion:Staying in any company right now is a negative return; you are wasting personal leverage.Unless you work for OpenAI, your GPT leverage is likely wasted on trivial business code, and even more likely that due to the overwhelming amount of poor code, GPT with its 4/8k context window is unable to optimize, further weakening the leverage.I see too many talented young people trapped in large companies, exhausting their energy in endless documentation and meetings. Maintaining income is the main reason, but they may also be unaware of the potential they have when using GPT alone.To be more extreme, I even think that joining any team is a kind of slowdown. Only by sailing alone in a small boat can one maintain agility.Setting Sail AloneHow to generate ideas and sustain a livelihood is not the scope of this article. Many people may not be aware of the leverage GPT-4 offers to individuals and may not have considered the endless possibilities it enables. What I am doing is simply informing them of these aspects.I hope this is useful to the 0.01% of readers.OLDER\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u6760\u6746",

GPT-4 has been particularly transformative, allowing users to ask questions and generate ideas quickly and efficiently. Users recommend breaking down projects into specific conversations to make the most of GPT's limited context recognition. LLMs offer the possibility of expanding median quality in a wide range of topics, which makes them powerful tools for novices and experts alike. Concerns arise regarding LLMs generating insecure code, but users can teach LLMs secure best practices. GPT-4 offers exciting potential, though questions remain regarding its ability to build large-scale systems.The profit potential for AI-generated applications and content is not particularly strong, and novel ideas and creativity are crucial. Good ideas and execution are important, and a deep or wide market is necessary for success. GPT-4 is useful for prototypes and writing utility functions, but it cannot replace higher-order operations. GPT-4 can help newcomers get over the learning curve but can also generate terrible code and lead to deficiencies in performance. ChatGPT is useful for quickly getting market information. AI has the potential to unlock opaque BI, make people smarter, and refine classes. AI is valuable for democratizing software development, but mentorship is crucial. There is optimism that ChatGPT will help newcomers get better at coding but also concerns that it will produce developers with no understanding of how their code works.ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, could help individuals learn to code and create practical programs that enhance their daily routines. It can be used as a tutor or mentor with extensive knowledge that provides hints and solutions based on the user's code. However, some individuals point out that learning to code properly requires writing everything yourself and that generated code may produce bugs and contribute to the creation of complex systems that people cannot control. Furthermore, there are concerns that massive amounts of code generated by GPT could result in a poor fit for the surrounding system or ecosystem. ChatGPT can be useful for debugging and explanations, and in the development of educational platforms that use AI tutors.- GPT-4 and ChatGPT are AI tools that reduce the learning curve in any new area\n- ChatGPT Plus or an API sign-up is required to access GPT-4\n- API access to GPT-4 is quickly granted for some, while others still wait after several weeks or more\n- AI tools may be useful for certain tasks, such as writing bash scripts or interpreting complex regex\n- AI tools may not be helpful for more substantial coding tasks, and the training data may become outdated over time\n- The sentiment is that AI should be used to empower people, especially those who are struggling physically, mentally, or emotionally, and not just for personal productivity gainsThe conversation revolves around the use of large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT for coding, and the potential impact on the role of developers in the industry. Some argue that LLMs can be helpful in generating code quickly, but it's important to understand the context and the limitations of such models. There are concerns about the over-reliance on LLMs and the potential devaluation of the role of junior developers. However, many believe that LLMs can be used as a complementary tool for software development, and can help with new language learning and code generation for less complex tasks. It's important for developers to find a balance between using LLMs and developing new skills to stay relevant in the industry.OpenAI's GPT-3 can be used to help with coding by generating functions for a given input object, but it lacks context and sandbox dev environment, limiting its usefulness. While it can be used to understand code blocks, it may not be able to help understand an application as a whole, and relying on it for entire projects risks creating spaghetti code. However, it can be useful for handling the syntax for a large system and generating code for specific functions, and for answering general and specific questions on architecture and structure of a project. It could also potentially be used for generating ESLint rules and unit tests after reviewing code.",

However, some were underwhelmed with what they saw and are concerned about the security and privacy surrounding the integration of AI. Google I/O included technical sessions and workshops in addition to business and product talks. While some attendees were disappointed with the lack of innovation in recent years, others found the developer-focused talks to be invaluable. There were criticisms of Google's customer service, advertising, and information hoarding, threatening democracy and human existence. Overall, there were mixed reviews of Google I/O 2023, with some excited about the future of AI while others were more skeptical.Google I/O, the annual developer conference, sparked controversy between developers for its lack of appeal to tech enthusiasts. As Google shifts its focus to executives and big buyers rather than developers, many believe the company has changed post-2012, where it was at the forefront of open standards and pushing the web forward. Despite negativity, Google I/O had great benefits, such as introducing computing resources to emerging economies and aspiring developers who couldn't afford to pay upfront. Besides arguing about whether or not Google I/O has become what it purports to be, users still look forward to new features and updates in Workspace, Bard, and the Cloud tracks, among others. Google I/O 2021 provided exciting updates to Workspace and Bard integration at the conference, which users are thrilled to explore.Google I/O 2023 announced a lineup of new AI features to be unveiled in the conference. However, the comments reveal skepticism and lack of interest in the talks. Google stresses its implementation of AI while facing criticism related to the effectiveness of their products in the competitive market (e.g., Google Translate vs. DeepL). As AI generated content is becoming more common, Google and other companies are exploring ways to embed watermarking to detect fake content. The audience must consider the potential consequences for society. Google I/O 2023 also discussed medical AI, sparking skepticism and hope for developments. The sentiment in the comments was more focused on the lack of engagement in the conference than the newly released AI tech.Apple's Final Cut Pro is already established and trusted, while Google's AI features are not widely used and there is a lack of trust due to the company's history of discontinuing products. Some professionals are skeptical about the practicality of Final Cut Pro on an iPad. Final Cut Pro may not be the industry standard for video production, as some professionals switched to Premiere after reception of FCP X was poor. Logic Pro, however, is widely used in the music industry. There has been a shift in sentiment towards large corporations like Google, with increased suspicion towards changes made by these companies. Some have noticed a decline in the level of maturity and thoughtfulness of comments on Hacker News, and a general trend towards negativity. There is a desire for tangible, hands-on products rather than theoretical talk about AI. Users' experiences with Gmail's spam filter vary.The discussion revolves around issues with Google's products and services, including poor spam filtering in Gmail, frustration over Google's product discontinuation, challenges accessing Google products outside of certain countries, and criticisms of Google's overreliance on targeted ads. There is also a debate about biases on Hacker News towards particular tech companies, including Apple, and how the term \"hacking\" is defined. Despite these issues, some commenters note that certain Google products, such as AppEngine, are still thriving, and one commenter suggests that Apple has a stronger claim to \"hacker culture\" than other tech companies.This post contains various comments about technology and ethics, including discussions about Steve Jobs, the meaning of the term \"hacker,\" and the biases of the Hacker News community. There is also a conversation about the challenges of finding good Bluetooth headphones and dealing with the removal of the headphone jack by Apple. Some comments include sarcastic or mocking tones but provide little meaningful content. Overall, the post lacks a central theme or notable update that would be of particular interest to readers.Apple's dongle is not an actual solution for most situations and is a worthless replacement for the headphone jack. Users have reported losing the dongles due to their small size, fragility, and incompatibility with devices without missing hardware. People prefer using AirPods for wireless audio instead of dongles, which is why Apple hasn't removed them. The push to use Apple products and services, such as Apple Music, is anti-competitive and alters defaults that matter to consumers. The sentiment on HN regarding Apple and Google varies, with some defending the companies and others criticizing them.",

    "hn_content": "YouTube is testing a feature that blocks videos unless the user disables ad blockers. A discussion on Hacker News focused on YouTube Premium and its relatively high cost for ad-free content compared to Netflix. Some users argued that the subscription price should be based on the revenue generated from ad views instead of a 1000% markup. However, others disagreed and noted that YouTube Premium is a good deal for regular users who would rather avoid ads and that creators prefer the subscription model since they earn more from Premium views than ad views. Overall, the discussion highlighted different perspectives on the value of ad-supported vs. paid content and suggested that both models have their own problems and benefits.Many millennials and early Gen Z/Zoomers purchase YouTube Premium to avoid distractions and enjoy long-term connections with creators. While there are alternatives like Vimeo and Reddit, YouTube holds a large following. YouTube Premium money funnels to creators with signed contracts, but some argue it is not worth paying for because the content is designed from the ground up to sell ads. Additionally, some people would rather support creators on their personal websites or Patreon. Despite these arguments, YouTube Premium users find it worth paying for because it offers ad-free access to YouTube and access to its music library. There are also alternatives to traditional ad-filled platforms, such as proper ad-blockers on desktop or alternative YouTube players for mobile. However, YouTube Premium's convenience and cheap pricing make it an attractive option.YouTube users discuss the implications of its ad-blocker block test. Some argue that ad-blocking is not cheating, while others suggest buying YouTube Premium is the solution. However, some users argue that Google's business model isn't working and content creators are starting to lead viewers to other platforms. The discussion also highlights the issues surrounding YouTube's arbitrary demonetization and restrictive algorithm, which is pushing users towards supporting creators directly through Patreon or other means. Overall, the discussion showcases the tension between content creators, advertisers, and users on the platform and raises questions about the sustainability of YouTube's business model.A debate over whether it's ethical to use ad-blockers on YouTube has erupted on hacker news. Users argue that forcing ads on viewers is unreasonable but also note that some content creators depend on ads or YouTube's Premium subscription service to make a living. While some criticize YouTube for its \"1984-esque\" restrictions, others point out that the platform needs to generate revenue - even if through ads - to fund its infrastructure and operations. Some users suggested donating money or supporting content creators directly through Patreon or other platforms. Viewers who use ad-blockers argue that it's a personal choice, but there is some resistance towards companies using ways to block their ad-blockers. YouTube Premium, which eliminates ads, remains a popular alternative for some.The post discusses the limitations and drawbacks of Youtube Premium. The author argues that the service offers a worse experience than third-party clients and ad-blockers, and that its subscription revenue payout structure is unhealthy for the ecosystem. The post suggests that direct donations to content creators are more valuable, and mentions Patreon and Twitch subscriptions as alternatives. The author emphasizes the importance of supporting content creators, rather than the platform. Some commenters defend Youtube Premium, but others suggest using other methods of supporting creators such as buying merchandise or directly donating to them. Overall, the post provides an insightful perspective on the current state of online video streaming and the challenges of supporting independent content creators.YouTube users discuss their frustrations with the platform, including wanting to be able to turn off ads without going incognito and wanting an option to disable \"Shorts.\" Some users defend paying for YouTube Premium as a way to support creators and avoid ads. Others express distrust in YouTube's recommendations algorithms and concerns about the platform's treatment of creators. One user suggests paying creators directly through services like Patreon or Kofi instead of giving money to Google. Despite these complaints, most users still use and enjoy the platform.Users debate the value of YouTube Premium, discussing the potential for added tiers and changes to the service, as well as concerns over logged-in accounts and the morality of advertising. Some users cite issues with Workspace accounts and device compatibility, while others argue that advertisement-based business models are unethical and criticize paid promotions and sponsored content on the platform. Despite some users expressing dissatisfaction with the service, others argue that paying for Premium is a fair trade-off for ad-free content and access to exclusive features.YouTube's ad model is necessary to keep the platform free, as users do not want to pay for content. The surveillance and propaganda on the platform are a drawback to paying for the premium service. The impossibility of remaining anonymous and the inconvenience of payment methods are also potential reasons for users to avoid premium. Users are likely to appreciate YouTube's value in aiding paid content creation for creators who want to monetize their content. However, this does not deny the fact that YouTube's content hosting service is like Imgur, where the content creators bear the costs of hosting. Lastly, the ability to monetize in the future may be uncertain given the limitations of YouTube's ad model and the difficulty in finding alternative methods of monetization.Patreon creators with a large number of patrons likely have millions of YouTube viewers; the proportion of viewers who pay is low. YouTube allows viewers to donate and leave comments through memberships and \"super thanks\", but they take a 30% cut, leading creators to use third-party options with lower fees. People prefer Patreon because it directly funds creators, and it's pay-what-you-want. YouTube Premium is unpopular due to mandatory music subscriptions, while Google Play Music was more popular. Many people dislike monthly subscriptions due to content provider fragmentation and changing content quality. Google's video content library is massive compared to Netflix, making caching difficult. Some suggest federated P2P networks or crypto-currency microtransactions for video sharing. Viewers dislike lengthy ads and distrust BigTech companies like Google.- Tech companies started with \"free\" internet services, but eventually introduced more and more ads, using more bandwidth than content on web pages.\n- Users accepted this as a reasonable compromise for limited ads and privacy protection, but then companies like Google became more invasive with personalized ads.\n- Youtube's \"ad-free\" paid tier eventually introduced ads, leading some users to switch to alternatives like Rumble or use ad-blockers.\n- Some users want a paid, ad-free video streaming service without predatory data collection or recommendation algorithms, but the economics of such a service may not be feasible.\n- There is a lack of trust in tech companies like Google due to their monetization tactics and the fact that users are essentially the \"product.\"",

This has prompted a discussion among software engineers on the best approach to assessing skills in job interviews. Some believe that asking open-ended questions or giving candidates tasks that test their skills in real-time is effective in revealing their expertise. Others argue that offering a welcoming and comfortable environment enables candidates to reveal their true abilities. Most agree that a candidate's ability to research and discover the answers to technical problems is important, and that memorization skills aren't a priority. Furthermore, some criticize the standard rigidity of existing interview processes. Life insurance policies and their fraud protection policies are tangentially related to the flawed interview process, with some policies requiring medical exams to confirm the physical condition of candidates, pointing out the paradox of the willingness of critics to fire people with less scrutiny than they employ to hire them.The post includes a discussion of various issues related to job interviews and hiring practices. Some interviewees cheat during interviews by referring to outside sources, including Google, to answer questions. The article notes that cheating is unfair and unethical to other interviewees and creates an uneven playing field. Internal evaluations for promotions may also be subject to unfair practices, including taking credit for work done by others. Additionally, the post discusses how the pandemic forced many remote interviews, which require more trust and accountability than in-person interviews. The article suggests that good work ethics and a culture of fairness and trust are essential for success in organizations.There is a discussion about cheating in the job interview process at Amazon on the Blind platform, with some individuals suggesting that cheating is acceptable and common, and others arguing that it is unethical. Some comments suggest that Amazon's corporate culture focuses too much on results and success over ethical behavior. Others suggest that the interviewing process is flawed and that cheating on questions is not necessarily an indicator of future job performance. There is also discussion about the market's ability to regulate unethical companies and the long-term implications of a culture that accepts cheating.The comments section discusses various topics from the perspective of cheating and lack of preparation. Some argue that cheating to get hired may lead to unethical behavior in the workplace, while others question the value of traditional interviews and tests. The discussion also touches on the importance of preparation, the value of flexible thinking, and the problems with a command-and-control management structure. However, there does not seem to be any specific new or exciting tech-related development or release discussed in this post.The post discusses how cheating is pervasive in the software engineering industry, with interviewees using resources such as Google and LeetCode to cheat during technical interviews. The comments include discussions on the changing nature of the software engineering industry, the use of IQ tests and LC tests for hiring, and the relationship between socioeconomic status and intelligence. The overarching theme is a debate over what constitutes fair competition and the role of honesty and integrity in the tech industry.This text contains a discussion about the inherent competitiveness of human nature and its impact on culture and civilization. Some argue that certain cultures may be more effective at tempering these excesses. There is also a discourse around cheating in job interviews and promotions, and its impact on work productivity and quality. It is suggested that cheating is more prevalent in a climate where honesty is not rewarded, and competition for high-paying jobs is fierce. Additionally, there is some talk about the growing trend of artificial intelligence and its impact on the programming industry. Finally, there is a mention of the importance of integrity, as well as the suggestion that humans will do anything to survive in a dog-eat-dog world, including violating their integrity.A discussion on cheating during tech interviews and whether cheating is justifiable due to flaws in the interview process. The discussion addresses biases, the role of credentials and tests, and the value of integrity in the context of business and life. The potential harm caused by shortcuts and cheating is also considered. The possibility of a coming breakthrough in AI technology is mentioned, which could change the current understanding of AI.

Factors contributing to cheating include poor planning skills, inability to write, lack of ethics, and the misalignment of hiring goals with the skills required for product delivery. The discussion in the comments covers topics like the broken interview process and the promotion process and its relation to cheating and merit. Overall, the post highlights the need for industry-wide reform to reduce cheating and raise standards of practice.There is a discussion about the arbitrariness of selection systems and the expectation for quick thinkers to perform better in job interviews than slow and deliberate thinkers. The article mentions a high school dropout, June Huh, who is a slow and methodical mathematician. Some comments express the opinion that cheating is inevitable in competitive selection processes, but others argue that allowing cheating undermines the integrity of the system. Some commenters point out that power asymmetry can lead to sociopaths taking over, while others believe that vigilant groups can prevent this.

    "content": "Why I'm done with Mouser ElectronicsMAY 10, 20231311I seldom complain about online retailers. When operating at a scale, a business needs to make tough calls to keep fraudsters and unreasonable customers at bay. In this spirit, I let most small grievances slide \u2014 and if I\u2019m fed up, I vote with my money without making a fuss.Today, I\u2019d like to make an exception. I\u2019m disappointed with a company I admired and recommended for two decades: Mouser Electronics. They are one of the two preeminent online component retailers in the United States. As an avid hobbyist, I must\u2019ve spent over $20,000 with them \u2014 and after a CS rep accidentally forwarded me some account stats, I know the margins on the account were pretty fat:For years, I steered fellow hobbyists toward Mouser because I felt they had transparent pricing, maintained a snappy website, and had policies that were friendly to retail customers \u2014 including no order minimums. But their main competitor \u2014 DigiKey \u2014 has made strides. Meanwhile, a series of comical mishaps with Mouser over the past 10 months make me seriously doubt their focus on the customer.The first signs of troubleMy misadventures with Mouser started last year. I noticed that in addition to standard UPS and FedEx shipping choices that cost around $10, the company added an economy option down the list:This is an attractive choice if you need to make small revisions to your projects, or are running low on a single type of a commodity part that costs just a couple of bucks per bag. I started using this option with some regularity.Behind the scenes, it appeared that the packages were deprioritized in the warehouse: non-economy orders almost always shipped within 24 hours, while the economy option would sometimes take 2-3 days. But eventually, you\u2019d receive a UPS Mail Innovations tracking number, the package would be tendered to UPS, and you\u2019d have the goods at your doorstep in under a week (for Mail Innovations, USPS does the last mile).But then, in September 2022, I noticed that one of the packages was never tendered to UPS. It had a tracking number, but there was absolutely no scan activity in the nearly two weeks following the supposed ship date.I contacted Mouser to report the issue \u2014 and received this reply:\u201cDue to the ship via method USPS Economy, it will take an estimated 7-10 business days for your order to arrive. \u201cI know that CS reps have a lot of tickets to go through quickly, so I replied matter-of-factly that we\u2019re past the 10 day mark, and that the package isn\u2019t merely delayed in transit: the carrier has no record of receiving it. After that, the CS rep went radio silent.Fine, stuff happens \u2014 perhaps they misclicked something in the CRM, or were out of the office. I started another ticket and was able to get in touch with another person. They replied with:\u201cDue to shipping method Economy the post office does not provide tracking information. Please allow up to 15 business days for delivery. \u201cBut we did have a tracking number, and at that point, we were at the 15 day mark! Again, the package wasn\u2019t merely making its way through the shipping network, it never left the warehouse. The rep didn\u2019t address that, but ultimately offered a replacement. OK, easy enough.Except, that replacement wasn\u2019t coming. Instead, I started getting phone calls asking me to provide credit card information for the CS-created order. I explained that the new shipment was meant to be a replacement; the rep seemed befuddled, but eventually offered a refund instead. Several days later, the money showed up in my account, I manually reordered the parts, and moved on.A week later, the UPS guy showed up not just with my reordered parts, but with a mystery collect-on-delivery package from Mouser. I refused that second delivery and promptly emailed Mouser, telling them that they shipped the COD package in error. This was getting weird, but still \u2014 no harm done.Then, about two months later, I started getting urgent calls from their collections department. They demanded payment for the \u201cunpaid invoice\u201d for the COD shipment. How? Why? I don\u2019t know, but I had to spend some time on the phone to clear it up.Another $20 \u201ceconomy shipping\u201d package went AWOL in the meantime. I footed the bill and I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out.Deja vu all over againFor the next couple of months, I decided to stick to the more expensive but dependable FedEx / UPS shipping options, and encountered no issues to speak of. But in April 2023, the allure of low-cost shipping once again proved to be too strong to resist \u2014 and I figured that whatever transient issues they had with this shipping option or with CS, it must be in the rearview mirror by now.Well, not so: a couple of packages arrived on time \u2014 but then, two orders vanished down the same warehouse black hole, never tendered to the carrier and seemingly gone for good:I waited a good while before contacting Mouser. I noted that this was a recurring issue and that there\u2019s something clearly wrong with that shipping option. The rep ignored all that, incorrectly asserted that UPS Mail Innovations is not trackable, and then gave an out-of-whack delivery estimate of four weeks:\u201cThis transit method can possibly take 4 Weeks from the date shipped to be delivered. [\u2026] Unfortunately, the order is not traceable.\u201dAfter a bit of back-and-forth, the rep finally offered a refund, but only for one of the two missing packages. It took another request to get the remainder, but I noticed that the amounts are a couple of bucks short. Why? Well, here\u2019s the kicker:\u201cWe do not refund shipping charges only merchandise value.\u201dFor a business, there are circumstances where you want the customer to share some of the cost of frivolous refunds or returns. But in this case, I can\u2019t imagine why I\u2019m being made to hold the bag \u2014 and I\u2019m starting to think that abusive and inattentive customer service is a consistent pattern, not a one-off.The last strawAfter that last interaction, I decided to reorder the missing parts. This included MCP4131-104E, a digipot chip I used in the Dog-o-Matic amplifier project featured on this Substack earlier on.To my surprise, I received this email:Apparently, after my last CS interaction, they reviewed my account and classified it as a \u201cdistributor\u201d. This might sound innocent, but it\u2019s a punitive label: it\u2019s designed to prevent eBay scalpers from purchasing certain hard-to-obtain components and flipping them for profit. Of course, if you follow this Substack, you know I\u2019m not doing any of that. I\u2019m a serious hobbyist \u2014 and the hobby is a money sink, not a source of any revenue. I did have a spike in orders in 2023, but this had to do with projects such as building several dozen Sir Box-a-Lot consoles for family and friends.Don\u2019t get me wrong, mistakes happen \u2014 but it\u2019s a pattern, not a fluke, and it is inexcusable for a specialty, high-margin business. It seems that you can get slapped with this label as a consequence of being a bother to a rep \u2014 with no advance notification, no recourse, and no way to know which parts of your order might be canceled down the line. At a time when most other retailers are trying to attract DIYers, Mouser will throw you under the bus if you\u2019re not important enough \u2014 and four figures a year still keep you a bus-worthy customer.But the best part? They charged my PayPal account for all line items on that order, canceled some \u2014 and so far, have not refunded the rest. There goes another $10?Mouser is not a scam, and you might shop with them for years and never run into issues. But there\u2019s something to be said about not patronizing businesses like that when you do have a choice. If you can, go with DigiKey.13 Likes\u00b71 Restack1311",

The discussion also touched on the controversy surrounding the hacker, Maia Arson Crimew, who has a Wikipedia page detailing her various hacks.In a whimsical aside, some users noted the availability of the .gay top-level domain and made jokes about potential website names.People are debating the use of Jenkins as an outdated system and its potential replacements, with some conceding that Jenkins has a better plugin ecosystem for certain features, while others argue that newer systems are better designed and more stable. Many big companies with data restrictions still use Jenkins, however. Several alternative CI/CD tools like GitLab CI, Drone CI, Woodpecker CI, etc. are offered for those who want to self-host. Embedded developers, aviation companies, and even honey pot creators still use Jenkins for its extendable and configurable nature. The comments also shifted towards discussing the challenges of switching from older systems to new ones.A security researcher discovered that OptimEyes.ai, a company that provides automated cybersecurity services, had an internet-facing Jenkins instance containing backups of its production data on an AWS S3 bucket, resulting in a data leak affecting over a thousand clients. While some commenters made jokes or pointed out the irony of a cybersecurity company being hacked, others criticized the company for its poor security practices, such as creating an internet-facing Jenkins instance, not properly segmenting customer data, and failing to use multi-factor authentication. A few commenters also discussed their nostalgia for the early days of the internet and the aesthetic of old websites.No meaningful content to summarize.",

One commenter praised the change, while another said it wasn't a noticeable difference. Suggestions were provided to make the logo look better, and some users noted issues with the design. One user suggested the sharp contrast between the bright orange and white hurt his eyes, while others claimed the icon is too small and hard to see. One user suggested that the icon should match the user-selected top-bar color, while another requested more space between the upvote and downvote buttons.",
