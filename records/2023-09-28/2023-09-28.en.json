I wanted to use a pi4 to be my home TV controller to stream content to a TV or projector.A long time ago I saw this appear: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26495719And it seemed to sort of work but not quite enough. There were stutters in the content streamed and strange clicks in the audio. Will this new one be enough? Was that even the likely limiting factor? reply Chatting 3 hours agoprevI question whether it&#x27;s wise to launch a new product before the supply chain issues which have plagued Raspberry Pi for years have been fully resolved.Granted, the situation has improved slightly over the past few months. But you will still find Pi 4s out of stock more often than not.The CEO said last year not to expect a Pi 5 in 2023, because they wanted to take the time to recover. Why the u-turn?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;23520400&#x2F;raspberry-pi-5-... reply numpad0 1 hour agoparentI think it&#x27;s completely acceptable so long that a legacy compatible \"Pi SE\" options would be available, in Pi 3 and Pi 4 form factors.Raspberry Pi are used installed as components into third party engineered products, and Raspberry Pi brand holds no value to potential industrial customers if new products did not technologically exchange with existing such products. That is to say the exact mounting details, electrical compatibility, software compatibility, DO provide the value the \"Raspberry Pi\" brand offers if its competitors offered it.What I&#x27;m saying is, if Espressif brought that new ESP-branded 32bit thing in the Pi 3 mounting dimensions and onboard eMMC and 1&#x2F;5th performance at $35+9%, that kind of thing could outsell Pi 5 at this rate, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind watching that happening. reply fanf2 43 minutes agorootparentCheck out the “obsolescence statement” on the Raspberry Pi product pages.

I&#x27;m hoping a few scalpers are about to get seriously burned.Interestingly Digikey has over 2000 left. I wonder if they are limiting quantities. reply michaeltimo 2 hours agorootparentprevFinding older models were also almost impossible in the past two years. It&#x27;s unlikely that Raspberry Pi 5 will solve the issue. But even so, it&#x27;s not a wise move because what is the point of bringing a new model when they can&#x27;t make it available to normal people? reply fanf2 41 minutes agorootparentThe Raspberry Pi 5 will only be for sale to individuals until the end of this year (no industrial customers competing for inventory like the older models) reply meragrin_ 1 hour agorootparentprev> they can&#x27;t make it available to normal peopleI guess you haven&#x27;t been looking recently? I can go to a local store and pick one up. It looks easy to pick up one online too.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rpilocator.com&#x2F; reply giancarlostoro 1 hour agorootparentI think I&#x27;ve seen Pi Kits at my local target. The issue with those is, they&#x27;re for niche things I might not care about and now I got tech waste on my hands, but also might not be the exact model I want.Note I&#x27;m not disagreeing, just saying in some cases, the ones in-store are kits. reply lonjil 3 hours agoparentprevIt may be that whatever is currently bottlenecking RPi4 production isn&#x27;t relevant to RPi5. reply a_paddy 59 minutes agorootparentThrough hole components resulted in previous Pi&#x27;s being slightly slower to manufacture, the Pi5 only uses surface mount components which should increase Sony&#x27;s build cadence. reply tpmx 8 minutes agorootparentThe bottleneck has been component availability (\"supply chain\"), not manufacturing. reply cameron_b 2 hours agorootparentprevThe RP1 I&#x2F;O custom silicon hints that this may be the case reply rasz 26 minutes agoparentprevCEOs lie, thats in their job description.My little pi CEO anecdote: Eben Upton visited local hackerspace many years ago, someone asked about Pi2 (or maybe 3) potential release date and should he wait or buy now, Eben answered they arent even planning next version. A week later Pi2 was announced. reply impalallama 23 minutes agoprevSurprised by the amount of negativity here. So many comments that are saying the raspberry pi isn&#x27;t competitive in their market anymore and then post more locked down less open systems at 2x the price. reply teamonkey 0 minutes agoparentSame as the people on Reddit claiming that Raspberry Pi has killed itself as a business because it&#x27;s constantly in such high demand that it&#x27;s always sold out. reply stkdump 7 hours agoprevNo word on price. When Raspberry Pi first launched, this was the prime feature of the thing. Can we expect same price as the Raspberry Pi 4? (at the respective RAM level)Edit: found it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;introducing-raspberry-pi-5&#x2F;So the 4 GB model is 60$, which is 5$ more than the 4 GB model of the Raspberry 4 when that was launched: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-... . I guess that is fair, especially with inflation nowadays. So they stay true to the idea of making this available for cheap. reply Archelaos 2 hours agoparent> I guess that is fair, especially with inflation nowadays.The accumulated inflation in the US since June 2019 is c. 17%.[1] This means US$ 55 in June 2019 is \"worth\" c. US$ 64.35 today. So it seems that you get a 4GB Raspi 5 for c. 7.25% less today.The \"US Real Average Hourly Earnings\" have increase by ca. 22% in the same period, from US$ 27.75 to US$ 33.82.[2] So an average person needs to work c. 12% less to buy a 4GB Raspi 5 today.However, I think the issue is more complicated: There is inherent deflation in electronics, which is included in the inflation rate. you can observe it when looking at the current price of a 4GB Raspi 4 at Amazone, which is c. US$ 67. So if the introductory price for a Rapsi 5 is really going to be US$ 60, you get something better for more than 10% less now.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usinflationcalculator.com&#x2F;inflation&#x2F;current-infl...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;archives&#x2F;realer_07112019.ht... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;empsit.t19.htm reply wredue 1 hour agorootparentPlease stop using “average” for wage comparisons. It’s an utterly useless metric for showing if wages are moving or not.If you must use average, then you should remove the top 5% from the average. reply sapiogram 39 minutes agorootparent> If you must use average, then you should remove the top 5% from the average.5% is too arbitrary, just use the median. reply martijnvds 7 hours agoparentprev$60 for the model with 4GB of RAM and $80 for 8GB.It&#x27;s mentioned in Eben Upton&#x27;s blog post (linked from the announcement):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;introducing-raspberry-pi-5&#x2F; reply sillysaurusx 4 hours agorootparentSure, if you want the raw board and nothing else. I spent $100 for a starter kit that had an enclosure and some heat sinks.

In states with sales tax you will be paying more. reply UncleSlacky 3 hours agorootparentprevAs is tradition. reply qwertox 5 hours agoprevA NVMe compatible M.2 M Key connector (like the Rock 5 Model B [0] has) would have been really nice. I&#x27;m starting to accumulate old but good, yet small in storage space terms NVMe&#x27;s which I&#x27;m no longer needing, but which would be perfect for a Raspi. Even if the PCIe bus were an older generation and not as performant as the NVMe.The microSD card slot is really great to have, to get up-and-running, but once it&#x27;s clear which function the board will serve, being able to move over to a directly connected old NVMe would really be a benefit, also in terms of reliability. These microSD cards scare me, yet I make full use of them.Finally having a battery backed RTC on it is really great news.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.radxa.com&#x2F;Rock5&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;5b reply teamonkey 4 hours agoparentThe blog post says they&#x27;re releasing a M.2 hat in \"early 2024\" reply mintplant 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t love that you&#x27;ll have to choose between PoE, M.2, or active cooling &#x2F; a case. reply danbee 1 hour agorootparentYou won&#x27;t have to. They can all be stacked. reply SparkyMcUnicorn 1 hour agorootparentWould active cooling work underneath another hat? reply mbreese 36 minutes agorootparentIt looks like the M2 socket will be connected with a flexible ribbon, so it is possible that it could be mounted below. replysillysaurusx 4 hours agoparentprevFwiw I bought a sleeve for my M.2 SSD and it plugs into usb3 with very little slowdown. It gets 500MiB read and 1.2GiB write. Haven’t measured vs native M.2 to compare, but it’s fast enough that I’d be surprised if the pi were blocked waiting for I&#x2F;O vs native M.2. And native M.2 comes with increased manufacturing complexity. reply LtdJorge 2 hours agorootparentAre you sure it&#x27;s 1.2GiB? The RPi comes with 5Gb&#x2F;s USB ports, which is 596MiB&#x2F;sNow that I think about it, Linux may be caching writes, but even then double the write speed compared to the read speed seems weird. reply sillysaurusx 1 hour agorootparentOh, I didn’t test on a pi, just a mac. And yeah the double write speed was super weird. Thanks for answering my internal question about why ~500MiB seemed to be the max. reply proxysna 3 hours agoparentprevSame with orange pi5 and 5b. Having an option for a faster and reliable storage is amazing. SD cards are great when you prototype or need just enough storage to netboot a device, but past that it is limiting. reply schappim 2 hours agoparentprevThis would limit you to just connect SSDs. Their solution opens up more versatile access to other PCIe devices. reply mastax 1 hour agorootparentIn addition to the ability to adapt M.2 slots into PCIe via an inexpensive adapter, there is a growing ecosystem of M.2 cards for most of the things you&#x27;d use a PCIe card for. USB controllers, SATA controllers, Ethernet controllers, FPGAs, even display adapters. reply ltbarcly3 2 hours agorootparentprevIt would not limit you to just SSDs, the m.2 connector on the rk3588 devices generally exposes 4 pcie lanes and an adapter to make this a full pcie slot is already available. So really an m.2 nvme connector is the best of both, you can turn it into any other pcie connector you want via an adapter, but you can just put an nvme ssd directly on the board without a hat. reply heresie-dabord 3 hours agoparentprevI recommend booting Pi 4 and Pi 400 from external (USB) NVMe in an enclosure. reply antx 3 hours agorootparentIndeed, but it&#x27;s somewhat of a hassle. Having everything integrated on the board, or in the same case, is nicer. reply glimshe 4 hours agoprevRasbperry Pis are losing their competitive edge for non-embedded applications to sub $150 mini PCs, which support Linux&#x2F;Windows and will come with enclosure, NVMe slot, power button etc. The mini PCs are also generally much faster. reply irusensei 1 hour agoparentThat&#x27;s true as long as you don&#x27;t mind using modified vendor supplied operating systems. Most of these advanced boards will lock you into some patched Ubuntu version.So far from the ones I&#x27;ve worked only the Pi and a patched Rockpro64 allows you to boot some generic USB installer from UEFI and have the system your way with mainline kernel support. reply IE6 1 hour agorootparentI agree with you about dev boards but I think their post was focused on things like used NUCs or other small x86 machines that are only marginally larger than a Pi in an enclosure and include literally everything you&#x27;d want (enclosure, pwa fan, SATA SSD, NVMe, wifi, etc.) and the software support is there (linux &#x2F; windows). reply nine_k 11 minutes agorootparentHow about power consumption, especially in when not under load? I remember that Intel chips were not as efficient at it as chips with ARM cores. reply bradfa 1 hour agorootparentprevI didn&#x27;t see any mention of UEFI in my first read through about the Pi 5. Did I just miss it?I would like to have a quiet and reasonably performant ARM aarch64 box at this price point, but only if it supports UEFI without needing to resort to silly EFI system partition tricks (which the Pi 4 required, last I knew). reply fanf2 32 minutes agorootparentOne of the differences in the Raspberry Pi 5 is the bootloader is in EEPROM. It has 2MiBytes which they doubt would be enough to fit a UEFI implementation. So it sounds to me like there isn’t much chance of UEFI this time. reply geerlingguy 45 minutes agorootparentprevNo official UEFI support at this time. reply BackBlast 36 minutes agorootparentprevHe&#x27;s talking about off the shelf PCs, not Arm based SBCs with a wonky software stack. reply ranting-moth 1 hour agoparentprevInteresting.

For example, there are Raspberry Pi Pico firmwares out there that present as a normal gpiochip. I recently set up a pico with 3D printer firmware (Klipper, specifically) so I could control power to my actual printer, which actually works surprisingly well. reply chalsprhebaodu 3 hours agoparentprevWhere can I find these mini PCs? I am trying to find hardware for an upcoming project and I’m considering the Pi but would love to see some alternatives. reply tommerjones 3 hours agorootparentI’ve purchased a few HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Minis (refurbished) for about $125 on Amazon. They even come with Windows 10 if you’re looking for that. They’re a deal considering the Pi’s extra expenses like power, case, storage, etc. reply rdschouw 1 hour agorootparentPower consumption is a consideration though depending on your use case and setup. A Pi 4 draws about 3W on light load and these G3 Minis take 10-12W.Of course if you deck out a Pi 4 with a SSD and a fan, it&#x27;ll come much closer to the G3 Mini in terms of power consumption. reply pleoxy 1 hour agorootparentThe Dell wyse 5070 idles close to 3-5 watts. A bit more than the pi, but pretty close. It&#x27;s older now, can be picked up cheaper than a pi off eBay. DDR 4, sata m.2, on board emmc flash. M.2 a-key for WiFi. Max 16GB ram.When you throw in m.2, lots of ram, all that IO eats power. So the minimum idle power creeps up. Arm boards too. reply Damogran6 2 hours agorootparentprevThere is also a general improvement in code support by sticking with x86. I bought a similar 10 year old i5 based workstation dell and so many little things just work _better_. I didn&#x27;t realize just how much of my battles were based on hardware architecture issues. reply pleoxy 59 minutes agorootparentAgreed, burns so much time messing around with arm and the limited IO suite. reply vladvasiliu 3 hours agorootparentprevI love the principle of the mini elitedesks, but some have a terribly annoying fan. It&#x27;s not firmly attached to the chassis, so it rattles while spinning (and it spins all the time). The heatsink uses a proprietary 3 point attachment, so you can&#x27;t use a big aftermarket cooler instead (even though it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the case, I would have accepted the compromise).Not sure about the =G7, but the G4 and G5 have the issue. The G6 seems to have the fan attached more firmly, but I&#x27;ve never tested one in a quiet room. reply darkwater 1 hour agorootparentprevI did something similar too, just beware of refurbishers putting cheap&#x2F;trash SSD disks in those machine, they can stop working all of a sudden sooner than later (I experienced that on my skin) reply hypercube33 2 hours agorootparentprevHp Elitedesk and prodesk are the two 1L available models they have you want to hunt for.Lenovo has M700, M75q (AMD) and a bunch others ranging from thin client to workstation performance.Generally new ones are awesome at about $700 but older ones are absolutely capable for upgrading ram, disk, wifi whatever. there are modules for up to 10g and other things too.

They are still available, and they still make them. If you have low power needs, you can use those. reply foggywin 8 hours agoparentprevDid you read the blog post? :)\"Raspberry Pi 5 consumes significantly less power, and runs significantly cooler, than Raspberry Pi 4 when running an identical workload. However, the much higher performance ceiling means that for the most intensive workloads, and in particular for pathological “power virus” workloads, peak power consumption increases to around 12W, versus 8W for Raspberry Pi 4.\" reply ZuLuuuuuu 3 hours agorootparentIs there a way to limit the processor power so that it never exceeds a certain threshold? Because some people might be okay with slower processor if it means less power usage. reply publicmail 3 hours agorootparentI think at least with the Pi 4, you can limit the CPU clock by editing a config file, which has a power limiting effect. reply moffkalast 6 hours agorootparentprevAlright so 27W with heavy peripheral draw then? But 12 W still means it&#x27;ll be drawing 2.4 amps instead of 1.6 when a random process decides to 100% it. I guess we can always underclock it.The real unanswered question is, does it finally have a damn sleep mode so it can save power when idle. reply pja 6 hours agorootparentJeff Geerling measured 1.8W idle power draw.Based on my experience with previous Pis, I bet you’ll be able to drop that even further by turning off unused board components at boot time. reply moffkalast 6 hours agorootparentTrue, I&#x27;ve gotten Pi 4s pretty low ( # for i in &#x2F;sys&#x2F;class&#x2F;leds&#x2F;*; do echo 0 > \"$i&#x2F;brightness\"; done[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;raspberrypi&#x2F;firmware&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1742 reply doubled112 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had this drive me crazy.The required lines were different between the Pi 2 and Pi 4 I was using at the time, and the documentation was not updated (or I&#x27;d found old docs).An exercise in trial and error. replypipo234 5 hours agorootparentprevI read that the \"PC style\" power button allows both soft and hard shutdown, so I suppose suspend and hibernate come into the picture as well.

This is lower than the 1.2A limit on Raspberry Pi 4, though generally still sufficient to drive mice, keyboards, and other low‑power peripherals.This is also very uncool, since powering it through the GPIO header with a capable PSU won&#x27;t trigger the PD signal and makes it impossible to draw any meaningful current through USB?

It will probably throttle and run slower.Meanwhile an adult using the pi could put on a cooler and wring lots of performance out of it. reply rsaxvc 2 hours agorootparentprevSays h265 decode, but nothing about h264. Does VC7 do h264 like VC6, or not at all? reply dragontamer 8 hours agoparentprevBeaglebone (from Texas Instruments) is more open, but still not as open as you&#x27;d probably like. Still, its a better balance than what Rasp. Pi organization has (more documents are available on AM335x, open-hardware for Beaglebone Green and reference designs, full chip specifications and the like). Beaglebone isn&#x27;t really \"more expensive\", as much as its just \"lower specs at the same price\" though.The \"most open\" are MPU chips and their associated \"System on Module\" boards. This isn&#x27;t quite a SBC, but its easier to use than a BGA. These SoMs are very poor from price&#x2F;performance perspectives, but instead serve as reference designs and&#x2F;or prototypes to the $8 or $9 chips. The overall expectation is that you&#x27;re \"supposed\" to be building your own PCBs eventually, so the SoM are kind of just a prototyping aid.Most SoM provide 100+ pins from the chip as well, meaning you absolutely have to build a PCB to use them. However, 2-layer boards solder very easily to a SoM with castilliated edges (even with a hand-soldering iron)... albeit with a bit of flux and technique and practice. Its just the easiest way to deliver the most-pins of customization in the smallest space. So a relative beginer should be able to boot an SoM. The most difficult routing and Power-Delivery-Network details are already solved on an SoM, you just gotta apply power and build out the final interfaces &#x2F; connectors.Take the ATSAMA5D27-SOM1, 104-pins in a 40x40mm form factor. $50 from Mouser for 500Mhz and 128MB RAM (though fully open source and fully documented at linux4sam, and processor manual, U-boot process and everything). But the underlying SiP (MPU + DDR2 RAM) is like $15... while the MPU alone is like $8 and 128MB of DDR2 RAM is only like $3.50 in practice. Since in mass-production, you&#x27;d probably have a custom PCB anyway, that&#x27;s the most expected use case. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linux4sam.org&#x2F;bin&#x2F;view&#x2F;Linux4SAM . I&#x27;d say that Microchip &#x2F; Atmel&#x27;s MPUs seem to be the best documented that I&#x27;ve found, but are unfortunately the lowest specs. Still, they also have some of the lowest power-consumption (like 200 mW or something), so really they&#x27;re in a low-power class of their own. Still Linux though.------------STM32MP1 is the MPU from ST Micro. Like the Microchip SAM-MPU series, the STM32MP1 is available in SOM, SiP, and \"raw\" MPU form. Except the SOMs are like $100+, the SiP is like $50+, while MPU is $10ish.-------------I know NXP has a huge line of MPUs. I haven&#x27;t researched them yet though.---------------I think all the hardware designers at this level just \"assume\" that their customers, if they care about \"open source\", are probably making their own PCBs.If someone \"just\" wants a SBC (like the Rasp. Pi), there&#x27;s not much point in publishing a ton of documents. People can just boot the Rasp. Pi and start messing with Linux.-------I got no experience with this yet. I&#x27;m just curious and am thinking of a simple MPU layout project ever since I discovered that OSHPark has 6-layer boards and KiCAD supports BGAs in practice. Overall, these lower-power lower-end MPUs fill a different niche than a Rasp. Pi ever would. But I feel like there&#x27;s enough overlap that these might scratch your \"open source\" and \"fully documented\" itches. reply m463 7 hours agorootparentI always thought the beaglebone had a better hardware design. The thing I first noticed was the female header pins - why would the pi have pins that can be shorted out?the beaglebone pru is cool too.But all of that pales in comparison to the huge mindshare the pi has, which makes all the difference. reply yjftsjthsd-h 7 hours agoparentprevPerhaps something from pine64? reply alexellisuk 6 hours agoprevHi, I&#x27;ve been testing the RPi5 for a few weeks and have written up my results and benchmarks on Twitter.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;alexellisuk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1707296079849365650?s=20This is so much quicker for clusters, servers and headless use, that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d consider buying any more RPi4s myself. reply justinclift 6 hours agoparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;alexellisuk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1707296079849365650 reply Fnoord 6 hours agoparentprevGood, then the price of second hand RPi4 will go down as it has been ridiculously expensive (even though I&#x27;m settled, still makes me happy for other people).I&#x27;ll wait for a CM module before I consider to replace my CM4 fleet, but for now I am happy with my CM4 as it is.

    "originBody": "Developers Product Company News Contact Us Mistral 7B The best 7B model to date, Apache 2.0 September 27, 2023 Mistral AI team Mistral AI team is proud to release Mistral 7B, the most powerful language model for its size to date. Mistral 7B in short Mistral 7B is a 7.3B parameter model that: Outperforms Llama 2 13B on all benchmarks Outperforms Llama 1 34B on many benchmarks Approaches CodeLlama 7B performance on code, while remaining good at English tasks Uses Grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference Uses Sliding Window Attention (SWA) to handle longer sequences at smaller cost We’re releasing Mistral 7B under the Apache 2.0 license, it can be used without restrictions. Download it and use it anywhere (including locally) with our reference implementation Deploy it on any cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), using vLLM inference server and skypilot Use it on HuggingFace Mistral 7B is easy to fine-tune on any task. As a demonstration, we’re providing a model fine-tuned for chat, which outperforms Llama 2 13B chat. Performance in details We compared Mistral 7B to the Llama 2 family, and re-run all model evaluations ourselves for fair comparison. Performance of Mistral 7B and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks. For all metrics, all models were re-evaluated with our evaluation pipeline for accurate comparison. Mistral 7B significantly outperforms Llama 2 13B on all metrics, and is on par with Llama 34B (since Llama 2 34B was not released, we report results on Llama 34B). It is also vastly superior in code and reasoning benchmarks. The benchmarks are categorized by their themes: Commonsense Reasoning: 0-shot average of Hellaswag, Winogrande, PIQA, SIQA, OpenbookQA, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and CommonsenseQA. World Knowledge: 5-shot average of NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA. Reading Comprehension: 0-shot average of BoolQ and QuAC. Math: Average of 8-shot GSM8K with maj@8 and 4-shot MATH with maj@4 Code: Average of 0-shot Humaneval and 3-shot MBPP Popular aggregated results: 5-shot MMLU, 3-shot BBH, and 3-5-shot AGI Eval (English multiple-choice questions only) An interesting metric to compare how models fare in the cost/performance plane is to compute “equivalent model sizes”. On reasoning, comprehension and STEM reasoning (MMLU), Mistral 7B performs equivalently to a Llama 2 that would be more than 3x its size. This is as much saved in memory and gained in throughput. Results on MMLU, Commonsense Reasoning, World Knowledge and Reading comprehension for Mistral 7B and Llama 2 (7B/13/70B). Mistral 7B largely outperforms Llama 2 13B on all evaluations, except on knowledge benchmarks, where it is on par (this is likely due to its limited parameter count, which restricts the amount of knowledge it can compress). Note: Important differences between our evaluation and the LLaMA2 paper’s: For MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset For TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts Flash and Furious: Attention drift Mistral 7B uses a sliding window attention (SWA) mechanism (Child et al., Beltagy et al.), in which each layer attends to the previous 4,096 hidden states. The main improvement, and reason for which this was initially investigated, is a linear compute cost of O(sliding_window.seq_len). In practice, changes made to FlashAttention and xFormers yield a 2x speed improvement for sequence length of 16k with a window of 4k. A huge thanks to Tri Dao and Daniel Haziza for helping include these changes on a tight schedule. Sliding window attention exploits the stacked layers of a transformer to attend in the past beyond the window size: A token i at layer k attends to tokens [i-sliding_window, i] at layer k-1. These tokens attended to tokens [i-2*sliding_window, i]. Higher layers have access to informations further in the past than what the attention patterns seems to entail. Finally, a fixed attention span means we can limit our cache to a size of sliding_window tokens, using rotating buffers (read more in our reference implementation repo). This saves half of the cache memory for inference on sequence length of 8192, without impacting model quality. Fine-tuning Mistral 7B for chat To show the generalization capabilities of Mistral 7B, we fine-tuned it on instruction datasets publicly available on HuggingFace. No tricks, no proprietary data. The resulting model, Mistral 7B Instruct, outperforms all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B chat models. The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. We’re looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to make the models finally respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environnements requiring moderated outputs. Acknowledgements We are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster. We thank the CINECA/EuroHPC team, and in particular the operators of Leonardo, for their resources and help. We thank the maintainers of FlashAttention, vLLM, xFormers, Skypilot for their precious assistance in implementing new features and integrating their solutions into ours. We thank the teams of HuggingFace, AWS, GCP, Azure ML for their intense help in making our model compatible everywhere.

So I think it&#x27;s worth giving Mistral big kudos here for actually doing it and going Apache licensed. reply monocasa 21 hours agoparentI&#x27;m really not a fan of how these releases of model binaries are being referred to as open source. How do I make changes to this model? How do I integrate changes to this model that others have made?The data pipeline is the source here. Just because it&#x27;s not locked behind a SaaS veneer doesn&#x27;t make it open source any more than Windows is. reply godelski 20 hours agorootparent> these releases of model binariesAre they binaries? I haven&#x27;t seen a binary in awhile tbh. Usually they&#x27;re releasing both the raw architecture (i.e. code) and the weights of the models (i.e. what numbers go into what parts of the architecture). The latter is in a readable format that you can generally edit by hand if you wanted to. But even if it was a binary as long as you have the architecture you can always load into the model and decide if you want to probe it (extract values) or modify it by tuning (many methods to do this).As far as I&#x27;m concerned, realistically the only issue here is the standard issue around the open source definition. Does it mean the source is open as available or open as \"do what the fuck you want\"? I mean it&#x27;s not like OpenAI is claiming that GPT is open sourced. It&#x27;s just that Meta did and their source is definitely visible. Fwiw, they are the only major company to do so. Google doesn&#x27;t open source: they, like OpenAI, use private datasets and private models. I&#x27;m more upset at __Open__AI and Google than I am about Meta. To me people are barking up the wrong tree here. (It also feels weird that Meta is the \"good guy\" here... relatively at least)Edit: I downloaded their checkpoint. It is the standard \"pth\" file. This is perfectly readable, it is just a pickle file. I like to use graftr to view checkpoints, but other tools exist (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmnt-com&#x2F;graftr) reply monocasa 20 hours agorootparentFirst off tokenizer.model in their release is absolutely a binary by any definition.Secondly, is hand editing the pickle file the way Mistral&#x27;s engineers constructed this pickle file? Why not? The automation that constructed that file (and tokenizer.model) is the source. Binaries in this context can certainly be an ASCII encoded file.Just because other vendors are worse doesn&#x27;t make this open source. reply syntaxing 19 hours agorootparentNot OP but I don’t get it though, you can modify the tokenizer all you want and fine tune the weights all you want. There’s nothing inherently hidden behind a binary reply monocasa 19 hours agorootparentI can edit binaries too.The question is am I provided the build source that constructed these files. Mistral did not hand edit these files to construct them, there&#x27;s source out there that built them.Like, come on, a 14GB of a dump of mainly numbers that were constructed algorithmically are not \"source\". reply ben_w 18 hours agorootparent> Like, come on, a 14GB of a dump of mainly numbers that were constructed algorithmically are not \"source\".So if I take a photo of a pretty sunset, release it under MIT license, you&#x27;d say it&#x27;s \"not open source\" unless I give you the sun and the atmosphere themselves?These models are perfectly valid things in their own right; the can be fine-tuned or used as parts of other things.For most of these LLMs (not sure about this one in particular yet) the energy cost in particular of recreation is more than most individuals earn in a lifetime, and the enormous data volume is such that the only people who seriously need this should be copyright lawyers and they should be asking for it to be delivered by station wagon. reply monocasa 18 hours agorootparentI said \"constructed algorithmically\". Ie. I expect source to be at the level the engineers who built it generally worked at.It&#x27;s very nice that they released their build artifacts. It&#x27;s great that you can take that and make small modifications to it.

Some of it even has explicitly friendly licensing terms.An LLM with a friendly license is something you can freely integrate into other things which need friendly licensing. That&#x27;s valuable all by itself. reply monocasa 18 hours agorootparentJust because a license is &#x27;friendly&#x27; and you don&#x27;t see the point of an open release, doesn&#x27;t make it open source.There&#x27;s been all sorts of closed source libraries that you can freely integrate for whatever reason. They&#x27;re not open source either. reply zamalek 12 hours agorootparentYou could train it from scratch on The Pile dataset[1] with a few hundred thousand bucks worth of GPU quota.

The graph is also all the code. But if you want it in python... that&#x27;s here[0].Please be clear, we keep asking. What are you asking for? Datasets? Training algo? What?Comparing it to software artifacts isn&#x27;t a good comparison when any program with open source code (visible or free to use) is equivalent to what&#x27;s being given. You have everything you need to use, edit, and fuck around with. You don&#x27;t have the exact scheme, but I&#x27;ll put it this way, if you gave me the hardware I could produce a LLM of high quality from scratch using their architecture.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mistralai&#x2F;mistral-src&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;mistral&#x2F;m... reply dartos 16 hours agorootparentprevThe permissiveness of the license with regards to use isn’t the crux of the argument.The open source family of licenses are about freedom. If I’m not given the tools to recreate a model, then I’m not afforded the freedoms normally associated with these open licenses. Really there’s little difference between Apache and CC-BY here. reply lmm 16 hours agorootparentprev> So if I take a photo of a pretty sunset, release it under MIT license, you&#x27;d say it&#x27;s \"not open source\" unless I give you the sun and the atmosphere themselves?You&#x27;ve gotta give me the stuff you used to make it, the stuff you&#x27;d want to have if you wanted to recreate a slightly different version of the photo (\"in the preferred form for making modifications\", as the GPL says). If you just snapped a photo of whatever you saw with whatever camera was in your pocket, then there&#x27;s nothing else to publish. But if you figured out a timetable of when you should stand where with what kind of lens, then making your photo open-source would mean publishing that timetable.> These models are perfectly valid things in their own right; the can be fine-tuned or used as parts of other things.If the original creator can edit them, and you can&#x27;t, then that&#x27;s not open-source; fine-tuning is a help but someone who can only fine-tune is still a second-class user compared to the original developer. The whole point of open source is to put you on an equal footing with the original developer (in particular, to make sure that you can fix bugs by yourself and are never stuck waiting for them to release an update that you need). reply dragonwriter 15 hours agorootparentprev> So if I take a photo of a pretty sunset, release it under MIT license, you&#x27;d say it&#x27;s \"not open source\" unless I give you the sun and the atmosphere themselves?Phorographs are not source code, are not computer code at all, and do not have a close analog to source code. Calling them “open source” is, at best, a poor and distant metaphor in any case, and so they aren&#x27;t a useful model for discussing what open source means for software.There&#x27;s a very reasonable argument that model weights are an IL or object-code like artifact with training data and training source code together as the source code.That doesn&#x27;t change that the MIT license is an open source license, but when what you release under that license isn’t the whole source aoplicable to the model, but just inference and maybe training code but not the data needed to produce the weights, and final weights, then it is fair to question whether as a whole the model is open source. reply haberman 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think photographs are generally advertised as \"open source\", because there is not generally a source code form of a photograph.The MIT license doesn&#x27;t distinguish between binaries and source, but the GPL does. The GPL defines source code as:> The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.What is the preferred form of an LLM for making modifications to it? reply tbrownaw 10 hours agorootparentprev> So if I take a photo of a pretty sunset, release it under MIT license, you&#x27;d say it&#x27;s \"not open source\" unless I give you the sun and the atmosphere themselves?Open source as a concept doesn&#x27;t really apply to quite a lot of things. Your MIT-licensed photograph is \"not open source\" in the same way that `{} * {}` is \"not a number\" (it technically isn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not quite what NaN is supposed to mean). reply godelski 18 hours agorootparentprev> a 14GB of a dump of mainly numbers that were constructed algorithmically are not \"source\".I&#x27;m sorry, but what do you expect? Literally all code is \"a bunch of numbers\" when you get down to it. Realistically we&#x27;re just talking about if the code&#x2F;data is 1) able to be read through common tools and common formats and 2) can we edit, explore, and investigate it. The answer to both these questions is yes. Any parametric mathematical model is defined by its weights as well as its computational graph. They certainly provide both of these.What are we missing? The only thing that is missing here is the training data. That means of course that you could not reproduce the results were you to also have tens of thousands to millions of dollars to do so. Which if you&#x27;re complaining about that then I agree, but this is very different from what you&#x27;ve said above. They shouldn&#x27;t be providing the dataset, but they should be at least telling us what they used and how they used it. I would agree that it&#x27;s not full \"open source\" when the the datasets are unknown and&#x2F;or unavailable (for all intents and purposes, identical). The \"recipe\" is missing, yes, but this is very different from what you&#x27;re saying. So if there&#x27;s miscommunication then let&#x27;s communicate better instead of getting upset at one another. Because 14G of a bunch of algorithmically constructed numbers and a few text tiles is definitely all you need to use, edit, and&#x2F;or modify the work.Edit: I should also add that they don&#x27;t provide any training details. This model is __difficult__ to reproduce. Not impossible, but definitely would be difficult. (within some epsilon, because models are not trained in deterministic manners, so training something in identical ways twice usually ends up with different results) reply monocasa 18 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m sorry, but what do you expect?

Cause you can&#x27;t practically modify it. Open source of a model would be exact same, you would need to be able to do the same build process.

At least not in normal software.Yes, in normal software, the &#x27;recipe&#x27; used to create the build artifacts is the source.> The recipe is honestly only really interesting to researchers (like me). But for building and production stuff, you have everything you need.A lot of excuses about why it&#x27;s not useful to a lot of people and that you don&#x27;t actually need it to use it in production is exactly the argument made for why not open sourcing is ok. That doesn&#x27;t mean this is a source release, open or otherwise.> I repeat, a free windows ISO doesn&#x27;t have an Apache license attached. This is an inane comparison.Even if the Windows binary iso was released with an Apache license, it wouldn&#x27;t be open source since no actual source was released.

This honestly can even change with a different version of pytorch, but yes, knowing the HPs would help get closer.But to train another 7B model of the __exact__ same architecture?

If you&#x27;ve built a system on top of this model, and you want to fix a bug in it, that&#x27;s not going to be good enough - without having access to the same training dataset, there&#x27;s no way for you to produce \"this model, but with this particular problem fixed\".(And sure, maybe you could try to work around with finetuning, or manually patch the binary weights, but that&#x27;s similar to how people will patch binaries to fix bugs in proprietary software - yes it&#x27;s possible, but the point of open source is to make it easier) reply godelski 9 hours agorootparentIs this code \"open source?\"[0] It is under a MIT license, has the training scripts, all the data is highly available, etc. But to the best of my knowledge no one has reproduced their results.

Most of the NLP research world is using pretrained models these days (I don&#x27;t like this tbh, but that&#x27;s a different discussion all together). Only a handful of companies are actually training models. And I mean companies, I don&#x27;t mean academics.

Without that data that specific heuristic wouldn&#x27;t exist, at least very likely not in that form. Yet that data does not have to be included in any open source release. And obviously you as a recipient of the release can modify the heuristic (or at least, you can modify the version that was codified), but you can not reconstruct it from the original data.I know my example is not exactly what is happening here, but the two sound pretty affine to me and there seem to be a fairly blurry line dividing the two... so I would argue that where \"this must be included in a open source release\" ends and \"this does not need to be included in a open source release\" starts is not always so cut and dry.(A variant of this, that happens fairly frequently, is when you find a commit that says something along the lines of \"this change was made because it made an internal, non-public workload X% faster\"; if the data that measurement is based upon did not exist, or if the workload itself didn&#x27;t exist, that change wouldn&#x27;t have been made, or maybe it would have been made differently... so again you end up with logic due to data that is not in the open source release)If we want to go one step further, we could even ask: what about static assets (e.g. images, photographs, other datasets, etc.) included in a open-source release... maybe I&#x27;m dead wrong here, but I have never heard that such assets must themselves be \"reproducible from source\" (what even is, in this context, the \"source\" of a photograph?).That being said, I sure wish the training data used for all of these models was available to everyone... replycfuendev 16 hours agorootparentprevWe should push for GPL licensing then, which AFAIK requires a source that can be built from. reply monocasa 16 hours agorootparentWe just also shouldn&#x27;t call releases with no source \"open source\".I wouldn&#x27;t really have a complaint with their source being released as Apache 2.

That it is text or binary doesn&#x27;t matter.So are the weights the preferred form for making modifications? Partly yes, because of fine tuning, but also no, because you are limited in what you can do with fine tuning. If Mistral had to make major changes to their model, they would probably start with the dataset and code they have but you don&#x27;t, the one that created the weights file.So I wouldn&#x27;t call it \"open source\", just \"open\". You can do whatever you want with what you have, but you don&#x27;t have the same abilities as Mistral to modify the model because you lack some data.Still, it is a bit of an unusual situation since even with the \"real sources\", i.e. training data and code, most people wouldn&#x27;t have the resources to retrain the model, and a big part of the value in these models is the computing resources that were invested in training them. reply scosman 19 hours agorootparentprevYou could fine tune and release that.

The way those data are read to make things work is the \"model\".

Doesn&#x27;t it need to look at the whole output at some stage? reply brucethemoose2 12 hours agorootparentAll generated output depends on all the previous output. The model \"looks\" at (mostly) everything every time.Generation never actually stops, the model just emits a special stop token when stopping is most likely next token. Hence the grammar implementation can prevent this stop token from being emitted prematurely.There was some discussion of models getting \"stuck\" where there is no syntactically correct token to emit. Some proposals included a \"backspace token\" IIRC, but I dunno what they actually did.

Here&#x27;s an example of how to use it to track horizontal and vertical swipes:```typescriptimport React from &#x27;react&#x27;; import { GestureHandlerEvent, GestureHandlerProps } from &#x27;react-native-gesture-handler&#x27;;const SwipeableContent: React.FC = ({ onStart, onEnd, onMove }) => { const handleHorizontalSwipe = (event: GestureHandlerEvent) => { if (event.type === &#x27;horizontal&#x27;) { onStart(event); } else { onEnd(event); } }; const handleVerticalSwipe = (event: GestureHandlerEvent) => { if (event.type === &#x27;vertical&#x27;) { onStart(event); } else { onEnd(event); } }; return ( Drag me horizontally Drag me vertically ); };``` In this example, we use the `PanGestureHandler` component from `react-native-gesture-handler` to track horizontal and vertical swipes. The `onStart`, `onEnd`, and `onMove` props are passed to the `PanGestureHandler` component to handle the different types of gestures.You can then use this component in your app to track swipes on any view:```typescriptconst App = () => { const [isHorizontalSwiping, setIsHorizontalSwiping] = useState(false); const [isVerticalSwiping, setIsVerticalSwiping] = useState(false); const handleStart = (event: GestureHandlerEvent) => { if (event.type === &#x27;horizontal&#x27;) { setIsHorizontalSwiping(true); } else { setIsVerticalSwiping(true); } }; const handleEnd = (event: GestureHandlerEvent) => { if (event.type === &#x27;horizontal&#x27;) { setIsHorizontalSwiping(false); } else { setIsVerticalSwiping(false); } }; const handleMove = (event: GestureHandlerEvent) => { console.log(&#x27;Gesture moved&#x27;); }; return ( {isHorizontalSwiping ? &#x27;Horizontal swipe is in progress&#x27; : &#x27;&#x27;} {isVerticalSwiping ? &#x27;Vertical swipe is in progress&#x27; : &#x27;&#x27;}); }; ```In this example, we use the `SwipeableContent` component to track horizontal and vertical swipes.

I am in these discords, and I only know because I ran into it on HuggingFace. reply semi-extrinsic 19 hours agorootparentprevJust the language being used here is amazing. reply brucethemoose2 13 hours agorootparentFrom the original effort linked above:> This is Llama 2 13b with some additional attention heads from original-flavor Llama 33b frankensteined on.And the lingo gets weirder, with an experimental merging method, for instsnce, being called \"SLERP\" reply skykooler 11 hours agorootparentIs it something other than the standard meaning of \"slerp\" as spherical linear interpolation? That&#x27;s not exactly new, it&#x27;s been around since the mid-1980s. reply jstarfish 19 hours agoparentprev7B seems to be the limit of what people can comfortably fit in last-gen GPUs, having ~6GB of VRAM. It&#x27;s also the lower acceptable boundary of coherence for generative text.There are some major releases at lesser parameter counts though. Databricks&#x27; Dolly had a 3B model, and Microsoft&#x27;s Orca also had a recent 3B release. They&#x27;re both abysmal at generating text, but I find them quick and useful for reductive tasks (\"summarize this,\" \"extract keywords from,\" etc.).(I like to treat parameter count as a measure of age&#x2F;WIS&#x2F;INT. For this question, do I need the wisdom of a 7-year old, a 13-year old, a 30-year old, etc. 3B is like polling preschoolers at daycare.) reply riskable 21 hours agoparentprevNot an expert but I&#x27;m pretty sure it has to do with how much VRAM you need in your GPU in order to process them efficiently. Last time I was reading about the sizes someone mentioned that 8B was just barely too big for their GPU. reply brucethemoose2 20 hours agorootparentThis is not really true anymore, as the \"consumer GPU\" backends have very flexible quantization. Llama.cpp has like a dozen steps between 2 and 6 bit, and exLlamav2 will literally do an arbitrary decimal bpw.It sort of matters with bigger models trying to squeeze into a server GPU, with the (currently) inflexible vLLM 4-bit quantization.I think its just a standard set by Llama. reply aidenn0 21 hours agorootparentprevSeems like 6B would still be useful if I want to run it on my GPU without exiting firefox. reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentKinda lame that applications can&#x27;t be told \"yo, your gpu buffer has now been moved back to RAM\". reply selcuka 14 hours agorootparentWith Apple Silicon there is no separation between GPU RAM and CPU RAM, so the whole model can be loaded into RAM and processed by GPU (Metal). reply dragonwriter 18 hours agoparentprev> Is there a reason projects seem to be standardizing on specific parameter sizes within larger buckets?AFAICT, it is because science: most of them are research artifacts and intended to support further research, and the fewer of parameter count, model architecture, training set, etc., that change substantially between models, the easier it is to evaluate the effects each element changing. reply godelski 20 hours agoparentprevShort:The short answer is that it is hard to compare models so to make it easier we compare parameters. Part of the answer of why we do it is because it also helps show scaling. (As far as I&#x27;m aware) The parameters __are not__ optimal, and we have no idea what actually that would mean.Longer:The longer answer is that comparing models is really fucking hard and how we tend to do it in the real world is not that great. You have to think of papers and experiments as proxies, but proxies for what? There&#x27;s so many things that you need to compare a model on and it is actually really difficult to convey. Are you just trying to get the best performance? Are you trying to demonstrate a better architecture? Are you increasing speed? Are you increasing generalization (note the difference from performance)? And so on. Then we need to get into the actual metrics. What do the metrics mean? What are their limitations? What do they actually convey? These parts are unfortunately not asked as much but note that all metrics are models too (everything you touch is \"a model\"), and remember that \"all models are wrong.\" It&#x27;s important to remember that there are hundreds or thousands of metrics out there and they all have different biases and limitations, with no single metric being able to properly convey how good a model is at any task you choose. There is no \"best language model\" metric, nor are there even more specific \"best at writing leet code style problems in python\" metrics (though we&#x27;d be better at capturing that than the former question). Metrics are only guides and you must be truly aware of their limitations to properly evaluate (especially when we talk about high dimensions). This is why I rant about math in ML: You don&#x27;t need to know math to make a good model, but you do need to know math to know why a model is wrong.Parameters (along with GMACs, which is dominating the FLOPs camp. Similarly inference speeds have become common place) only started to be included as common practice in the last few years and still not in every subject (tends to be around the transformer projects, both language and vision). As a quick example of why we want them, check out DDP vs iDDPM. You wouldn&#x27;t know that the models are about 60% different in parameter size when comparing (Table 3). In fact, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time noticing the difference unless you read both very carefully as they&#x27;re both one liners (or just load the models. fucking tensorflow 1.15...). Does it seem fair to compare these two models? Obviously it depends, right? Is it fair to compare LLaMA 2 70B to LLaMA 2 7B? It both is and isn&#x27;t. It entirely depends on what your needs are, but these are quite difficult to accurately capture. If my needs are to run on device in a mobile phone 7B probably wins hands down, but this would flip if I&#x27;m running on a server. The thing is that we just need to be clear about our goals, right? The more specific we can get about goals, the more specific we can get around comparing.But there&#x27;s also weird effects that the metrics (remember, these are models too. Ask models of what) we use aren&#x27;t entirely capturing. You may notice that some models have \"better scores\" but don&#x27;t seem to work as well in real world use, right? Those are limitations of the metrics. While a better negative log likelihood&#x2F;entropy score correlates well with being a high performing language model, it does not __mean__ a high performing language model. Entropy is a capture of information (but make sure not to conflate with the vernacular definition). These models are also very specifically difficult to evaluate given that they are trained and tested on different datasets (I absolutely rage here because non-hacking can&#x27;t be verified) as well as the alignment done post process. This all gets incredibly complex and the honest truth here is that I don&#x27;t think there is enough discussion around the topic of what a clusterfuck it is to compare models. Hell, it is hard to even compare more simple models doing more simple tasks like even just classifying MNIST numbers. Much harder than you might think. And don&#x27;t get me started on out of distribution, generalization, and&#x2F;or alignment.I would just say: if you&#x27;re a layman, just watch and judge by how useful the tools are to you as a user -- be excited about the progress but don&#x27;t let people sell you snake oil; if you&#x27;re a researcher, why the fuck are we getting more lazy in evaluating works as the complexity of evaluation is exponentially increasing -- seriously, what the fuck is wrong with us? reply sp332 23 hours agoprevAside from the sliding attention window, I don&#x27;t see them mention any particular reasons for the incredible performance. I would like to see some tests for benchmark contamination in the training set. reply brucethemoose2 23 hours agoparentThis ^I am suspicious of contamination in every finetune I see, and very suspicious in a new foundational model like this.(For those reading and not following, \"contamination\" is training a model&#x2F;finetune on the very test it will be tested on. Normally these known tests are specifically excluded from training datasets so the models can be properly evaluated, but throwing them in is an easy way to \"cheat\" and claim a model is better than it is.In a foundational model with a huge dataset, there&#x27;s also a high probability that well-known evaluation questions snuck into the dataset by accident). reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentTheres also a good chance that simply people discussing the test questions and answers on forums like reddit sneaks into the dataset, even if the exact question is filtered out. reply brucethemoose2 13 hours agorootparentYeah, this is exactly what I was thinking.Its supposed to be searched for and filtered out in the training datasets, but I can even see an active effort to weed them out missing some test Q&#x2F;A pairs. reply Workaccount2 18 hours agorootparentprevWe need an AI that can generate bespoke AI tests... reply brucethemoose2 11 hours agorootparentThe existing models are technically bad candidates for this, as they will inevitably produce tests they can more effectively answer themselves. reply loudmax 22 hours agoparentprevAgreed. It&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re model available under a permissive license. But without more information about the training data and methodology, it isn&#x27;t exactly \"open source\". reply Tommstein 21 hours agorootparent> But without more information about the training data and methodology, it isn&#x27;t exactly \"open source\".Being or not being open source has exactly jack shit to do with that. reply falcor84 20 hours agorootparentI actually would support that statement. An AI model is a software artifact generated as part of a complex \"build\" process. Without having access to the details of the process that generated the artifact, including the training data, it&#x27;s no more open-source than a compiled binary. reply capableweb 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d argue that it goes against the intent of open source very much.The idea behind OSS is that you&#x27;re able to modify it yourself and then use it again from that point. With software, we enable this by making the source code public, and include instructions for how to build&#x2F;run the project. Then I can achieve this.But with these \"OSS\" models, I cannot do this. I don&#x27;t have the training data and I don&#x27;t have the training workflow&#x2F;setup they used for training the model. All they give me is the model itself.Similar to how \"You can&#x27;t see the source but here is a binary\" wouldn&#x27;t be called OSS, it feels slightly unfair to call LLM models being distributed this way OSS. reply computerex 15 hours agorootparentWhilst not wrong, understand that having the weights be released explicitly under Apache is a hell of a lot better than the weights being released under a non open source license and commercially friendly license. At least people can legally use this for their solutions. reply pk-protect-ai 22 hours agoparentprevThey use some improvements on attention mechanisms. It is on the main page ... That is why 7B model requires 24GB VRAM, there might be increased amount of attention heads as well... reply sp332 21 hours agorootparentThey clarified https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37677311 that it should only need 16GB, but the unoptimized runtime currently takes 24. reply rafaelero 23 hours agoparentprevYeah, they should have mentioned details about the dataset. reply eminence32 23 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve never run one of these models locally, but their README has some pretty easy to follow instructions, so I tried it out...> RuntimeError: Found no NVIDIA driver on your system.It&#x27;s true that I don&#x27;t have an NVIDIA GPU in this system. But I have 64GB of memory and 32 cpu cores. Are these useless for running these types of large language models?

There is an open alternative to CUDA called OpenCL. reply londons_explore 21 hours agorootparentNvidia has wrapped their cuda language in patents and licensing so tightly that there is no way AMD could release anything cuda-compatible. reply kkielhofner 21 hours agorootparentYes but AMD could release a ROCm that actually works and then put actually meaningful resources into some of the countless untold projects out there that have been successfully building on CUDA for 15 years.There was a recent announcement that after six years AMD finally sees the $$$ and will be starting to (finally) put some real effort into ROCm[0]. That announcement was two days ago and they claim they started on this last year. My occasional experience with ROCm doesn&#x27;t show much progress or promise.I&#x27;m all for viable Nvidia competition in the space but AMD has really, really, really dropped the ball on GPGPU with their hardware up to this point.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetimes.com&#x2F;rocm-is-amds-no-1-priority-exec-says... reply tormeh 17 hours agorootparentprevAs sad as it is, this is true. AMD has never spent lots of money on software, while Nvidia always has, which was fine for traditional graphics, but with ML this really doesn&#x27;t cut it. AMD could have ported Pytorch to OpenCL or Vulkan or WebGPU, but they just... can&#x27;t be bothered??? reply avereveard 19 hours agoparentprevit&#x27;s not entirely their fault, they rely on xformers, and that library is gpu only.other models will happily run on cpu only mode, depending on your environment there are super easy ways to get started, and 32 core should be ok for a llama2 13b and bearable with some patient for running 33b models. for reference I&#x27;m willingly running 13b llama2 on cpu only mode so I can leave the gpu to diffusers, and it&#x27;s just enough to be generating at a comfortable reading speed. reply kardianos 23 hours agoparentprevUse llama.cpp to run models locally. reply turnsout 22 hours agorootparentCan llama.cpp run this yet?

Responds half in Korean and does unnecessary numbering of paragraphs.Just one big sigh towards those supposed efforts on prompt template standardization.

Took about 10 minutes to output some cooking recipe.I think people way overestimate the need for expensive GPUs to run these models at home.I haven&#x27;t tried fine tuning, but I suspect instead of 30 hours on high end GPUs you can probably get away with fine tuning in what, about a week? two weeks? just on a comparable CPU. Has anybody actually run that experiment?Basically any kid with an old rig can roll their own customized model given a bit of time. So much for alignment. reply loudmax 22 hours agorootparentprevIt would be very surprising.Mistral AI&#x27;s github page has more information on their sliding window attention method to achieve this performance: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mistralai&#x2F;mistral-srcIf Mistral 7b lives up to the claims, I expect these techniques will make their way into llama.cpp. But I would be surprised if the required updates were quick or easy. reply jsight 13 hours agoparentprevollama runs it pretty well on CPUs like that. reply mchiang 21 hours agoprevThis model will run on Ollama, llama.cpp, and other tools:ollama run mistralor for llama.cpp, thebloke has uploaded the GGUF models here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;TheBloke&#x2F;Mistral-7B-v0.1-GGUF&#x2F;tree&#x2F;ma... and you can run itreally looking forward to the chat fine-tuned models that doesn&#x27;t seem to be available yet. reply brucethemoose2 20 hours agoparentOh, that means its a llama architecture model!Is the tokenizer the same?

Very happy that they&#x27;re building mistral at this pace from Europe – breaking the narrative. reply ComputerGuru 23 hours agoprevThe announcement says a lot (and has plenty of numbers) but I feel like the most important one is missing: how many GB of GPU memory does this need, quantized and unquantized?(Searching tells me Llama2-7b unquantized needs close to 15GB; presumably this is similar?) reply sp332 23 hours agoparentOne parameter is 16 bits == 2 bytes. So a model with 7 billion parameters needs 14GB of RAM for the un-quantized model, plus some overhead for the KV cache and other \"working memory\" stuff but that should be fairly low for a 7B model. I expect it will work on a 16GB GPU just fine.Quantized ones are also easy. 8 bits == 1 byte so that&#x27;s 7GB for the model. 4-bit gets you below 4GB. reply semi-extrinsic 22 hours agorootparentFrom the Mistral docs, it seems they need 24GB which is kind of odd?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.mistral.ai&#x2F;llm&#x2F;mistral-v0.1 reply lerela 22 hours agorootparentWe have clarified the documentation, sorry about the confusion! 16GB should be enough but it requires some vLLM cache tweaking that we still need to work on, so we put 24GB to be safe. Other deployment methods and quantized versions can definitely fit on 16GB! reply brucethemoose2 21 hours agorootparentShouldn&#x27;t it be much less than 16GB with vLLM&#x27;s 4-bit AWQ? Probably consumer GPU-ish depending on the batch size? reply sp332 22 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, and that requirement is repeated on the cloud deployment pages, even the unfinished ones where that is the only requirement listed so far. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.mistral.ai&#x2F;category&#x2F;cloud-deployment I wonder if that sliding context window really blows up the RAM usage or something. reply sebzim4500 22 hours agorootparentUnless I&#x27;ve misunderstood something, the sliding context window should decrease memory usage at inference compared to normal flash attention. reply brucethemoose2 22 hours agorootparentprevIts not so straightforward, as theres some overhead aside from the weights, especially with 7B at ~4 bit.But this is probably capable of squeezing onto a 6GB (or less?) GPU with the right backend. reply brucethemoose2 23 hours agoparentprevLlama 7B will squeeze on a 6GB GPU quantized. Maybe even less with EX2 quantization.Foundational model trainers dont seem to worry about quantization much, they just throw the base model out there and then let the community take care of easing the runtime requirements. reply 311 more comments...

I don’t think the LED feature listed on this product page will often be honored by most people who will use these shades reply rollcat 2 hours agoparent> some sort of personal scramblerWe&#x27;re nearly at the \"Foundation\" levels of surveillance tech, but with no countermeasures in sight to oppose that. Even resisting web browser fingerprinting is difficult. reply TeMPOraL 43 minutes agorootparentThere are no \"hard\" countermeasures possible, not technological ones - you&#x27;re fighting against the laws of physics here, which mandate that everything constantly radiates information about what it&#x27;s doing, in every direction, at the speed of light. Advancement of surveillance is advancement in being able to discern that information. You can try and introduce noise, but you&#x27;re still fighting uphill, against the whole fields of signal processing and information theory.The only \"countermeasures\" we can have are \"soft\" ones - social, political and legal. Convince people to treat privacy as core value, and surveillance as repugnant. Make forms of surveillance illegal. Mandate by law to have surveillance capabilities in devices handicapped by design. But this, at best, only solves the problem for regular people and some of the time, while governments stay stable and sane - the possibility of deeper surveillance is still there, just the choice to perform it seems unattractive at a given moment. reply LinuxBender 46 minutes agorootparentprevA Halloween costume that changes the shape of the body and face should suffice.

I wonder if counter-surveillance tech could take the same route (e.g. ordinary soldiers can no longer afford to not carry a smartphone -> strong incentive to protect them from tracking; maybe I&#x27;m extrapolating too far). reply autoexec 2 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s more likely that the military would provide soldiers with phones using a special version of Android with less tracking than it is that they&#x27;d mandate Google stop snooping on everybody for national security reasons. They take advantage of the data Google collects, the fact that everyone is carrying a mobile wire (mic and camera) filled with radios collecting and broadcasting location info, and that for many people a single device they carry acts as a treasure trove of information on them, who they&#x27;ve been talking to, and what they&#x27;ve been doing. washywashy 2 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not so much having a countermeasure but having countermeasures be built in to the system. Similar to a concept called gevulot in the book Quantum Thief. reply cypherpunks01 26 minutes agoparentprevCheck out Adam Harvey&#x27;s \"CV Dazzle\" and other related design efforts.

If (and this is a big if) you assume Luxottica takes the same cut on both models, then Meta is selling a camera, headphones, etc, conveniently packaged into a very small form-factor for $128. If I were in the market for a new pair of sunglasses, it isn&#x27;t hard to seem me splurging another $128 for something that could potentially replace my airpods for taking calls while I&#x27;m away from home.Personally, not a fan of sticking a camera everywhere I look though. I get why companies want to push that feature (more data!) but I just don&#x27;t see a reason why consumers need a camera pointing at everything they&#x27;re doing.Kinda cool nonetheless. reply wyclif 12 hours agoparentThe base, regular Wayfarers were cannibalized and cheapened out by Luxottica a long time ago. I&#x27;m fortunate enough to have a vintage pair from the mid-1980&#x27;s that still look brand new. They have higher quality zyl frames, polarized glass Bausch & Lomb lenses, and, crucially, five barrel bolted hinges. They&#x27;re built like a tank.The new ones are so cheap I won&#x27;t even wear them. Cheap plastic, plastic lenses, spring hinges that break quickly, and obnoxious branding on both the temples and the lenses. Terrible. reply throwaway837367 10 hours agorootparentI work in the optical industry. I do R&D&#x2F;quality control for a lens manufacturer and agree Luxottica is an awful company, but your comment is way off base. It&#x27;s actually quite wrong.Your \"zyl\" acetate frames aren&#x27;t higher quality. Modern acetate is stronger, lighter, less brittle, less subject to warping from temperature change, and more resistant to UV damage which impacts brittleness and color. 40 years of material science progress. No one in the industry would say older acetate is better. It&#x27;s worse in every way especially because yours are old. They&#x27;re breaking down.People don&#x27;t wear glass lenses anymore for a reason. They are heavy and the only advantage over plastic is less chromatic aberration which is a non issue unless you are comparing to an extreme prescription using high-index plastic. They are also fairly dangerous compared to plastic due to the way they shatter. They fog up more easily. Again, 40 years of material science.Additionally, there are no low optical-quality plastic lens blanks. This is a solved problem. The only defects you&#x27;ll get in lens blanks are bubbles and these won&#x27;t make it through production. What happens after a manufacturer grinds the lens out is a different story but I can also tell you that their lens surfacing is not low quality by any means.Your hinges aren&#x27;t any better and get loose over time. You can&#x27;t actually use these for 40 years, they will wear out too and are harder to replace. Spring loaded hinges are lighter and reduce strain on both the frames and the wearer. I know what they use, they aren&#x27;t cheap, and are high quality.I do agree with your point on the branding.The optimization for optics is all about weight. Your old frames and lenses aren&#x27;t better because they&#x27;re heavier, they&#x27;re worse. As well as being more brittle and shatterable. It&#x27;s like pining for the old heavy golf clubs made of wood and iron or all steel cars with V8 engines. Yeah, they&#x27;re heavier! But they&#x27;re worse in every way.I will also say that you should buy frames because you like the frames. If you want great lenses, you just get them made. You shouldn&#x27;t expect high-quality prescription lenses from a frame manufacturer, that&#x27;s what your optometrist is for. I buy cheap frames all the time and pop in whatever I want.You may have a bit of a point if you are talking moderate to high prescription ordered from Ray-Ban, but if you are talking about their non-prescriptive sunglasses, you&#x27;re just yelling about all the wrong things.Edit: typo and swapped in \"surfacing\" rather than \"production\" for clarity. reply oooyay 3 hours agorootparent++ I wear prescription Ray-Ban Wayfarers and they&#x27;re highly durable and the lenses are pretty good quality. I use them out gardening and when working in the yard. In general I only wear Ray Bans because they&#x27;re a pretty consistent quality, durable, very lightweight, and never pinch my nose. reply froh 6 hours agorootparentprevthank you for this very down to the facts excursion on 40y of progress in non-prescription glasses :-) this is what I come for on HN reply pulpfictional 35 minutes agorootparentprevWhere do I go to for quality sunglasses? reply wyclif 9 hours agorootparentprevFirst of all, nobody (certainly not me) is \"yelling.\" I find the way you wrote this response a bit telling, and that sort of thing actually detracts from your ability to persuade.I&#x27;d freely grant your point about the zyl. But the rest of your response is somewhat motte-and-bailey fallacy to me. For instance, I never maintained that there are \"low quality plastic lens blanks.\" What I was getting at is that for a lot of consumers, the polarized Bausch & Lomb glass lenses are superior in quality and a better experience than the cheap plastic lenses. I also never, at any point, maintained that I&#x27;d \"expect high-quality prescription lenses from a frame manufacturer.\" My comment was framed (pun intended) in terms of off-the-rack, non-Rx sunglasses which was absolutely clear from what I said above.And your claim about the hinges is simply laughable. I&#x27;d dare you to stress-test (in the R&D sense) the old five-barrel bolted hinges against these cheap spring hinges. That&#x27;s a Pepsi challenge I&#x27;d be willing to take any day. Incidentally, as I mentioned above, I have a pair of 1984 Ray-Ban Wayfarer IIs that are a few months away from being exactly 40 years old, and as I said they look and function like new even though they&#x27;ve been worn constantly for decades. Trying to maintain that the spring hinges Luxottica uses on today&#x27;s Ray-Ban branded sunglasses are \"high quality\" completely destroys the force of your argument. reply sirsinsalot 4 hours agorootparentAssuming both commenters are honest, I&#x27;m going to listen to the person who works in QA in the industry.The parent just sounds like someone who loves a specific item and is a bit miffed they changed it.Lots of \"cheap plastic lenses\" and \"cheap spring hinges\" type complaints without much backup.Is carbon fiber cheap and rubbish because it isn&#x27;t steel? Why does the parent think plastic means inferior?\"Mine are 40 years old and fine!!\" Is a bit useless, and a sample of one.I own a wide range of old and new sunglasses, and in my eyes, the new ones are mostly superior if you buy right. Granted Luxottica are a bad actor in many ways.\"... destroys the force of your argument ...\" really? Does it? Does it tho? No.I think the GP was bang on. reply hattmall 1 hour agorootparentThis is just industry entrenchment. Owning a pair of old vs new raybans just doesn&#x27;t compare, it&#x27;s not just the weight. The springs and material are simply stronger, they don&#x27;t break or get scuffed as easily. The new lenses may have some better technical properties in the lab or extreme settings but the biggest difference is just keeping them smudge free. Old lenses just stay clean and are so much easier to simply wipe down. The new ones are nearly impossible to clean without chemicals and seem to get dirty almost immediately.The bit about cars is telling too. Yes new cars are better in everyway on paper and in extreme cases. But from an actual consumer usage standpoint it&#x27;s not the always better... $3500 repair because I bumped a guardrail on the highway one night vs some touchup paint in an older car. High speed collision, sure new car is preferred.No one at a marina is going to try and sell you on a 1980s Yamaha 2-Stroke vs the new EFI 4 Strokes, but anyone that owns both would tell you they just wish they made a few improvements to the old style instead of going completely modern. Of course the new motor makes 30 more HP and uses less fuel but it needs vastly more maintenance and you need an entire parts store to have a reasonable chance of avoiding being stranded.The improvements are great, but for most things, for most people, they just want them to work well for their intended typical usage.It&#x27;s wonderful the new F225s can operate in 9ft swells at 0F but I would really just like it to have a greater than 50% chance of starting up in calm 75 degree weather which is like 90% of the time I&#x27;m boating.You know the dealers recommendations though, and I&#x27;m not joking, is just buy two (or more) motors! reply hellomyguys 36 minutes agorootparentYou can touch up an old car because they were not made to crumple when hit, which makes them pretty unsafe. reply rconti 8 hours agorootparentprevI find both comments pretty insightful and have a hard time disagreeing with either. It&#x27;s nice that the poster you&#x27;re replying to has deep knowledge about these glasses, but it doesn&#x27;t actually change the way you feel about a sturdier-feeling product. And, sure, maybe you treat them really carefully, but the fact that they&#x27;re 40 years old at least proves SOMETHING about them.Sometimes things that \"feel\" high-quality are actually less robust, but longevity is not always more important than aesthetics. reply Anon_Admirer 7 hours agorootparentThere maybe survivorship bias in this persons feelings and beliefs. reply ToucanLoucan 2 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s nice that the poster you&#x27;re replying to has deep knowledge about these glasses, but it doesn&#x27;t actually change the way you feel about a sturdier-feeling product.This is the entire basis of Beats putting chunks of shitty iron in their headphones. It does absolutely nothing for the audio quality, but it makes them feel heavier and therefore people will swear up and down they are of better quality.Part of being an intelligent person I feel is recognizing your own limitations, biases and failings. I am a very smart person, and I feel most people who know me would agree. But I am smart about particular things. I know a lot about my field of programming and I&#x27;m well educated in the software I make, and I know a lot about web development in a bit of an old school way (was educated formally awhile back, and while I can still sling PHP and use SQL with the best, I don&#x27;t know nearly as much about newer frameworks and ways of doing things.) And while I&#x27;m proud of all that, it doesn&#x27;t mean I know shitfuck about anything else.I think a good part of what makes people intelligent is knowing what they know, knowing what they don&#x27;t know, and being open to finding out if they need or want to from people who do know. reply ad404b8a372f2b9 1 hour agorootparentListening to some of these arguments you&#x27;d believe we need to get an expert&#x27;s opinion and a literature review to gauge the quality of the things we use in our daily lives.I don&#x27;t need an expert showing me a frequency curve to gauge the quality of earphones, I don&#x27;t need an expert on manufacturing to tell me whether my current pair of glasses are more or less solid than the previous pair.Part of being an intelligent person is also accepting that other people are just as intelligent as you, and not complete fools.

I like listening to podcasts or music, but want to be able to hear any rattlesnakes or interesting birds, so the speakers seem like a plus. And being able to snap a photo without pulling my phone out would also be great. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use them in a lot of situations, but hiking seems like a good one.

You get highly available image and voice input, and good voice output.Imagine if you could take a picture of anything, add a little note, have it filed away. Not necessarily an awesome Instagram picture, but just a picture of some mail you got, a tool you are putting away, any thing you want to record and save. Heck, why not a picture of your computer screen? Pair that with quickly available audio transcriptions and you can also dictate anything, thoughts, small notes, information associated with the images.That all could be great... if the library of things you made was useful. It&#x27;s pretty clear how it could be useful now; do some OCR and other detection on images, use a vector store for both that and transcripts, and hook it all up to an LLM assistant. It&#x27;s a bit complicated, and a bit expensive to run, but at least for a prototype you could make something pretty incredible.Meta might make something like that... but they aren&#x27;t doing that yet, and they might never do that. If the platform was open people could explore these things right now.

Holding it is awkward, you have to do a bunch of swipey things to make the camera work, the 3D Touch (or whatever it&#x27;s called now) is somewhat random with gloves, and I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of times it&#x27;s got itself stuck in portrait or panorama mode. Those of you with daughters will understand this ultimate critique - it was worth it to me to bribe my grumpy pre-teen to operate the camera rather than fighting it myself.All of this is to say, I could _really_ use a pair of camera glasses. That little bit of friction taken out of the process would make a massive difference to me.

This seems like a positive signal. Voice doesn&#x27;t get used this way, but the voice interactions are cumbersome on the phone mostly because the platform is not open enough, not because of form factor issues.In regards to voice: there&#x27;s no way to have access to the easy start mechanisms of wake words or quick button access and also control what happens before intent resolution and endpointing (i.e., deciding when the voice interaction is done). You can have your own app with its own \"record\" button: hard to open but you have control of what happens. Or you use the assistant infrastructure and have to compete with every other Apple&#x2F;Google product goal and parsing approach, and at best you have a chance to do further recording only after the initial intent has fully resolved, the mic has closed, and you can reopen it.So yes a phone can do all that, and it ALSO would be awesome, but just like with these glasses you can&#x27;t ACTUALLY implement this. reply jperras 16 hours agorootparentThank you for the thoughtful reply.

They have equal rights - and equal opportunity, therefore, to express - or not express - these rights.It is entirely up to the individual to make the decision to exercise those rights and to not deny them to others for any reason, as it is a fundamental, universal human right to record others in public. reply 34679 1 hour agorootparentThe founding fathers didn&#x27;t record any video, publicly or privately. They were still able to \"exercise political freedom\".There&#x27;s no such thing as a \"fundamental, universal right\" that requires the possession and use of a product. reply barrysteve 2 hours agorootparentprevPolitical freedom is exercized at the ballot box, not in photos of my wife. reply gumballindie 5 hours agorootparentprevSorry - I am confused. Are you saying that we should accept creeps lurking around taking photos of people? reply boffinAudio 3 hours agorootparentYou should accept the fact that, while out and about in public, you have no expectation of privacy.In your own home - sure.Such is the price of freedom. reply gumballindie 3 hours agorootparent> Such is the price of freedom.I am confused again.

Stores are allowed to refuse their business, but it&#x27;s not illegal to record others in public.

I took some videos with my wife and captured some cute interactions and conversations that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to record with my phone.Most of the photos and videos don&#x27;t turn out great because of the camera&#x2F;mic quality and because you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s in frame but I got some fun videos from them. reply r0fl 11 hours agorootparentprevUseful when travelling so you don’t have a phone in your hand at all times.Few things are more enjoyable for me than looking at photo albums from trips I took years ago with loved ones. reply goodoldneon 12 hours agorootparentprevWould be great while driving.

I more or less only wore them while running, so my best guess is moisture from my sweating got into them.

Great to see you here for another issue of Headlines. I thoroughly enjoyed researching and writing this one. Let’s get right to it. Subscribe LIVE NEAR YOUR FRIENDS Deep and meaningful friendships are integral to a happy and healthy life. Why not live closer to your pals? THE FRIENDSHIP RECESSION As we’ve written about before, friendship and community are essential to our emotional well-being. The longest-ever longitudinal study on human life found that deep relationships hold, by far, the strongest correlation with our health and happiness. Unfortunately, the last decade has seen a steep drop in adult friendships. Modern life encourages us, writes editor and journalist Catherine Woodiwiss, to atomize ourselves away from each other: “We seem to be doing life backward: We live alone and expend effort to gather together, as if that’s the healthy baseline; instead of starting with togetherness as the foundation, and striking out for aloneness when we need it.” Indeed, the rise of hyperindividualism has fragmented our connections, scattering our relationships across the country. Even today’s modern self-care trends turn us inward, convincing us to “hyperfocus on ourselves at the expense of connecting with others.” And the numbers don’t lie: Americans are spending more and more time alone and less and less time with their friends. Meanwhile, the number of close friendships Americans have has plunged over the last two decades; only 13% of Americans report having 10 or more close friends, down from 33% in the 1990s. PEAS IN A POD In a 1935 letter to his lifelong friend Arthur Greeves, author C.S. Lewis wrote: “Friendship [to me] is the chief happiness of life. If I had to give a piece of advice to a young man about a place to live, I think I should say, 'sacrifice almost everything to live where you can be near your friends.’” Yet our friendships today have taken a backseat to marriage, career, and more. While technology has made it easier than ever to maintain bonds across geographic distances, ease can’t replace depth. Having a friend whom you see on most days, compared to not having such a friend, has the same impact on well-being as making an extra $100K a year. A 20-year multi-generational study showed that living within a mile of a friend who is happy increases the likelihood that you’ll be happy by 25%. Given the undeniable ties between meaningful relationships and well-being, why aren’t we placing friendship at the center of our lives? That’s a question the live-near-your-friends movement is trying to answer. Live near your friends. At the frontier of this movement is Phil Levin, founder of coliving community Radish in Oakland, California and co-founder of the car-free neighborhood project Culdesac. This August, Levin launched Live Near Friends, a site that helps people live within a five-minute walk of a close friend or family member. Live Near Friends, Levin says, was inspired by his wife Kristen, who would proactively send out listings to friends trying to get them to move nearby. Over three years, she succeeded in getting eight people to rent and buy homes within a short walk of where they live. Now, they help take care of each other’s kids, do regular dinners, and hang out on a whim. Others in this space include grassroots projects like NYC’s Fractal, a collective of ten living rooms within a five-minute walk from Morgan Ave’s L train station. There’s also SF’s Neighborhood, led by Jason Benn, a multigenerational campus of 200+ people living within a square mile in central San Francisco. What if I don’t have friends? A sobering statistic you may have noticed above: 12% of Americans say they have zero close friends. Hoping to help, apps like Saturday and Geneva want to ease the discovery process while dating app Bumble launched Bumble for Friends. And, as we’ve covered before, the social prescribing model uses local “link workers” to help nudge people toward nonclinical care via movement, art, and more. Here, orgs like Unite Us, Wider Circle, and findhelp look to power community health and social care systems. Even the federal government is stepping in. This July, Senator Chris Murphy introduced legislation to create a national policy to promote social connection. But, Levin notes, many interventions tend to put too much onus on the individual and not enough on our built environment, adding that: “People are often told to ‘go meet their neighbors.’ But for me, the question is more about: ‘How can we design places so it’s impossible not to have a relationship with your neighbors?’” A NOTE FROM MEL This topic is one close to my heart. I’ve moved around a lot these past few years, and my friends are scattered cross-country, from Los Angeles to New York, Austin to San Francisco. The pandemic further cemented the slow dissolution of many relationships I wish to rekindle but are complicated by the sheer fact of geography. This year in particular, after moving from LA to SF, I saw many dear friends much less frequently; it had an undeniable impact on my emotional well-being and resilience. All this is to say: These past few months have underlined the importance of deep and meaningful relationships to me. Time and time again, when life gets rough, it is my friends who consistently show me the love and compassion I am unable to give myself, gently lifting me back up into the light. Punchline: How do we help people build and nurture meaningful relationships? It’s perhaps the most important question we should be addressing in the mental health space. Tackling the loneliness epidemic will be no easy challenge—and not everyone can move close to their friends—but it’s a great goal to strive for. The good thing is, the first step can be very simple.

NEWS & TRENDS 1) Coming of age New studies from The Lancet Psychiatry and Blue Shield of CA reveal mental disorders are on the rise, and Gen Z is suffering the most. A whopping nine out of 10 Gen Z youth say they’re experiencing mental health challenges on a regular basis, citing gun violence, racial/social injustice, and climate change. Meanwhile, with 50% of the world’s population projected to develop at least one mental disorder in their lifetime, the mental health crisis has reached beyond the ability of a single sector to solve. Solutions will require concerted efforts across government, healthcare, Big Tech, and more — paying special care to prevention among young people. → Read more 2) Bird is the word Speaking of the younger generation, there’s a new mental health trend sweeping Gen Z: Bird-watching. Posts tagged with #birdwatching and #birding on TikTok have over 1.4B and 240M views, respectively, while apps like Birda, Merlin Bird ID, and BirdNET have reported up to 30% increases in monthly signup rates. With few barriers to entry (save a pair of binoculars), the trend is taking flight — many are calling it the new meditation. Not just a hobby, there’s strong evidence behind the mental health benefits of birding. Studies show that birdsong can help alleviate anxiety and paranoia, while a mere 10% increase in bird species in one’s vicinity increased participants’ life satisfaction the same as a 10% increase in income. Small wonder that spending time outdoors and connecting to nature can be such a boon for our health — this is one TikTok trend we can get behind. → Watch more DEALS & DEBUTS 🍄 COMPASS Pathways, a psychedelic biotech company, has entered a securities purchase agreement of $125M, including a potential additional $160M, with a group of healthcare specialist investors.

I love the idea of friends buying houses nearby, and know people who have done that around here in the past —but this is not as much of an option lately in the Bay Area, where a small bungalow in our North Oakland neighborhood sold for $1 million. (BTW, Radish is very near us and sounds so cool! Though we're much older than the people living there.) We'll keep trying, but it's challenging to build the kind of community we want.

The idea that in our current arrangement we had already depleted MOST of our time together was a bitter pill to swallow.For years we batted around the idea of living closer to each other. One day we just pulled the trigger and did it. It was enormously inconvenient, took a ton of logistical planning for our respective families, jobs and so on; but we ended up with houses within walking distance of one another and went from seeing each other and our immediate families maybe 10 days a year to 300+. We have accepted going forward it may limit our career options relative to when we lived in top tier American cities but the happiness we gained in the process is more than worth it.I’m still not 100% sure the experiment will work out, but making the adjustment to live closer to family has substantially increased my mental health and emotional well-being. If you have close friendships and have ever talked about this seriously, I’d encourage you to consider what you might be gaining or losing in your current setup.

The person who sells bread, the person I see on walk after walk, the person I&#x27;m meeting for the first or 4th time... I&#x27;m just open-minded and open-hearted, genuinely curious, generous with my time and attention... and it&#x27;s awesome. With just a few interactions, I feel like I am with my people, that I am valued, that I am around people I appreciate.Occasionally I&#x27;m met with suspicion (some people don&#x27;t believe that I am seriously that curious&#x2F;excited about XYZ that we are doing together), but overall most people seem to appreciate the ready camaraderie. Occasionally I get burned by forming too deep of a connection too quickly with someone who turns out to be untrustworthy, but time has proven that that is a worthwhile risk to take on.I think of community as a pyramid – there are infrequent acquaintances at the base, and best friends and family at the top. All of it matters. My strategy is basically to respect the entire pyramid, showing up as fully as possible for everyone.Forming friendships rapidly is not easy – it has taken me many years to learn to soften myself and open the mind, but I do keep getting better at it, for everyone&#x27;s benefit. It greatly helps to share projects (in my case, mostly rock climbing).Note that walking (to the grocery store, when bored, when the sun is setting) is a phenomenal way to feel connected with nearby people. reply esistgut 1 hour agoparentCan I ask where are you from and where are you living&#x2F;traveling? What you describe seems to be just the standard way of living and interacting with people almost everywhere here in Italy. Well, it is more common in smaller communities and in the southern part of Italy. Of course it is a generalization so it isn&#x27;t an absolute truth. My point is that even with this kind of interaction I find it very very hard to find friends even remotely comparable to the friends I have been growing up with. It feels like the word \"friend\" is misused if I use to describe people I have know for 30+ years and people I have met in the last couple years both. reply whywhywouldyou 11 hours agoparentprevWe must have very different definitions of the word \"friend\". I don&#x27;t count someone I run into on a walk a friend, and I don&#x27;t think this would fit the definition for the majority of people.Sounds like you&#x27;re being friendly with people, which is of course great, but I highly doubt any of these \"friends\" of yours would help you move. reply arthurofbabylon 6 hours agorootparentThe pyramid I described flows upward. Every close friend we have began as an acquaintance, and with time and repeated interactions they became progressively bigger influences, stronger supports, deeper connections.Many adults stop forming friendships, because they (or their culture) insert mechanisms that maintain distance between acquaintances. I don&#x27;t do that – my whole strategy is to not do that.What is the threshold at which point someone becomes a friend? There&#x27;s no clear line – it&#x27;s defined by amorphous things like trust, vulnerability, shared enthusiasm. The way we conduct ourselves can make us more or less capable of experiencing trust&#x2F;vulnerability&#x2F;shared-enthusiasm&#x2F;etc. While the person I run into for the third time is not yet a friend, I conduct myself knowing that we can probably get along quite well, if we&#x27;re both present and open.You might underestimate the power of curiosity and an open mind. Remember when you were 5 or 10 years old, how suddenly you connected with your best friends? It happened in a matter of days, or in some cases hours. It&#x27;s not just a phase of life thing (although it is relevant), open-mindedness and curiosity have the same effect in adulthood.(Finally, I guarantee a large portion of the people I interact with each day would help me move, if I were to ask. Many of them are literally catching me while I fall rock climbing, and vice-versa!) reply dukeyukey 1 hour agorootparentprevNot at the start, these things take time.

But connections also open up at different paces. For some people it took a decade (and multiple phases of life) for us to become close friends, others it took just days.Consider the pyramid of relationships – at the base are acquaintances, 90% of the people we see each day – at the top are our closest friends and family, those few people that we deeply trust. We can let the people in our lives move fluidly along the vertical axis, and if we are lucky more than just a handful will make it to the top.I try to not know anyone \"in a trivial sense\" – the whole point is to be present enough to realize how cool people are. reply jhatemyjob 11 hours agorootparentprevThere is a conundrum with the question you are asking.

Would love to hear about your stories and learnings should you ever choose to write about them :) reply madaxe_again 7 hours agoparentprevSame boat, to some extent.My childhood was highly itinerant between frequent international moves and boarding school, and adult life has been much the same, and I rapidly learned as a kid:A) how to form “friendships” fastB) that “friendship” is usually convenient, transitional, temporary, and disposableI have zero friends from school or university, and people I would count as friends who I have known more than a decade I can count on one hand - and that’s just fine, as I accept and understand that friends are people who you are geographically proximal to and are convenient to spend time with.I am rarely geographically proximal to anyone for very long, and as it’s my choice to move on, I slink off to my next destination to never be heard from again, as there’s just no point in trying to maintain a friendship at long distance - the effort&#x2F;reward ratio is all out of whack for both parties. What possível relevance does what I am doing on another continent have to your life? None. Is it likely to engender resentment and hostility if we keep in touch? Absolutely. It’s far preferable to just let the embers fade than to end up with an explosive decomposition down the line when your values and weltanschauung inevitably drift.The few friendships that I have maintained over the years are with fellow travellers - people who, like me, understand that relationships are disposable, and are not worth operating at a distance - rather once every few years coincidence will see us in the same place, and we bring the friendship out of stasis for a weekend. As an added bonus, by not keeping in touch, we have plenty to catch up upon when we re-encounter one another. These people usually emerge from the strangest cracks in the pavement - a borrowed cigarette on an icebreaker, a hot air balloon disaster, as a mirage on the horizon whilst stood queasily in the oozing muck of the dried up Aral sea. Because they begin out of utter disconnection, they can be sustained.Unlike you, it doesn’t foster a sense of connection - rather a sense of deep disconnection, as I realise that to the majority of people, who live sedentary lives and have had the same friends since they were in nappies, this way of thinking is alien - but again, that’s ok, as it’s now of my own volition to live the life I lead.Hence “friendships” in my points - as I don’t really view this type of interaction as friendship, rather just that the world is better when you are friendly to strangers.Friendship, in the fecund, smothering way that many seem to view it, is utterly alien to me, and is in my view nothing more than tribalism, as most people have “friendship groups”, within which they engage in cultural drift and mutual ego-massage, usually resulting in poor outcomes for all.Honestly, I’m not sure it’s even a thing beyond a reified concept that we are taught to engage in from an early age. reply dividefuel 22 hours agoprevThis sounds great, but it&#x27;s difficult to pull off when career and family can pull everyone to different regions. My core group of close friends formed in university. The school pulled us all in from wherever we grew up, and unsurprisingly after graduating there wasn&#x27;t anything to pull us all into the same area for work. Many left to return to their home city to be close to family, others went further in their schooling, and some even moved abroad.Even when you live near your friends, meeting up can be difficult. I feel like many of my friend gatherings need to be scheduled weeks in advance because everyone has various other commitments (family events, obligations for their children, hobbies, gathering with other friend groups, etc). reply hibikir 21 hours agoparentIn the US, it&#x27;s part of the curse of the suburbs: When there are fewer people living near you, going to see anyone involves far more minutes.I think of where I grew up: A very dense city, where streets are narrow, easy to cross, and pre-teens can move around with not just lack of fear, but major convenience. My mother had 4 siblings: All with their families, living in their own apartments. But every apartment was within a 5 minute walk: I could see the other buildings from our building&#x27;s front door! So if someone needed babysitting, or just had to run random errand, children could be dropped off easily: Cousins almost become brothers when you see them every couple of days anyway.This was also great for organizing activities with classmates. Not only we got to see each other on the street at random, as we did different errands, but organizing to meet in some bench was trivial. RPGs in the weekend? No problem, as a 15 minute walk catches most of the high school&#x27;s families.Now, in the US suburbs, socialization is more about online gaming, because the number of classmates a 14 year old can reach conveniently is pretty low: You could fit an apartment building with 16-20 families in the space that my suburb dedicates to 2. Access to 10 times the people sure makes living next to a friend much more likely! And since drivers aren&#x27;t needed to get anything done, a lot of things that are commitments in the suburbs just disappear or are easy to move, as another neighbor can take Timmy to the soccer game, as they also have another kid going to the game anyway, and Timmy can walk himself to the neighbor&#x27;s door with no hassle.Transit time, and the total dependence of children, are a curse that can be avoided, but we have to do a lot of urban rebuilding for that. reply jimmydddd 20 hours agorootparentThis reminds me of a documentary I saw about Italian immigrant familes in the 1930&#x27;s? coming to the US and living in tenements in Newark NJ and NYC.

There was a park sort of in the center of the neighborhood, we&#x27;d ride our bikes there and hang out, sometimes ride to the closest gas station to buy candy bars, etc. Moms would make arrangements to carpool kids to practices, take kids to the pool, or do other things that were farther away.At some point we&#x27;ve decided instead to live behind locked doors in fear of our neighbors.

So far we exchange polite pleasantries but there&#x27;s just nothing beyond that. It should be unsurprising, the prospect of any change in routine is more uncomfortable and daunting when you&#x27;re a busy parent, and friendship invites more overhead. There are friends I made after moving to a city that I barely want to see now, mostly because there wasn&#x27;t enough in common in the first place.Strategy wise if you&#x27;re unattached and have free time, making commutes to events and planned activities is still a more effective way to make friends. reply kredd 20 hours agorootparentYou’re probably right, since both of my siblings with children have said the same. That being said, it’s more about “living close to your existing friends” rather than “how to make friends in your area”. The latter deserves its own discussion too, as I think it’s not that easy. reply SoftTalker 13 hours agorootparentprevFriendships are overhead.

I am very much looking forward to the next breakup. Another friend of mine just never got in touch with me after her new relationship, funnily we got to know each other from the last relationship to a friend of mine where I know she neglected her older friends to favour her new circle.To be honest, I am not interested in being friends with a person when I get sidelined the moment someone goes into the next relationship. I have better things to do than to revolve around someone else life. I have my own friends. It&#x27;s a very frustrating experience because you try to stay in touch and you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. It&#x27;s not your fault.I try to balance my relationship and my own, personal life. Breakups happened and rougher times in a relationship happen and it&#x27;s essential to have your own friends. It is very important to me to not give up my identity and my social life. But it has to be said I also don&#x27;t really accept too much inference into my own life and I don&#x27;t think I could be in a relationship where each one doesn&#x27;t have their own space.

But it&#x27;s just too easy for an introvert to be in a relationship and not have to socialise any more.Over years I&#x27;ve given up on trying to be a social person and I just need to be honest about it: I hate socialising and will only do it when there&#x27;s a clear and direct reason for doing so.

I require a monogamous relationship. I get much more out of my relationship than just sex (like love, for a start) but the sex has to be there. It doesn&#x27;t make sense, but that&#x27;s just the way it is. reply danenania 22 hours agorootparentprevAnother way to approach it rather than trying to socialize or make friends directly is to find one or two weekly activities you enjoy that involve a group or collaboration of some kind. Sports, exercise, and boardgames are common ones but it could be anything.People tend to make friends naturally this way over time, but even if you don’t, at least you are doing something fun and developing a life independent of your partner. reply globular-toast 5 hours agorootparentTried that. I can never be consistent with it; my mind resists it every time. One reason is my natural schedule never seems to align with society. For example, I like cycling, but I&#x27;m never going to make it to a Sunday ride at 9am. Another reason is I don&#x27;t necessarily like the kind of people who are into geeky stuff. I find board game nerds and computer geeks tiresome and annoying. It&#x27;s better to communicate with them over the internet, at home. I don&#x27;t think one should have to force themselves to do something they don&#x27;t want to do several times a week. Nobody else does that.Instead of friends I rely on my mental health, my skills and the financial system for insurance. It would be a big mistake for me to let my health deteriorate, get married or quit my job, for example. reply artyom 20 hours agorootparentprevI can relate with this. I only socialize for sex and&#x2F;or money (e.g. networking). I have zero interest in anything else.From my point of view everyone does the same, but can&#x27;t deal with the isolating nature of it all and need to decorate it with friendships and similar unwritten rules and then act surprised when they don&#x27;t work reply throwaway3618 19 hours agorootparent\"can&#x27;t deal with the isolating nature\" sounds like other people do feel a different need&#x2F;reason to socialise no?

Most people want money because, contrary to the old adage, money buys happiness. People want friends for the same reason: friends are the people who you are happy to spend time with.

Pick an arbitrary A-B in any city, e.g. go test brooklyn or chicago. Unless you happen to pick an A-B that is within a few mins walk of the same single rail line (no transfers), the car is always faster and by a good deal.

You also need to deal with parking for a car if you’re not using a rideshare. reply LordDragonfang 16 hours agorootparentprevSuburban USA towns are impossible to live in without cars because they&#x27;re built with the assumption everyone has one.

The challenge is convincing governments and home buyers that the pros of less car-dependent cities massively outweigh the cons (which are mostly around accepting being closer to your neighbours and having less yard space&#x2F;more stairs, plus governments having to focus on more than a single mode of transport when building roads etc). reply balfirevic 12 hours agoparentprevIt was the same - I just used public transport instead of the car to meet up with my friends.

That plus that occasional phone call, video chat and a WhatsApp group keeps me closer to these old friends now than in the past.But the idea of uprooting my life, finding a new job, finding a new home and then moving near one friend seems excessive and unrealistic.

Moving to the US after YC: SF, NYC... or Miami?

When I’m not in the “startup pitch” mood, I default to, “We’re Stripe Billing, but open source”. Or my co-founder might say, “We’re like an open-source Chargebee.” Frankly, it gets the job done. Of course, if that’s all there was to us, we would have failed by now. What we’ve learned is that open-source tools can’t rely on being an open-source alternative to an already successful business. A developer can’t just imitate a product, tag on an MIT license, and call it a day. As awesome as open source is, in a vacuum, it’s not enough to succeed. To be clear, I’m talking about open-source projects that compete with popular paid solutions. Commercial open source, so to speak. Some community-driven, sponsored products—like React, TypeORM, or VSCode—have different priorities. They are either bankrolled by a larger organization (e.g., Meta for React) or rely on donations to fund development (e.g., TypeORM). They aren’t businesses at heart. But open-source companies, like us, need to be more than just an open-source alternative to succeed. They either need a concrete reason for why they are open source or have to surpass their competitors. Profit, not usage, is a measure of success Excluding non-profit projects that are sponsored by donations or parent organizations, a typical open-source business needs profit to be the ultimate north star. For some, this might be a tough pill to swallow. But a for-profit business exists for profit. Definitionally and practically. Profit is what allows the company to hire employees, grow, and sustain itself—it is quite literally what funds ongoing development. And there’s nothing wrong with that; the fact that businesses can be profitable while building free software is a great thing. It’s not that open-source companies aspire to gouge customers—but they do aspire to remain in business. This is precisely what has enabled MongoDB to grow into one of the largest databases with over 4,600 employees. (Granted, MongoDB eventually switched to a special SSPL license to add specific restrictions on Cloud Providers from distributing a service without contributing to the project, which isn’t OSI approved, but is open-source practically). But why make this point? Well, splitting the hair between profit and usage is important to measuring long-term success. If a project gets great adoption but cannot drive revenue, it will die. Some wishful thinking might argue that the community will take over, but there’s been little evidence to indicate this happens. How open source does not win—by being cheaper Catering to the price-conscious is a losing battle. Imagine a buddy who wants to create an open-source version of Amplitude. She argues that Amplitude is pretty expensive, particularly prohibitive for some early-stage companies, and larger companies could save a fortune by using an open-source version. In theory, sure. While this pitch might resonate with early-stage companies, those same price-conscious early-stage companies will either use an open-source version or a free tier. That is not enough to sustain the business. Building a cheaper alternative is typically a ticket to future bankruptcy. What about larger companies? With some caveats, larger companies aren’t worried about going out of business because their Amplitude is too expensive. They might be price-conscious in terms of negotiating a contract in context of their budget, but most SaaS software is just a line item at the end of the day. What matters more is that the solution is (a) a good solution, (b) around for the long haul, and (c) easy to manage. And, unfortunately, deploying an open-source solution can be tricky to manage. The caveat is if the solution is a massive cost on the overall budget, then a corporation may seek out a more price-friendly solution; there are plenty of companies that needed to kick Oracle when their database costs skyrocketed due to usage. But most open-source solutions aren’t replacing a top-three line item, and therefore price isn’t the north star deciding factor. How open source wins—by solving a transparency problem A great case for an open-source solution is when a transparency problem is present. What is a transparency problem? It’s when a solution being closed source creates distrust between the client and vendor. Let’s return to the previous example—open-source Amplitude. That product actually does exist, and it is winning: PostHog. Growing with Airbus, DHL, and Staples as clients, PostHog combines a few product SaaS solutions together and is open source. It’s actually super open source—even the blog source code and roadmap is available publicly. We’ve modeled a lot of our open-source mantras after them. PostHog is positioned as a better product than its competitors because analytics tools need to process sensitive client data such as IP addresses, names, session recordings, etc. In a world of increasing data regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPA), it can be daunting for third parties to store that data. So PostHog provides an alternative—either (a) self-host an analytics solution yourself or (b) hire PostHog as a third party to do it, but with transparency into how that data is stored and how possibly migrating to self-hosted in the future would work. This split is important. Even if the most privacy-conscious technique is to self-host the open-source solution (which often leads to no revenue for the developer), many companies will still opt for a hosted model. But they do so now with assurances of how the software works—line by line—and the process of migrating to a self-hosted model in the future if necessary. It’s not that open-source companies win by preventing the need for a third party; they win by allowing for the open audit of how it works. Nowadays, there are many early open-source solutions taking advantage of these selling points. Medplum is an open-source electronic health record platform competing with closed-source incumbents; being open-source gives users assurance of exactly what is and isn’t supported by the platform. SuperTokens is an open-source alternative to authentication solutions like Auth0; logins deal with sensitive data including names, emails, and passwords, and by being open source, Supertokens is able to capture more trust. TableFlow is an open-source alternative to CSV import platforms like Flatfile; once again, the imported data is sensitive. One of the biggest ones is Minio, which is an open-source alternative to AWS S3 storage. Given that S3 often stores customer PII (either inadvertently via screenshots or actual structured JSON files), Minio is a great alternative to companies mindful of who has access to user data. Of course, AWS claims that AWS personnel doesn’t have direct access to customer data, but by being closed-source, that statement is just a function of trust. The list goes on and on. We could say the same about our own story; we deal with billing and product usage information, which is pretty high on the list of sensitive content. By being open source, we’re able to better build trust among our users. How open source wins—by solving an extensibility problem One of the big benefits of open source is that it opens the development of niche features to the community. While the core product is typically maintained by a central engineering team, integrations or plugins are often built by community developers and then occasionally merged into the main branch. Conversely, closed-source solutions struggle with this because they rely on their engineering team This is particularly advantageous for open-source companies building systems that require lots of connections with other libraries, frameworks, or applications. For instance, Airbyte, an open-source ELT platform, blew up because of community-driven additions to its connectors. The same could be said about Elastic, an even bigger originally open-source company that hosts a bastion of data integrations. One of the founders I’ve met is Advait Ruia of Supertokens. For them, extensibility was a core part of their value proposition, as their community members are able to build integrations with uncommon authentication providers, benefiting everyone. How open source wins—by being better Both of the above issues contribute to commercial open-source being a better product in the long run. But by tapping the community for feedback and help, open-source projects can also accelerate past closed-source solutions. PostHog—who raised a $15M Series B—started as an alternative to Amplitude and FullStory, but has accelerated into a massive, encompassing solution that even competes with LaunchDarkly and Pendo. This happened over the last few years, and they heavily credit their community as one of the core reasons. Open-source projects—not just commercial open source—have served as a critical driver for the improvement of products for decades. However, some software is going to remain closed source. It’s just the nature of first-mover advantage. But when transparency and extensibility are an issue, an open-source successor becomes a real threat. Footer © 2023 GitHub, Inc.

There&#x27;s never been any \"profit\", but there has been revenue.I regard profit as what&#x27;s left of the revenue after you pay the people who work on the project and any expenses, which is the way most corporations and accountants would view it.The only sort of open source project that needs \"profit\" defined this way is one funded by a capital investment of some kind, where the investor expects a \"return\". While there are some open source projects that fit this description, the vast majority do not.Also, as is typical for things linked from HN, this whole article seems very web-y and SaaS-y. There are other kinds of open source projects, believe it or not. reply dalbasal 21 minutes agoparentProfit is an accounting term, so ambiguous. To be actually clear, it would be useful to qualify it as \"taxable profit\" or \"investor profit,\" for example. In practice, these are two unrelated numbers for most big companies. Each one is defined by who you are communicating to, and what the rules are for this communication.You might also have \"management profit,\" a catch-all term for unstandard & unregulated metrics. For example, A business graduates from \"cash accounting\" for tax and investor purposes... but it&#x27;s still useful for the old management to track the old definition of profit. Maybe because habits. Maybe because it tracks cash flow or is useful some other way.It&#x27;s one of those pomo problems. The SEC, IRS or bank manager will not stand for \"SEC Profit.\" They want \"real\" profit. It&#x27;s like a naive local politician demanding to know what the hospital \"really\" cost the contractor.Anyway.... like the SEC, IRS and such... author is using terms from their own perspective. When they say \"Open Source does not win by being cheaper,\" \"open source\" specifically refers to an open source business modeled after MongoDB or similar. So yes, investors, growth goals and such are implied.He clarifies himself on this point and there&#x27;s no real point taking it into semantic growling. reply bruce511 11 hours agoparentprevThe article is talking about businesses being on Open Source foundations, not the myriad of other possible Open Source projects.In that context profit is what&#x27;s left once revenue is received and expenses paid.Implicit in those expenses are (fixed) salaries, employee contracts, payslips and so on.What a business does with the profit can be varied. Firstly it can be added to cash reserves, which can contine to pay expenses through poor-revenue months. It might be spent on assets, like new hardware. It might allow for another hire. In some cases, although less often than you might think, it pays out dividends to owners.You don&#x27;t mention too many details, so I can only presume your situation. I suspect it&#x27;s a different kind of setup. If you are man-alone, and the project is small, (ie you have no desire or need to add a employee) then basically the revenue is just income to you. Some months you get more, some months you get less. In this context there isn&#x27;t \"profit\" but revenue. This is especially possible for software where other overheads are trivial and the effort of tracking expenses for tax purposes meaningless. You may not even keep a set of books.If you are indeed in this space, then I understand why the article feels unrelateable. It&#x27;s discussing a very different situation.As with all articles of this nature, context is important. reply PaulDavisThe1st 9 hours agorootparentTFA said:> To be clear, I’m talking about open-source projects that compete with popular paid solutions.[ ... ]> Excluding non-profit projects that are sponsored by donations or parent organizations, a typical open-source business needs profit to be the ultimate north star.So, I think you&#x27;ve somewhat misinterpreted the space the author thinks they are referring to.Ardour is a small project in terms of man-power - 2 full time paid developers, other individuals paid for media and other work, various commercial collaborations along the way, certainly dreaming of being able to use more paid development hours. We absolutely compete with at least a dozen popular paid solutions, with at least 3 on Linux alone.The main reasons I think this article feels so unrelatable to me is (a) it&#x27;s strange focus on profit (b) it&#x27;s web&#x2F;SaaS centric nature (c) it&#x27;s B2B centric nature. It just doesn&#x27;t have much to say about the \"space\" of writing native&#x2F;desktop applications for individuals involved in creation workflows, free of VC influence. reply jacquesm 28 minutes agorootparentHi Paul, I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Ardour and would love to send some bread your way, but I&#x27;m absolutely allergic to Paypal, is there a way for EU users to send you funds directly via SEPA or something like that? reply PaulDavisThe1st 19 minutes agorootparentSorry, there&#x27;s no way for us to interface with SEPA at this time. It would not be that hard to setup a way to just receive money via SEPA (probably using Wise&#x27;s multicurrency account system), but integrating it into the rest of our payment system would be gigantic, because of the totally different interaction model inherent in SEPA-based transactions (i.e. a bank would have to notify us of a payment). While I&#x27;d love to do this as a matter of principle, we think it better for our users that we focus more on features and bugs in the software.We explain why we use PayPal over here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ardour.org&#x2F;faq.html#why-paypalPeople complain a lot about PayPal (especially on HN), but I have yet to see a viable alternative especially given (a) my status as a US citizen (which makes it harder to bank elsewhere (b) micropayment fee structure (PayPal is unique in offering something that makes $1 payments somewhat viable (saving around $0.25 per transaction, and there are LOT of them). The other well-known payment processors do not have the footprint nor the features that PayPal offers. reply jacquesm 10 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s understood. I&#x27;ve sent you a mail. replyGuB-42 1 hour agoparentprevIf you don&#x27;t make profit, you are a non-profit organization, or at least, you should be. Companies of all kinds, including open source companies are for making profit.Now you can make money running a nonprofit, by having the organization pay you, but few people do that, even in open source. Usually, you want your company to be worth something. A company often requires personal investment, and if you want to stop, you want to be able to sell the company and get some return on that investment, or at least, not lose everything. But in order to do that, you need profits. On a nonprofit, because obviously, you can&#x27;t make profit, you can&#x27;t get anything back from what you created. reply PaulDavisThe1st 32 minutes agorootparentIn the USA, a 501c3 organization that sees revenues of over about $10k needs a fairly extensive board, officer insurance (to protect board members from claims about misappropriating funds) and other legal stuff. I considered this years ago, but decided that it was not worth the effort.> On a nonprofit, because obviously, you can&#x27;t make profit, you can&#x27;t get anything back from what you created.I do not agree with your assessment. I do not want the \"company\" to be \"worth\" anything. The software is the value, and in keeping with the open source license, the software is a gift to the rest of the world. There merely has to be sufficient revenue associated with it to allow people to work on it at an appropriate level. Profit and \"value growth\" is not part of the goal. reply brabel 8 hours agoparentprevI am kind of amused to see someone here on HN, of all places, who allegedly runs a business use scare quotes around the word profit and make it sound like there&#x27;s something ambiguous about it. reply zogrodea 6 hours agorootparentIs the word \"allegedly\" meant to cast doubt on the story? The user mentioned working on \"Ardour\" in the comments, and it wasn&#x27;t hard to find what he was talking about from a quick Google search that led me to Wikipedia [0].I think the quote marks around \"profit\" are appropriate here because the comment was about defining that specific word.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Davis_(programmer) reply brabel 4 hours agorootparentAllegedly because I don&#x27;t have time or interest to check it, and because if you&#x27;re running a for-profit business and you need someone to clarify for you what profit means, I feel like there&#x27;s something weird going on. reply Applejinx 3 hours agorootparentThere is, but it&#x27;s not where you think it is.That&#x27;s the guy who runs Ardour. It&#x27;s a fundamental DAW on Linux, as familiar as Excel on Windows: it is the foundation of Harrison Mixbus. He&#x27;s also fundamental to the JACK audio subsystem. It&#x27;s possible you&#x27;ve heard of him as one of the two first programmers at Amazon.His objection is mighty valid, here. You cannot say profit is a basic principle of open source. The whole point of open source is communication of ideas in the form of software and the ability to reformulate those ideas freely, leading to an empowering of communities of software users and the ability to DO THINGS.That&#x27;s the point. Making wealth for individuals isn&#x27;t in the equation. reply bombcar 1 hour agorootparentprevProfit has many meanings. The IRS considers my wages to not be profit to my company, but they are profit to me.I could setup a non-profit that explicitly doesn’t aim to profit, but it does so by paying my very comfortably. Profit‽This disconnect is what causes many businesses that are successful (they earn enough for expenses and rainy days) to explode and die when sold, because they don’t earn enough for all that plus interest expenses plus return on capital. reply PaulDavisThe1st 28 minutes agorootparentYour wages are not profit by any definition I&#x27;ve seen.You arrived at an employment contract with your employer. The contract is an exchange of value: your labor for some of their money.If you are being paid more than the price your employer could otherwise obtain your labor for, then I suppose you could call some of that profit. But that is rather unlikely. Your employer is buying your labor, and is almost certainly paying you less than the value (to them) of whatever it is you do for them. reply bombcar 21 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s certainly profitable to me to be employed, I get money. It&#x27;s one way you can \"profit\" from an activity. You can also profit via other things, but it&#x27;s a wider meaning of \"profit\" than the financial one.And people do enrich themselves via that method. reply PaulDavisThe1st 4 minutes agorootparentI am aware of the colloquial english use of the terms \"profit\" and \"profitable\". But in the context of TFA, that&#x27;s not the use we&#x27;re discussing.We would profit by focusing on what the author of TFA actually meant.Kiro 7 hours agoparentprevI presume you pay yourself, so you rely on profit. The profit is nullified in the books but in practice it&#x27;s no different than using the profit for dividends. reply PaulDavisThe1st 25 minutes agorootparentThis runs counter to every definition of profit I&#x27;ve ever read. reply Nevermark 7 hours agoparentprevYou don’t need VC’s to be organized as a corporation and&#x2F;or have a growth&#x2F;profit mindsetIt removes a lot of pressure to not have pure investors expecting constant returns. Easier to do the right thing for the project.But growth is likely to be necessary, and sensible, in any product space competing against ambitious corporations who are going to be strongly growth oriented.Booking profits so you are prepared for downturns, opportunities, or large expenses isn’t just reasonable. The more people & customers involved, the more reason not to burn through all revenue as it comes. reply Applejinx 3 hours agorootparentThe basic problem here is HN posters unable to conceptualize the idea &#x27;right thing for the project&#x27;. They&#x27;re stuck in &#x27;investor mode&#x27; so to them, anyone interacting with the project (or the world) can only be interested in extracting profit from the system, rendering what the project does, meaningless.Not a good way to get work done. At the end of the day you have to have done something. reply reverius42 12 hours agoparentprevAre you in the US? Do you report that revenue as personal income on your taxes? If yes, then I think it’s fair to call it profit (since you’re also presumably deducting expenses). reply PaulDavisThe1st 11 hours agorootparentYes, sole proprietor, all revenue reported as personal income ... hence I consider it income.It would be profit if I was organized as an LLC that agreed to pay me $X&#x2F;year and took in $(X+Y) in revenue. reply Ir0nMan 17 minutes agorootparentThe Net Income you report on your Schedule C is your businesses profit whether you like to think of it that way or not.

Like e.g. my robot vacuum that I couldn&#x27;t operate between 1600 yesterday and noon today, because the Internet was down and the robot insists on being able to talk with servers in China to be able to vacuum the floor. Same with my A&#x2F;C and floor thermostats, except those at least have IR remotes or wall panels for local control.Of course, I am operating all those via an Open Source HomeAssistant app, connecting to an Open Source HomeAssistant instance running on an Open(ish) Hardware Raspberry Pi. But all of that means fuck all, when the malicious vendors make a cloud server a required control intermediary. Despite all that Open Source, my home appliances are still run as a Service. That&#x27;s one of many cases of what I mean by \"being implicitly a SaaS\". reply beremaki 7 hours agoparentprevProfit is one of the least ambiguous term possible.If you pay yourself 100% of your revenue as income you don&#x27;t make any profit which is your choice.Profit is needed to sustain periods when revenue decreases and to act when an investment is needed (for pivoting, adapting to evolutions in the market, scaling or whatever move the business has to make).I don&#x27;t see what is controversial here for a business, profit is like capitalism 101. reply jameshart 3 hours agorootparentIf profit was completely unambiguous, accountants wouldn’t have had to invent the word ‘EBITDA’.The article rather ambiguously says:> Profit is what allows the company to hire employees, grow, and sustain itself—it is quite literally what funds ongoing developmentThere’s a key distinction between reinvesting profits - using accrued money to develop or acquire capital assets that can grow the company - and expenses.Cash used to ‘sustain the business’, ‘grow’ (increase sales) and ‘hire employees’, as well as ‘ongoing development’ in the sense of business development, is largely going in the ‘operating expenses’ bucket. It doesn’t come out of profits, it comes out of revenue and it reduces your profits.But in the case of a software focused organization, engineering staffing costs and ongoing product development can absolutely be reinvestment into developing software assets - but with a lot of caveats.So it’s certainly a little ambiguous for the original article to claim that all those things are ‘what profit is for’. Often they are preprofit expenses. reply msy 14 hours agoprevThe problem with this business model is it creates a tension between the OSS version and the paid versions - you want the OSS version to be good, but not such a good solution that nobody feels the need to pay for your SaaS&#x2F;consulting&#x2F;etc. That tension seems to inevitably lead to obvious features missing or functionality&#x2F;knowledge that&#x27;s needed to operate at any scale coistered away as closed source so the sponsoring entity can make some money.If the product is more infrastructural you also now have an established pattern (Elastic, Hashicorp etc) of switching to look-but-don&#x27;t-touch licences to avoid being obliterated as a one-click service for the major cloud providers.Which isn&#x27;t to say the article is wrong, I just wish they wouldn&#x27;t pretend commerically backed OSS is some kind of kumbaya win-win for everyone instead of being effectively a trust growth hack for startups before the need to generate revenue inevitably leads them to turning the screws one way or another on the beloved community that helped them grow. reply imiric 8 hours agoparent> That tension seems to inevitably lead to obvious features missing or functionality&#x2F;knowledge that&#x27;s needed to operate at any scale coistered away as closed source so the sponsoring entity can make some money.This is not inevitable at all. You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a tension there, but there are companies that manage to do this right, and please both OSS and commercial users.The fact many companies don&#x27;t is not an indication that this business model doesn&#x27;t work, but that it&#x27;s very hard to do correctly. reply thinkmassive 1 hour agorootparentOne of the main reasons to donate a project to a foundation, such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is to protect the community against this type of rugpull.

There security requirements like fips-validation and released STIGs that make organizations depend on your product. Off the top of my head, other than these, I can&#x27;t think of anything RHEL offers that Amazon Linux doesn&#x27;t, but plenty of orgs still choose the RHEL ami for their EC2s. Some orgs may want or be required to self-host. Some orgs may use your cloud but only in a FedRamp-accredited or classified enclave, where many managed services available in the commercial enclave are not available or not yet approved by your sponsoring agency.I don&#x27;t know how much of a moat this constitutes for vendors like Elastic, though. Those markets are inherently smaller than what they hoped to get out of managed Elastic cloud, and more labor-intensive to service. It&#x27;s more of a moat for the big five defense contractors and why Raytheon is still writing all the software for spy satellites rather than Google and Lockheed does all the hardware rather than SpaceX.

It means the vendor is sharing what they tell you is the source code running behind their service. Even if it&#x27;s exactly the code - which it may not be - it&#x27;s unlikely to be the only code running behind the \"official\" service. And you ain&#x27;t gonna build your own copy and deploy on their servers. Open source really means something only when you self-host, otherwise it may just as well be proprietary, as everything depends on trust you have in the vendor (and possibly the contract you have with them). reply syllogism 7 hours agoparentprevMaybe \"trust\" in a purely technical sense, but we live in a society. If a vendor has a part of their contract that would put them under penalty of fraud, customers don&#x27;t usually worry whether they can independently verify it&#x27;s true.For instance, if you write in your agreements that data goes into this bit of open-source code and leaves it and goes nowhere else, and you list out some processes you take to ensure this is true, and the whole thing is an outright lie, that&#x27;s really bad for you in ways that are clear and enforceable. It&#x27;s also hard to hide from your own employees, and people come and go. You&#x27;re unlikely to make that claim unless it&#x27;s true. reply jameshart 3 hours agorootparentYes - people here talk like vendors are inscrutable black boxes, which suggests to me they have never been through a serious vendor selection process (on either side). This is not a problem businesses are unaware of, and solutions and enforcement mechanisms exist.SOC2 may be kind of a tedious drudge to go through, and provide limited actual security, but a third-party auditor’s SOC2 attestation for a vendor goes some way to assuring you that they have some level of access controls and processes to protect your data. It’s not nothing. And the lack of a SOC2 attestation for a vendor is a red flag for sure.Back in my proprietary SaaS days we used to regularly undergo third party security audits, code escrow processes, and numerous standards compliance hoops, to create sufficient assurance to clients to sign a contract. reply stepanhruda 9 hours agoparentprevAll you need is knowledge about this from a former employee and you have an excellent opportunity for a lawsuit reply the_common_man 10 hours agoparentprevNot really.

(More Profit == Keep Building More OSS).I happen to like the Open Core model here, where businesses adopt OSI OSS licenses for the core, and Source Visible licenses for the rest - which gives the balance of visibility, auditability, etc, whilst still enabling the project to be revenue generating, delivering longevity as well. reply xtracto 8 hours agoparentI hate these new \"open core\" freemium companies.The best \"open source \" business is one that gets profit from doing something else and publishes some open source software on the side .

I&#x27;d wager that if Canonical launched today, it&#x27;d be as Open Core, which isn&#x27;t far off what it&#x27;s actual business model is.However, those are great examples of companies whose primary focus is in shipping \"The Thing\", and finding a way to build a business around it. That&#x27;s far better than making \"The Thing\" a side-hustle, which is what the React example was advocating. reply martypitt 8 hours agorootparentprev> Open core are just companies that want to throw around the \"look we are cool, open source\" mantra , but in reality are dealers giving you the first dose free to hook you up in their business.Strong disagree.There are real material benefits to companies making their source code available - lots of them are espoused in this discussion. Things like Auditability, Debuggability, etc.These aren&#x27;t about appearances, it&#x27;s about giving additional benefits to the users.But it HAS to be backed by a sustainable business model. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a hobby. Open Core, and other similar models, are about delivering the benefits of open source, with the security of knowing there&#x27;s a viable business model sitting behind it.Also, as a community - we should be far more open to paying open source companies than we are. Statements like:> but in reality are dealers giving you the first dose free to hook you up in their business.Exactly!It&#x27;s a business.

Any dedicated developer can fork your project and add the Premium feature they like the most, and then there&#x27;s nothing your company can do about it.When people use an open source project, they usually expect everything in the project to be open source and will go to great lengths to not pay you, including sabotaging any of your efforts to try to get paid. reply martypitt 8 hours agorootparentI think this is a great point.I&#x27;d hate to see Open Source become even less commercially viable then it is today. I don&#x27;t know the answer here, but I agree with the risks you&#x27;ve highlighted.I think part of the issue is in mindsets of the community, where they see any Github source project, and immediately think \"I&#x27;m entitled to use this without paying\".

We are not gonna intentionally make our product less reliable on CE.The other reason in my opinion is deeply rooted with the nature of open-source: software cost nothing to replicate and it would be a shame to have users not benefit from the right tools just so the pricing can extract as much $$$ as possible.So ultimately it comes down to the tension between being VC funded (and we are but to a much lesser extent that our prop alternative) and the pricing of open-source. I am deeply convinced that there is a compromise that satisfies everyone by having the different force in presence being kept-in-check. VCs want small seed companies to scale to become global companies; customers and users want to invest in a platform they know they won&#x27;t have to regret later because of rent-seeking or lock-in practices. True OSS helps companies achieve global scale as long as their product is better (which make me agree with the substance of the post, being cheap is not enough) and also ensure that company can never or hardly employ dark patterns otherwise OSS fork of company&#x27;s product will be too competitive against itself.Before being a founder, I was among the most skeptical of OSS with VC backing and I really understand why someone would have a hard stance on it. But I came to realize that good software takes not only lots of hard work, but a focus and a dedicated team that is hard to find without a core team that has strong incentives to make something that people want. So I see the future being dominated by companies that fall somewhere in the following spectrum:1. OSS products that are public utilities and there are enough needs or the project is interesting enough to have a strong core team that doesn&#x27;t require VC backing2. OSS products that are more commercially oriented and have values but wouldn&#x27;t exist without VC backing3. OSS products that were able to bootstrap themselves completely and are COSS but without VCsAnd proprietary software to slowly become extinct as the world of software become more competitive everyday as the potential grow larger and the number of VCs that will fund open-source grow larger (and the ability to bootstrap those businesses also get easier). reply mooreds 13 hours agoparentLoved your podcast here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcast.scalingdevtools.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;ruben-fiszel-fr... reply ubermonkey 1 hour agoprevI thought this was well understood.

I priced it at 2x the cost of the game ITSELF. And people still bought it, because it was professionally designed. That is, I as a professional designer, took time away from my full-time work to do what presumably this developer could not.The primary complaint as clearly noted in the comments of the digital distribution platform I sold on at the time was that the update was too expensive. And people obviously commented on how I price-positioned the software.But one point was obvious. The game itself was too cheap.When people are complaining about your price alone and still buying, it’s means there was nothing else worth complaining about.The birds will always want free food. Don’t cater to the birds.As a flattering addendum, the update was distributed illegally and got around to pirates quite well! I was happy with that because most customers paid.

It&#x27;s free. Not because it&#x27;s better than the non-Open Source alternative, because very often, it is not. And not because they can read the source code, because companies need a working product much more than they need the ability to write their own patch for a bug. And not because of some feel-good notion of sharing with a community. It&#x27;s just cheap and plentiful. Which is great, for the consumer. But it&#x27;s not easy to build a company on a free product.For the most part, Open Source products win by either being A) cheaper, B) Freemium, C) \"Source-Available\", D) being the incumbent, or E) a better product.Sometimes \"a better product\" really does win out, if a product is able to provide features competitors don&#x27;t. But incumbents have had the time and resources to establish lots of features, a solid track record, and lots of support and integrations, so not going with the incumbent tends to be a bad idea. People prefer Source-Available when it&#x27;s completely free, and Freemium if it&#x27;s not completely free. All things being equal, cheaper wins. reply AlotOfReading 13 hours agoparentI guess I&#x27;m lucky that the open source things I deal with are far and away better than the proprietary options.

Most large companies generally don&#x27;t, not unless that product is truly battle-tested. They are usually fine throwing out money to another company as long as they can get support. Support around an open source product is very hard to do unless you structure your company this way reply cpill 9 hours agoparentprevWe ended up paying for people to host stuff for us. the free OS aspect attracts us because we know we can host ourselves down the line when the team grows and also, that the people behind it aren&#x27;t douche bags and want to make the world better in some small way. reply c0balt 13 hours agoparentprev> B) FreemiumA good example of this would be open-core. It may be source available, like Grafana, but Premium features are paywalled (Grafana Enterprise for SAML, more datasources, ...). Other examples might include GitLab which is mostly source available but also has Freemium-ish model. reply mooreds 13 hours agoprev [–] Disclosure: I work for a closed source product company, but write a lot of open source that pairs well with our product.What a silly claim by the author.Of course OSS wins by being cheaper (in terms of $$$ paid). I agree that cost is not the only way it wins, though. Points made by the author on how it can win:* extensibility* transparencyI&#x27;d also add:* lower barrier to entry (for a subset of technical users, at least). If you want to try it, you download it.* optionality: in the spirit of libre open source, you should be able to stand it up yourself. If things go sideways with the company providing you the OSS app, you&#x27;ve lowered your risk.* if the user is a dev (the product is infra) \"many eyes make for shallow bugs\"Those are all compelling arguments.However, weighed against all of that is the profit motive and sustainability of a business. People, even software devs, like to eat :) . And businesses need to make money to employ people and push a product forward.Honestly, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve figured out how to build a pure big open source business outside of the following business models:* consulting&#x2F;support (Redhat); pursuing this has poorer margins* loss leader for another service (like VSCode for the MS ecosystem). this isn&#x27;t really a pure OSS business model* hosting&#x2F;SaaS (but the clouds impinge; I opined a few years ago on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mooreds.com&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;archives&#x2F;3438 )(I&#x27;m leaving out open core or SSPL companies because I don&#x27;t consider them to be &#x27;pure&#x27; OSS companies, myself.)Maybe the answer is that we can&#x27;t have a big open source business. Maybe smaller ones are just fine. I&#x27;d avoid VC though, in that case. Most don&#x27;t like smaller businesses.FYI, you can also have some of the beneficial attributes of OSS:* transparency through clear communication and docs* extensibility through clear, stable APIs and docseven with a closed source company. Software companies have lots to learn from OSS as a development process. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Create a free Team Why Teams? Why does trying to break into the NT 3.1 kernel reboot my 486DX4 machine? Ask Question Asked 2 years, 5 months ago Modified 2 years, 5 months ago Viewed 48k times 185 I installed Windows NT 3.1 on a Compaq ProSignia 3080 system, because of several reasons: I know that this machine was running Windows NT 3.1 when it was in productive use. And I think this machine was one of the machines Microsoft explicitly targeted with Windows NT. For improved performance, I maxed out the RAM at 128MB and swapped the socketed Intel 486DX-33 by an AMD enhanced 486DX4-SV8B (write-back cache and SMM) in a voltage adapter socket. I postponed dealing with BIOS support for 486DX4 processors, and jumpered the processor to a 2x multiplier. Without chipset support for L1 write-back and with a 2x multiplier, the processor is supposed to be software compatible to the Intel 80486DX2-66, which is a supported option for that system. While installing Windows NT 3.1 worked perfectly, I really like to tinker with my retro stuff. The Windows NT 3.1 CD comes with the full set of debugging symbols, I'm curious into investigating why NetDDE throws an error into the event log, and the system crashes with a specific EISA ethernet card (which might be due to faulty hardware), so I decided to dive into kernel debugging. Setting up kernel debugging is straight-forward, once you realize you should use the i386kd executable supplied with Windows NT 3.1 instead of kd/ntkd from the current Windows 10 develepmont kit. As soon as I want to break in (using Ctrl-C in i386kd), the target machine reboots instead of providing a kd> prompt. I already tested the following: Memory in that system is OK The system files are not corrupted There is no hardware watchdog active that reboots the machine when the kernel is interrupted for debugging The USB-to-serial adapter I use (which seems to be a counterfeit PL2301) in the host communicates properly. It's not mis-sending some debugger commands as \"reboot system\" command (the KD protocol provides one, though!) It's not related to some remote management or alerting options provided by the mainboard. compatibilitydebuggingbugs80486 Share Improve this question Follow edited Apr 25, 2021 at 14:11 user3840170 21k4 4 gold badges 86 86 silver badges 140 140 bronze badges asked Apr 19, 2021 at 19:00 Michael Karcher 7,2963 3 gold badges 24 24 silver badges 46 46 bronze badges Add a comment 1 Answer Sorted by: Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 266 Short explation The Windows NT 3.1 kernel is incompatible with enhanced 486 processors. Specifically, it is incompatible with 486 processors providing the CPUID instructions. Kernel debugging works fine with the 486DX-33 that was originally installed in the machine, and with the older non-enhanced core in a write-through Am486DX4-NV8T without SMM. If your goal is just toying around with NT 3.1 kernel debugging, you might want to use a processor that is compatible with Windows NT 3.1 out-of-the-box. If you are as curious as me, you might want to fix Windows NT. Keep reading in this case. The underlying issue The incompatibility is due to a bug in KiSaveProcessorControlState (and a similar bug in the counterpart KiRestoreProcessorControlState), which is called from three locations inside NTOSKRNL.EXE: When an exception is reflected to the kernel debugger using KdpTrap (If I use Ctrl-C to break into the kernel debugger, a breakpoint exception is raised from the break-in polling functionality in the timer tick interrupt) When KeBugCheckEx is called (i.e. the \"blue screen\") When KiSaveProcessorState is invoked. This appears to never happen, as this function is neither exported nor called from inside NTOSKRNL if the control flow analysis by IDA in NTOSKRNL.EXE is exhaustive. This function is supposed to save the processor control registers into an extended CONTEXT structure. Its disassembly looks like this: .text:80106740 ; __stdcall KiSaveProcessorControlState(x) .text:80106740 public _KiSaveProcessorControlState@4 .text:80106740 _KiSaveProcessorControlState@4 proc near .text:80106740 .text:80106740 dest = dword ptr 4 .text:80106740 .text:80106740 mov edx, [esp+dest] .text:80106744 xor ecx, ecx .text:80106746 mov eax, cr0 .text:80106749 mov [edx+0CCh], eax .text:8010674F mov eax, cr2 .text:80106752 mov [edx+0D0h], eax .text:80106758 mov eax, cr3 .text:8010675B mov [edx+0D4h], eax .text:80106761 mov [edx+0D8h], ecx .text:80106767 cmp ds:word_FFDFF138, 5 .text:8010676F jb short @@before_pentium .text:80106771 mov eax, cr4 .text:80106774 mov [edx+0D8h], eax .text:8010677A @@before_pentium: .text:8010677A mov eax, dr0 .text:8010677D mov [edx+0DCh], eax .text:80106783 mov eax, dr1 .text:80106786 mov [edx+0E0h], eax .text:8010678C mov eax, dr2 .text:8010678F mov [edx+0E4h], eax .text:80106795 mov eax, dr3 .text:80106798 mov [edx+0E8h], eax .text:8010679E mov eax, dr6 .text:801067A1 mov [edx+0ECh], eax .text:801067A7 mov eax, dr7 .text:801067AA mov dr7, ecx .text:801067AD mov [edx+0F0h], eax .text:801067B3 sgdt fword ptr [edx+0F6h] .text:801067BA sidt fword ptr [edx+0FEh] .text:801067C1 str word ptr [edx+104h] .text:801067C8 sldt word ptr [edx+106h] .text:801067CF retn 4 .text:801067CF _KiSaveProcessorControlState@4 endp This function is supposed to save all control register (CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4 on pentium and later processors), all debug registers (DR0-DR3, DR6, DR7) and various global protected mode settings (the address of the GDT, the address of the IDT, the selector of the active TSS and the selector of the LDT). To detect the processor type, it uses a value from the KPRCB (Kernel Processor Control Block). The KPRCB is part of the KPCR (Kernel Processor Control Region). The KPRCB for the boot processor (or the only processor on uniprocessor systems) is located at virtual address FFDFF120, which is hard-coded into this method. Geoff Chappell writes this about the relevant part of the KPRCB in NT 3.1: +018 CHAR CpuType; +019 CHAR CpuID; +01A UShort CpuStep; These members of the KPCRB are initialized by KiSetProcessorType, which identifies the relevant processors correctly (but be aware that it mistrusts processors that report a CPUID feature level above 3 and considers them as \"generic non-CPUID capable 586 compatible processors\". The byte at offset 18 is set to 4 for 486 processors, 5 for Pentium processors and 6 for Pentium Pro and Pentium II/III processors. The byte at offset 19 is a boolean flag that indicates whether the processor support CPUID and it behaves \"reasonable\". A very attentive reader might already have noticed the bug: The CMP instruction uses the word at address FFDFF138 (which is 18h bytes into the KPRCB), instead of the byte at that address. This means the byte at offset 19h in the KPRCB is considered part of the model number. If a processor supports CPUID, its model number is considered to be 256 bigger than it actually is. This means Windows NT 3.1 treats a CPUID capable 80-4-86 processor as 80-260-86 processor. And as 260 is way larger than 5 (Pentium), that processor better had CR4. The fix The fix is obvious once the bug is identified. The instruction cmp ds:word_FFDFF138, 5 only appears twice in NTOSKRNL.EXE, specifically in KiSaveProcessorControlState and KiRestoreProcessorControlState, and it needs to be patched to be a byte compare instead of a word compare. Use your favorite hex editor to patch 66 83 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05 to 90 80 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05, two times. This fix applies both the NTOSKRNL.EXE from the original NT 3.1 Advanced Server distribution as well as NT 3.1 SP3.

Apr 20, 2021 at 14:10 34 I see your NOP (90h), and raise you an explicit DS prefix (3Eh). It's all about the style points! :-) Any instruction with a memory operand can have a segment prefix. In this case, the DS prefix is implicit/implied, but it can be explicitly specified without changing the meaning of the instruction. Both ways work to pad the extra leftover byte of space, but the explicit DS prefix does not change the instruction's execution speed, whereas the NOP actually takes 1 cycle of time to execute (plus possible decoding). – Cody Gray - on strike Apr 21, 2021 at 0:34 20 The really interesting question is, how on earth did you get the idea to look at _KiSaveProcessorControlState in the first place, when all you had was a rebooting PC without a usable debugger? – Guntram Blohm Apr 22, 2021 at 11:06 17 @GuntramBlohm NTOSKRNL.EXE + debug symbols + IDA helped me understand how the remote break-in is supposed to work. I knew that something in the remote break-in code path before the first debug packet is sent is going to reboot my machine. So I patched \"JMP SHORT $\" instructions into the relevant code-path. If I placed it before the crash point, the machine hangs. If I placed it after the crash point, the machine reboots. This allowed me to \"bisect\" where the crash is happening. BTW: Good question, but I don't think the debugging story fits the Q/A format well, so I left it out. – Michael Karcher Apr 22, 2021 at 20:23 Show 6 more comments You must log in to answer this question.

I don&#x27;t think he could have used QEMU or some other form of debugging. reply pjgalbraith 7 hours agorootparentHe does mention a bit more in a hidden comment:\"NTOSKRNL.EXE + debug symbols + IDA helped me understand how the remote break-in is supposed to work. I knew that something in the remote break-in code path before the first debug packet is sent is going to reboot my machine. So I patched \"JMP SHORT $\" instructions into the relevant code-path. If I placed it before the crash point, the machine hangs. If I placed it after the crash point, the machine reboots. This allowed me to \"bisect\" where the crash is happening.\"-----Here is a Chat-GPT breakdown of the comment:NTOSKRNL.EXE: This is the kernel of the Windows NT operating system. When people refer to the \"Windows kernel,\" they&#x27;re typically talking about this executable.debug symbols: These are additional pieces of data that describe the internal structures and functions within a binary (like an EXE or DLL). They make it much easier to understand what&#x27;s going on when analyzing or debugging the binary.IDA: IDA (Interactive DisAssembler) is a popular disassembler and debugger used by security researchers and reverse engineers to analyze binaries.how the remote break-in is supposed to work: It sounds like the commenter is trying to understand how a specific feature or vulnerability related to remote debugging (or \"remote break-in\") operates.something in the remote break-in code path before the first debug packet is sent: There&#x27;s a sequence of events or a code path in the kernel related to the remote debugging feature. The problem seems to manifest before the first debug packet is sent over the network.JMP SHORT $: This is an assembly instruction. The JMP instruction is used to jump to another part of the code. SHORT refers to a short jump, meaning the jump target is relatively close. The $ symbol refers to the current address of the instruction, so \"JMP SHORT $\" will cause the program to jump to itself, effectively causing an infinite loop.patched \"JMP SHORT $\" instructions into the relevant code-path: By inserting this instruction at various points in the code, the commenter created intentional hangs in the system. This helped isolate where the crash occurs.bisect: This term comes from the world of debugging and means to divide the code into smaller parts to determine where a problem is. In this context, the commenter is using the hang (from the JMP instruction) as an indicator. If they inserted the JMP instruction and the system hangs, it means the crash hasn&#x27;t occurred yet. If they inserted the JMP instruction and the system reboots, it means the crash already happened. By moving the JMP instruction around, they can get closer to the exact point of the crash.In essence, the commenter used a mix of reverse engineering tools and clever debugging tricks to narrow down where a crash was occurring in the Windows NT 3.1 kernel when using a remote debugging feature. reply H8crilA 6 hours agorootparentNot sure why this is downvoted, the comment is on point. Is it because it is partly gpt-generated content?I wonder if patching memory worked in the debugger, if not this would have to be done by manually editing the kernel file with IDA or something, and rebooting the machine. But in either case this is a good way to find the problem. reply MBCook 24 minutes agorootparentThat’s likely. ChatGPT is not reliable, dumping its explanation of an issue isn’t valuable.

Jennifer ChuMIT News Publication Date : September 27, 2023 PRESS INQUIRIES Caption : A tilted ten-stage prototype is located into a “boat-like” reservoir. Credits : Credit: Jintong Gao and Zhenyuan Xu Caption : Outdoor test of the prototype under natural sunlight Credits : Credit: Jintong Gao and Zhenyuan Xu Previous image Next image Engineers at MIT and in China are aiming to turn seawater into drinking water with a completely passive device that is inspired by the ocean, and powered by the sun. In a paper appearing today in the journal Joule, the team outlines the design for a new solar desalination system that takes in saltwater and heats it with natural sunlight. The configuration of the device allows water to circulate in swirling eddies, in a manner similar to the much larger “thermohaline” circulation of the ocean. This circulation, combined with the sun’s heat, drives water to evaporate, leaving salt behind. The resulting water vapor can then be condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate through and out of the device, rather than accumulating and clogging the system. The new system has a higher water-production rate and a higher salt-rejection rate than all other passive solar desalination concepts currently being tested. The researchers estimate that if the system is scaled up to the size of a small suitcase, it could produce about 4 to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years before requiring replacement parts. At this scale and performance, the system could produce drinking water at a rate and price that is cheaper than tap water. “For the first time, it is possible for water, produced by sunlight, to be even cheaper than tap water,” says Lenan Zhang, a research scientist in MIT’s Device Research Laboratory. The team envisions a scaled-up device could passively produce enough drinking water to meet the daily requirements of a small family. The system could also supply off-grid, coastal communities where seawater is easily accessible. Zhang’s study co-authors include MIT graduate student Yang Zhong and Evelyn Wang, the Ford Professor of Engineering, along with Jintong Gao, Jinfang You, Zhanyu Ye, Ruzhu Wang, and Zhenyuan Xu of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. A powerful convection The team’s new system improves on their previous design — a similar concept of multiple layers, called stages. Each stage contained an evaporator and a condenser that used heat from the sun to passively separate salt from incoming water. That design, which the team tested on the roof of an MIT building, efficiently converted the sun’s energy to evaporate water, which was then condensed into drinkable water. But the salt that was left over quickly accumulated as crystals that clogged the system after a few days. In a real-world setting, a user would have to place stages on a frequent basis, which would significantly increase the system’s overall cost. In a follow-up effort, they devised a solution with a similar layered configuration, this time with an added feature that helped to circulate the incoming water as well as any leftover salt. While this design prevented salt from settling and accumulating on the device, it desalinated water at a relatively low rate. In the latest iteration, the team believes it has landed on a design that achieves both a high water-production rate, and high salt rejection, meaning that the system can quickly and reliably produce drinking water for an extended period. The key to their new design is a combination of their two previous concepts: a multistage system of evaporators and condensers, that is also configured to boost the circulation of water — and salt — within each stage. “We introduce now an even more powerful convection, that is similar to what we typically see in the ocean, at kilometer-long scales,” Xu says. The small circulations generated in the team’s new system is similar to the “thermohaline” convection in the ocean — a phenomenon that drives the movement of water around the world, based on differences in sea temperature (“thermo”) and salinity (“haline”). “When seawater is exposed to air, sunlight drives water to evaporate. Once water leaves the surface, salt remains. And the higher the salt concentration, the denser the liquid, and this heavier water wants to flow downward,” Zhang explains. “By mimicking this kilometer-wide phenomena in small box, we can take advantage of this feature to reject salt.” Tapping out The heart of the team’s new design is a single stage that resembles a thin box, topped with a dark material that efficiently absorbs the heat of the sun. Inside, the box is separated into a top and bottom section. Water can flow through the top half, where the ceiling is lined with an evaporator layer that uses the sun’s heat to warm up and evaporate any water in direct contact. The water vapor is then funneled to the bottom half of the box, where a condensing layer air-cools the vapor into salt-free, drinkable liquid. The researchers set the entire box at a tilt within a larger, empty vessel, then attached a tube from the top half of the box down through the bottom of the vessel, and floated the vessel in saltwater. In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through. The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging. The team built several prototypes, with one, three, and 10 stages, and tested their performance in water of varying salinity, including natural seawater and water that was seven times saltier. From these tests, the researchers calculated that if each stage were scaled up to a square meter, it would produce up to 5 liters of drinking water per hour, and that the system could desalinate water without accumulating salt for several years. Given this extended lifetime, and the fact that the system is entirely passive, requiring no electricity to run, the team estimates that the overall cost of running the system would be cheaper than what it costs to produce tap water in the United States. “We show that this device is capable of achieving a long lifetime,” Zhong says. “That means that, for the first time, it is possible for drinking water produced by sunlight to be cheaper than tap water. This opens up the possibility for solar desalination to address real-world problems.” “This is a very innovative approach that effectively mitigates key challenges in the field of desalination,” says Guihua Yu, who develops sustainable water and energy storage systems at the University of Texas at Austin, and was not involved in the research. “The design is particularly beneficial for regions struggling with high-salinity water. Its modular design makes it highly suitable for household water production, allowing for scalability and adaptability to meet individual needs.” Funding for the research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China.

Dumping it back into the ocean can be disruptive to the local ecosystem.A quick search turned up this Scientific American article about the issue: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;slaking-the-world...\"The excess salt decreases dissolved oxygen in the water, suffocating animals on the seafloor\"\"In addition to harming sea life, extreme salinity also makes desalinating the water more difficult and expensive.\" reply iamthemonster 14 hours agoparentThe salinity is normally only increased by a factor of four (assuming a 25% reject ratio) so just be aware that brine discharge is a very highly localised environmental issue, it doesn&#x27;t spread too far.I wouldn&#x27;t call it an unsolved problem necessarily. We probably disrupt the ecosystem more when we build a parking lot. reply rconti 8 hours agorootparentJust talking out my ass here, but can&#x27;t it be combined with, say, treated wastewater?We&#x27;re taking the salt out of the water in order to \"drink\" it, but the reality is that most of it gets used for irrigation or toilets or whatever, and eventually returned either as groundwater or to the ocean. reply bruce511 8 hours agorootparentIn some cases, yes. I know we had a temp desalination running here for a while, and they just mixed the brine with sewerage outflow.Obviously it depends on the location of the sewerage outflow relative to the location of the plant.Of course this only matters at scale. For the suitcase sized device mentioned in the article the amount of brine generated is negligible. reply kinnth 3 hours agorootparentprevThe salty sea water could even become the water to flush your toilet with as one use for the waste?! I agree with the above, the scale of the proposed system shouldn&#x27;t lead to sealife issues. reply Taek 8 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t the reject ratio typically closer to 75%? At least, my filter at home has a reject ratio of 75%, which means the wastewater is only ~33% more ppm than the starting water. reply iamthemonster 5 hours agorootparentYeah that&#x27;ll be right for a small scale unit, I think it&#x27;s just that large commercial-scale RO plants have better reject ratios. reply local_crmdgeon 12 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not a great example - surface parking lots and their runoff are fucking horrible for the environment reply SamBam 12 hours agorootparentSo, it&#x27;s probably a good example then, since we currently accept the building of parking lots.The point is, people are always writing letters to the editor and what-not when some green tech has some environmental impact, far more than they do over their city making another parking lot or any of a million other things. I assume it&#x27;s because it triggers some notion of hypocrisy. c.f. wind turbines and dead birds.How about we put our energy into fighting cars and parking lots first, before we worry about solar-powered desalination that could potentially save the Western states from the over-extraction of water that&#x27;s turning them into dust bowls? reply missedthecue 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a good example then. Given that a Walmart parking lot is societally acceptable, fresh clean drinking water probably will be too. reply wolverine876 9 hours agorootparentCarbon-based energy is socially acceptable, as are completely unsecured computing devices and mass corporate surveillance, but that isn&#x27;t the standard of a good idea.

It seems to be an entirely pointless exercise in aesthetics to me. I&#x27;ve parked on unpaved spots (in large parks near hiking trails, etc), and never had an issue.We really should have more unpaved outdoor that is simply trimmed semi-regularly if or when the plant growth gets too big.[1] Unless you&#x27;re in a sandy or snowy area, where shoveling the sand or snow is difficult on an unpaved surface. reply oooyay 3 hours agorootparentPure soil wouldn&#x27;t be a good option. Anything that&#x27;s subject to high traffic, whether foot or vehicular, will also be subject to soil compaction which implies water pooling. That&#x27;s a long way of saying those parking lots will turn into mud lots. At a minimum you could grade and gravel them, going the extra mile to crush the gravel so it stays in place longer. I do this with the driveway at my house because it rains a lot where I live. Paving would arguably last a lot longer and probably be more bang for my buck, but not having a place for water to go and having a basement is not a good combination.On my driveway we only tend to get clovers and really resilient weeds. So, either really shallow rooted plants or weeds with absurdly strong roots. You&#x27;re not likely to get native plans to grow unless you section off parts of the area for maintaining living soil. reply mattashii 4 hours agorootparentprevUnpaved parking lots tend to lose their plant growth when frequently used, after which the parking lot turns to mud in wet weather, which then results in stuck cars and dirt getting into stores with the customers that walked through that mud. reply NavinF 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not going to lose any sleep over that.

Personally, I&#x27;d prefer small roads and outdoor parking lots to be au naturel unpaved. Zero construction cost, and I imagine the maintenance cost is just trimming grass. reply thombat 2 hours agorootparentOnly works if the natural soil is remarkably solid or the traffic negligible. Unpaved roads with more than very modest traffic generally need routine grading (repairing corrugations by scraping it over with a levelling blade) and re-graveling reply beaviskhan 2 hours agorootparentAccurate. And, if there is significant rain and&#x2F;or snowmelt, roads can quickly become impassable (see: \"mud season\" in New England, and surely many other places) reply F-W-M 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s the problem with parking lots? reply iamthemonster 14 hours agoparentprevCheck out the pictures of the brine discharge diffuser at this desal plant in Western Australia: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.watercorporation.com.au&#x2F;Our-water&#x2F;Desalination&#x2F;P... reply mattclarkdotnet 5 hours agorootparentThis plant helps Perth (a city of 2m people) get over half of its fresh water from desalination. We used to get most of our fresh water from the local aquifer and from dams, but this was totally unsustainable. The water table has been recovering over the past 10 years, and is on track to recover to pre-invasion levels in the next decade. By which time we should be at over 90% renewables for power too! Quite proud to be a West Australian really. reply jillesvangurp 6 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s actually only a challenge in shallow water that doesn&#x27;t move, which if you think about it isn&#x27;t that surprising. If you pump it out a bit further, you quite literally have a whole ocean to dilute the salt in. Off the coast of California, for example, which is a state that should have no water shortage as it has abundant access to clean solar and wind energy and the entire pacific to desalinate, ocean depths drop quickly even just a few miles out. You would not be able to affect salinity levels of ocean waters there in any measurable way even if you wanted to.So, the solution is pipes and pumps. Those add cost of course but it&#x27;s a completely solvable problem otherwise. Exhausting natural sources of ground water and aquifers also has an impact. Desalination done right might give some of those stressed ecosystems a chance to recover. reply bmitc 6 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s actually only a challenge in shallow water that doesn&#x27;t move, which if you think about it isn&#x27;t that surprising.

The article doesn&#x27;t really specify how big of an issue it really is. reply BurningFrog 12 hours agoparentprevMy controversial take is that the best solution will be to accept that solving the drinking water problem for people is worth worsening the environment for some local sea life. reply comboy 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think humanity is ever really considering environmental impact unless it impacts it somehow. We care about disappearing species which amuse us, which we can see at our scale level, not much below. Some rare lion? Tragedy! Thousands species of fungi living underground which don&#x27;t impact us directly? Irrelevant. Same goes for climate change and others. We only care if it impacts us in any way, even if only our entertainment.So long story short we probably care about sea life. reply SonicScrub 12 hours agorootparentprevThat local sea life also provides humans with food. So even with the human-centric viewpoint, we have a strong incentive to solve this problem. reply missedthecue 10 hours agorootparentA poorly implemented runoff would nuke a square km or five of ocean floor with high salinity waste.

GNU utils use stdout for help texts, and so should you. dredmorbius 15 hours agoThere&#x27;s a case where this might be valid, which is where a command-line invocation is incorrect and a utility provides help as part of an error message. In that case, writing to stderr is justifiable.(Of course, an alternative argument is that commands should fail silently but emit a nonzero return value.)When invoked directly, as with &#x27;-h&#x27; &#x27;--help&#x27;, etc., help output should write to stdout, and not stderr.StackOverflow has tackled this question, 2nd response follows the course I suggest:And in this case, the first response:I&#x27;m looking for any specific guidance from, e.g., GNU but am not finding any. reply jolmg 14 hours agoparent> In that case, writing to stderr is justifiable.More than justifiable, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the correct thing to do in that case. Otherwise, the caller (which can be another script) may end up working with the help message thinking it was the output it expected.The whole rule should be something like \"Print to stdout if it&#x27;s part of what&#x27;s asked by the caller. Print to stderr if it wasn&#x27;t asked but the user should know about it.\" So outputting it to stdout should happen when it&#x27;s asked via --help, and outputting it to stderr should happen when it&#x27;s part of an error. reply kazinator 13 hours agoparentprevThe traditional Unix command \"philosophy\" is that commands succeed quietly, using their termination status to indicate all is well. Failing quietly was never a part of it.Chatter on success reads like a cheesy sci fi script. > copy * dir 34 files copied, captain! > mount plasma_cannon &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdc plasma_cannon mounted, ready to fire, captain!A message like \"incorrect arguments, use --help\" can itself go to stderr. Not --help itself though.Some GNU guidance is in the GNU Coding Standards:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;prep&#x2F;standards&#x2F;standards.html#Command_00...That does say that --help and --version should go to standard output.The document also gives a list of common options; i.e. don&#x27;t invent your own name for an option, if something matches in this list. reply dredmorbius 13 hours agorootparentFair point on succeed quietly.ESR&#x27;s a somewhat less reliable narrator on many topics these days, but his TAOUP remains useful, and indeed suggests \"Rule of Repair: Repair what you can — but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.\" reply kazinator 9 hours agorootparentMeta-rule of Postel&#x27;s Law:Postel&#x27;s Law does not count among \"repair what you can\". Do not try to repair Postel&#x27;s Law as ESR is doing here; it&#x27;s broken beyond repair and can only be replaced.- Rarely repair a bad input; it is optional at your discretion. Just fail.- If you repair a bad input, do it only in order to try to diagnose more of that input; more things could be wrong, or the first failure encountered could even have a root cause in those other things.- Remember to fail if you repaired the bad input, even if there are no more errors after the repair. reply jolmg 12 hours agorootparentprev> Failing quietly was never a part of it.Not part of it, but not against it. It&#x27;s useful to stay quiet when the program is meant for conditions and failure is normal. For example: `test`&#x2F;`[`, `false`, `grep` (when no matches are found), etc. Also when the program is meant as a sort of wrapper to other programs, like `ssh localhost false`, `script -qec false &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null`, `truexargs false`, etc.> A message like \"incorrect arguments, use --help\" can itself go to stderr. Not --help itself though.I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s incorrect to save the user the step of calling --help, when it&#x27;s obvious they need to see that info from an incorrect call. Once decided that including the --help message in an error is right, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s correct to include it in stdout when it&#x27;s not expected.This isn&#x27;t an odd behavior either, including the --help message (or at least just the synopsis) in stderr on incorrect options is the behavior I&#x27;m seeing in utilities like GNU&#x27;s `bash`, `grep`, and OpenBSD&#x27;s `netcat`, for example. reply kazinator 9 hours agorootparentIf that bad command is in in a script where it is run 1000 times in a loop you don&#x27;t want 1000 copies of the help text.The user doesn&#x27;t always need help; maybe they just made a typo.Spewing help on every error gets old, fast.

The guidance you quote doesn&#x27;t cover the case described. reply jakewins 8 hours agorootparentCan you be explicit with what they are missing, I’m clearly missing it as well?OP says please have —help post to stdout, GNU guidance posted above says exact same thing? reply tlamponi 8 hours agorootparent> Can you be explicit with what they are missing, I’m clearly missing it as well?There are two cases when a CLI program can print its usage1. when the `--help` option, or often also the short-option `-h`, is passed to the program2. When the user passes a wrong option to the program, where first the error is printed and then often also the general usage.For 1. the output always should be on stdout, but for 2. the error should be on stderr, and it might be warranted that in that case the usage might be printed on stderr too, so that all is on the same stream.Doing 2. is not a must though, one can also go for an output like: > error message > Try &#x27;program-name --help&#x27; for more informationThis avoids \"hiding\" the actual error in the often rather big amount of usage-text while still hinting how to get information about what options the program expects and&#x2F;or accepts. reply consp 7 hours agorootparent3. With no input when input is required.This is a special case of 2, but is distinctly different since no context can be inferred.In my opinion the program should fail successfully (as in non zero return) since no command was given.

I didn&#x27;t even realize it was a standard, it just made the most sense to me. Being given help via a --help argument is intentional and thus appropriate for STDOUT (and a return code of 0); being given help after an argument error makes sense to go to STDERR (and a return code of 2, \"USAGE\").Since you can nest functions in Bash (did you know?), I usually have a help function within the main function that is called from both logic branches and just outputs to the right file descriptor. reply kazinator 13 hours agorootparent> (did you know?)Yes, but they are not scoped to the parent: $ foo() > { > bar() > { > echo 42 > } > } $ foo $ bar # bar can be called though we are not in foo! 42Probably the most profitable use for this is for individual functions to override some callback.But without even dynamic scope, you have no nice way of restoring the previous one, which could be one that some intermediate caller installed for itself.It could be used to delay the definition of functions. Say that for whatever reason, we put a large number of functions into a file and don&#x27;t need them all to be defined at once. There can be functions which, when invoked, define sets of functions.A module could be written in which certain functions are intended to be clobbered by the user with its own implementation. A function which defines those functions to their original state would be useful to recover from a bad redefinition, without reloading that module. reply OJFord 1 hour agorootparentHm, and not with `local bar` either, bit of a shame. I think at the point that mattered I wouldn&#x27;t want to be using bash though! It&#x27;s nice just as a grouping, &#x27;this is related to that&#x27; sort of thing. reply dingosity 6 hours agoprevThis is going to sound snotty, and I&#x27;m not really trying to be, but... Unix and its derivatives were made for people who sort of knew what they were doing. The reason you pipe exceptional events to STDERR is so the STDOUT output, if it exists, can flow into the next command in the pipe. Asking for help is an exceptional event. If you want the error output of a Unixish (linux, macos, solaris, etc.) machine running bash to be lessable, re-direct it to STDOUT with `2>&1`. You probably shouldn&#x27;t be touching the shell if you don&#x27;t know what that does. These tools were developed assuming the users would have a basic understanding of the system they were running on.The GNU Project has published tools of varying quality, based on who was around to write the tool, debug it, give feedback, etc. It is not the exemplar of high quality software. (But it&#x27;s far from crap.) The important bit about GNU (and any other software) is that it was written to adhere to their uses. Other people have different requirements. Telling people to \"write your software like GNU writes their software\" is to misunderstand personal agency and one of the major points of open source software.Your comments sound like you&#x27;re saying \"Software freedom means you&#x27;re free to write software the way I want you to write software.\"No thank you. reply figmert 1 hour agoparentSure, but adding --help to a command means that the output of help is not exceptional, thus you&#x27;re expecting it in stdout. If on the other hand you invoke the command incorrectly, and the author decides the best thing to do is print out the help in such cases, then yes, it should be stderr. reply blackbear_ 2 hours agoparentprev> Unix and its derivatives were made for people who sort of knew what they were doing. [...] You probably shouldn&#x27;t be touching the shell if you don&#x27;t know what that does.You really do not need to be such a grumpy elitist.

Why else would that be beneficial, just to clear it when I&#x27;ve read what I wanted?) reply throwaway46281 1 hour agorootparentI use `less` with help output because if the help output is long, it starts me at the top of the help output rather than the bottom, and the top usually has a nice summary of the command usage that I usually want to read.More importantly, I can easily find things by searching with less&#x27;s `&#x2F;` hotkey. Relying on the terminal emulator&#x27;s built-in search isn&#x27;t great because (a) I&#x27;m not used to it - I am more used to vim&#x27;s keybindings, and the search hotkey `&#x2F;` is the same in vim, and (b) that&#x27;s also going to search all the output from before I ran --help (not as big of a gripe, but still somewhat annoying). reply unflxw 4 hours agoparentprev> This is going to sound snottyThe word you’re looking for is “condescending”.Regardless, there is no argument about software freedom to be made here.You’re allowed, be it open or close source, to write and publish software that defies common, well-established conventions.You can pretend that it’s some sort of first amendment right to do so if you like, and attempt to deflect your unwillingness to write software that behaves properly as incompetence on the users’ end.But whether anyone will be convinced by that is a separate question, and those who aren’t convinced certainly have the right to tell you, in turn, that your software sucks.

I mean, please do that if you have to make a conscious choice; there&#x27;s no pointing fighting if you&#x27;re using an argument parsing library.--help, when used correctly, is almost always interactive, where stdout&#x2F;stderr and exit status don&#x27;t matter at all. The few noninteractive uses like help2man or zsh auto parsing can trivially handle a redirect. Sure, a noob piping --help to less may be confused for a first time, that&#x27;s rare and it&#x27;s a good chance for them to learn about streams and redirection.That leaves accidental noninteractive usage. Sooner or later someone will call your program with dynamic arguments from another program, and if your command accepts filenames&#x2F;IDs there&#x27;s always a chance to encounter one that starts with &#x27;-&#x27; and contains an &#x27;h&#x27; (a practical example: YouTube video IDs). It&#x27;s very easy to forget to add -- before the unsafe argument(s), so that it&#x27;s accidentally interpreted as flags. Nonempty stdout, empty stderr and zero exit status makes it way too easy to accidentally accept the output as valid, only to discover much later.This is not a theoretical concern, I&#x27;ve made this mistake myself and had it masked by -h behavior. A noob only need to learn redirection once, in a totally harmless setting. Meanwhile, even the most seasoned expert could forget -- in a posix_spawn.At the end of the day, this is not a big deal, but as I said, if you have to make a conscious choice, make the one that makes accidental mistakes more obvious, because humans do make mistakes. This principle applies everywhere. reply wruza 6 hours agoparentAlthough unconventional, this makes sense. reply figmert 1 hour agoprevOn that same note, please do not exit with non-zero when --help is passed. Requesting the help is expected, and I&#x27;m now not sure if the help did some weird stuff to output the help text, and one of those weird things failed, or someone was just too lazy and decided to exit with non-zero. reply GuB-42 15 hours agoprevprint --help to stdout, but if the usage is part of an error (ex: because of bad arguments), then print it to stderr.Many tools, for consistency or for laziness always print usage to stderr.

The only thing that should go to stdout is the result of the program.For example, many programs will print usage&#x2F;help when used incorrectly. Imagine you upgrade the \"read_reactor\" tool, and your usage in your \"control_reactor\" becomes invalid - suddenly you&#x27;re piping help message data to the control rods. By sending it to stderr instead, no bogus data would be piped and, as a bonus, you would see the help message after invoking your script because (as you have experienced) stderr is not piped by default.If you want to send it to less: read_reactor -h 2>&1less reply recursive 14 hours agoparentModern usage is a misnomer.

The arguments for making unix harder than it has to be by sending help to stderr when the user has asked for it is the kind of stuff that gives linux it’s bad reputation. reply umanwizard 2 hours agorootparentAFAIK all standard tools on typical Linux distributions send help to stdout when it’s been asked for, and to stderr when it’s a response to a malformed command. Third parties can make their software do whatever they want, but that’s hardly “Linux”’s fault. reply benatkin 13 hours agorootparentprevI disagree, the program&#x27;s purpose isn&#x27;t to show the help.

As for the redirection order, if you haven&#x27;t learned it yet, learn now!These numbers arent magic. 0 is stdin, 1 is stdout, and 2 is stderr. These are the free file descriptors you get on Unix and on Windows. Stdout (1) from previous process goes to stdin (0) in the next process in a pipeline. So, if you want less to see the previous processe&#x27;s stdout (1) and stderr (2), you just need to tell shell \"send stderr to wherever stdout is going right now\". That&#x27;s exaxtly what 2>&1 means.A fun caveat about this syntax is the difference between these two: ls >&#x2F;dev&#x2F;null 2>&1 ls 2>&1 >&#x2F;dev&#x2F;nullThe first one tells stderr to go to dev null (\"where stdout is going right now\"), and the second one sends stderr to the next process and stdout to dev null reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentprevIt didn&#x27;t exist until \"recently\", but my mnemonic for 2>&1 is two goes to one, but not just one, but to the same place as one, so you have to dereference it with an ampersand. replyrwmj 34 minutes agoprevAlso please do always exit with some non-zero status on error. Looking at you, Fedora Python tools ... reply phyzome 14 hours agoprevIf you used --help, then decided to pipe it to less, and it disappeared, then you can&#x27;t have been confused for too long. But agreed that an explicit --help should print to stdout.However, if you used the tool incorrectly (passed the wrong args) and you expected the usage information to go to stdout rather than stderr, I would disagree vehemently. stdout is (generally) for parseable information, whereas stderr is kind of a garbage bin of everything else. reply _kst_ 14 hours agoparent\"But agreed that an explicit --help should print to stderr.\"I think you meant stdout here, not stderr. reply phyzome 13 hours agorootparentFixed, thanks! reply ygouzerh 4 hours agoparentprevI love this answer! Indeed, we cannot put --help because sometimes the help appears when we put wrong arguments, so we should output it to stderr, so we can see that we made a mistake reply jefftk 29 minutes agoprevIf you&#x27;re in this situation, redirect stderr to stdout: $ tool-that-uses-stderr-for-help --help 2>&1less reply hn92726819 1 hour agoprevAs many others have said, please disregard this advice.OP (and others), if you&#x27;re using zsh or bash, just use |& instead of |. That&#x27;s all you have to do command --help |& lessIt&#x27;s shorter than 2>&1 and it does the same thing. reply globular-toast 1 hour agoparentGood tip, but what the OP said is still valid. You shouldn&#x27;t need to speculatively use |& then redo when you get interleaved rubbish. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agoprevYes, errors (and perhaps debug messages, diagnostics, etc.) should go to stderr.The output of --help is not an error message, it&#x27;s the legitimate and expected output of the program when invoked with that argument. reply wahern 13 hours agoprevI always write my usage printing routine to take a FILE pointer, similar to the following, static void usage(const char *arg0, FILE *fp);and then at the very end of main&#x27;s getopt switch something like, case &#x27;h&#x27;: usage(argv[0], stdout); return 0; default: usage(argv[0], stderr); return EXIT_FAILURE; }By default getopt prints (to stderr) a one line message for unknown options or missing arguments, so I usually don&#x27;t bother catching &#x27;:&#x27; or &#x27;?&#x27; explicitly. reply galdosdi 15 hours agoprevIn the meantime until every tool is rewritten to account for your recommendation, just add 2>&1 and stderr will redirect to stdout, so you can easily pipe it to other stuff reply teraflop 15 hours agoparentOr just use \"|& less\" to do the same thing more succinctly. reply foresto 14 hours agorootparent...if you happen to be using bash. reply vdfs 14 hours agorootparentAh bummer, every command i run need to be backward compatible with Bell Labs first release reply eesmith 9 hours agorootparentUnlikely.

Git invoking PAGER is tripping me up every time.

Many want to show usage info when there&#x27;s an argument error, and you want to reuse the help code with minimal complexity. reply SushiHippie 13 hours agoprevFor this reason I have a zsh function in my .zshrc with bat (which pages by default, if it&#x27;s longer than your console height):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sharkdp&#x2F;bat#highlighting---help-messages # in your .bashrc&#x2F;.zshrc&#x2F;*rc alias bathelp=&#x27;bat --plain --language=help&#x27; help() { \"$@\" --help 2>&1bathelp }This highlights the help output with colors so it looks nicer, works with most help outputs, as it highlights the first part which is the flag&#x2F;argument in one color and the description in another color reply zzo38computer 14 hours agoprevI agree this makes sense. The help text is the primary output of the program in this case, so it should be stdout. (However, if you want longer documentation then a man page might be better anyways.)You would use stderr for status messages, error messages, and other stuff that is not the primary output of the program. (In some cases, this might include help text; like another comment says, if you specified wrong arguments (not --help) then a short description might be a part of the error message.)One program that does write error messages to stdout and that annoys me significantly is Ghostscript. (Although you can tell it to write it to stderr, doing that causes all output to be written to stderr; I want output from \"print\", \"==\", etc to be written to stdout.) reply stabbles 4 hours agoprevIn Bash, just use `tool --help |& less` by default :)Saves a few characters compared to 2>&1 reply hexo 3 hours agoprevPlease learn to redirect output.

I guess it could log to stdout if you specify an explicit file and stderr when you want the video on stdout. But sometimes being consistent is better than being convenient. reply matheusmoreira 13 hours agoprevIt depends.Standard output is for program output. Standard error is something of an unfortunate name since it&#x27;s actually a side channel for all non-output messages meant for the user to read.So what&#x27;s \"output\" anyway? Whatever the user asked the program to compute. If you pass a --help option, the help message is clearly the program&#x27;s output because it&#x27;s what the user asked for. If you use it incorrectly and the program prints usage information, the help message should go to standard error while the output is empty because the operation failed. reply jjgreen 15 hours agoprevEven more fun, Python printed --version to stderr before 3.4, then to stdout. reply Calzifer 14 hours agoparentJava (since version 9) has -version which prints to stderr and --version which prints to stdout (also with slightly different content).

Where does that go? reply eesmith 9 hours agoparentThe logging libraries I know of let you configure the log destination, for example, to save to stderr and&#x2F;or a file and&#x2F;or syslog or the Windows event log, etc.Use the defaults for your logging library and support a config option. reply junon 14 hours agoprevDisagree here.

What new experience are ready for this?I get the quality is better, and that’s not nothing.But other than that this largely seems like more of the same. VR still doesn’t seem to have advanced much in software to me. And Meta keeps pushing virtual meetings and such but that’s not my cup of tea.I owned a Quest 2 and had some fun with it. I’ve owned previous headsets too. But I just don’t see anything that would makes me say “ooh I need that”.This feels very “PC” to me. By which I mean they’re selling it because they can sell new hardware. The Pentium 9 is out! Which is fine.But when Sony&#x2F;Nintendo&#x2F;MS want to sell a new console they put new and fancier games. They give you a specific reason to upgrade besides better specs. So you can play Horizon 12: We’re On The Moon Now. Or Bob’s Crazy Adventure. Whatever.All this time and it still seems like the market is 95% games, and those aren’t advancing much beyond visuals. So I don’t feel like I’m really missing anything. reply bouncyhat 19 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve found BigScreen (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigscreenvr.com&#x2F;software) to be a fairly compelling killer app case for VR. Besides being able to trick your eyes into thinking they&#x27;re in a movie theater, the social elements are great. On a weekly cadence I jump into a shared room with 6+ of my friends and we pick a bad movie to watch together as we MST3k it. There&#x27;s something about positional audio when talking with someone that makes it easier to replicate the experience of hanging out in person versus a video meet.We&#x27;ve been doing this since the pandemic started and it&#x27;s the #1 way I stay in touch with a bunch of friends now. It&#x27;s also ruined real life movie theaters for me since I&#x27;m used to being able to talk with friends while watching. We&#x27;ll actively wait for a movie to hit streaming before \"seeing it in the theaters\" with each other.All of this was already possible with the Quest 2, but I&#x27;m interested to see how the quest 3 can further make those hangouts feel even closer to the real thing. Dunno if it will be a big enough leap for everyone to jump from the 2 to the 3, but if the visuals comes through sharper, or the sound is better, or the controller is easier to hold for 2 hours - any of those things would be a win. reply bsimpson 15 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t got to use VR much, since my apartment is too small for it, but I have played a few rounds of VR racketball.I have no interest in VR videoconferencing, but shared presence is surprisingly interesting. When you&#x27;ve both got headsets and headphones on, you can&#x27;t tell the difference from playing in the same room as your friend, even if you&#x27;re physically hours from one another. reply mulderc 14 hours agorootparentprevBig screen has the most toxic online community I have ever interacted with. I know there is worse out there but the amount of anti-LGBTQ chat I hear was disturbing for a place that is about watching movies. reply cheriot 19 hours agoparentprevQuest 2 grew the VR market by ~10x. What was the killer app? Beat Saber is the first install, but not what kept it going for 3 years.It&#x27;s the ecosystem. VR Chat for some, social game for others, immersive experiments like Bonelab, and a few studio titles.I&#x27;m glad Meta didn&#x27;t hype the Quest 3 too much. It&#x27;s easy for VR expectations to outrun current tech. VR seems to be in the trough of disillusionment where it&#x27;s moving forward (2023 games are way more playable than 2021 games) but it&#x27;s a slow burn. \"Hey this isn&#x27;t a step change\" is probably right about the Quest 3, but I think also misses the bigger picture. It&#x27;s a platform and people are still figuring out what to build on it. reply seanmcdirmid 19 hours agorootparentBeat Saber is still hella fun. I know some people that just play that (but play it daily) on their Quest. I&#x27;m not sure Facebook is particularly happy about that, however, since those people aren&#x27;t buying apps or making them much money (maybe just the occasional song pack).I&#x27;m guessing Beat Saber is the only reason the Quest is even sold in Japan and Korea. reply cableshaft 19 hours agorootparentThe song packs come out really slowly too. They&#x27;ve released just one song pack with 11 songs on it this year, the Queen one back in May, as well as added 10 songs to existing song packs. For a total of 21 songs total this year so far.And 210 official songs since it first came out back in 2018.Meanwhile the PCVR version has a ridiculous 65,000[1] custom songs made for it at this point.Not sure why they can&#x27;t get closer to the Rock Band model, where it released new songs all the time, and had 2,743 songs total (and 84 songs THIS YEAR according to Wikipedia[2]...had no idea there was even an actively supported Rock Band game out there still).Beat Saber should be making them enough money to allow them to at least do double or triple what they&#x27;re doing now.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsaber.com&#x2F;ultimate-guide-to-beat-saber-custom-songs...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_downloadable_songs_for... reply seanmcdirmid 19 hours agorootparentI agree! But the modding...that is all legally dubious, it makes sense that Meta can&#x27;t just release whatever song they want. I wish it could be attached to spotify or something: you get to listen to the song because you have a subscription, and just play custom beat saber levels with it.Heck, I would be happy if they just were able to do as well as Konami did with DDR. But Meta seems to be taking a slow growth approach on Beat Saber. reply cableshaft 17 hours agorootparentI understand they need to get the rights to it, I&#x27;m just surprised they aren&#x27;t more aggressively doing so. Rock Band has shown it should be doable to negotiate a lot more licenses more quickly than they have.I understand they like to make a bit of a visual stage experience to each song pack, but not every song pack needs that necessarily, and they should also be able to have multiple teams working on song packs in parallel you&#x27;d think, as opposed to one every once in a while, even if they insisted on making new visual themes for each one.As it is, I&#x27;d love to buy more song packs from them, but I&#x27;m not that into Queen, or Lizzo, or several others they&#x27;ve done the past couple of years (Electronic Mixtape released in May 2022 was the last one that excited me). And other people have their tastes too. Putting out songs more often insures that people have something new they can support and a reason to get back into it more than once every other year.The reason I brought up the custom songs, is they could potentially use those for ideas of what players would really like to see in the game, based on custom song usage, as well as possibly once they do get rights to those songs, possibly get permission from the creator to use the beat patterns (or whatever they&#x27;re called) and save some development time.I know they hired at least one person from the custom song community before, they could potentially get permission from some others (with some compensation). reply seanmcdirmid 17 hours agorootparentI had a discussion with someone who had some real knowledge, and they said Meta can&#x27;t really make a business with Quest just via Beat Saber.

The Wifi AP was on the wall just about 3 feet from my head and I still got the occasional lag spikes and I confirmed that they were due to the Wifi network (not just rendering spikes on my PC).There&#x27;s just too much random interference on the 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz bands for it to be buttery smooth.

Same but better specs.But the site appears to me like it’s positioning it as a Vision Pro competitor when it’s not even in the same league. “We have AR too so it’s the same!” The Vision Pro seems very clearly marketed at a different segment and primary use case to me.The problem is that if Apple (or a 3rd party on the platform) figures it out I think there’s a good chance it can’t work well on a significantly cheaper headset like the Quest 3.Then the Quest 3 may be the cheap thing that doesn’t do what people want. Like when you didn’t get an XBox 360 at Christmas because mom&#x2F;dad got you a $25 TV plug-in Pac-Man game because “it’s the same thing”.But Meta wants in on the party. And I feel like they’re trying to get their sales before the Vision Pro comes out and immediately becomes the thing that they get very unfavorably compared to (except price). Just like they rushed out a pre-announcement this was coming around the Vision Pro announcement.Even if Apple face plants or never finds “it”and the Vision Pro isn’t successful I don’t see Meta being either. All these years and it’s still kind of “eh”. reply supernikio2 20 hours agorootparentI feel like the \"killer app problem\" is not unique to the Quest, but the whole VR ecosystem. I&#x27;m being cautiously optimistic Apple will finally break through and find an app that will appeal to the masses, and even though the price is not attainable for 95% of the population, that will trickle down and find it&#x27;s way to the broader market. reply gabereiser 19 hours agorootparentAs stated before, YMMV, because the killer apps for me have been iRacing and DCS in VR. If you aren&#x27;t into simulation games, VR isn&#x27;t really there yet for your genre. FPS&#x27;s are getting there, kinda. Your brain still has to remind your body to crouch. Beatsaber, tennis, there&#x27;s some novelty games but if you&#x27;re asking yourself why would you buy VR, you already answered your own question. You shouldn&#x27;t. Apple&#x27;s headset, like the iPhone, will take some time to get apps working and finding their market fit. I do have hopes that Apple&#x27;s headset brings VR into a more \"stable\" marketplace.

It’s not unique to the Quest. They’re just the most successful player so far (I think).Apple isn’t target VR (though it works), they’re trying something different.

I&#x27;ve got the original Quest, and features you&#x27;d expect to be broken or missing (eg. hand tracking, multitasking, game streaming, web browsing, sideloading, et. al) all work fine.It&#x27;s honestly quite sad that the core line of rhetoric here is a laconic \"what if\" statement around theoretical apps. The Quest exists and has sold tens of millions of units; the Vision Pro has yet to prove itself. Unless you have a specific example, this can only be interpreted as wishcasting. reply MBCook 18 hours agorootparentThe quest sold millions at the beginning of a pandemic when people were trapped at home and needed an escape.How many people still use it? How many regret the purchase, how many would have bought it without the pandemic?I see that as Meta’s big opportunity to grab success in VR. And it didn’t happen.They’re trying to market this like the next thing everyone needs and after multiple tries I just don’t see it. I don’t even see how they get there, this is the same strategy as the Quest, Quest 2, PSVR, PSVR2, etc. Games are great but that pitch just isn’t working at really moving the needle. But that’s all they have. reply smoldesu 16 hours agorootparentGames moved 20+ million units. That&#x27;s &#x27;the needle&#x27;, unless your goal is to depose the iPhone. And clearly Meta is content to leave it alone, since the Quest even has an iOS companion app. They&#x27;re complimentary products, not cannibalistic.On the other hand, I can guarantee that most people who already own an iPhone will regret buying a Vision Pro. It&#x27;s too expensive and too redundant to matter as a piece of hardware. It&#x27;s not a market-redefining release like the Quest was, nor is it a proprietary solution to unfixable problems. It&#x27;s an expensive thing, and for most people the Quest value proposition will align long before the Vision Pro value proposition does. The Hololens already tried this avenue too; merely offering a premium version of mixed reality doesn&#x27;t work (even when the military is your customer).It&#x27;ll be years before the dust settles, but the Quest has gotten undeniably far on it&#x27;s own. You can rationalize that success however you want, but you&#x27;ll consistently be confused if you hold it to unproven standards like \"spatial computing\".

The VR&#x2F;AR&#x2F;XR market comes with its own set of challenges so imagining where it maps onto that timeline is hard, but I would guess we are still more in the Handspring - WinCE era of these devices.Wearable display systems have a solid and growing user base but the hardware is still a ways off from something that will have mass adoption.

When it comes to actually getting things done, in my experience VR just gets in the way.AR on the other hand is something I could easily see becoming useful.

If you blow it up until you&#x27;re only looking at a portion of the screen you can have a larger one but then you&#x27;re stuck to moving your head around to see your whole monitor.

The closest you can get is a VR motion racing rig, but those are prohibitively expensive.

This makes it the most flexible VR headset on the market atm.Don&#x27;t know about Quest 3, but probably the same. reply crooked-v 19 hours agoparentprevAlong with the other comments, one extra thing to note is that the three-point tracking (head + 2 hands) is entirely standalone even when connected to a PC (platforms like Steam VR will translate it across), so you don&#x27;t need any other hardware than that. Apps and games then generally either guesstimate the rest of your body positioning (using inverse kinematics) or just leave it out entirely by making you walk on your hands (like Gorilla Tag does - this actually works way better than it sounds).There are some additional standalone body trackers, like SlimeVR, Sony mocopi, or HaritoraX, where you strap the hardware widgets on and they communicate inertial measurements with each other and your device without needing any base stations. But, since there&#x27;s no OS-level support for them on Quest, support is app-by-app and usually requires a second device as a go-between (like a phone running the mocopi app).PCVR makes it easy to use a ton of trackers and they&#x27;re much more precise, but they require base stations (IR cameras on mounts you set up around your play space) since each one is basically a little IR transmitter with its position computed by the PC. If you see any \"full body trolling\" videos on Youtube it&#x27;s generally people using these, since you can do strange things with them (handstands, pogo stick bouncing, multiple people sharing the same physical space, other Youtube creator nonsense) without the tracking getting confused or desynced. reply mesmertech 20 hours agoparentprevStandalone, but you can connect to PC if you want to play graphically intensive games.

It&#x27;ll give you a cordless, hassle-free, console-like experience as a standalone device if that&#x27;s what you want, or, if you instead want to play graphically intense VR games, you can connect it to a gaming PC and use SteamVR (AirLink, Virtual Desktop, or a USB-C cable.)If you want something high end with a really solid game library so far, the PSVR2 is much better than this at $550 (though requires a PS5.)The Quest 2 had a promising start with several great games coming to it, but then Meta seemingly stopped funding new games and VR ports, and unfortunately SteamVR hasn&#x27;t had a ton release recently either.Sony, on the other hand, had an incredible starting library for the PSVR2 and plenty more AA and AAA games are releasing soon. Discoverability is also much better on PSVR2 — my friend with the headset has shown me many great games that actually are on the Quest and SteamVR, but I had never seen them before as there are so many more games on Steam and the Quest store (unfortunately most of which aren&#x27;t good.) Not sure if Sony curates their store better or if it&#x27;s just that not much shovelware has been made on it yet. In either case, great games exist on all 3 of those platforms, but they&#x27;re easiest to discover on PSVR2.As others have mentioned, Meta&#x27;s resources would be better spent bringing games to their existing headset versus creating new ones. I do think that having a more powerful headset would allow more impressive experiences (as is the case with PSVR2), but people aren&#x27;t going to keep buying their devices if only a handful of impressive games release on them.Nintendo regularly releases underpowered hardware compared to the competition, but they make such great first-party games that they end up selling incredibly well despite their lackluster hardware. The Quest 2 sold very well, and I imagine that games like Resident Evil 4 VR probably convinced many people to buy it (I know at least one person who got it for that game.) The Quest Pro did not sell well, so I&#x27;m not sure why they think better hardware but with the same library will convince people to buy new headsets.EDIT: I guess I should have done a bit more searching, as does seem like there are some potentially popular games coming out for the Quest still, such as Assassin&#x27;s Creed Nexus VR and Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable. Strange I haven&#x27;t gotten any ads for it on YouTube, I saw tons of ads for Resident Evil 4 VR for the Quest 2 (as well as some of the Star Wars VR games.) reply dmix 15 hours agoparentQuest 2 was underrated one of the best deals in tech in recent history. Easily worth the $300.I got way more enjoyment out of it than I ever expected as a casual gamer. Replaying Resident Evil 4 + the various workout apps like boxing made it worth the price. But I got much more.The beta app store offers a TON of free games still in dev too. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidequestvr.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;applab&#x2F;0&#x2F;rating reply koshergweilo 15 hours agoparentprevI completely agree, I just got a used quest2 for $200 and this doesn&#x27;t see any compelling reason to shell out the extra $300 yet.Maybe someone&#x27;s going to come up with a must have AR experience but as someone who mostly uses their quest for sims and gaming, I feel like my money would be better spent on upgrading my computer reply dougmwne 20 hours agoprevThis seems like on paper it is quite close to the Apple Vision Pro. The performance per watt of the chips is probably not far off and both devices deal with the same basic design constraints of needing to fit comfortably on your head.

I had loads of fun gaming on the Quest 2 in the pandemic lockdowns, and the controllers really help with gaming by providing accurate controls for weapons&#x27; triggers and haptics to feel weapons firing and when the tension in the bow before you fire arrow. Good luck feeling all that via waving your empty hands in the air.I feel like HN simply loves to hate certain things without understanding them or using them, like the Quest while never actually using it for games and expecting it to be an early Apple Vision PRO. It&#x27;s not, it was designed to be a games console, and for that it works quite well. reply smoldesu 19 hours agorootparentIt also feels like there&#x27;s a Paretto principle of VR experiences that people seem eager to avoid; the last &#x27;20%&#x27; of experiences offered by PCVR or Vision Pro might not be worth it. Even as a tech nerd, I don&#x27;t really find myself pining for an upgrade to my original Quest. It offers the &#x27;80%&#x27; of the experience I&#x27;d actually want a headset for. I can watch 3D movies in bed, play immersive games or browse the internet surrounded by tabs. Adding iMessage to that equation will probably not be worth $3,000 for the average consumer.Given the direction digital markets are headed (and the open precedent of VR), I think Meta is right to bet on that &#x27;80%&#x27;. It&#x27;s much easier to pitch a console like the Quest than an overly-ambitious lockdown-helmet that costs as much as 2 used cars. Until Apple announces a better Vision lineup, it&#x27;s going to be a bloodbath in terms of unit shipments. reply dougmwne 20 hours agorootparentprevCould be? If Quest 3 can deliver a nausea free experience then it may hit the same use cases as the Vision Pro.

I&#x27;ve never been able to get VR working on Linux no matter the headset though personally. reply riskable 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s still severely locked down Android. You can enable some hand-holding kid gloves \"developer mode\" features that go ever so slightly above what a normal user would be able to do but be prepared to sacrifice your firstborn just to get developer access (requires having a phone paired to the device with your personal Facebook account so no chance of sharing developer mode features with anyone else).Trying to do file management on the Quest platform is a nightmware. With a whole lot of work you can flash some Android apps that can do things like SFTP but it&#x27;s impossible to keep the headset \"awake\" long enough to complete large file transfers. Not only that but it&#x27;ll auto kill such apps that have been open for a while without activity.You have no mechanism to schedule tasks or execute arbitrary scripts. There&#x27;s no command line access to speak of. Closest you can get is locked down adb.Apps can access other apps storage areas if they&#x27;ve designated that area as shareable (e.g. not part of the app itself). So that means if you say, mod Beat Saber (which is very complicated&#x2F;difficult compared to PC) the downloaded maps can be accessed by a normal Android file sharing application. But like I said, the headset will turn itself off and occasionally just plain kill any app that&#x27;s running without activity (maybe due to lots of network activity? Dunno).Trying to keep the files on your headset in sync with anything anywhere is always a manual process. There&#x27;s no way to script or automate anything. You also can&#x27;t install URL handlers that would say, open another app to handle a particular filetype (that&#x27;s locked down). I haven&#x27;t tried it but I also haven&#x27;t seen a mechanism to install your own certificates.There&#x27;s also no way to set the clock (LOL). Once you pick your timezone when you first power on the device (and mandatory pair it with your personal phone&#x2F;Facebook account) you must use that timezone forever. This means that if something goes wrong with the date (as did happen with my headset) the device will no longer accept any SSL certificates which means no updates and basically everything stops working on the headset. The only fix for this is a factory reset.Meta support is also total garbage. If you have an issue and it&#x27;s not part of their script of answers or something they&#x27;ve encountered a million times it&#x27;s not getting fixed. FACTORY RESET is what they say over and over again because Meta wants the headset to be perceived as an appliance and most certainly not as a general-purpose computing platform.That last fact is what I think holds back the entire platform as a whole. If they used a regular Linux distribution and gave developers the power to use it like a normal Linux distribution it would accelerate innovation and vastly increase the usability, availability of apps, and overall improve the user experience. reply freedomben 14 hours agorootparentThank you, I wish I could upvote this 10 times to show my gratitude for your answer and the time it took you.

If underlying data is identical in JSON or YAML or whatever, why not introduce a view layer that is structure agnostic provided that the syntax can be translated without modifying the data?I&#x27;m imagining a VSCode plugin or some view that parses the data into whatever format you&#x27;d like when you open it, then when you write it serializes it into the file format specified in the filename. You could do the same with your code review system.Ultimately the specific syntax is for humans only, so as tooling improves why not add that next layer of abstraction? Is it because there are so many format-specific idiosyncrasies that can&#x27;t translate well, due to the complex nature of a lot of these config files (gitlab-yaml, etc.)?Just wondering, without having the time to think through the language specs properly, why we haven&#x27;t seen this yet when it seems like such a huge quality of life improvement. reply djur 3 hours agorootparentprevThe timing doesn&#x27;t quite work out for this explanation, unfortunately. YAML is about the same age as JSON and started finding a niche as a configuration language in parallel with JSON finding use as a serialization format.

JSON, at least superficially, didn&#x27;t have many of those because it lacked (and still lacks) a lot of features. So, for a reasonable person it wouldn&#x27;t be a proper comparison, but... there&#x27;s the reason number 2.JSON rise to prominence coincided with Flash dying and JavaScript hype train gathering momentum. Flash made a bet on XML (think E4X in the latest AS3 spec, MXML, XML namespaces in the code etc.) Those who hated Flash for reasons unrelated to its technological merits hated everything associated with it. In particular, that hate would come from people doing JavaScript. HTML5 that was supposed to replace Flash, but never did was fueling this hype train even more.At the time, JavaScript programmers fell inferior to every other kind of programmer. Well, nobody considered JavaScript programmers to be a thing. If you were doing something on Web, you&#x27;d try hard to work with some other technology that compiled to JavaScript, but god forbid you actually write JavaScript. But people like Steve Yegge and Douglas Crockford worked on popularizing the technology, backed by big companies who wanted to take Adobe out of the standardization game. And, gradually, the Web migrated from Flash as a technology for Web applications to JavaScript. JSON was a side-effect of this change. JavaScript desperately needed tools to match different abilities of Flash, and XHR seemed like it won&#x27;t be part of JavaScript and was in general a (browser-dependent) mess, especially when it comes to parsing, but also security. JSON had a potential to exploit a security hole in Web security model by being immediately interpreted as JavaScript data, and this was yet another selling point.To expand on the last claim: one of the common ways to work with JSON was through dynamically appending a `script` element to HTML document, then extracting the data from that element, which side-stepped XHR. There was also a variant of pJSON (I think this is what it was called, but don&#x27;t quote me, it was a long time ago), where thus loaded JSON would be sent as this: $callback({ ... some JSON ... })Where the `$callback` was supplied by the caller. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what this was actually trying to accomplish beside dealing with the asynchronous nature of JavaScript networking, but I vaguely remember hearing about some security benefits of doing this.Anyways, larger point being: JSON came to life in a race to dislodge one of the dominant forces on the Web. Speed of designing the language and the speed of onboarding of new language users was of paramount importance in this race, where quality, robustness and other desirable engineering qualities played a secondary role, if at all. reply malaya_zemlya 1 hour agorootparentBefore CORS, JSONP was one of the few ways to work around the same-origin policy. reply thaumasiotes 2 hours agorootparentprev> HTML5 that was supposed to replace Flash, but never did was fueling this hype train even more.My impression of what happened was that the iPhone replaced Flash, and therefore HTML5 couldn&#x27;t replace Flash because Flash was already gone.There were some nasty things about Flash, but in retrospect mobile applications are so much worse.

In the other hand, HTML5 was adopted quickly by Apple. So we can say that HTML5 replaced Flash (not iPhone per se, as it didn&#x27;t come with a specific replacement first and an alternative was already there second.)However, I wouldn&#x27;t say that HTML5 is the drop-in replacement of Flash.

You build your subset language based on JSON, and you want to validate input data to check whether it complies with your format. Instead of writing your own parser, you specify your language with a high-level language and run the validation as a post-parsing step. Nothing in this usecase involves anything resembling \"too dumb\".OpenAPI is a language to specify your APIs. At most, it is orthogonal to JSON. Again, nothing in this usecase involves anything resembling \"too dumb\".JSON is just one of those tools that is a major success, and thus people come out of the woodwork projecting their frustrations and misconceptions on a scapegoat. \"JSON is too dumb because I developed a JSON-based format that I need to validate.\" \"JSON is too dumb because I need to document how my RESTful API actually works\". What does JSON has to do with anything? reply whizzter 1 hour agorootparentToo-dumb is that it was too machine tied, imo jsonc(and now later json5) strikes a perfect compromise.Json5 adds back, quote-less identifiers, trailing commas in objects&#x2F;arrays and most importantly, comments (That jsonc already added).With those additions, there is little extra pain of writing JSON as configuration without losing anything in terms of being stringent. reply sanitycheck 3 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re making an interesting distinction between \"JSON\" and \"languages based on JSON\" there, which I don&#x27;t. JSON and XML in isolation are just a bunch of punctuation and not useful. They&#x27;re only useful when we know the structure of the data within them. XML already had schemas, and we were able to easily (YMMV!) validate the correctness of a document.JSON was simpler because we would just say to each other \"I&#x27;ll send you a {\"foo\":{\"bar\":1234,\"ok\":true}}\", \"Cool thx\" - and there wasn&#x27;t a way to formalise that even if we wanted to.

It&#x27;s about using the wrong tool for the problem.Ultimately, code as configuration is the solution. The code generates the actual configuration-data which can be of an arbitrary format (e.g. json) since no one is gonna see it anyways except for debugging.There are usually two arguments against that:1.) code can be or become too complicatedIt&#x27;s a non-argument because while code can and will be complicated, the same configuration in non-code will be even worse. In the worst case, people will build things around the configuration because the configuration isn&#x27;t sufficiently flexible.What is true is that a single line of code is usually more complex than single line of yaml. The same can be said about assembly vs. any high level language. But it should be clear that what counts is the complexity of the overall solution, not a single line.2.) code can be dangerousThis is a valid point. You will have to sandbox&#x2F;restrict it and you need to have a timeout since it could run forever - and that creates some additional complexity.I think this complexity is worth it in 90% of the cases. Even if you are not using code to generate the configuration, you probably still want to have a timeout, just in case of some malicious actor trying to use a config that takes forever to parse&#x2F;execute etc.But if you say that this is a nogo, then at least use a proper configuration language such as Dhall instead of YAML. It already exists.

To summarize from memory:- Ant’s config needs were modest: configs were static strings, numbers, booleans, and lists- XML parser existed, was well tested, was supported by lots of tools, so was a quicker and easy way to parse configs- As Ant became successful, the configs grew more complex and started to need to be dynamic and have “control flow”- Once control flow was needed XML was no longer the best choice for config parsing, but it was too late. (The correct answer is that a scripting language is what you want here.)Edit: I posted this quote from his essay on HN back in 2020 [1]:> Now, I never intended for the file format to become a scripting language—after all, my original view of Ant was that there was a declaration of some properties that described the project and that the tasks written in Java performed all the logic. The current maintainers of Ant generally share the same feelings. But when I fused XML and task reflection in Ant, I put together something that is 70-80% of a scripting environment. I just didn&#x27;t recognize it at the time. To deny that people will use it as a scripting language is equivalent to asking them to pretend that sugar isn&#x27;t sweet.Edit 2: The reason you’re not seeing an “improved yaml” is because the improved version is just Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;JS&#x2F;PHP,…[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25385443 reply crabbone 4 hours agoparentprevYeah... this is like saying that murdering all people in line to buy ice-cream and waiting for your turn to buy ice-cream have pros and cons: either you get to buy ice-cream faster, but some people die, or you have to wait, but nobody dies.YAML is trash.

Ultimately, YAML & Markdown are good for one common reason: human write-ability. A lot of people think it&#x27;s about readability, but it isn&#x27;t: readability may be a pro in terms of quality, but its write-ability that actually drives adoption. YAML has pretty bad readability in reality (people think it&#x27;s good because they confuse readability with aesthetics), in no small part due to its non-standardised indentation (also in smaller part due to its ambiguous data-types).JSON is probably the most readable of all of them (readability isn&#x27;t about being terse or \"clean\"), but the requirement for terminators makes it much less write-able. XML is worse again in this regard.TOML is a kind of middle-ground - adopting many of YAML&#x27;s flaws but fixing some of it&#x27;s most egregious faults.

This is why webpack configs get so messy. As soon as people can use a real language, their \"DRY sensor\" (or other bad applied paradigm sensor) triggers and they make things more complicated.Being declarative also makes it easier to follow standard practice and supports tooling.

For rust the clap crate helps put the brakes on if you agree on a simple rule, anything that is a config file parameter is a command line argument and environment variable.

The API need to always be up so engineers can merge their modifications to infrastructure. Recovery and undo is also a problem that needs to be solved so you need a system with point in time recovery.My Preference is to have an actual language generate what the system will do in a human-readable format, and you check that in, but Git and JSON or YAML with a Proto DSL act as the API, and then anything that can write a flat file can be used to configure your system. reply quickthrower2 4 hours agoparentprevGet that YAML to call a bash or powershell script outside of the YAML as soon as humanly possible! reply baz00 1 hour agoprevThis is my favourite turd: - 07 - 08Results in [ 7, \"08\" ]due to assumptions about octal and strings.This assumption was discovered deep within some templated YAML generated by templated something else three levels down and resulted in a complete k8s cluster failure for us, but only the 08 cluster!

What isn’t great is how hard we have made the deployment part of CD. I’ll admit that our setup within Azure DevOps isn’t amazing, but the fact that you have organisations with multiple teams or 5-6 operators working on these tools is just mind blowing to me. Maybe not for Google, but for us in regular boring enterprise where we top out at 50.000 concurrent users or typically way, way, less.It was easier for me to deploy enterprise web-applications to our on-prem IIS that had all the load balancing and networking and whatever else done by less than a quarter of a full time employee back in the early 00’s than it is for me to deploy the same damn thing into our “modern” setup. Yes, there are advantages to our modern pipeline. We’ve moved far beyond the whole “it works on my computer” thing and we’ve increased the quality control immensely by putting up much better acceptance gates, but the actual deployment? That’s a damn nightmare in 2023.Again, this is likely not an issue for many HN programmers who work in actual tech companies, or in companies with good dedicated DevOps teams, but in the world of non-tech enterprise CI&#x2F;CD has frankly never felt worse in my career. I guess you can chose to blame YAML, and the loads of it you need to do anything and how hard templating seems to be. But in my opinion it’s far more of an organisational issue than a technical one. We need CD tools that are far more automated, so that it doesn’t become the job of the developer to describe the infrastructure as code. It’s fine that you can do that, but the reality is also that we are asking millions of developers to deploy infrastructure that they might not have the slightest clue how works. I’ve never met a developer who didn’t just want to hand off their container and then have all the networking and “server stuff” just done for them. And when you don’t, you end up with a lot of VNETs and subnets that nobody really knows how works and that your organisation is losing a ton of money on because your developers didn’t know you could so &#x2F;x and then start the subnet where it came to. reply jiggawatts 4 hours agoparentThe cloud is the new mainframe.You work offline on a \"job definition\" of some sort, submit it to the proprietary shared system, wait in a queue, then you receive a log file generated by a system you don&#x27;t control. You can&#x27;t run the proprietary system code locally on a workstation, and hence the inner loop is often tens of minutes long at best, hours or days at worst. There&#x27;s no preview, no \"what if\" mode or \"dry run\". You work directly on production even if it&#x27;s called \"test\" because there&#x27;s only one system.The real problem isn&#x27;t YAML. It wouldn&#x27;t matter if the pipelines were scripted in God&#x27;s own programming language.Software development on workstations instead of central timeshare mainframes became wildly popular because it allowed a dramatically faster inner loop, it allowed isolation from production environments, and it gave control back into the hands of the developers.Current-generation CI&#x2F;CD pipelines generally undo all of that.Single-box Kubernetes reintroduces most of what made workstation-based development good, but it is still a very new system and has many teething issues.PS: A related issue to yours is that there are great solutions for the solo dev doing click-ops for one app, there are great solutions for megacorops doing automation at scale for thousands of devs, but in the middle where you have a couple of enterprise devs managing a few dozen apps its just madness. reply bewo001 2 hours agorootparentGot it, I&#x27;ll use JCL for the next project.More seriously, this is a very good comparison.

You&#x27;re not going to deploy things on the internet in an Enterprise Organisation, so you&#x27;re going to have something that can make sure your application gets on the right VNET and the right subnet. Obtains the correct private-endpoints. Gets a DNS address so people can go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yourapp.yourcompany.com from the internal on-prem network that will need a DNS routing as well because it&#x27;s not going to ask the internet. Once in a while, when you actually want your app to be accessed from the internet, you&#x27;re going to need some sort of gateway resource that can transfer the traffic through whatever security your org has setup in such a way that it blocks, every, IP you&#x27;re not intending on letting through.The second thing you&#x27;re going to want is a place to persist your data. You can have a centralized shared database, and most places use this, but the issue with that is that it&#x27;ll eventually end up a mess. Not by bad intention, but because it&#x27;s just very easy to build stored procedures, views and whatever else on top of the data from all those 100+ applications that are sharing the same DB server because it&#x27;s a quick way to deliver business value (until it isn&#x27;t). It also doesn&#x27;t scale, which will eventually be an issue for you even if you aren&#x27;t netflix. The flip-side is that you can&#x27;t actually do a bunch of managed DBs because that is ridicilously expensive, and you likely can&#x27;t use the CosmosDB (and whatever the AWS equvilient is called) because of company red-tape and also because your 3rd party DB backup vendor doesn&#x27;t support it. So you either run them in containers, or share servers, or run up the bill. Two of those solutions require all the steps in the networking step, because they too need to be on the right private endpoints on the right subnets on the right VNETs, and all of them will need you to grant some sort of access rights through your IDM. Which is often as simple as giving your apps some sort of managed ID and then adding it to some AD group, but that&#x27;s still something that needs to be done.Deployment slots: now we&#x27;re moving into the more ridicilous parts of it, but you&#x27;re probably going to need to deploy your application at least twice. It&#x27;ll probably be three or more, but it&#x27;ll be at least twice. Each of these slots require that you go through the two previous steps. If you&#x27;re wondering why, then it can be as silly as because some Enterprise Architect lied in a meeting and convinced everyone it was required by law, similar to how you&#x27;re also forced to put 4-6 eyes on every pull request (though to be fair, this part makes sense).And that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re using serverless dockerized function apps in Azure in an enterprise organisation. If you&#x27;re not doing serverless it gets way worse. Sure kubernetes, travis, openshift and so on can do it much smarter, but in non-tech enterprise you don&#x27;t have anyone employed to manage it.@jiggawatts really put it well when he said this in one of the other comments:> there are great solutions for the solo dev doing click-ops for one app, there are great solutions for megacorops doing automation at scale for thousands of devs, but in the middle where you have a couple of enterprise devs managing a few dozen apps its just madness.In all seriousness I&#x27;ve written and deployed business critical serverless applications, which are less code than the bicep and yaml required to deploy them, and here is the biggest issue, I have no idea if my bicep is actually good because GPT wrote most of it. reply kunley 1 hour agoprevThis is why I started to craft my own format: BCL, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wkhere&#x2F;bclWill not immediately help in all cases of YAML usages, but at least can be a cooler way of defining resources in a Terraform-like style. In fact, it&#x27;s already helpful as a replacement for HCL in one internal project, that was a final motivation to hack it.In a bigger picture, I have no idea how to help with YAML omnipresence in Kubernetes. More than a half of my problems at a $daily_job is how crude is consolidating a final Helm chart from different sources. I am not saying that Helm would be inherently a bad tool or my company has chosen pretty bad way of using it - I guess everyone is doing their best considering the ciscumstances. But manipulating textual templates with semantic whitespaces is just too error prone, and the detection of errors happens too late.

As an application grows, its configuration expands until it became a programming language, except bug-ridden, underspecified and with terrible ergonomics. The configuration-bankruptcy is declarer and a new configuration format is picked. Rinse, repeat.The format itself is not without blame of course: the more flexible it is, the more easily can be repurposed into a (bad) programming language.Having committed this mistake over and over, these days, I would pick the simplest config format possible (even .ini might be too powerful) for basic configuration, and delegate more complex \"configuration\" to a real programming language (possibly the same language the application is written in). reply throwawaaarrgh 27 minutes agoprevYAML is a data serialization format that was never intended to be written by hand.

They were ugly and not based on any kind of \"principles\" or \"best practice\" or trendy bullshit found on a social media site for nerds. It was just whatever the user found easiest that worked. No standards, just a wonky configuration that worked great for that one program. And guess what?

For an example, see Honey SQL from the Clojure community [0] (though without something to contrast strings like Clojure&#x27;s keywords, you miss out on the automatic parameterization).You mentioned moving JOINs around, so I&#x27;ll mention that if represented as structured data, you can move any of the top level components around, so you could more closely follow the \"true order of SQL\" [1]. For example, I would love to be able to put FROM before SELECT in all or almost all cases. There&#x27;s also being able to share and add to something like a complicated WHERE clause, where essentially all programming languages have built-in facilities for robustly manipulating ordered and associative data compared to string manipulation, which is not well-suited for the task.Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t particularly care for YAML (though it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much), but as someone who&#x27;s done their fair share of programmatic SQL creation and manipulation in strings, not having a native way to represent SQL as data is a mistake in my opinion.0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seancorfield&#x2F;honeysql#big-complicated-exa... 1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jooq.org&#x2F;a-beginners-guide-to-the-true-order-of... reply contravariant 3 hours agorootparentYeah those examples aren&#x27;t really fixing the problem I was referring to, if anything they&#x27;re making it worse.What I was referring to is that &#x27;SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON f(A) = g(B)&#x27; and &#x27;SELECT * FROM B JOIN A ON f(A) = g(B)&#x27; mean exactly the same thing, but this is not obvious from the language.

There are also a lot of cases where people prefer a bit more features like Turing completeness (eg. jsonnet.

And YAML is almost always a configuration format, (so a deserialization format?)Edit:> In computing, serialization (or serialisation) is the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (e.g. files in secondary storage devices, data buffers in primary storage devices) or transmitted (e.g. data streams over computer networks) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment). [Wikipedia]So a serialization format is something a machine generates to store or transmit some internal data structure or state. JSON is an obvious example. YAML on the other hand is a superset of JSON with a lot of different ways to represent the same data. This creates a problem; the serializer has to choose which way to use. But writing YAML is simple, way more than JSON. Built in to YAML there are many things that seem to me to be made for the humans writing the format and not a program serializing to it.

I would propose that we sit together and develop a new standard. Contact in bio. reply unscaled 2 hours agoprevI believe YAML has serious issues and I would not be using it as a configuration format.But I think a lot of the criticism around YAML misses the mark. YAML is not excessively overused as configuration language. It is not dominant like XML was back in its heyday. TOML has a pretty strong mindshare, and many projects are still using JSON or XML. I would pick TOML over YAML any day for this usage, but I still think YAML beats XML and JSON (just think about comments and terrible merge resolution whenever you add an item to an array or an object).But YAML does reign supreme in the world of DevOps-oriented DSLs. YAML is more suited for DSL compared to alternatives, like TOML, JSON, JSON5 or XML:- YAML is the least verbose of all alternatives (especially XML, but even JSON5 and TOML).- YAML requires the least of amount of \"syntax noise\" on top of your DSL. The \"syntax noise\" is mostly limited to indentation, colons, dashes (for arrays), indented text block markers and occasionally quotation marks. JSON, JSON5 and TOML require quoting all string values and explicitly marking arrays and object boundaries, which make the DSL seem less fluent. XML is even worse.- YAML supports indenting multi-line strings, so you can easily embed other formats. This makes adding markdown descriptions (in Swagger&#x2F;OpenAPI) or embedded shell scripts (in YAML-based CI&#x2F;CD DSLs) a breeze.- YAML syntax is hierarchical. The same is true for JSON and XML, but not for TOML. TOML syntax only has two fixed and assymetrical tiers of hierarchy: sections and key-value pairs. Hierarchy can be achieved while parsing, by grouping sections hierarchically, but this is not reflected in the syntax, and this property makes TOML ill-suited for DSLs.Of course, TOML was never meant to be used for DSLs - it&#x27;s was designed as a configuration language, just as JSON was designed to be a simple data exchange format and XML was designed as a document markup language. But if you had to choose any of the format above to base your DSL on, YAML seems like the natural choice.What is the best alternative to YAML then? Probably writing your own parser and removing all unnecessary cruft that you keep to make your DSL fit the YAML straitjacket. And that&#x27;s the real problem, and the real reason why YAML is overused: parsing YAML is easy, but writing your own custom parser is hard.Sure, most languages have at least one easy to use library that lets you implement a basic parser based on PEG or parser combinatorics quite easily. But even then you have to deal with all the fun things like: ambiguities (or lack thereof[1]), the limitations of whatever parsing technique you&#x27;ve chosen, tokenizing newlines and indents and parsing a token tree that is still not as clean and easy to parse as YAML.YAML is still two or three order of magnitudes easier than even writing the simplest parser, so most tool writers pick up it for writing their DSL. This is the age-old \"worse is better\" principle. It is faster and easier to release and iterate on YAML-based tooling, so most projects pick up YAML and the ones that pick up YAML tend to both ship and iterate faster, and then go ahead to capture the market.> IMO if there was something that was substantially better, we would see projects switching to it in a heartbeat.Maybe not in a heartbeat, but I do think most of the \"YAML alternatives\" o",

It's based on an AVR128DB48 which provides 128K bytes of flash memory, and 16K bytes of RAM. There's an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp, using reverse-mounted buttons giving room for large key legends on the PCB. It has a low-power monochrome display, readable in daylight without a backlight, so it's ideal for programming in the garden or on the beach! This gives 10 lines of 41 characters, or graphics with a resolution of 250x122 pixels, supported by several graphics commands. You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. Introduction A few years ago I designed the Lisp Badge, a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you could program in Lisp. Since then I've been thinking about how I could improve it, and made a list of features I'd like to add. On the one hand I wanted it to have a better keyboard, and be low power, powered from a button cell, with an eInk display that you could see in daylight. On the other hand I wanted it to have a colour TFT graphics display, and use a fast 32-bit ARM processor, with support for floating-point arithmetic. I soon realised that these requirements are incompatible in a single design, and so set about designing two different Lisp Badges to meet the two sets of requirements. This Lisp Badge LE (low energy) is the first of those designs, and has the following new features: Processor and memory It’s based on an AVR128DB48 (or AVR128DA48) running at 24MHz, and provides 2800 Lisp objects, about the same as the original Lisp Badge. You can save the entire workspace to flash. Current consumption The Lisp Badge LE draws only 6mA from its CR2032 button cell, and so should have a life of about 40 hours. There’s a physical on/off switch too for long periods of inactivity. Lisp language The Lisp Badge LE runs the AVR version of uLisp which provides 16-bit integer arithmetic, arbitrary length symbols and strings, lists, multi-dimensional arrays, Arduino interface functions, debugging features, and built-in documentation. Display The display is a low-power monochrome graphics display [1] which I explored in an earlier article; see Monochrome Low-Power Display Library. It has a resolution of 250x122 pixels, and a text resolution of 10 lines of 41 characters per line. It supports reading back from the display, which makes it possible to support a full range of graphics functions, including plotting points, drawing lines, drawing outline and filled rectangles circles or triangles, and plotting characters and text at normal size or enlarged by any integer scale factor. Keyboard The keyboard takes advantage of push buttons that mount on the reverse of the board, with the button caps protruding through holes in the PCB. This makes it much easier to use than on the original Lisp Badge because it's easier to press the keys, and there's space for larger key legends. The push buttons are available from Adafruit [2]. or The Pi Hut in the UK [3]. It uses the same 45-key layout as the original Lisp badge, with upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp. However, it now provides an addition META modifier key in addition to SHIFT, allowing you to enter characters that don't have a dedicated key on the keyboard. Peripherals There’s a large piezo speaker that supports playing notes, and a reverse-mounting LED that shines through a hole on the front of the board. Here's the full specification: Lisp Badge – Specification Size: 107mm x 61mm (4.2\" x 2.4\"). Display: 41 characters x 10 lines, or 250 x 122 pixels. Keyboard: Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp. The META key pressed in conjunction with another key gives access to the following characters not available from the main keyboard: META + A C D E P Q T U VCharacter & : $ ! % ? @ ^{ } Memory available: 2800 Lisp cells (11200 bytes). Flash: 16384 bytes of flash are reserved for use to save the Lisp workspace using save-image. Processor: AVR128DB48 Clock speed: 24 MHz. Current consumption: Approx. 6 mA. A CR2032 cell has a typical capacity of 225 mAh, so this should give a life of about 40 hours. Types supported: list, symbol, integer, character, string, stream, and array. An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with \"+\" or \"-\". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42. User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol. There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable. Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.

For a full definition see uLisp Language Reference. Graphics extensions The Lisp Badge LE includes a graphics library to allow you to do plotting on the display; for details see Graphics extensions. These work using a coordinate system with the origin at top left: The following example shows a plot of the fractal Dragon Curve; for the program see Dragon curve: A fractal Dragon Curve drawn in Lisp on the Lisp Badge LE using the graphics extensions. Assembler The Lisp Badge LE also includes an AVR assembler which allows you to generate and run machine-code functions, written in AVR mnemonics, using an assembler written in Lisp. For details see AVR assembler overview. The language includes several extensions specifically for the Lisp Badge, including plot and plot3d, for plotting graphs and 3d functions, and keyboard and check-key for reading the keyboard in real time. For details see Lisp Badge LE extensions. Interfaces These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge LE board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers: Eight analogue input pins using analogread: PD0 to PD7 (22 to 29). VCC, GND, and UPDI. Two analogue outputs using analogwrite: MOSI0 (4) and MISO0 (5). Digital input and output using pinmode, digitalread, and digitalwrite: TX0 (0), RX0 (1), SCL0 (2), SDA0 (3), MOSI0 (4), MISO0 (5), SCK0 (6), and PD0 to PD7 (22 to 29) I2C interface using with-i2c and restart-i2c: SCL0 (2) and SDA0 (3), plus VCC and GND. SPI interface using with-spi: MOSI0 (4), MISO0 (5), and SCK0 (6), plus VCC and GND. Serial interface (FTDI) using with-serial: TX0 (0) and RX0 (1), plus DTR, VCC, and GND. Analogue output PB4 (12) is connected to a piezo speaker, which can use analogwrite or note. The SHIFT (33) and META (11) keys can be used as digital inputs, read with digitalread and referenced as :shift-key and :meta-key. PA7 (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel, referenced as :led-builtin. You can turn it on and off with digitalwrite, or vary its brightness with analogwrite. Entering programs You can enter commands and programs by typing them at the keyboard, and pressing ENTER. A keyboard buffer is provided that buffers a full screen of text, and you can use the DEL key to delete characters and correct typing mistakes. The line editor includes parenthesis matching which automatically highlights matching brackets in inverse video as you type in a program. This makes it much easier to enter a program correctly, and is especially helpful in telling you how many closing brackets to type at the end of defining a function. For example, the following program pulsates the built-in LED slowly on and off: (defun pulse (&optional (up t)) (dotimes (x 256) (analogwrite :led-builtin (if up x (- 255 x))) (delay 8)) (pulse (not up))) It's shown nicely formatted here for clarity, but you can type it in as one continuous line, only pressing ENTER at the end. To run the program type: (pulse) Connecting to a computer You can connect the Lisp Badge to a computer by plugging a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter onto the FTDI connector on the top right of the Lisp Badge, and then connecting this to the computer using a USB cable. You can then use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to enter and edit programs as described in Using uLisp. I used the 3.3V FTDI Basic Breakout from Sparkfun [4]. When using it with the Lisp Badge it powers the Lisp Badge, and so the battery should be left switched off. The circuit Here's the main part of the circuit: Circuit of the Lisp Badge, based on an AVR128DB48 microcontroller. The keyboard arranges the keys in a matrix of four rows and 11 columns: The circuit of the Lisp Badge keyboard matrix. ► Parts list Construction I created a PCB in Eagle, and ordered a set of boards from PCBWay. I chose white PCBs to contrast with the black buttons. The board is the same width as the original Lisp Badge, but slightly taller to accomodate the larger display. After a bit of experimentation I chose a board thickness of 1.2mm. With the standard 1.6mm thick PCB material the reverse-mounted buttons didn't protrude far enough through the holes, and 0.8mm made the boards too bendy, but 1.2mm was ideal. The components, apart from the display, are mounted on the back of the board: The reverse side of the Lisp Badge printed circuit board. The push buttons are mounted at a 15° angle, which makes it possible to pack them closer together. I've taken advantage of the fact that the terminals on each side of the push buttons are connected together to link the rows and columns of the key matrix across the board, and simplify the PCB track layout. A consequence of this is that if one push button is omitted, or has a faulty connection, all the other buttons to its left or below it across the keyboard may not work. Understanding this should help you track down any faulty soldering. The PCB uses 0805 resistors and capacitors. The LED is a reverse-mounting 1206 LED [5] to make the front of the board flush. The board will accommodate either a 16 x 16mm SMD piezo speaker [6], or a 11 x 9mm SMD piezo speaker [7]. The battery holder is an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun [8], or from Proto-PIC in the UK [9]. Note that on many button cells the negative terminal is concave, and doesn't make good contact with the pad on the PCB. I therefore recommend melting some solder on the circular PCB contact to provide extra thickness before mounting the battery holder. The display is held in place with a double-sided self-adhesive foam pad, and then soldered to the board with the seven header pins. There are also four mounting holes if you prefer to use screw mounting. I recommend leaving the display uninstalled until you have tested the rest of the board, because it's likely to be sensitive to overheating. I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 275°C to solder the small SMD components and push buttons, and then used a conventional soldering iron for the display, battery holder, switch, piezo speaker, and connectors. The PCB has space for a 5 x 3.2mm 32.768kHz crystal and its capacitors which you could use with the RTC peripheral to provide accurate timekeeping. However, I didn't fit it on the prototype as the internal clock is already pretty accurate. The program The Lisp Badge program is based on the code for the AVR version of uLisp Version 4.4 (see Download uLisp), with the addition of routines to handle the display and keyboard, and the plot extensions. Display The display routine is based on the routine I developed for the display in my project Monochrome Low-Power Display Library. The display driver is the ST7302 [10], and it shares some similarities with the ST7735 used for colour TFT displays. Here's the display layout: The display is divided into 11 lines, each of which is 12 pixels high, and 125 columns, each of which is 2 pixels wide. Note that because 122 isn't an exact multiple of 12, only part of the last line actually appears on the display. Unlike on the colour TFT displays each pixel isn't individually addressable; in fact, the minimum update is to write three bytes to the display, which defines the state of a block of 2x12 pixels corresponding to one column and one row. Fortunately the display supports reading back the display memory, so it's not necessary to maintain a copy of the display in RAM to do things like line drawing; instead, to set a single pixel we can read the 2x12 block, change one pixel, and write it back. Reading from the display The routine ReadBlock() reads a 12x2 pixel block from the display memory specified by the column, from 0 to 124, and the line, from 0 to 10: uint32_t ReadBlock (uint8_t column, uint8_t line) { uint32_t pix = 0; PORT_TOGGLE(1>mosi & 1); PORT_TOGGLE(1>16); Data(block>>8); Data(block); PORT_TOGGLE(1<<cs); } Scrolling The display doesn't provide hardware scrolling in the vertical direction, so scrolling is done in software by calling ScrollDisplay(), which uses the ReadBlock() and PlotBlock() routines: void ScrollDisplay () { uint32_t block, block2; for (uint8_t x = 0; x < Columns*3; x++) { block = ReadBlock(x, 0); for (uint8_t y = 1; y < Lines; y++) { block2 = ReadBlock(x, y); if (block2 != block) { // Optimisation if already the same PlotBlock(block2, x, y-1); block = block2; } } } ClearLine(LastLine); } The routine optimises the scrolling by only writing blocks when necessary if they have been changed by the scrolling. Keyboard The keyboard uses the AVR128DB48's Timer/Counter TCB3 to generate an interrupt at about 250Hz. Each call of the interrupt service routine takes the next column low in the keyboard matrix, and it then tests to see if any of the four row inputs has been pulled low by the pressing of a push button. If so, the button's position is looked up in the key table Keymap[] to translate it to the ASCII code of the key. This also takes into account the state of the SHIFT and META keys, which are connected to dedicated inputs. A keyboard buffer buffers a full screen of text, so you can use the DEL key to delete characters and correct typing mistakes. The line editor includes parenthesis matching which automatically highlights matching brackets in inverse video as you type in a program. Installing a bootloader To program the Lisp Badge I recommend using Spence Konde's DxCore on GitHub. The first step is to install a bootloader using a UPDI programmer. I used a SerialUPDI programmer, based on a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter. Because the display is only tolerant of 3.3V you should power the Lisp Badge from 3.3V while programming, or do the programming before connecting the display to the board. Choose the AVR DB-series (Optiboot) option under the DxCore heading on the Board option on the Tools menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (leave other options at their defaults): Chip: \"AVR128DB48\" Clock Speed: \"24MHz internal\" Bootloader Serial Port (Bootloader burn req'd): \"USART0 (default pins): TX PA0, RX PA1\" Set the Programmer option as appropriate for the UPDI programmer you are using. Then choose Burn Bootloader. Uploading the Lisp Badge code The next step is to install the Lisp Badge code via the serial connection, using the bootloader you have just installed. Plug a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter into the FTDI connector on the PCB. I used the SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout [11]. Leave the DxCore options set as described above, and choose the USB port from the Port submenu. Then choose Upload from the Sketch menu to upload uLisp. Note that this stage will fail if you didn't set the Bootloader Serial Port correctly in the previous step, and you'll need to go back and repeat that step with the correct setting. You should then be able to choose Serial Monitor from the Tools menu in the Arduino IDE, and type Lisp commands at the uLisp prompt.

Peer-Reviewed Publication MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IMAGE: MIT RESEARCHERS HAVE DESIGNED A NEW SOLAR DESALINATION SYSTEM THAT TAKES IN SALTWATER AND HEATS IT WITH NATURAL SUNLIGHT. THE SYSTEM FLUSHES OUT ACCUMULATED SALT, SO REPLACEMENT PARTS AREN’T NEEDED OFTEN, MEANING THE SYSTEM COULD POTENTIALLY PRODUCE DRINKING WATER AT A RATE AND PRICE THAT IS CHEAPER THAN TAP WATER. view more CREDIT: CREDIT: JINTONG GAO AND ZHENYUAN XU Engineers at MIT and in China are aiming to turn seawater into drinking water with a completely passive device that is inspired by the ocean, and powered by the sun. In a paper appearing today in the journal Joule, the team outlines the design for a new solar desalination system that takes in saltwater and heats it with natural sunlight. The configuration of the device allows water to circulate in swirling eddies, in a manner similar to the much larger “thermohaline” circulation of the ocean. This circulation, combined with the sun’s heat, drives water to evaporate, leaving salt behind. The resulting water vapor can then be condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate through and out of the device, rather than accumulating and clogging the system. The new system has a higher water-production rate and a higher salt-rejection rate than all other passive solar desalination concepts currently being tested. The researchers estimate that if the system is scaled up to the size of a small suitcase, it could produce about 4 to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years before requiring replacement parts. At this scale and performance, the system could produce drinking water at a rate and price that is cheaper than tap water. “For the first time, it is possible for water, produced by sunlight, to be even cheaper than tap water,” says Lenan Zhang, a research scientist in MIT’s Device Research Laboratory. The team envisions a scaled-up device could passively produce enough drinking water to meet the daily requirements of a small family. The system could also supply off-grid, coastal communities where seawater is easily accessible. Zhang’s study co-authors include MIT graduate student Yang Zhong, and Evelyn Wang, the Ford Professor of Engineering, along with Jintong Gao, Jinfang You, Zhanyu Ye, Ruzhu Wang, and Zhenyuan Xu of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. A powerful convection The team’s new system improves on their previous design — a similar concept of multiple layers, called stages. Each stage contained an evaporator and a condenser that used heat from the sun to passively separate salt from incoming water. That design, which the team tested on the roof of an MIT building, efficiently converted the sun’s energy to evaporate water, which was then condensed into drinkable water. But the salt that was left over quickly accumulated as crystals that clogged the system after a few days. In a real-world setting, a user would have to place stages on a frequent basis, which would significantly increase the system’s overall cost. In a follow-up effort, they devised a solution with a similar layered configuration, this time with an added feature that helped to circulate the incoming water as well as any leftover salt. While this design prevented salt from settling and accumulating on the device, it desalinated water at a relatively low rate. In the latest iteration, the team believes it has landed on a design that achieves both a high water-production rate, and high salt rejection, meaning that the system can quickly and reliably produce drinking water for an extended period. The key to their new design is a combination of their two previous concepts: a multistage system of evaporators and condensers, that is also configured to boost the circulation of water — and salt — within each stage. “We introduce now an even more powerful convection, that is similar to what we typically see in the ocean, at kilometer-long scales,” Xu says. The small circulations generated in the team’s new system is similar to the “thermohaline” convection in the ocean — a phenomenon that drives the movement of water around the world, based on differences in sea temperature (“thermo”) and salinity (“haline”). “When seawater is exposed to air, sunlight drives water to evaporate. Once water leaves the surface, salt remains. And the higher the salt concentration, the denser the liquid, and this heavier water wants to flow downward,” Zhang explains. “By mimicking this kilometer-wide phenomena in small box, we can take advantage of this feature to reject salt.” Tapping out The heart of the team’s new design is a single stage that resembles a thin box, topped with a dark material that efficiently absorbs the heat of the sun. Inside, the box is separated into a top and bottom section. Water can flow through the top half, where the ceiling is lined with an evaporator layer that uses the sun’s heat to warm up and evaporate any water in direct contact. The water vapor is then funneled to the bottom half of the box, where a condensing layer air-cools the vapor into salt-free, drinkable liquid. The researchers set the entire box at a tilt within a larger, empty vessel, then attached a tube from the top half of the box down through the bottom of the vessel, and floated the vessel in saltwater. In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through. The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging. The team built several prototypes, with one, three, and 10 stages, and tested their performance in water of varying salinity, including natural seawater and water that was seven times saltier. From these tests, the researchers calculated that if each stage were scaled up to a square meter, it would produce up to 5 liters of drinking water per hour, and that the system could desalinate water without accumulating salt for several years. Given this extended lifetime, and the fact that the system is entirely passive, requiring no electricity to run, the team estimates that the overall cost of running the system would be cheaper than what it costs to produce tap water in the United States. “We show that this device is capable of achieving a long lifetime,” Zhong says. “That means that, for the first time, it is possible for drinking water produced by sunlight to be cheaper than tap water. This opens up the possibility for solar desalination to address real-world problems.” Funding for the research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China. ### Written by Jennifer Chu, MIT News JOURNAL Joule DOI 10.1016/j.joule.2023.08.012 ARTICLE TITLE Extreme salt-resisting multistage solar distillation with thermohaline convection ARTICLE PUBLICATION DATE 27-Sep-2023 Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

    "commentBody": "Desalination system could produce fresh water that is cheaper than tap waterHacker NewspastloginDesalination system could produce fresh water that is cheaper than tap water (eurekalert.org) 209 points by geox 23 hours ago| hidepastfavorite133 comments mixedmath 22 hours agoThis sounded pretty strong to me, so I did a quick napkin-math check of feasibility (in short - it passed the napkin check).On a sunny day, total solar energy hitting the top of the atmosphere gives about 1360 watts per square meter (source - top result from google, something something NASA). It takes about 4.184 joules to raise one ml of water by 1 degree celsius. Let&#x27;s suppose that the \"suitcase\" proposed in the article has 1 square meter of space (a pretty large suitcase) and is able to capture 100 percent of solar energy (unreasonably effective). Then pure solar energy-wise, there is enough energy to raise 325 ml of water by one degree of celsius per second in a square meter. If the water is, say, at 16 degrees (the temperature of the ocean near me), in would take 84 seconds to bring 325 ml of water to boiling temperature. To transform boiling water to steam, each ml of water takes an additional 2257 joules. In 540 seconds, the 325 ml of water is now converted to steam.In total, it has taken 624 seconds to steamify 325 ml of water (under very optimistic circumstances). Morally one could do this almost 6 times in an hour, giving approximately 2 litres of water per hour.(Edit): Looking a bit closer, I see that the article&#x27;s description of their work suggests that they recapture some of the energy from condensing the steam back into water. I didn&#x27;t account for this. Even a moderate amount of recapture changes the math very favorably.This makes me suspect that their claim of 4-6 liters per hour would require a rather large \"suitcase\"-sized device, but is within the ballpark of reason. reply PaulKeeble 22 hours agoparentSolar heaters are remarkably efficient, well above 95%. Solar water heaters are really quite efficient so there is no particular reason why with the right coatings such a device wont get quite close. Its actually surprisingly easy to make a solar water boiler and they aren&#x27;t expensive. People heat pools with DIY water heaters.If heating water is the goal then going directly to heating the water is more than 4x the power capture of a solar panel. Dropping one solar panel on your roof for a water heater pays off its just that the solar heaters are kind of expensive dealing with all the other aspects, like if the pump fails or its too cold and the water would freeze etc etc. Those other aspects are probably going to dominate the complexity and cost of the devices. reply bertil 18 hours agorootparentI’ve always wondered how hard it would be to have standard solar panels water-cooled and use that heat for hot water storage. reply PaulKeeble 17 hours agorootparentThe main problem is the expected lifetime (and payout periods) of the two parts. Cooling solar panels brings more efficiency so it feels like a reasonable fit, cool the panels and get hot water. Its less efficient water heating because the panels aren&#x27;t the ideal coating but they do still get quite hot and a few of them can definitely do the job. The big mismatch is in life.A solar thermal heater typically lasts 10 years, its a pretty harsh environment and they have pumps and expansion vessels and water in the heat range of -25 through +80 C is just damaging over time. Where as a solar panel has a rated 80% output at 25 years. That mismatch is problematic for Solar panel payoff, 10 years is only just past break even point. Whereas the solar thermal heaters typically pay off within a few years so the reduced lifetime isn&#x27;t such a big problem (but both are driven by local gas and electrical prices).Companies are trying to do this better and products exist to do it. The added installation complexity and reduced expected lifetime are all a bit of an issue. Currently I suspect most people are better off with a dedicated solar heater and solar panels separately, at least for now until the water channels in the panels at least are reliable enough that they meet the panel lifetime and then the pump is installed in the roof cavity so its cheap and easy to replace. Work still needs to be done to work out the details and make the parts that fail easily swappable. reply danans 16 hours agorootparent> Currently I suspect most people are better off with a dedicated solar heater and solar panels separatelyRight now most people are better off (from a total cost of ownership perspective) with PV panels + heat pump water heater. The latter can achieve a COP of 3.0 (300% \"efficiency\"), and also can just use grid electricity on a cloudy day. Unless you are off-grid, the additional cost&#x2F;complexity of running plumbing to the roof for a solar water heater doesn&#x27;t pencil out. reply zbrozek 10 hours agorootparentWhere are you finding COP for water heaters? The best I found was a field study by the Canadian government where it seemed like most units operating in ambient temperatures relevant for me (in central California) get about 2.5. reply danans 8 hours agorootparentThe COP is roughly equivalent (but more forgiving) than the UEF rating. Many new heat pump water heaters have a UEF of 4 [1], but this accounts for things like standby losses, so the COP of the heat pump itself is higher than that.Some premium hot water heaters like the SanCO2 can achieve COP of up to 5.0 [2], so high that they don&#x27;t need backup resistance elements, even in northern climates.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energystar.gov&#x2F;productfinder&#x2F;product&#x2F;certified-w...2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smallplanetsupply.com&#x2F;small-planet-blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;1&#x2F;7... reply azornathogron 18 hours agorootparentprevYou can buy such things.

They also have a “cool pond” cooled using a heat pump to just above freezing.The combination of the heat and cold reservoirs are used to run a turbine with a low boiling point fluid.Obviously with the low temperature differentials it’s not terribly thermally efficient, but the proponents claimed the cost of electricity combined with the storage will make it viable in sunny locations.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raygen.com&#x2F; reply colechristensen 18 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is you want your hot water much hotter than your solar panels so there may be limited use for this compared to a traditional solar water heater. reply hinkley 17 hours agorootparentHeat pump water heaters exist. I would think running a warm water source past one would increase the efficiency since it lowers the delta-T reply adrianmonk 19 hours agoparentprevCan&#x27;t you boost the efficiency by using heat recovery?The steam is very hot, and the condensed fresh water is also pretty hot. You can use a heat exchanger to transfer this heat into your 16°C ocean water, preheating it so the sun doesn&#x27;t have to do all the work.This wouldn&#x27;t mean magically getting free energy. Your output fresh water would otherwise be really hot, and that&#x27;s where the energy comes from.Obviously there are limits. If you have 100°C fresh water coming out and 16°C ocean water going in, a heat exchanger will at best average their temperatures to 58°C. You could in theory overcome this with a heat pump, but that&#x27;s pretty elaborate.(I&#x27;m not trying to design the perfect desalination system here. The point is there may be some easy efficiency wins.) reply e44858 19 hours agorootparentA countercurrent heat exchanger could transfer up to 99% of the heat from the steam to the ocean water: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Countercurrent_exchange reply bertil 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s obviously the way to go, but… Where does the 99% come from? reply Faaak 18 hours agorootparentThe theoretical efficiency could almost reach 1 with an infinite tube. In practice I&#x27;ve seen ~80%. reply hinkley 17 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds to me like the &#x27;condenser&#x27; is perhaps wrapped around the water intake. reply nighmi 15 hours agorootparentprevDo we want to heat up the oceans that much though? reply dwattttt 14 hours agorootparentI believe the heat is being transferred to the ocean water entering the desalination process, which reduces the energy required for desalination, so no transfer of heat to the ocean itself. reply delecti 16 hours agorootparentprevA simple system can do much better than the average. Picture the water flowing in a \"U\", with the hottest water at the bend. The coldest incoming water is warmed just a bit by the coldest outgoing water, then the slightly warmer incoming water is warmed by water a bit further upstream from the output. Carry that logic through and you recapture the heat with a fairly simple system (give or take longer pipes to let enough heat exchange happen). reply Dylan16807 19 hours agorootparentprevA multi-stage or continuous heat exchanger can transfer a lot more than half the heat. reply m463 19 hours agorootparentprevif you can do it at lower pressure, boiling and evaporation happen at a lower temperature. reply bertil 18 hours agorootparentGood idea, but it probably makes a very cheap system more expensive — kitchen-equipment expensive. reply o0banky0o 22 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think they are boiling it. It read to me like they&#x27;re just evaporating the water in some efficient way, rather than boiling.What would the math look like if they aren&#x27;t necessarily going to boil? reply AlexandrB 21 hours agorootparentBoiling is just evaporating water rapidly. No matter what you do, you need to put the same amount of energy in to convert some mass of water to vapor. Any efficiency gains would be in how you get this energy into the water (electric element vs. directly heated by the sun) not in the energy required. reply jjk166 20 hours agorootparentTechnically evaporation takes less energy than boiling as your product is ambient temperature water vapor instead of hot water vapor. You also don&#x27;t have to replace heat lost to the environment by the hot water and steam during the boiling process. The difference can be lessened by good insulation and heat regeneration, but they still can&#x27;t be perfect.Of course on the flip side, your goal is fresh liquid water, so you need to condense the vapor. Condensing hot vapor is easy, just expose it to cooler ambient conditions. Condensing ambient vapor is harder, and will require you to run something like a refrigeration cycle or a chemical desiccant system which will need energy to be regenerated.Most commercial systems use vacuum distillation which boils water at low temperatures and pressures, which has its own drawbacks but is generally more efficient. reply AlexandrB 20 hours agorootparentFair enough. I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is that the heat of vaporization sets a lower bound for how much energy you need to add, regardless of whether you boil the water or evaporate it. reply DoctorOetker 17 hours agorootparentYou are correct that at ambient temperatures there is an ultimate lower bound for energy.You are incorrect that at ambient temperature the lower energy bound is set by the latent heat of vaporisation, as others have pointed out this is theoretically recoverable.At ambient temperature there is however still a fundamental physical limit: the solvation energy of the salt in the water: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solvation#Solvation_energy_and...Now the whole globe does not have the same ambient temperature, and as you know about global warming it would be great to shed some energy in the form of heat.There are many forms of desalination. Another way to desalinate is freezing: when salty water freezes, it pushes out the salt, so while desalinated water ice forms, the liquid water surrounding the ice will increase in salinity and become brine. One could then use simple nets or grills to separate ice from brine.Suppose one has a space elevator, or even a tether from a balloon, but capable of carrying significant weight.The temperature falls roughly adiabatically with height. Above the tropopause the atmosphere is essentially cloud-free, CO2 free and below freezing point (say -60 deg C). Hence the latent heat of fusion (freezing) can be shed to outer space. So it should be possible to lift salty water up an elevator, allow it to freeze over, separate brine from ice at the top, then lower the separated brine and ice.The energy required to lift the brackish water is compensated by the energy released by lowering the freeze-distilled water and brine. What comes up must go down, so simplistically speaking a pulley in equilibrium, so that the only energy intentionally exerted is lost to pulley and air friction. Then one would be cooling the planet and receiving frozen freeze-distilled water at the same time.The law of conservation of misery is typically not a fundamental law of nature, but imposed by reluctance to study of those who dictate artificial laws. reply mannykannot 18 hours agorootparentprevI just found out that the latent heat of evaporation itself decreases with increasing temperature and disappears at the critical temperature [1].With regard to the energy expenditure for reaching that temperature: if we were merely raising the temperature of the water and then cooling it down again, I think it would be correct to say that with a completely efficient contra-flow heat exchanger, perfect insulation, and no pumping losses, the steady-state heat input could be arbitrarily low.If we now modify this system to evaporate and then condense some of the water at the point of highest temperature, we would have to supply, and then extract, the latent heat at whatever temperature the evaporation is performed at. Once that has been performed, the outflow would comprise of the same amount of water as before (and at the same temperature), and it would be equally available to warm up the incoming stream as in the initial scenario (though now we would need two heat exchangers in order to keep the fresh water separate.)Of course, both the heat exchanger and the insulation will have losses, but we are rejecting quite a bit of heat in the condenser, and it is at the highest temperature in the system. Would that, in principle, be available to make up for any losses elsewhere? This makes me wonder if, counter-intuitively, it could be more efficient to do the distillation at higher temperatures, at least up to the point where the diminishing latent heat can no longer compensate for the losses of running at a higher temperature?I&#x27;m leaving out some considerations that I don&#x27;t know how to handle (and probably others that have not occurred to me.) For one thing, there&#x27;s the question of what happens if the evaporation occurs into a chamber containing some air, rather than just steam (my guess is that the relevant temperature is determined by the water vapor partial pressure.) For another, what difference does having salt dissolved in the water make? And this may all be moot, as this system has no moving parts, so the pressure is probably atmospheric (or somewhat below, if the condensation can be exploited to create a partial vacuum.)I have no idea if any of this makes the slightest bit of sense, and it&#x27;s probably wrong - as you say, most systems run at reduced pressure.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;water-properties-d_1573.h... reply jjk166 15 hours agorootparentThe latent heat of vaporization decreases, but the amount it decreases by is the same amount of heat you need to put in to raise the water to that temperature. You&#x27;re still trying to do the same thing - overcome the intermolecular bonds, but at higher temperatures you&#x27;ve already invested most of the energy you need to do so.With perfect insulation and heat recovery (zero loss) all that matters is the change in entropy between the starting and end products. Both the energy for raising the temperature and for the vaporization is theoretically recoverable (when you condense a vapor back to a liquid it releases the same amount of heat that it took to vaporize it). But you can&#x27;t have perfect insulation and heat recovery in practice, and the losses become worse with increasing temperature - or more accurately increasing temperature difference, so trying to cool things down below ambient won&#x27;t help you either. reply mannykannot 2 hours agorootparent> The latent heat of vaporization decreases, but the amount it decreases by is the same amount of heat you need to put in to raise the water to that temperature.I Don&#x27;t think that can be right - for example, at 18 °C, the isobaric specific heat of water is 4.18 kJ&#x2F;(kg.K), while the rate of change of the latent heat with temperature is only 2.4 kJ&#x2F;(kg.K), and at 100 °C, the figures are 4.22 kJ&#x2F;(kg.K) and 2.7 kJ&#x2F;(kg.K) respectively.> Both the energy for raising the temperature and for the vaporization is theoretically recoverable (when you condense a vapor back to a liquid it releases the same amount of heat that it took to vaporize it).Only up to a point: you cannot condense steam at 100 °C in a condenser where the incoming coolant is also at 100 °C. Using only passive methods (heat exchangers) you cannot, even assuming perfect efficiency, recover all of the heat needed in a distillation process for reuse within that distillation process.While distilling at higher temperatures need not be anywhere near as inefficient as it seems if you don&#x27;t include the use of heat exchangers, the numbers given above don&#x27;t seem different enough to justify distilling at a higher temperature than necessary, under realistic assumptions of efficiency, which is not surprising, given that it does not seem to be done. reply trashtester 2 minutes agorootparentOne way to bring the recovered energy higher could be to use some of the steam energy to drive a steam engine (with most still used in a heat exchanger). The steam engine, in turn, can provide at least some of the power needed to take the sea water in the last stage past 100°C. hinkley 17 hours agorootparentprevIf your water source is cooler than ambient air, is that still a problem?If it works less well on cool days, well you don&#x27;t need as much water on cool days as you do on hot ones. reply jjk166 15 hours agorootparentAmbient here is referring to the temperature of the water. The hotter the air is, the higher the partial pressure of water can be, meaning you need to take even more heat out to get it to condense. reply PicassoCTs 21 hours agorootparentprevUltrasound would do it without boiling? reply abakker 20 hours agorootparentUltrasonic \"steam\" tends to aerosolize the total dissolved solids.

During my brief patent career, I wrote the patents for a distillation system where the main elements involved heating water that was distributed across rotating blades (heat + surface area + air movement) to evaporate the water.

Water evaporates in the air at any temperature; it’s faster when the water is warm, and the air is warm and dry. Technically, that’s boiling, even if it’s not exactly like how your kettle does it.Essentially, they find an equilibrium between the cold water coming in, warming in the sun, an increasing amount evaporating into the warm, damp chamber, and the remaining brackish water being cooled by the new water. reply Izkata 21 hours agorootparentprevFrom some quick searches, it looks like 2257 J the energy used by the phase transition, so that part will probably be the same. reply scotty79 21 hours agorootparentprevThermodynamics can&#x27;t be cheated.

In the 2020-2021 year, Melbourne Water delivered 439 billion liters (116 billion gallons) of fresh water[1]. That is roughly 318 million gallons of water consumption on an average day. What kind of drought would reduce the available water from 318 million gallons to 25 million gallons per day?Personal consumption (drinking, showering, household washing) is not the primary driver of water use. In general, it is dominated by agriculture, and to a lesser extent by industry. The economics of these activities would not permit an order of magnitude increase in the cost of fresh water.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.melbournewater.com.au&#x2F;media&#x2F;18976&#x2F;download reply Veserv 16 hours agorootparentYou missed a zero. 5 million people by 50 gallons&#x2F;day is 250 million gallons&#x2F;day. So they only missed by ~25%.Australia uses a estimated ~16T liters of water per year [1] for all uses including personal and agricultural. That is 16M ML * 600 AUD&#x2F;ML for a total of ~10B AUD.Australia has a population of ~25M. So that is ~400 AUD&#x2F;person to completely replace all water usage in Australia. As Australia is a island, I assume they do most of their own agriculture, so for additional 400 AUD on their food bill a year they never need to worry about a drought ever again.The Australian government appears to have a budget of ~500B&#x2F;year which is around 25% of GDP [2].

Domestic use is a tiny fraction of all water usage. However, as you point out it is necessary to incorporate the food water to determine actual water independence.600 AUD&#x2F;ML is ~400 USD&#x2F;ML.

The real question is whether it is cheaper to set up a solar-thermal desalinator, or set up solar panels that can power more efficient desalination methods.Solar panels are cheap and getting cheaper quickly as there is an incredible economy of scale. While desalination systems could likewise be mass produced, there will never be as large a demand for that one specific application of solar power as for general solar power. Further, photovoltaics are reasonably simple solid state devices which are well suited to mass production. I am highly skeptical a priori that a solar thermal system could compete on economic terms. Perhaps in a space confined situation it makes sense, but it&#x27;s tough to run out of space in the ocean. reply PaulKeeble 19 hours agoparentA Solar thermal system will definitely out perform using solar panels to produce heat. A typical commercial solar panel is only 23% efficient whereas solar heaters are above 95%. With 4x the energy for the same area and a lot less sophisticated technology there is little doubt heating the water directly is better. But like with all desalination its a relatively slow process that leaks a bunch of material behind that damages everything and the costs will be dominated by all those other aspects not just where it gets its energy from. reply jjk166 15 hours agorootparentYou get 4 times the energy per unit area, but if it costs more than 4 times more per unit area, the photovoltaics win.

Either way even if the third port was effectively Sigma-Aldrich 100% pure H20, the simple fix would be to dilute a tiny amount of the brine into the distilled water to restore the mineral content to potable levels.You did not reference the study or page of the supposed WHO conclusion.When I was studying at university I recalled the concensus basically being that the adverse health effects are a myth, since 95% of our salt intake comes from food.Remember sailors have been drinking distilled water for over a hundred years.Steamboats needed the ability to desalinate water anyway.It is quite conceivable, that this myth starts as a counter-myth for a prior myth.Scientifically different types of desalinated, deionized and distilled waters are closer to pure H2O than normal waters.Linguistically pure is the antonym of impure.The mere existence of distilled or pure water in the scientific literature conceivably caused purity zealots to opt for drinking distilled waters, falsely claiming health benefits.Just like taking 10x vitamin C doses will not make you 10x healthier, neither would drinking distilled water. But it \"sounds\" purer.In order to counteract obsessions about drinking distilled water, and to counter the false and disinformative claims of health benefits, some started opting to use the same tactics and weapons to stop the \"pure water zealots\", and the countery-myth is born.That was my interpretation at university. So it surprises me to learn that WHO would recommend against drinking distilled water.Of course only drinking distilled water would not be healthy indeed: you also need to eat, breathe, etc.So I first did the easy check: wikipedia.On wikipedia the same vague statement of the WHO concluding something along the lines of it being unhealthy is reiterated, but with a [citation needed] appended.

    "originBody": "The Tao of Programming Translated by Geoffrey James Note: I copied this from http://misspiggy.gsfc.nasa.gov/tao.html and stripped out all of the IMHO extraneous formatting. ---Alex BOOK 1 The Silent Void Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave.\" 1.1 Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming. If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great. If the compiler is great, then the application is great. The user is pleased, and there is harmony in the world. The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning. 1.2 The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler. The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages. Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao. But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it. 1.3 In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time. Therefore Space and Time are the Yin and Yang of programming. Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of time and space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals. How could it be otherwise? 1.4 The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it. If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao. The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. Even a perfect program still has bugs. BOOK 2 The Ancient Masters Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.\" 2.1 The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance. Aware, like a fox crossing the water. Alert, like a general on the battlefield. Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves. Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds? The answer exists only in Tao. 2.2 The Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke, he exclaimed: \"I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!\" 2.3 A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: \"What sort of programmers work for other companies? They behaved badly and were unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed our hospitality suite and they made rude noises during my presentation.\" The manager said: \"I should have never sent you to the conference. Those programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life absurd, an accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing limitations. Without a care, they live only for their programs. Why should they bother with social conventions? They are alive within the Tao.\" 2.4 A novice asked the Master: \"Here is a programmer that never designs, documents or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world. Why is this?\" The Master replied: \"That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.\" BOOK 3 Design Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"When a program is being tested, it is too late to make design changes.\" 3.1 There once was a man who went to a computer trade show. Each day as he entered, the man told the guard at the door: \"I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.\" This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully. But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself. When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes, but nothing was to be found. On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the guard, saying: \"I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even better.\" So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail. On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his curiosity no longer. \"Sir Thief,\" he said, \"I am so perplexed, I cannot live in peace. Please enlighten me. What is it that you are stealing?\" The man smiled. \"I am stealing ideas,\" he said. 3.2 There once was a Master Programmer who wrote unstructured programs. A novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write unstructured programs. When the novice asked the Master to evaluate his progress, the Master criticized him for writing unstructured programs, saying, \"What is appropriate for the Master is not appropriate for the novice. You must understand Tao before transcending structure.\" 3.3 There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu. The warlord asked the programmer: \"Which is easier to design: an accounting package or an operating system?\" \"An operating system,\" replied the programmer. The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. \"Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system,\" he said. \"Not so,\" said the programmer, \"When designing an accounting package, the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design.\" The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. \"That is all good and well, but which is easier to debug?\" The programmer made no reply. 3.4 A manager went to the Master Programmer and showed him the requirements document for a new application. The manager asked the Master: \"How long will it take to design this system if I assign five programmers to it?\" \"It will take one year,\" said the Master promptly. \"But we need this system immediately or even sooner! How long will it take if I assign ten programmers to it?\" The Master Programmer frowned. \"In that case, it will take two years.\" \"And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?\" The Master Programmer shrugged. \"Then the design will never be completed,\" he said. BOOK 4 Coding Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"A well-written program is its own Heaven; a poorly-written program is its own Hell.\" 4.1 A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a string of pearls. The spirit and intent of the program should be retained throughout. There should be neither too little nor too much. Neither needless loops nor useless variables; neither lack of structure nor overwhelming rigidity. A program should follow the \"Law of Least Astonishment\". What is this law? It is simply that the program should always respond to the users in the way that least astonishes them. A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit. The program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward appearances. If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of disorder and confusion. The only way to correct this is to rewrite the program. 4.2 A novice asked the Master: \"I have a program that sometimes runs and sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am totally baffled. What is the reason for this?\" The Master replied: \"You are confused because you do not understand Tao. Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans. Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed? Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect. The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal. Therefore, you must contemplate Tao before you receive Enlightenment.\" \"But how will I know when I have received Enlightenment?\" asked the novice. \"Your program will run correctly,\" replied the Master. 4.3 The Master was explaining the nature of Tao to one of his novices. \"The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how insignificant,\" said the Master. \"Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?\" asked the novice. \"It is,\" came the reply. \"Is the Tao in a video game?\" asked the novice. \"It is even in a video game,\" said the Master. \"Is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?\" asked the novice. The Master coughed and shifted his position slightly. \"The lesson is over for today,\" he said. 4.4 Prince Wang's programmer was coding software. His fingers danced upon the keyboard. The program compiled without and error message, and the program ran like a gentle wind. \"Excellent!\" the Prince exclaimed. \"Your technique is faultless!\" \"Technique?\" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, \"What I follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years, I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off.\" Prince Wang said, \"Would that all of my programmers were as wise!\" BOOK 5 Maintenance Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to be maintained.\" 5.1 A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges. A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant. A deer blends perfectly into the forest colors. Software rots if not used. These are great mysteries. 5.2 A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the program on which he was working. \"I will be finished tomorrow,\" the programmer promptly replied. \"I think you are being unrealistic,\" said the manager, \"Truthfully, how long will it take?\" The programmer thought for a moment. \"I have some features that I wish to add. This will take at least two weeks,\" he finally said. \"Even that is too much to expect,\" insisted the manager, \"I will be satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.\" The programmer agreed to this. Several years later, the manager retired. On the way to his retirement luncheon, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal. He had been programming all night. 5.3 A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial package. The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his Master reviewed his program, he discovered it contained a screen editor, a set of generalized graphics routines, and an artificial intelligence interface, but not the slightest hint of anything financial. When the Master asked about this, the novice became indignant. \"Don't be so impatient,\" he said, \"I'll put in the financial stuff eventually.\" 5.4 Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted? Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student? Does a good father allow a single child to starve? Does a good programmer refuse to maintain his code? BOOK 6 Management Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"Let the programmers be many and the managers few -- then all will be productive.\" 6.1 When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games. When accountants speak of quarterly profits, the development budget is about to be cut. When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds are about to roll in. Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming. When managers make commitments, game programs are ignored. When accountants make long-range plans, harmony and order are about to be restored. When senior scientists address the problems at hand, the problems will soon be solved. Truly, this is the Tao of Programming. 6.2 Why are programmers non-productive? Because their time is wasted in meetings. Why are programmers rebellious? Because the management interferes too much. Why are the programmers resigning one by one? Because they are burnt out. Having worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs. 6.3 A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him wrote a new program that became popular and sold well. As a result, the manager retained his job. The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer refused it, saying, \"I wrote the program because I thought it was an interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward.\" The manager upon hearing this remarked, \"This programmer, though he holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an employee. Let us promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!\" But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, \"I exist so that I can program. If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste everyone's time. Can I go now? I have a program that I am working on.\" 6.4 A manager went to his programmers and told them: \"As regards to your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave at five in the afternoon.\" At this, all of them became angry and several resigned on the spot. So the manager said: \"All right, in that case you may set your own working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule.\" The programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the wee hours of the morning. BOOK 7 Corporate Wisdom Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but you can't make him computer literate.\" 7.1 A novice asked the Master: \"In the East, there is a great tree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural entity exist?\" The Master replied: \"You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?\" 7.2 In the East there is a shark which is larger than all other fish. It changes into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky. When this bird moves across the land, it brings a message from Corporate Headquarters. This message it drops into the midst of the programmers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach. Then the bird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns home. The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands it not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears its message. The Master Programmer continues to work at his terminal, unaware that the bird has come and gone. 7.3 The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the Master Programmer to examine. The Magician wheeled a large black box into the Master's office while the Master waited in silence. \"This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,\" began the Magician, \"ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of the art user interfaces. It took my assistants several hundred man years to construct. Is it not amazing?\" The Master Programmer raised his eyebrows slightly. \"It is indeed amazing,\" he said. \"Corporate Headquarters has commanded,\" continued the Magician, \"that everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs. Do you agree to this?\" \"Certainly,\" replied the Master. \"I will have it transported to the Data Center immediately!\" And the Magician returned to his tower, well pleased. Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the Master Programmer and said, \"I cannot find the listing for my new program. Do you know where it might be?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Master, \"the listings are stacked on the platform in the Data Center.\" 7.4 The Master Programmer moves from program to program without fear. No change in management can harm him. He will not be fired, even if the project is cancelled. Why is this? He is filled with Tao. BOOK 8 Hardware and Software Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software hardware is useless.\" 8.1 A novice asked the Master: \"I perceive that one computer company is much larger than all others. It towers above its competition like a giant among dwarfs. Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire business. Why is this so?\" The Master replied, \"Why do you ask such foolish questions? That company is large because it is large. If it only made hardware, nobody would buy it. If it only made software, nobody would use it. If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a servant. But because it combines all of these things, people think it one of the gods! By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.\" 8.2 A Master Programmer passed a novice programmer one day. The Master noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game. \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"may I examine it?\" The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the Master. \"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium, and Hard,\" said the Master. \"Yet every such device has another level of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the human.\" \"Pray, Great Master,\" implored the novice, \"how does one find this mysterious setting?\" The Master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it with his heel. Suddenly the novice was enlightened. 8.3 There was once a programmer who wrote software for personal computers. \"Look at how well off I am here,\" he said to a mainframe programmer who came to visit. \"I have my own operating system and file storage device. I do not have to share my resources with anyone. The software is self-consistent and easy-to-use. Why do you not quit your present job and join me here?\" The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his friend, saying, \"The mainframe sits like an ancient Sage meditating in the midst of the Data Center. Its disk drives lie end-to- end like a great ocean of machinery. The software is as multifaceted as a diamond, and as convoluted as a primeval jungle. The programs, each unique, move through the system like a swift-flowing river. That is why I am happy where I am.\" The personal computer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the two programmers remained friends until the end of their days. 8.4 Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said: \"You are Yin and I am Yang. If we travel together, we will become famous and earn vast sums of money.\" And so they set forth together, thinking to conquer the world. Presently, they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and hobbled along propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them: \"The Tao lies beyond Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool of water. It does not seek fame; therefore, nobody knows its presence. It does not seek fortune, for it is complete within itself. It exists beyond space and time.\" Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes. BOOK 9 Epilogue Thus spake the Master Programmer: \"Time for you to leave.\"",

COBOL was like picking your nose with boxing gloves on (h&#x2F;t Michael Pavlinch). It was appallingly clumsy to use. Lisp was like programming directly in the compiler&#x27;s abstract syntax tree, with both the plusses and the minuses of that. It was almost the opposite extreme from COBOL.Or to put it a different way: I don&#x27;t program in Lisp because that language isn&#x27;t a good fit for how my brain works and the kind of problems I work on. I don&#x27;t program in COBOL because I don&#x27;t like reading things that take that long to come to the point. reply poutinepapi 20 hours agoprevHA!

Blog Archive POSTED ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2023 BY MICHAEL LUCAS OpenBSD PF versus FreeBSD PF I encountered yet another discussion about OpenBSD PF versus FreeBSD PF. For those who are new to the discussion: OpenBSD developers created PF in 2001, and it rapidly improved to become the most approachable open source packet filter. FreeBSD ported PF over to its kernel in 2004, with occasional updates since. Today a whole bunch of folks who don’t program echo cultish wisdom that one or the other version of PF has fallen behind, not kept up on improvements, or otherwise betrayed their community. My subtler comments have been misinterpreted, so let’s try this. These claims are garbage. First, and most importantly: FreeBSD PF developers work with OpenBSD devs all the time, and OpenBSD PF developers pull stuff from FreeBSD1. You get a lot of noise about certain people being jerks about the other project–and both projects absolutely have jerks. (And yes, anyone who has read my books knows that I am a cross-platform jerk.) But for the most part, folks want to work together. PF is absolutely an OpenBSD creation, though, so why isn’t the OpenBSD version the Single Source of Truth? Why doesn’t FreeBSD just consider OpenBSD a vendor and pull that code in? Because the OpenBSD and FreeBSD kernels are wholly different. Back when I wrote Absolute BSD, I could realistically write a single book that would basically apply to the three major open source BSDs. Yes, the various projects objected to being lumped together, but if you knew any one of them you could stumble through the others. This is no longer true. FreeBSD’s kernel uses a wholly different locking model than OpenBSD. OpenBSD’s memory protections have no equivalent in FreeBSD. These are not things you can manage with a shim layer or kernel ABI. These are big, complicated, intrusive differences. You can’t tar up one version and dump it in the other’s kernel. It won’t work. If you do a hack job of making it work, it will perform badly. Yes, you can find “proof” that one PF or the other is faster under particular workloads on specific hardware. I have no doubt that some of them are not only accurate, but honest. There are other workloads, though, and other hardware, and other conditions. Regardless of who wins a particular race, the constant competition to achieve peak performance benefits everyone. I’m not going to link to any of the benchmarks, because I have made my opinions on benchmarking very clear elsewhere.2 Pick what you want and roll with it. Every PF developer is trundling along, doing their best to make things work. Are features missing from one or the other? Yep. I’m not going to list examples because, as the above links show, each project plucks what they find useful from the other. These things are freely given, with glad hearts, but they take time to integrate. Filling message boards with staunch declarations that my team’s PF is better is not only tedious, it wholly misses the point. People are working together to improve the world. And the PF syntax is the most approachable in all of open source Unix. (Partisan fanboy comments will be mercilessly whacked.) Commit history links courtesy of Mina. Yes, I could have looked it up, but she thought to do so. “The natural impulse to compare your server against others, to whup your neighbor, is exactly that: natural. It’s like flipping rocks to find tasty grubs. Sleeping in trees coveting the upper-class caves inhabited by the snooty grizzly bears. Perishing within twenty years of What Is Vitamin C Anyway? We invented civilization to escape dysentery, cleaning ourselves with mud, and benchmarking.” CATEGORIES BSD 6 Replies to “OpenBSD PF versus FreeBSD PF” Pingback: OpenBSD PF versus FreeBSD PF – TOP HACKER™ Patrick SEPTEMBER 27, 2023 AT 2:35 PM But all the rhetoric probably applies to Dragonfly, though?

Doing this allows the firewall input checks to happen early, before the packet has been received into the network stack, while its still in DMA-mapped, driver-owned buffers. If the firewall decides a packet is to be dropped, the NIC can recycle the buffer with minimal overhead (skips DMA-unmap, buffer free, ethernet input into the IP stack, and the replacement buffer alloc, DMA map).This allows for very fast dropping of DOS flood attacks. I&#x27;ve tested this using ipfw up to screening and dropping several 10s of millions of packets on 2014 era Xeons with minimal impact to traffic serving. I wrote a paper about this for a conf. that was cancelled due to COVID. I really need to re-submit it someplace.This works for Mellanox, Chelsio, and NICs that use iflib (ix, ixl, igb, bnxt, and more that I&#x27;m forgetting). reply brynet 19 hours agoparent> This allows for very fast dropping of DOS flood attacks.OpenBSD has something very close to that w&#x2F; bpf(4) BIOCGFILDROP filter \"drop\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;bpf#BIOCGFILDROPhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;tcpdump#Bhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=openbsd-tech&m=155228135415650&w=2 reply tedunangst 17 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s pretty different.

One exception being ferm ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferm.foo-projects.org&#x2F; ), because it keeps iptables-like keywords just expands on that, but it is iptables only and kinda superseded by nftables syntax anyway. reply epcoa 16 hours agorootparentiptables&#x2F;ebtables is deprecated even in RHEL.

In openbsd, pf is pretty much root only, and root -> kernel escalation isn&#x27;t a big deal. There&#x27;s a bug, it gets fixed, but no hoopla. Easy to miss if you&#x27;re not paying close attention. Maybe fixed incidentally as part of a refactor.But FreeBSD also has jails&#x2F;vnet, which makes root -> kernel escalation a lot more spicy. Eventually the bug gets found, some years later, although not really the result of negligence. reply wkat4242 20 hours agoprevAnd then there&#x27;s macOS pf too. Also different again! reply cyberpunk 19 hours agoparentI&#x27;m sure i read on a comment here recently that the latest macos is using a recent openbsd pf? As quite a heavy user of freebsd pf, I wonder if anyone knows more details on that? reply toast0 17 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t looked in a while, but an update would be nice. When I was looking at it in the last couple years, many things in the networking stack were unchanged since the late 90s&#x2F;early 2000s, so macos didn&#x27;t have syn flood protection built in, and while the macos pf had synflood stuff, it only works if the macos host is strictly a firewall, using the syn protection for traffic where macos is an endpoint results in no connectivity.If they pulled in a more recent pf from either OpenBSD or more current FreeBSD would be welcome. (And you know, a recent tcp stack would be nice too; although they&#x27;ve added in things like MPTCP that they&#x27;d need to port forward by 20+ years) reply nvy 19 hours agorootparentprevOn my mbp, the man page for `pfctl` contains the following:>HISTORY> The pfctl program and the packet filter mechanism first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0. reply yakubin 19 hours agorootparentThe same is in the current manpage on OpenBSD: .

(Understatement of the century right there!)FWIW the threading in the network stack is one of the original major divergences between Open&#x2F;FreeBSD PF. The way FreeBSD&#x27;s PF works is within the context of FreeBSD&#x27;s threaded network stack. FreeBSD PF is not \"single threaded\" in the way it used to mean.I would really like to have the modern PF syntax&#x2F;structure from OpenBSD in FreeBSD though. The unified rdr&#x2F;nat&#x2F;pass&#x2F;block mechanism in OpenBSD is so much cleaner and nicer to work with. reply cperciva 20 hours agorootparentDragonFly and FreeBSD have radically different ideas on how multithreading should work. (Understatement of the century right there!)To elaborate for people who don&#x27;t know the history: Disagreement about how multithreading should work are why Matt got booted from the FreeBSD project and started DragonFly. reply darkhelmet 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not that simple. Disagreements are one thing, but the real reason was the conflict and drama that happened when things didn&#x27;t go his way. The threading approach just happened to be a really good trigger for those conflicts.Conflicting personalities makes resolving technical disagreements so much harder. reply cperciva 19 hours agorootparentI was being euphemistic.

Firewalling has the benefit that queue alignment should happen automagically, because of where it runs. If you&#x27;re doing a lot of processing in userspace, it makes a lot less of a difference, but on a very lightweight application, there was no point in using more cores than nic queues, because cross-core communication was too slow. reply josteink 20 hours agoprev [–] > And the PF syntax is the most approachable in all of open source Unix.As someone not deeply into the BSDs and who has never tried pf, I would love to see this claim illustrated with a few examples.Are there any “definitive” or authoritative beginner guides for those merely curious, but without a production system to test on? reply tedunangst 20 hours agoparentFind your favorite topic in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;pf&#x2F;index.html and compare to how you&#x27;d do it in your favorite firewall. reply voytec 20 hours agoparentprev> And the PF syntax is the most approachable in all of open source Unix.I actually find ipfw(8) [0] syntax more human-friendly.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.freebsd.org&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;man.cgi?query=ipfw&sektion=8&for... reply stock_toaster 19 hours agorootparentI wish dragonflyBSD’s ipfw3 would get ported to freeBSD. reply i_am_a_peasant 20 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d go for the handbook in that case:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.freebsd.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;books&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;firewalls&#x2F;#firewa... reply nesarkvechnep 20 hours agoparentprevGet yourself “The Book of PF” and get to work. reply fragmede 19 hours agoparentprev [–] Explore in the direction you want to go:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;e1e2a207-5fb4-4f12-9f3c-7850ff... replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Currently, there is no file-format which is purpose-built for this task. Standard MIDI files can represent note data, but it is often a lower-level representation (no ramps) of data than what the DAW uses internally, which forces consolidation on export. AAF only covers audio and doesn't have any concept of musical-time, which limits it to post-audio workflows . Most plug-ins do allow you to save presets to a shared location, but this has to be done for each instance. What most users end up doing is just exporting audio as stems. The aim of this project is to export all translatable project data (audio/note/automation/plug-in) along with the structure surrounding it into a single DAWproject file. The table below aims to explain the scope format from a music-production perspective and how it compares to other methods of data transfer.DAWproject Standard MIDI Files Advanced Authoring Format (AAF) Intended Use Music Production MIDI Sequencing Video Post-Production Time Format (seconds/beats) Beats and seconds can be combined Beats Seconds Audio Audio Events/Clips Fades Crossfades Amplitude Pan Time Warping Transpose - Audio Events/Clips Fades Crossfades Amplitude Pan Notes Notes Note Expressions Notes - Automation Tempo Time Signature MIDI Messages Volume Pan Mute Sends Plug-in Parameters Built-in Device Parameters Tempo Time Signature MIDI Messages SysEx Messages Volume Pan Video Related Parameters Plug-ins Stores full plug-in state and automation of parameters - - Built-in Devices Generic EQ Generic Compressor Generic Gate Generic Limiter - - Clip Launcher Clips Scenes - - Status The format is version 1.0 and is stable. Goals Package all user data of a project/song into a single file. Audio timeline data Note timeline data Note expression data Automation timeline data Audio data (embedded or referenced) Plug-in states (always embedded) The format should be able to preserve as much user created data as feasible. The format should be able to express the track and timeline structures of the exporting DAW as is, leaving it up to the importer to use this data and flatten it as needed. Simple to implement Built upon established open standards Language agnostic, no special dependencies Open & free Non-goals Being the native file-format for a DAW Optimal performance (like a binary format could provide) Storing low-level MIDI events directly (but rather relying on higher level abstractions) Storing non-session data (view settings, preferences) Format Specification File Extension: .dawproject Container: ZIP Format: XML (project.xml, metadata.xml) Text encoding: UTF-8 The exporting DAW is free to choose the directory structure it wants for media and plug-in files. DAWproject XML Reference Project XML Schema MetaData XML Schema Language Support DAWproject is based on plain XML/ZIP and can be used with any programming language that can parse those. The DOM of DAWproject is defined by a set of Java classes which have XML-related annotations and HTML-induced Javadoc comments. Those are used (via reflection) to generate XML Documentation and Schemas. Potentially, the same approach could be used to generate code for other languages (contributions welcome). Building the Library, Documentation and Tests Requires Java Runtime version 16 or later. To build (using Gradle): ./gradlew build Example project The exporting application is free to structure tracks and timelines in a way that fits its internal model. The choice is left to the importing application to either use the level of structure provided (if applicable) or to flatten/convert it to match its model. As an example, here's the project.xml of a simple file saved in Bitwig Studio 5.0 with one instrument track and one audio track. As the audio clips in Bitwig Studio are themselves a timeline of audio events, you will notice that there are two levels of elements, id25 representing the clip timeline on the arrangement, and id26 representing the audio events inside the clip.

I&#x27;ve been trying to write a VCS for Ableton projects but their schema is way too complex to try to make sense of it.Ableton is incredibly hostile to third party devs building upon their work. Eg: There is no official documentation for any of their Python APIs. reply thomashop 7 hours agorootparentAlthough the python API could be documented, it was not meant to be a public API.

I went for Mixcraft because friend has it already, but still struggling to make it running alongside Spitfire with wine. Spitfire needs win 10 but then no sound with the \"low latency\" driver in Mixcraft. Anyway… an exchange format would help me go native while keeping friends! reply elihu 17 hours agoprevOne thing I&#x27;d like to see is native support for some notion of pitch other than 12-tone equal temperament.Looking at their example, I see this:...which looks like it&#x27;s basically just a representation of the underlying midi.One way they could represent other pitches is for \"key\" to allow a floating point value rather than an integer. So, for instance, 65.5 would be a quarter-tone (50 cents) above note 65.According to their reference document, \"key\" is currently required to be an integer:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitwig&#x2F;daw...There&#x27;s other ways to support microtuning. They could apply a tuning table to the midi notes, for instance. (Ideally they should support more than the 128 notes that midi supports, because 128 isn&#x27;t enough for some use cases.) They might also allow you to apply pitch bend to individual notes (which isn&#x27;t allowed in midi 1.0 but was added to 2.0). reply gravitronic 16 hours agoparentAt this layer of note information, fact is the data will be either sent to a MIDI device or a plugin as a MIDI event, so you might as well keep it in the native format and not convert to a frequency. reply elihu 15 hours agorootparentMPE exists, and can handle microtuning of pitch. MIDI 2.0 supports per-note pitch bend. Old multitimbral MIDI synths can be used in an MPE-like fashion by using the one-note-per-channel and pitch bend trick. Modular synthesizers (and virtual modular synthesizers like VCVRack) use control voltage directly, which has no built-in assumptions about how or if the voltages are quantized.Microtonal music, or even just plain regular traditional music that&#x27;s tempered to be more in tune with itself, should be trivially easy to do with electronic instruments, and yet due to some historical decisions to base the one near-universal music protocol we&#x27;ve been using for the last 40 years on a piano-centric representation, it&#x27;s a lot harder than it ought to be.I think we should not disregard microtonal music just because it isn&#x27;t cleanly backwards compatible with a protocol that&#x27;s over 40 years old. reply pdntspa 11 hours agorootparentIdunno, half the instrument VSTs I have seem to support some form of microtuning or alternate tunings... reply AlecSchueler 7 hours agorootparentHow do they achieve that? reply elihu 5 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know what all the options are, but MTS-ESP is one. If I understand it right, it&#x27;s a sort of out-of-band channel where you can apply tuning tables to all the MIDI synths that use the MTS-ESP API from one place.I think it&#x27;s not sent over MIDI so it only works if everything is running on the same computer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oddsound.com&#x2F;mtsespsuite.php reply spacechild1 15 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t need to convert to frequency, you can use fractional MIDI pitch values. E.g. 60.5 would be a quarter tone above middle C.In fact, the VST2 and VST3 SDKs support microtonal offsets per note event (measured in cent). Unfortunately, only few plugins and hosts support it. reply gravitronic 15 hours agorootparentI mean, you could, but that would get really gross when implementing certain scales that are nowhere similar to the MIDI tuning (like working out the fractions for a 13-note scale) reply elihu 13 hours agorootparentEh, it&#x27;s fine. With two decimal points of precision you&#x27;re basically working in cents, which is a pretty standard way of representing tuning.This doesn&#x27;t need to be a trivially human-readable format, but I think maybe it would be nice to allow for multiple pitch representations: floating point frequency, floating point fractions of a semitone in any arbitrary EDO, fractional frequency as used in just intonation, etc..You could also allow for annotations, like maybe a note pitch is represented as \"63.86\" in 12-EDO, but it&#x27;s not just some weird in-between note, it&#x27;s actually the E that&#x27;s 5&#x2F;4 above C, so the file could have an annotation that says that&#x27;s what the note actually means in this context. reply AlecSchueler 7 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the issue that pitch bends in midi apply to every sound on that channel, so if you play a chord with a different temperament and send the bend data of each note the result is that the whole chord will be tempered as normal but with every note the same amount higher or lower?I&#x27;ve heard the recent midi 2 can get around this but it&#x27;s still a pain with the 40 years of midi equipment that surrounds us. reply elihu 5 hours agorootparentYes, that&#x27;s a problem with MIDI 1.0. There are a few ways to work around it. Some synths support custom tuning tables, and there&#x27;s even a MIDI spec for custom tuning tables called MTS that hardly anyone actually implements as far as I know.One way that works for multitimbral synth (which a lot of 90&#x27;s romplers are) is to only play one note at a time on each channel, and use multiple channels for polyphony. This allows you to individually control the pitch of every note.The one-note-per-channel trick works okay, but it&#x27;s kind of awkward. If you want to use all 16 channels, it means setting every channel to the exact same patch, which is tedious. Also, you have to know what the pitch bend range of the synth is if you want to bend by the exact right amount. So, eventually MPE was adopted as an official MIDI standard to provide an easier, more user-friendly and standardized way to do one-note-per-channel MIDI.MIDI 2.0 has added per-note pitch bend. For anyone making microtonal instruments right now, though, I&#x27;d say MPE is probably the best&#x2F;easiest option. reply AlecSchueler 2 hours agorootparentThanks, that sas a helpful response and I&#x27;ll surely have a fun time looking into these different potential solutions. replylondons_explore 16 hours agorootparentprevI feel like we&#x27;re only months&#x2F;years away from software and file formats being obsolete for this for this sort of thing, and instead songs are composed by humming a tune to ChatGPT and have it add all the other instruments, some nice vocals, and output the MP3.If you want to make changes, you give ChatGPT the MP3 file and say \"switch out the trumpet for a piano and make the singer a guy\". reply johnnyworker 16 hours agorootparentAs someone who makes music as a hobby that&#x27;s about as enticing as outsourcing sex. I don&#x27;t care if the machine can do it better. reply unshavedyak 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an interesting point. I don&#x27;t get much value from art personally (not that i don&#x27;t see why people value it, i do!), so the idea of AI generated art isn&#x27;t disgusting to me.Music however.. i adore music. A big (but not essential) thing i love about music is the story that got the artist to that point. Pain, joy, emotion is transferred. Yea, often it&#x27;s not essential so maybe AI Music has a place in my life, but easily 60% of my music is loved partly, if not heavily, because of the emotions that got the artist to that point.I too am not interested in outsourcing this. reply couchand 15 hours agorootparent... music is art, no? reply throwaway290 9 hours agorootparentIn English speaking world \"art\" can be used in two ways, as a synonym for \"visual art\" or to mean really any art (including music, cinema etc). reply ok_computer 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is a hilarious take and juxtaposition with MP3 (lame encoders anyone?) and some far fetched gtp application. It would be a musak equivalent of the bored ape nft’s.Like midi note transcription or waveform modeling will be cool machine learning tools. An end to end composition and mastering bot may make something passable like other current derivative music out there, being generous by saying passable.Show me the leaps and bounds in self-driving cars that were only 3-5 years away 8 years ago.There is still need for better daw, music transcription, and audio file formats in the next century.

International music styles are suffering in DAW-land imo :(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oddsound.com&#x2F; reply duped 15 hours agoparentprevThis is built into MIDI 2, fwiw reply elihu 13 hours agorootparentYeah, MIDI 2.0 has per-note pitch bend. They kept with 7 bits for note numbers, though, which is kind of inconvenient. If you have an instrument with more than 128 keys, you have to do a kind of dynamic allocation thing where you find the nearest unused key and bend it to pitch.I think for most use cases, MPE is actually simpler. (Also it&#x27;s probably supported by more instruments and synths at this point.)All the more reason to include microtuning as a supported feature in this new format. reply duped 12 hours agorootparentNot per note pitch bend. Note On&#x2F;Off messages support an extra 16 bits of \"attribute\" data that can optionally be used as an unsigned 7.9 fixed point pitch offset in semitones. Note numbers are also expanded to 256 since they can use the full 8 bits of the note number.MPE is a super limited hack, I doubt anyone is going to use it once MIDI 2 becomes available in synths (it&#x27;s a future technology, fwiw - it will be a year or two before you can buy any controller that uses it) reply sim7c00 3 hours agoprevepic project, one of my fav DAWs already supported too. So damn happy to see this. Hope Renoise will pick it up too though that one moves a lil slow :P maybe someday! just wanted to say thanks. this is needed sooo much! reply royjacobs 17 hours agoprevThis is pretty nice. I&#x27;ve written some tools for my own softsynth that revolved around parsing various DAW formats and having a standard format, even just to export to, would have been very nice to have. reply dmicah 17 hours agoprevIt would be nice if Bitwig would support existing plug-ins formats like AU. reply teilo 13 hours agoparentWhy would they want to support AU? The only reason to use AU is Logic. Everything else (Protools excepted) supports VST, and all the plugin devs release in VST and AU, so it would be a waste of time. Bitwig is putting their time into CLAP, and for good reason. It&#x27;s cross-platform, much easier to develop against, and much more advanced that all the alternatives. Even Avid has shown interest in CLAP. So has Image Line. I expect Studio One to support it in v7. reply jonpalmisc 13 hours agorootparentFor starters, AUs are \"easier\" to run under Roestta than VSTs since AUs run out-of-process by default. This means you can use a x86_64 AU without running the entire DAW under Rosetta on Apple Silicon. reply tomduncalf 9 hours agorootparentIt hadn’t occurred to me that AU run out of process, but this makes sense. Does this mean an AU crashing in theory won’t take down your DAW? (The same thing that Bitwig has it’s own isolation feature for)I always default to AU just because I’m on a Mac and I arbitrarily decided to do so long ago. The Rosetta thing has been a nice bonus. Not sure what the other (dis)advantages are, these days I try to focus on using native Ableton and M4L stuff anyway! reply yungporko 8 hours agorootparentprevbitwig already does this with vsts because plugins are sandboxed reply sctb 16 hours agoparentprevDo you encounter many AU-only plugins? From what I can tell, the limitations of VST&#x2F;AU&#x2F;AAX are more pressing and Bitwig are working to address that with CLAP: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;u-he.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;clap. reply unshavedyak 16 hours agorootparentMan i hope more people (plugin developers too) embrace CLAP or something open. I&#x27;m writing a Rust program and i really want to allow for Modart&#x27;s Pianoteq plugin and VST just makes it feel so difficult. reply dmicah 14 hours agorootparentprevThere have always been plug-ins, especially by small developers on the Mac, which are AU only.Apple Silicon macs can now run iOS &#x2F; iPadOS AUs as well, so there are a ton of plugins from that world that are not available as VSTs.Apple Logic can&#x27;t load VSTs, so typically on the Mac it makes sense to just have AUs. Ableton Live on the Mac can load VSTs or AU, but there isn&#x27;t really a reason to keep the VSTs around. reply odiroot 5 hours agoparentprevOr LADSPA&#x2F;LV2 which is actually free. reply duped 15 hours agoparentprevFewer hosts should use AU reply raincole 12 hours agoprevIt sounds nice but I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re going to convince other DAWs devs (bigger than Bitwig) to adopt this. reply Borgz 11 hours agoparentThe readme says that PreSonus Studio One supports the format, so I think it&#x27;s possible others might in the future. reply throwaway290 11 hours agoparentprevIf Reaper and Bitwig supported one interchangeable arrangement format it could already be big. reply dottjt 12 hours agoprevIncredible. If Ableton adopts this it&#x27;ll be a huge thing. reply xoac 6 hours agoparentProbably not happening any time soon.

And there are a lot of DAWs. reply sedivy94 14 hours agoparentMaybe I’m misinterpreting the readme but other DAWs would not need to cooperate if you’re developing a tool to transpile between formats. I think most of the proprietary specs could be reverse engineered. reply noizejoy 17 hours agoparentprevMIDI was enthusiastically supported by Yamaha and Roland, two of the biggest synth players of that era.So I imagine, for it to become widely successful, that this new standard would need the wholehearted support of at least 2 of Steinberg, Apple, Ableton, and Avid. reply surfingdino 8 hours agorootparentIndeed, MIDI 1.0 is one of the oldest implemented standards in existence.

The sailor, from the very nature of his craft, has a dependence upon rope and a consequent familiarity with knots that is demanded of no other workman. It follows that most important knots owe both their origin and their names to the requirements of a ship at sea. So diverse are these requirements that the number of knots devised by the sailor is probably ten times greater than the sum of all other handicrafts combined. Nor is this surprising if we consider that on a full-rigged ship, in everyday use, are several miles of rigging, and an able seaman, of necessity, is acquainted with every inch of this extent. Knotting has been an important adjunct to the everyday life of all people from the earliest days of which we have know ledge. There are still primitive races who fasten their huts, traps, canoes, and harness with knotted thongs and withes. But civilized man is no less delendent on knots than his more backward brothers, even though :nots today are much less in evidence in sophisticated surroundings. Long ago man recognized the decorative possibilities of knots, and “fancy knotting” is one of the oldest and most widely distributed of the folk arts. But it remained for the sailor to seize upon this art and to develop it into something that is peculiarly his own.

It is truly the knot bible. Unfortunately, however, this is the 1993 version and contains corrected material that are still protected under the copyright laws. To the reviewer who claimed that this book is in public domain, you are wrong. The Internet Archive contains much material, including game source codes that were stolen from game software companies, that are illegal to distribute. (Regarding the stolen source code, you need to know how to look for them in the IA because the uploaders used \"special\" words that are recognizable only by those who know what the stolen files represent.) I've also seen books (including proprietary material stolen from private corporations that have words like \"proprietary\" or \"confidential\" marked in them) posted in IA that were published within the past couple of decades and thus are still copyrighted. So this says that the IA simply does not have the resources to go through every uploaded file and delete the ones that are not legal to download. There are simply too many of them for any single individual like me to report them to IA for deletion. Just trying to report them to the IA would be a full-time job. As for this Ashley book, for it to be truly in the public domain, it needs to be the original 1944 version, the one that has errors that the 1993 version corrected. However, there is also the possibility that the copyright owner may have given the permission for the 1993 version of the book to be available via the IA, without releasing the book into the public domain, but I don't know how IA would be able to know this without contacting the copyright owner.

Not only in the chapter headings, but even the knot descriptions sometimes have random little anecdotes, and you get the sense that the author must have been quite a guy.A favorite quote:> The topsail halyard bend is said to be a yachting hitch, but it is possible that it has never appeared outside the covers of a book. It has one more turn than the studding-sail bend and this, like the second tablespoonful of castor oil, savors of redundancy. reply teeray 18 hours agoprevThe Marlinspike hitch is my favorite :) If you stick anything functioning as a marlinspike in there (stick, screwdriver, etc.), you get a great handle for pulling in tension. If you put a hook in there, you have a hitch onto the hook that can be released by slipping it off (and the whole knot collapses in on itself). If you stick the tag end one way instead, you end up with a great stopper knot (Oysterman’s Stopper Knot) that is triple the diameter of the cordage. If you stick the tag end in another way, you end up a Bowline—and it’s a whole lot faster tying it than the “rabbit-around-the-tree” method. reply dougalm 18 hours agoparent> a great stopper knot (Oysterman’s Stopper Knot)Also known as the Ashley stopper knot! I&#x27;ve started keeping a short length of paracord on my desk to practice knots during video calls. It makes a great fidget toy. The Ashley stopper is what I&#x27;ve been tying this week and it&#x27;s such a gem (but a little harder to untie than I&#x27;d like).ABOK is the classic. But I was surprised to learn recently that it&#x27;s not the final word on knots. Superior knots like the Zeppelin bend don&#x27;t appear in it and there have even been useful knots invented since it was published. Geoffrey Budworth&#x27;s \"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots and Ropework\" includes knots that were invented in the 80s. reply MrVandemar 15 hours agorootparentI did this during COVID lockdowns (I never did get locked-down, being medical staff, but I had plenty of boring moments with nothing to do otherwise).I wound up learning 20, and one of the GPs challenged me to tie them all blind-fold. Which I did, and won a metre of liquorice! reply stereo 11 hours agorootparentHow did you tie the liquorice though? reply MrVandemar 10 hours agorootparentI was generous and there was quickly not enough to tie even a half-hitch. reply bccdee 12 hours agorootparentprevSeconding the shout-out to Budworth&#x27;s Ultimate Encyclopedia. Best knot book I ever had. Not as comprehensive as The Ashley Book of Knots, but an extremely clear & thorough survey of the field nevertheless. If there&#x27;s one knot book to own, that&#x27;s the one. reply teeray 11 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;ve started keeping a short length of paracord on my desk to practice knots during video calls. It makes a great fidget toy.This is literally what I started doing like 6 months ago, and I went from knowing only how to tie my shoes to having a great repertoire of knots. It’s great to have a couple hanks of paracord in the car now to tie stuff down, and more versatile (and safer) than the bungee straps. reply hprotagonist 3 hours agorootparentsee also rok straps (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rokstraps.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;rok-moto) and ratchet straps, though neither are fun enough to involve knots. reply triyambakam 15 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;ve started keeping a short length of paracord on my desk to practice knots during video callsWhat a great idea. I just started learning knots. What do you use to tie onto? Some knots require something to which to fix. reply MrVandemar 15 hours agorootparentNot the parent, but I cut myself a nice stick, divided it into shortish lengths of three, probably about 20cm, sanded them down. Three sticks lets you practice a number of knots, and I stored them tied with two lengths of rope (the fantastic hitch, forget what it&#x27;s called, but two of them are brilliant for bundling poles together).Then I just carried that around in my bag, or in a drawer at work, and when the opportunity presented itself, I practiced. reply dougalm 14 hours agorootparentYeah, I similarly have dowels floating around my desk for tying hitches. But I don&#x27;t have a good solution for practicing knots that are meant to be tied under tension, like the \"trucker&#x27;s hitch\" family.

There were knots before, of course, but the variety and intricacy exploded. (a bit of a simplification of course, there are lots of cool Celtic knots and whatnot, too)It was a somewhat special time, where you had a lot of relatively well-paid capable people stuck on a boat with nothing to do for sometimes weeks on end. Encourages some creativity, I suppose (: Scrimshaw is another product of that time — some really intricate stuff out there (eg: [1]).For me, I feel like the bowline and trucker&#x27;s hitch give you huge bang for the buck. Memorize those, and you can handle many things, with a bit of rope.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelshipworld.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;27614-prisoner-of-war-bone-... reply saberience 9 hours agoparentI’m sure knots were developed for whaling… but most were developed (as might be expected) during the age of sail and the British empire. reply JoeAltmaier 11 hours agoparentprevTautline very useful, especially with tents.But the Tarbuck is just that little bit better, and identically easy to tie (and untie). reply swalberg 20 hours agoprevKnow knots or tie lots!Knowing a few different knots for a variety of situations comes in handy. The right knot holds properly and can usually be undone when needed without having to cut it out.If you&#x27;re starting out then the square knot, two half hitches, taught line hitch, clove hitch, and bowline cover most use cases. And, yes, those are among the basic ones taught to Scouts. reply Ishmaeli 17 hours agoparentThe Klutz Book of Knots was one of my favorites as a kid, and cited Ashley throughout. Here&#x27;s what it had to say about the square knot:\"But Which Knot Is Really The Best Knot?A true landlubber&#x27;s question, but one that is inevitably raised. The correct answer should be the responsible—albeit boring—\"It depends.\" Are you knotting together sheets for an open-air exit from a burning hotel? Or are you tying up your hair?But let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve really only got room for two or three knots in your long-term memory files. If such were the case, I could be forced to recommend the bowline, the sheet bend, and the clove hitch. The three of them are the class of the three primary knot categories—loop knots, rope-to-rope knots (bends), and rope-to-something-else knots (hitches). Between them, they should get you into most binds.Incidentally, the opposite question, \"Which is really the worst knot?\" is far simpler to answer. As disillusioning as this sounds, it&#x27;s the square knot, the most over-hyped, under-strength knot in creation. Clifford Ashley, the author of the definitive encylopedia on the subject of knotting, states that the square knot \"...has probably been responsible for more deaths and injuries than all other knots combined.\"The reason is that the square knot capsizes, i.e. it unties itself. A couple of quick tugs on the rope, or an inadvertant bump, and the honest square knot turns into thin air, an unhappy result that demonstrates the difference between a \"strong\" knot, one that weakens the rope least, and a \"secure\" knot, one that resists unraveling.\"This was disillusioning when I first read it as an avid Boy Scout. Now I can&#x27;t think of a more apt symbol for the Scouting program. reply triyambakam 15 hours agorootparentI have heard that the clove hitch isn&#x27;t very good, either. That it easily comes undone with wiggling reply alex-robbins 8 hours agorootparentSee my other comment on this post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37685921 reply foundart 12 hours agorootparentprevA “round turn and two half hitches” (ABOK #1720) is what I’ve been told is a better alternative for tying fenders to a boat that will be left unattended reply quaddo 13 hours agorootparentprevSome knots are only useful under tension; absent that, they can get sloppy without too much effort. I&#x27;d say the clove hitch is one such example. reply AndyKluger 12 hours agorootparentprevBut it can be fixed in that regard by turning it into a constrictor knot instead, IIUC. reply dates 11 hours agorootparentprevif the clove hitch is tied near the end of the rope, you can take the tail and tie an overhand knot with it around the standing line to back it up reply eternityforest 10 hours agoparentprevMy personal list is the uni-knot, sheet bend(Along with the slipped and double versions), tautline hitch, alpine butterfly loop, highwayman&#x27;s hitch, and clove hitch.And of course the double slipped square knot. I always have trouble with it, the right over left and left over right steps slow me down trying to make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally tie a granny. But once it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s really obvious to anyone how to untie it since it&#x27;s a standard shoelace bow.I think one of the coolest things is that most knots have a really obvious slipped version, once you know the base knot you can make sure it never binds on you.I always hear the clove hitch is not the greatest though, so I&#x27;m never sure what to do. Gliepnir is my favorite replacement, but it&#x27;s not easy to remember. reply alex-robbins 8 hours agorootparent> the clove hitch is not the greatest though, so I&#x27;m never sure what to doThe rolling hitch [1] is a slight variation that works great as a drop-in replacement. For attaching a rope to a pole, I go as far down this list as is feasible and&#x2F;or necessary:- two half hitches [2] (this is actually just a clove-hitch around the standing end)- round turn and two half hitches [3] (like the above, but a little more secure and it takes the load while you tie it)- anchor hitch [4] (even more secure, but harder to tie under load)[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animatedknots.com&#x2F;rolling-hitch-knot[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animatedknots.com&#x2F;two-half-hitches-knot[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animatedknots.com&#x2F;round-turn-two-half-hitches-kn...[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animatedknots.com&#x2F;anchor-hitch-knot reply guntherhermann 2 hours agorootparentMy go to is the &#x27;midshipmans hitch&#x27; with an extra half-turn at the end, dead easy and secure whenever I&#x27;ve used it https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animatedknots.com&#x2F;midshipmans-hitch-knot reply eternityforest 7 hours agorootparentprevThanks, that&#x27;s really neat!Round turn and two half hitches is really interesting because you don&#x27;t have to relearn anything.It seems to be \"nooslike\" similar to the uni-knot, which makes me wonder if just a slipped uni-knot (Maybe with a round turn?) Could also work? reply pclmulqdq 19 hours agoparentprevI would suggest adding the sheet bend (ABOK #1) to that list: if you ever end up not having enough rope, you will want to be able to join multiple sections together. reply swalberg 19 hours agorootparentYea, another good Scout knot. While a square knot can do the same it can capsize under tension! reply eternityforest 9 hours agorootparentPretty sure Ashley himself says the square knot should never be used as a bend, and that doing so has probably killed more people than any other knot failure. reply 123pie123 19 hours agoparentpreva very simple knot that has been very useful to me and yet simple to learn is the - round turn and two half hitches knot. for tying a line or rope under tension reply loloquwowndueo 20 hours agoparentprev*taut line hitch. reply hooverd 16 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t forget the Sommerville bowline.

Very short list: the reef knot (square knot, avoid the granny version) and the alpine butterfly (don&#x27;t use reef knot for joining two ropes, i.e. a \"bend\"). The alpine butterfly is more useful to know than the bowline, IMHO.If you want to expand your list a little, here are some additional useful ones: double fisherman&#x27;s, adjustable grip hitch, sheet bend, trucker&#x27;s hitch.Edit: I suppose this is more useful with a little additional commentary. The reef knot is so common that you should know it and know how to avoid the granny knot and also when not to use it (e.g. as a bend). You can use the alpine butterfly as a bend and also for quite few other things. It is more versatile than the bowline (e.g. if you need a loop that doesn&#x27;t slip) and works fine as a bend (very smiilar to the Zeppelin bend). reply at_a_remove 18 hours agorootparentRight, but this isn&#x27;t a what question, it&#x27;s a when to do what question. I might know a knot, but I don&#x27;t know when to use that knot and when it ought to be avoided. That&#x27;s what I am getting at.Even under the \"bend\" page in Wikipedia, sometimes the knots are merely described. reply eternityforest 9 hours agorootparentIf it&#x27;s a safety critical situation, leave it to the experts&#x2F;become an expert&#x2F;try to make it so that the failure of your knot won&#x27;t kill anyone&#x2F;etc.For non-critical use(In my limited experience, some of my choices are as much about ease of tying as actually picking the right one, some of these are things I&#x27;ve only used once or twice or never used for anything important):If you want to tie two ropes together, use a sheet bend. or a double for more security, or the slipped version to be able to undo it. Add a stoper knot for even more security.If you want to make a loop in the middle of a rope, alpine butterfly.If you want to adjust tension, tautline hitch.If you are tying thin spectra cord, or making a permanent attachment between thin cord and something else, try a uni-knot. Note that it&#x27;s not actually considered the standard for tying to carabiners, but I use it sometimes(For non climbing purposes).If you are tying a bundle together, try gliepnir or a standard shoelace knot, or a clove hitch.If you are tying a rope to a fixed pole, try a clove hitch. It&#x27;s not perfectly secure. Maybe try gliepnir too. Honestly bundles and hitches are the two uses I&#x27;m least sure of. There are apparently better things than the clove hitch, but it&#x27;s easy and good enough probably.If you want to tie something you can undo really, really fast, use a highwayman&#x27;s hitch.If you want to tie something someone else might need to untie, shoelace knot which is a doubly slipped square knot, it advertises visually that it&#x27;s meant to untie.Might want to just use a regular overhand though, the Ashley stopper is hard to undo.If you want to cause a real nightmare for anyone untying something, or remove unwanted fingers by circulation loss, constrictor knot.If you want to make the end of a rope not go through a hole, Ashley stopper. You can also use this, or just a simple overhand, to keep another knot from slipping.If you want to do something involving climbing, do not listen to me, I know nothing about it. reply marai2 16 hours agorootparentprevBe the change you want to see in the world ;-)I think a flow chart of when to use a knot is a great idea!

With some metadata describing the input&#x2F;output schema. The underlying engine can use WASM or containers or something like that. reply mikeravkine 17 minutes agoparent..isn&#x27;t this just Docker? reply brap 2 minutes agorootparentWell... yeah, kind of.I guess some parts that are missing are having a schema for the CMD part, and being able to easily generate APIs for various languages from that schema reply jarym 3 hours agoprevThis looks interesting - I use OONX to call my PyTorch models from .NET but so far it’s meant I’ve not been able to test out JAX based libraries since they don’t have ONNX export and it has also meant I had to write C# boilerplate code to preprocess my input data into the form required by the model.Potentially this could be a lot better but I’d be curious what speed overhead the IPC layer adds. At least with ONNX you get a nice speed bump :) reply jcrash 11 hours agoprevSo this means if I want to use a ML model I made in python, but don&#x27;t want to code the rest of the application in python I can do that? reply vpanyam 11 hours agoparentYes, that&#x27;s a use case Carton supports.For exmaple, if your model contains arbitrary Python code, you&#x27;d pack it using [1] and then you could load it from another language using [2]. In this case, Carton transparently spins up an isolated Python interpreter under the hood to run your model (even if the rest of your application is in another language).You can take it one step further if you&#x27;re using certain DL frameworks. For example, you can create a TorchScript model in Python [3] and then use it from any programming language Carton supports without requiring python at runtime (i.e. your model runs completely in native code).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carton.run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;packing&#x2F;python[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carton.run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;loading[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carton.run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;packing&#x2F;torchscript reply ZeroCool2u 11 hours agorootparentSeems almost too good to be true, but I really hope it&#x27;s not. How does it handle things like CUDA dependencies? Can it somehow make those portable too? Or is GPU acceleration not quite there yet? reply vpanyam 10 hours agorootparentThanks :)It uses the NVIDIA drivers on your system, but it should be possible to make the rest of CUDA somewhat portable. I have a few thoughts on how to do this, but haven&#x27;t gotten around to it yet.The current GPU enabled torch runners use a version of libtorch that&#x27;s statically linked against the CUDA runtime libraries. So in theory, they just depend on your GPU drivers and not your CUDA installation. I haven&#x27;t yet tested on a machine that has just the GPU drivers installed (i.e without CUDA), but if it doesn&#x27;t already work, it should be very possible to make it work. reply jcrash 11 hours agorootparentprevThat’s awesome!

That would make Carton the ultimate library to embed LLMs into desktop applications reply vpanyam 9 hours agoparentI&#x27;m definitely open to it if there&#x27;s interest (or if someone wants to help), but I don&#x27;t have plans to implement Windows support myself at the moment.The currently supported platforms [1] were mostly driven by environments I&#x27;ve seen at various tech companies.I do have active plans to support inference from WASM&#x2F;WebGPU so maybe that could be a good entrypoint to Windows support.--[1] Currently, the supported platforms are:* `x86_64` Linux and macOS* `aarch64` Linux (e.g. Linux on AWS Graviton)* `aarch64` macOS (e.g. M1 and M2 Apple Silicon chips)* WebAssembly (metadata access only for now, but WebGPU runners are coming soon) reply astronautas 7 hours agoprevIs this the same as Nvidia&#x27;s Triton? reply capableweb 2 hours agoparentI think this Carton project is on a lower level than Triton. With Triton you&#x27;d start the Triton server then make requests against it, while Carton is more like a library that you include in your application&#x2F;library and code it with the same language you&#x27;d write your application&#x2F;library. reply carbocation 8 hours agoprevI&#x27;d love to see this for golang (even without GPU support). reply otabdeveloper4 8 hours agoprev> From any [*] programming language.[*] If \"any programming language\" is Python or Javascript. reply liuliu 53 minutes agoparentThis is a reasonable approach for systems that allowed to load binaries (either the running artifact is a binary or semi-binary (WASM executable) or it allows to load .so &#x2F; .dll from user-provided places).It basically runs with the promise that you can package CUDA &#x2F; PyTorch &#x2F; Python interpreter into the host language in some way, and use it.This is true for Android, not true for iOS, true for almost all desktop systems, somewhat true for web (packaging PyTorch + Python interpreter in WASM, the latter is easy, the former, I am unsure), probably not true for FAAS environments (such as Cloudflare worker, or AWS Lambda). reply Areibman 10 hours agoprevMaybe I&#x27;m missing something here, isn&#x27;t this largely achieved by ONNX already?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onnx.ai reply vpanyam 10 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s a good question! There&#x27;s an FAQ entry on the homepage that touches on this, but let me know if I can improve it:> ONNX converts models while Carton wraps them. Carton uses the underlying framework (e.g. PyTorch) to actually execute a model under the hood. This is important because it makes it easy to use custom ops, TensorRT, etc without changes. For some sophisticated models, \"conversion\" steps (e.g. to ONNX) can be problematic and require additional validation. By removing these conversion steps, Carton enables faster experimentation, deployment, and iteration.> With that said, we plan to support ONNX models within Carton. This lets you use ONNX if you choose and it enables some interesting use cases (like running models in-browser with WASM).More broadly, Carton can compose with other interesting technologies in ways ONNX isn&#x27;t able to because ONNX is an inference engine while Carton is an abstraction layer. reply Dayshine 6 hours agorootparentONNX runtime doesn&#x27;t convert models, it runs them, and it has bindings in several languages. And most importantly it&#x27;s tiny compared to the whole python package mess you get with TF or pytorch.If carton took a TF&#x2F;pytorch model and just dealt with the conversion into a real runtime, somehow using custom ops for the bits that don&#x27;t convert, that would be amazing though. reply ZeroCool2u 3 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s an ONNX runtime, but to use the runtime you do need to convert your model into ONNX format first. You can&#x27;t just run a TF of PyTorch model using the ONNX runtime directly. (At least last time I checked.) Unfortunately this conversion process can be a pain and there needs to be an equivalent operator in ONNX for each op in your TF&#x2F;Torch execution graph. reply astronautas 7 hours agoprevMake it for Go, and I am sold. Running ML models in Go services is still an unsolved problem. reply liuliu 51 minutes agoparentThis seems to be a reasonable approach for Go, but you did need to carry a lot in your containerized environment (Go tends to have very lean container, and this approach requires a fat container with CUDA, PyTorch, Python etc). reply r0l1 6 hours agoparentprevWe have a similar high performance AI stack written in Go capable to load many different models from different frameworks. This is work of several years. Just saw your comment and thought about our company internal talk to release everything under an open source license. Thanks for reminding me :) What are your use-cases? reply astronautas 6 hours agorootparentWow, make it open source quickly!!! :hype:. It&#x27;s a classic Python REST API for model serving. But we have very low latency constraints. As such, rewriting in more high performant backend languages e.g. Go or Rust would substantially reduce resource usage (by reducing horizontal scaling need). Pre-baked model serving frameworks e.g. Nvidia&#x27;s Triton aren&#x27;t an option, since we have to query a feature store, and do some input feature tracking in between. Go seemed like an efficient, developer friendly choice, but there aren&#x27;t any well maintained model inference libraries in Go up to this day... reply huac 1 hour agorootparentWe used Triton Inference Server (with a Golang sidecar to translate requests) for model serving and a separate Go app that handled receiving the request, fetching features, sending to Triton, doing other stuff with the response, serving. This scaled to 100k QPS with pretty good performance but does require some hops.In general writing pure Go inference libraries sucks. Not easy to do array&#x2F;vector manipulation, not easy to do SIMD&#x2F;CUDA acceleration, cgo is not go, etc. I wrote a fast XGBoost library at least (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stillmatic&#x2F;arboreal) - it&#x27;s on par with C implementations, but doing anything more complex is going to be tricky. reply ramoz 5 hours agorootparentprevI’ve also ran models in Go, transformers even T5.

The claim is so obviously false, that I don&#x27;t mind. I would not expect support for INTERCAL or Awk.Yes, it does not deliver, but that does not warrant the personal attack. The author of Carton actually already had internships at Google and Facebook, and currently works at Uber. reply 3vidence 45 minutes agorootparentprevI gotta agree here, I don&#x27;t think the process of porting this to a wide array of languages is trivial.Additionally I would have some serious performance concerns when it comes to marshaling the data across languages boundaries. reply capableweb 2 hours agorootparentprev [–] Maybe you and I have different understandings about what \"Proof of Concept\" means, but if you&#x27;re supposed to deliver cross-language interoperability and have successfully delivered it to three different languages with wildly different runtimes, I think I&#x27;d consider that a successful proof of concept and since you&#x27;re demonstrated that the bindings works for at least two other languages, it&#x27;s more or less trivial to get it to work for N other languages, so this is clearly beyond the proof of concept stage at this point, and trying to reach a maturity stage instead. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://werd.io/2023/unions-work",
    "originBody": "Werd I/O Posts Links Technology About CV Subscribe Unions work The Writer’s Guild of America seems to have received everything it asked for: Delivering on issues that many scribes saw as core to their profession, the deal contains big leaps in AI guardrails, residuals and data transparency for writers — leaps that could be transplanted into the upcoming negotiations between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA, which could start in the next week. This is a great example of how unions can really work for their members. Hollywood is a broadly-unionized industry, as we’ve seen for the last five months, and the result has been real gains in writer equity and compensation in the face of technology changes like streaming and AI. Of course, at least in America, most industries are not highly-unionized. 10.1% of wage and salary workers were unionized in 2022, down from a peak of about a third, which coincided with income inequality’s lowest point. Generally, unionized workers make 18% more (20% for African Americans, 23% for women, and 34% for Hispanic workers). Tech is often the home of a particular kind of libertarian thinking that is often anti-union. But that, thankfully, is changing. In 2004, a third of tech workers were in favor of unionization; twelve years later, it was 59%. These days, prominently recognized tech unions include the Alphabet Workers Union, but firms have engaged in nakedly union-busting activity, from big tech companies like Apple, later-stage startups like Instacart, and supposedly public interest organizations like Code for America. (It’ll be no surprise that Elon Musk’s Tesla was found guilty of illegal union-busting tactics). Regardless, the industry would gain immensely from unionization — and more and more tech workers agree. It’s not so much about wages as recognition and a say in how these companies are run. Last year, Jane Lytvynenko, senior research fellow on the Tech and Social Change Project at the Shorenstein Center wrote in MIT Technology Review: […] Silicon Valley companies don’t see more protests about wages from their white-collar employees—those workers get stock options, good salaries, and free lunch. But such perks do little to address structural discrimination. My hope is that examples like the WGA’s win will help spread this idea that there should be a counterbalance to corporate power, and that the people who do the work should have influence over how it is organized. If you’ll pardon the pun, tech workers should own the means to push to production. Allworkers should have a say in how their companies function. And I believe — still crossing my fingers, because there’s a lot of work to do and a lot of gains still to be made — that this future is coming. In the meantime, congratulations to the WGA!

    "commentBody": "Unions workHacker NewspastloginUnions work (werd.io) 153 points by benwerd 1 day ago| hidepastfavorite208 comments braza 23 hours agoKudos for the WGA for the achievement.I partially agree with the statement that unions work. From what I see Unions are great and the current model works in situations where there are 2 monopolies, a monopoly of a work place and monopoly of workforce.In this case the WGA is the monopoly of workforce and the Hollywood is the monopoly of workplace.Along the history I saw that this dynamic worked and got advancements for the workers (especially during the industrialisation phase of several countries).However, when this dynamic is broken what happen is that the “losing side” in a negotiation will start to see alternatives to reduce the dependency of this monopoly.One clear example is the automotive industry that invested in high amount or automation, offshoring, and in a streamlined supply chain to reduce that exposure. I do not have any number but I would bet that Tesla today can have a high operational margin in comparison with Ford or GM.For IT I think several companies, specially in this down market, are starting to do the same thing doing offshoring or nearshoring of SWE, hiring folks abroad to avoid the risk of unionization due to the fact there’s no monopoly of SWE as a workforce. reply callmeal 22 hours agoparent>I would bet that Tesla today can have a high operational margin in comparison with Ford or GM.Of course they can, and we know where that margin comes from:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2017&#x2F;may&#x2F;18&#x2F;tesla-wor... Ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, dizziness, seizures, abnormal breathing and chest pains, according to incident reports obtained by the Guardian. Hundreds more were called for injuries and other medical issues. ... “I’ve seen people pass out, hit the floor like a pancake and smash their face open,” said Jonathan Galescu, a production technician at Tesla. “They just send us to work around him while he’s still lying on the floor.” reply andrei_says_ 23 hours agoparentprevAre you implying that it is unions that cause corporations to seek offshoring, automation etc.?From where I stand it’s a constant race to extract more from workers and unions and possibly legislation are some of the very few forces impeding it. reply zeroonetwothree 22 hours agorootparentInasmuch as unions increase the cost of labor, employers will have a stronger incentive to replace it with capital.It’s one reason we haven’t seen much advancement (until recently!) in automated food preparation (vis-a-vis industrial factories)—the labor has been very cheap. reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentAny human worker will increase the cost of labor compared to automation. Even at slave wages, automation wins every single time. Employers are, and long have been, 100% incentivized to automate the instant it becomes technologically feasible.Research and advancement in automated food preparation has never stopped. They were working on the problem in the 1970s with automatic vending machines, Fast food in particular has been salivating at thought of throwing out human workers for ages. (see for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deseret.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;8&#x2F;11&#x2F;19740875&#x2F;mcdonald-s-flips-... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wfmynews2.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;mcdonalds-testi... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;mcdonalds-hires-7000-touch-scre...)The very second that the tech is ready and reliable enough, it&#x27;s a done deal. No worker will ever be as cheap as a robot slave. reply braza 22 hours agorootparentprev> Are you implying that it is unions that cause corporations to seek offshoring, automation etc.?Not for this _single_ reason. The decision for offshoring&#x2F;nearshoring is a multifaceted one.Companies that have the risk to be locked in a workforce monopoly and does not have the capability to offshore&#x2F;nearshore work positions, will fight with nail and tooth attempts for uniontization reply specialist 22 hours agorootparentprevYup. Capital pushes to commodify skills and labor.We as \"knowledge workers\" know this in our bones.Now that we&#x27;ve digitized and automated blue collar work, we&#x27;re tackling white collar work.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ouroboros reply doubleg72 19 hours agorootparentTell that to all the factory workers still moving parts around plants in small towns all across the US. Tell that to the healthcare workers at hospitals, assisted living facilities, and medical practices.

You live in a fantasy world. reply rexpop 21 hours agorootparentprevBut we haven&#x27;t \"digitized and automated blue collar work.\" Not by the a long shot. We&#x27;ve still got vast billions toiling in our service. reply specialist 19 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the skill level required for those billions of jobs? reply rexpop 15 hours agorootparentSkill level? It&#x27;s the same opportunity cost as any career. reply Spivak 23 hours agorootparentprev> Are you implying that it is unions that cause corporations to seek offshoring, automation etc.?Well that&#x27;s at least the spooky scary threat that companies use to get people to not join union so my bet is that it&#x27;s total bullshit and if they could already offshore their workers and factories they would have done so already. Milk those higher wages and benefits while they&#x27;re still here because they won&#x27;t change the calculus at all when compared to workers who will work for single digit dollars a day. reply billy99k 22 hours agorootparentThat isn&#x27;t the point. When the union is involved, they keep demanding hire wages and benefits and it gets to the point where companies are better-off offshoring.Just look at the automotive industry. They have not only been offshoring, but the unions have strangled them to the point where it nearly destroyed the industry.I will only buy non-US cars as a result of this (mostly because of poor qualit). reply specialist 22 hours agorootparentAccelerating inequity and record corporate profits are just a coincidence? reply Spivak 22 hours agorootparentprevThat makes no since because foreign companies are onshoring manufacturing. There&#x27;s a good chance your foreign car was made here.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Honda_Motor_Companyhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Volkswagen_Group_of_Americahttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyundai_Motor_Americahttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Toyota_Motor_North_AmericaThe fact that The Ford Dodge GM Chrysler Jeep Dr Pepper Snapple Group can&#x27;t make a quality car is on them. In real dollars American workers have never cost less.Those fat-cat union workers making… $45k&#x2F;yr. Don&#x27;t they understand how their greed affects our profits? reply wilg 22 hours agorootparentNone of those companies auto workers are unionized in the US. reply Spivak 22 hours agorootparentBut they&#x27;re still in the US and paying near identical wages to UAW plants so it&#x27;s not unions \"ever demanding higher wages\" that makes the difference.But maybe not forever since the UAW strike those unionized workers might gasp make the same amount they did pre-inflation in real dollars. The greedy bastards not taking a pay cut while the cost of the cars go up and those companies make record profits. Won&#x27;t you think of the poor owners who are demanding higher returns, I think we can all sacrifice for them. reply wilg 21 hours agorootparentOK replybko 22 hours agoparentprevI disagree that unions work. It&#x27;s mainly due to the fact that it treats everyone more or less the same based on some formula. For instance, they make decisions based on an observable set of factors like how long someone has been there and what education and training they have. But anyone that&#x27;s worked in the workforce knows this is very limited. People aren&#x27;t the same. Sometimes someone has been in an org forever but is utterly incompetent. Or someone may have all the certifications in the world but be completely useless. So its a dehumanizing sausage factory. Everyone knows two people may have the same title but one is much more productive at their job.The rigidness also extends to other factors. For instance, working at a bank we were not allowed to move our monitor to another desk. That was a union job. You had to put in a work order have someone show up eventually and move the monitor for you and get paid some fee. It introduces rigidity and inefficiency and there are constant turf wars. Person A can unplug the monitor but person B has to move it, etc. Or they may have to mandate things like \"moving is dangerous so you need a supervisor watching as the person move the monitor.Finally even if they do succeed at paying above market salaries, that introduces a new question: who gets the job? Paying above a market salary will necessarily result in a lot more workers than available positions. So you have gatekeeping. That leads to cronyism as above market jobs are dolled out to friends and family.A clear example of how destructive unions can be, take a look at police unions that regularly protect bad police. You see that across the board. I&#x27;ve known teachers in the teachers union that obviously phone it in every chance they get (i.e. showing educational videos during class time). This wouldn&#x27;t fly in a normal work environment, but due to the over-formalization of hiring, you can&#x27;t just let someone go for being incompetent or just not very good at their job. You have to jump through hoops reply blindhippo 21 hours agorootparentUnions are meant to be effective in situations where the balance of power between capital and labor is heavily tilted towards the former.In a situation where there is an actual competitive market and people can leverage their skills and experience towards better salaries on their own, the effectiveness of a union is much lower, though there is still industry wide benefits such as normalization of health insurance standards, anti-cartel advocacy, general working condition standards, etc.I think the police union example is a bit of a bad faith example - there is more to that one than just \"union bad, mmmmkay\" - it&#x27;s institutionalized power and would NEVER be a market driven situation.Teachers, generally speaking, work in a single employer market, meaning the power dynamic is again tilted towards the employer. Without a union, teachers would likely have even worse conditions than they currently \"enjoy\" in the USA (and frankly Canada). Hell even now they basically work overtime for free due to expected \"extra curricular\" workloads outside of school hours and in many cases have to supply their own materials just to be able to do their own job.Yes, there are disadvantages (as there is in all things). But these do not mean that unions are fundamentally broken. reply braza 21 hours agorootparentprev> A clear example of how destructive unions can be, take a look at police unions that regularly protect bad police. You see that across the board. I&#x27;ve known teachers in the teachers union that obviously phone it in every chance they getBut I think the counter argument here would be that for every bad cop&#x2F;teacher that get away with something due to some shenanigans of a Union, there’s cases also that the same Union provides a platform for someone innocent to not get fired.Let me place another perspective regarding why some unions are necessary that is for airline pilots.This is a classic case where you have a monopoly of workforce (qualified pilots with specific knowledge with low job transitivity) and workplace (exists in some specific location just a few airlines).In a hypothetical situation where the airlines start to enforce increase in working hours, reducing rest, and place strain on the workforce; the Unions has the organisation and power to balance that relationship and in some of the cases to help to shape the minimum regulation for the work conditions.In those situations with dual-monopoly and low job transitivity of the workforce I think make sense to have Unions. reply em-bee 17 hours agorootparentprevThe rigidness also extends to other factors.

If they are rigid, that&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what the majority wants. If they are flexible, likewise.Police unions are basically the worst example of a union. Cops are not \"workers\". They are on the side of capital, policing its boundaries (literally) that&#x27;s why they are so rotten! reply phone8675309 22 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s mainly due to the fact that it treats everyone more or less the same based on some formula.The beauty of a free market system is that if you feel that way, that the union bring mediocrity, you&#x27;re not forced to deal with them.

Its also tough when the president of the US is on the picket line and your industry depends on a federal bailout every decade or so. But that&#x27;s a while different story...> Not sure why you think non-union jobs are immune to cronyism and gatekeeping.Other places are not immune and if someone wants to hire their family member at an above market rate, he is free to do so. But it may raise a few eyebrows from greedy business owners. But paying above market rates is not by design. I would still like to know what to do if you have 100 equally qualified people trying to get the same over paid position. How do you decide?> Do you honestly think that the situation would be any different if police were non-union?Absolutely. You don&#x27;t see non unionized industries protecting workers to an extreme degree. Why would they? The whole premise behind unions is that management is not always aligned with workers interests. But now you&#x27;re telling me managers would protect literal murderers just because? It&#x27;s not consistent reply adamrezich 21 hours agorootparentprev> The beauty of a free market system is that if you feel that way, that the union bring mediocrity, you&#x27;re not forced to deal with them.

That&#x27;s a strawman. What is actually being said is that the owner of a business couldn&#x27;t make those profits _without_ the workers, which means that the workers, the people actually doing the work, share some of the credit for the success they bring to the owner and that they too should be entitled to at least some of share of profits.> enthusiastically pro-union people don&#x27;t see any problem with this line of thinkingYes, workers talking to each other about forming a union is a right they have by virtue of being a human being. Why does nobody flip this around and ask _what is the business owner doing wrong that their employees feel they need the protection of a union_?> somehow the idea of them starting a business themselves, as a co-op, is Literally ImpossibleFor some workers it actually is. The primary thing that distinguishes the owners of the business and the workers of the business is access to capital. It is asinine to assume that someone who has worked all of their life necessarily has access to the capital to start a business. There is a power imbalance here, and you have not addressed it here.> connecting and organizing people who share a common purpose or ideal is easier than it ever has been in human historyThis is what a push to unionize _is_. The owners have the ability to respond to this - it&#x27;s a growing industry of anti-union consultants and had made a few companies obscenely wealthy providing those services.> somehow it&#x27;s considered perfectly fine and just to do nothing like that on your own, but, instead, reap the rewards of others&#x27; risk and resources by pretending, after the fact, that they had never had any value to begin with—that it&#x27;s the workers and workers alone who provide the Real Value to the company, and always have, and always willSee my point above about this being a strawman. Nobody is saying that the person that starts the company has ZERO value. Far from it. All they are asking is fair compensation for their work that has enriched the owner, which they are not getting. Employee productivity has almost doubled but their wages have been stagnant. Far from workers acting like owners have no value, it&#x27;s the owners that are treating the workers as not having value. reply Jensson 16 hours agorootparent> What is actually being said is that the owner of a business couldn&#x27;t make those profits _without_ the workers, which means that the workers, the people actually doing the work, share some of the credit for the success they bring to the owner and that they too should be entitled to at least some of share of profits.So if the company is doing badly then the workers that are actually doing the work share some of the blame of that failure and need to pay at least some of the losses?Workers prefer fixed salaries instead of revenue share to avoid risk. This is a normal way to do things, workers don&#x27;t want to share profits and losses, they want a fixed salary. Moving to a profit share model would not make workers happy at all. reply heavyset_go 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not either or. You can be paid for labor, get equity and profit sharing at the same time. reply adamrezich 53 minutes agorootparentwhat possible incentive would the owner of a company have to give workers equity&#x2F;profit sharing while keeping all of the risk for himself? reply adamrezich 18 hours agorootparentprevwhy did you disingenuously disconnect the two parts of my sentence (regarding \"starting a business on one&#x27;s own being perceived as being Literally Impossible\" and \"ubiquitous instantaneous communication has made collaboration in shared purpose easier than any prior point in human history\", and then respond to them separately, as if they were two separate thoughts? they were two parts of the same thought, hence them sharing the same sentence.anytime enthusiastically pro-union people want to try to start a business on their own, together, by pooling their resources to collectively take on risk—if for no reason but to prove that unions don&#x27;t exist more or less solely to tear down existing things that weren&#x27;t built by the union themselves—they&#x27;re more than welcome to give it a shot. but, since this doesn&#x27;t really seem to happen, it&#x27;s really easy to continue to perceive enthusiastically pro-union people as outwardly appearing entitled to rewards for risks and resources that were not theirs.anyone can destroy—it takes considerably more effort to create. reply CamperBob2 22 hours agorootparentprevFor one thing, berserk cops could actually be fired if it weren&#x27;t for their union. reply heavyset_go 3 hours agorootparentLook at how the justice system, regulators and legislators treat cops who abuse their power.The reasons cops are allowed to beat and murder with impunity extends beyond a singular entity. reply phone8675309 19 hours agorootparentprevIt is not the union that is keeping those cops employed - they&#x27;re taken off the street, typically without pay - while their case is being adjudicated. What is keeping them employed is the doctrine of qualified immunity where they are rarely, if ever, held to account, criminally, for their behavior. reply dehrmann 22 hours agoparentprev> the “losing side” in a negotiation will start to see alternatives to reduce the dependency of this monopolyReally, it&#x27;s that you can&#x27;t hold back the invisible hand forever. If the deal was actually too good for workers, it leaves room for a foreign competitor to move in.It&#x27;s fine that the use of AI will be limited in TV and movies, but once it&#x27;s good enough to actually write shows, a new AI-driven studio will do that, and Hollywood doesn&#x27;t control distribution well enough to stop them. reply VancouverMan 22 hours agoparentprevThe impact of unionization on the customers&#x2F;consumers should be considered, too.My experiences dealing with unionized workforces in Canada as a customer&#x2F;consumer have generally not been good at all.Such workers often exhibit tremendous inefficiency, a lack of care, and disinterest. This results in low-quality service&#x2F;work, and a bad experience for the customers&#x2F;consumers involved.This is particularly noticeable when dealing with government employees who are unionized, such as public school teachers, some public hospital staff, the police, public transit system staff, and bureaucrats.Unionization in such cases creates an environment where there&#x27;s no incentive to perform well, as there&#x27;s pretty much no downside to the unionized worker for providing terrible service.While private sector unionization can result in a similarly-bad customer&#x2F;consumer experience, at least there&#x27;s often some degree of competition involved, which can give customers&#x2F;consumers an alternative when service is remarkably awful. The bad service isn&#x27;t as unavoidable as it is in the case of the public sector.The content out of Hollywood matches this pattern, too. I&#x27;ve found it to be among the least-entertaining, least-interesting, and lowest-quality content around. I&#x27;ve had much better results with content from small, non-unionized, independent creators. reply supertimor 10 hours agorootparentI mean, Hollywood unions have been a thing since the 1930’s, pretty much since the inception of the “Talkies.” So any loss in quality that you claim will have not been due to the unions.In fact, the most likely culprit of any loss in quality is likely do to the studios and producers who have cut down on budgets, prep time, filming time frames and staffing which makes the existing workers have to constantly scramble to make a good product. And because of the staffing shortages, workers don’t have the same opportunities to learn the ropes from more experienced workers, so the ladder has effectively been broken. The unions are actively fighting the studios on these points because they care about the future of the industry. Without the union backing up these workers, the loss in quality would have likely been even worse than it is now.Not every union is the same. Hollywood union members are incredibly hardworking, regularly working 60-90 hours a week in very physical and stressful jobs. Many of these workers are highly skilled and take their job very seriously. And they would be much worse off without the union advocating for them.Bad customer experiences happen in all type of businesses regardless of union status. That shouldn’t distract us from the fact that many people that would otherwise be exploited would be far worse off if they didn’t have a union to represent them. reply Keegs 22 hours agorootparentprevThe things you attribute to unionization are, I think, a bit of a stretch. Hollywood especially. Actors and writers have been organized for a long time. Smaller studios like A24 with a reputation for making good movies when larger studios milk existing franchises still use organized labor. reply specialist 22 hours agorootparentprevIn what ways would non-union government employees be better? reply nebula8804 22 hours agorootparentIm not OP but when I think of bad government employees, I think of this jerk at my local post office that has been there for at least 10+ years(I am in the US). Always unhelpful, always making a simple task of sending a package as hard as possible by yelling, complaining about alignment of address labels, providing improper advice on the best way to ship different items causing me to spend a lot more money than I needed to or preventing me from using certain services to ship specific packages that others workers would allow because of his misunderstanding of my package description.My only recourse to alert anybody of this issue is to fill out a survey. I&#x27;ve been filling out that survey for years. There is no feedback loop to enact change. There is no other \"manager\" there. How would I even find a manager?I could go to a competitor but that would not affect them and there are some services that other competitors are not allowed to perform (USPS is the only one that can perform letter mail service by law and others will just take your letter and put it in a larger parcel).This situation sucks so much that I am reduced to trying to visit the post office at hours that I think he is not there or take a long trip to another town&#x27;s post office. reply specialist 21 hours agorootparentAgreed, we need flexibility to fire people. And, honestly, I&#x27;ve never been real clear why civil servants, eg admin and staff, are unionized.Unions are not uniquely impotent wrt their \"bad apples\". Every organization is afflicted.This phenomenon seems to be holding all of society back.Ideas?(FWIW, my main motivation for being pro-union & pro-labor is profit sharing. Corporate welfare and record high profits while most people struggle really pisses me off.) reply zeroonetwothree 22 hours agorootparentprevPresumably the idea is they would be motivated to do a good job or else be fired. Whereas now they are immune from firing unless doing something egregious.I don’t really agree with that though as the real reason is the government has no competition. If McDonalds does a bad job at service you will go to Burger King. But if the DMV does a bad job well tough cookies what are you going to move to Sweden? reply heavyset_go 2 hours agorootparent> But if the DMV does a bad job well tough cookies what are you going to move to Sweden?You engage in the democratic processes to effect change, versus the \"choice\" between what other non-democratic entities are willing to give you. reply simfree 22 hours agorootparentprevEven with unions King County already does 3 year \"temporary\" contract positions for all new hires in some departments, and the City of Seattle is driving a hard line of only a 2% COLA increase in contract negotiations.Outside of the SPD Guild, unions don&#x27;t have much leverage to retain underperforming employees. Document the failure to perform a handful of times and that employee will be gone, with at most a grievance filed where you get to reiterate how they repeatedly failed to deliver at work. replytimbit42 23 hours agoprevThey do but an even better option is worker cooperatives which bring democracy and fair profit sharing to the workplace. reply thebradbain 23 hours agoparentWGA is a guild, technically, not a union — because most writers are 1099d by studios, not actually full-time employees. Hence the need for collective protections, as contractors in the US have much less guarantees than W2 employees, and thus a co-op structure is almost infeasible any way you look at it. reply TheCoelacanth 22 hours agorootparentWGA as a co-op obviously wouldn&#x27;t make sense. The studio itself is what should ideally be a co-op. reply mcv 17 hours agorootparentOr the WGA should start creating their own movies, of course. reply ShrigmaMale 23 hours agoparentprevI agree. I&#x27;m kind of surprised more unions haven&#x27;t taken responsibility for opening up co-ops. They have lots of money to do it, it&#x27;s pro-worker, and it enables them to own the means of production.Unions ironically act very conservative these days. They could take some bold steps to potentially create very worker-friendly, worker-owned shops, which would create a voluntary, non-coercive path towards the \"market socialist\" structure many people advocate.Even in large industries like automobiles where this is hard, they could probably start doing something like smaller-scale parts production and sell those. reply Jensson 23 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m kind of surprised more unions haven&#x27;t taken responsibility for opening up co-opsBecause that requires skillsets they don&#x27;t have. People with the skills to start, manage and run companies usually aren&#x27;t workers so not a part of the union, and I doubt the union members would be happy if the union spent lots of money to hire managers to bet on a startup. reply treyd 23 hours agorootparent> Because that requires skillsets they don&#x27;t have.This is reductive, union organizers have management skills that would transfer over if needed. The reason co-ops are not more common is moreso because there aren&#x27;t the same kinds of institutions that support their growth like there are for traditional companies. reply treis 23 hours agorootparentprevBecause the real title should be Unions Work For Union Members. Unions became unpopular for a reason. Some were (and I assume still are) outright criminal organizations. The better ones were happy to sell out future workers with two tiered pay structures and by rotting out the companies they worked for.In practice they have just been another layer of economically unproductive people siphoning off value. reply neon_electro 22 hours agorootparentUnions are working to fight the two tier wage structure you speak of; are you aware? UPS&#x2F;Teamsters is one such example. reply treis 21 hours agorootparentBecause after 15 years the balance of power has tipped from those who sold out to those that were sold. reply neon_electro 20 hours agorootparentOk, so can you explain how that shift in the balance of power does NOT invalidate your parent point? reply treis 14 hours agorootparentBecause it&#x27;s still the union doing what&#x27;s best for union members. The only thing that&#x27;s changed is what&#x27;s best for the union members. reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentunions should work for their members.

Smart and strong enough to get abused by the Company? lmao. Talk about being fucked so much you start to like it reply em-bee 18 hours agorootparentprevthat&#x27;s because unlike in europe unions in the US did not manage to get the same level of worker protection changed into law. US unions need to act like a mob because corporations are to powerful. compare that to eg. germany where there are more laws to protect employees so that pretty much the only job unions have left to do is to negotiate salaries and benefits. reply weatherlight 22 hours agorootparentprevThe United States has a rich history of effective organized labor.

This might be seen as a pyrrhic victory 20 years from now. reply aldousd666 22 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not a business owner or a CEO, and I can say wholeheartedly that I do not believe unions are good for anybody. It&#x27;s just like rent control that gives renters lower prices but it destroys the supply eventually. Unions that get wage hikes by stomping their feet and yelling in public are not making the economy better. The detriment is that over time, it makes it harder to hire new workers because the union will get all up in your business if you try to fire someone for non performance. Union shops also make it harder for individual workers who stand out to negotiate higher salaries for themselves. On balance I think unions are a big bad. reply tehjoker 22 hours agoparent> if you try to fire someoneSounds like a manager lol reply xnx 23 hours agoprevI&#x27;m conflicted about unions, but it would be truly amazing if they brought us the 4-day work-week the way they got the 8-hour workday and weekends. reply gumby 23 hours agoparentI built my house using union labor. Having seen the quality of welds from some non-union welders it was a no brainer. Overall quality of the rest of the work (carpentry, plastering everything) was worth it. reply VancouverMan 22 hours agorootparentIs there something that such unions in your area do to ensure that a worker&#x27;s skill and ability matter far more than, say, who their relatives happen to be? reply gumby 21 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like in Vancouver, but I have lived in Massachusetts and there it&#x27;s not really a union issue: the corruption is equally present in, say, government (e.g. until recently there was a whole county all of whose land had been taken away but that remained solely so jobs like sheriff, bailiff etc could be handed out to relatives in cronies. Anything with a large flow of money (e.g. the Big Dig) gets openly looted. I&#x27;ve been told the same is true in Chicago, but I don&#x27;t know directly. As far as the unions go, indeed, the lack of seriousness about the work is how, for example, the Ted Williams tunnel killed people, with no repercussions.OTOH what passes for corruption in California, where I live now, would make an east coast politician laugh. Certainly in the trades (welding in particular, but all sorts of construction I needed) the quality of work was top notch. And why not? In construction, at least, there is no reason to use union if you don&#x27;t want to and most don&#x27;t, which leads to the the shitty quality of residential construction (there should be more of it but that&#x27;s another issue).Perhaps one thing is regulation. We once bought a pressure vessel that arrived with a small ding (if bad, it&#x27;s an opportunity for an explosion). We called the pressure vessel unit in Oakland and someone arrived in 45 minutes which means he&#x27;d dropped anything else and and hopped into his car as soon as we hung up the phone. Even before he arrived we got an annoyed call from the mfr (as it turned out all was well...but the pressure vessel unit wanted to see for themselves). While he was there we showed him a piece done by a former contractor who had not been able to produce the union tickets. We had fired them because the work was safety critical (high pressure steam is no joke) and the contractor was suing us. One look at the piece and he yanked out his phone. Let&#x27;s just say later that day the contractor&#x27;s lawyer couriered over a document cancelling the lawsuit, a cashier&#x27;s check for money already paid, and a request that we not countersue. Those guys are not fucking around. reply tim333 2 hours agoparentprevRegulation on work hours, holidays and the like is better handled by government legislation on the whole. I mean it works ok in France for example. reply londons_explore 23 hours agoparentprevA good chunk of employers will let you work a 4 day workweek in return for a 20% pay cut.For most people here on HN, you could probably survive on a 20% pay cut - you&#x27;d just have to have the kids share a bedroom rather than having one each and a guest room.Downside: Those on a 4 day workweek really struggle to get promoted to senior positions. reply toomuchtodo 23 hours agorootparentThe 4 Day Week movement is to not take a pay cut, as workers are already productive enough (and that productivity can be maintained in a shorter work week, proven by several pilot&#x2F;trials [1]). It&#x27;s incredibly disingenuous for folks opposed to a 4 day week to say workers need to be even more productive [2] to obtain a shorter work week to maintain existing pay (at least in the US, where pay has been stagnant for almost half a century [3]).If a 4 day week is codified into labor law and regulation, there is no game theory consideration vs some orgs with 4 day weeks competing with those with 5. Would you work 6 days a week today (for example)? Probably not, unless you&#x27;re an outlier of some sort, and you don&#x27;t see many orgs with a mandatory 6 day work week (because they wouldn&#x27;t be able to retain talent). This is about pulling a policy ratchet to reduce the work week at scale for everyone, because the productivity already exists (it&#x27;s just been funneled to the top wealthiest population, traditionally).\"It always seems impossible until it&#x27;s done.\"[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.4dayweek.com&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.4dayweek.com&#x2F;research[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;productivity-pay-gap&#x2F;[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;heres-how-labor-dynamism-aff... reply NoMoreNicksLeft 23 hours agorootparentDoes a nurse working a 32 hour week monitor as many patients as one who works a 40 hour week?Does a grocery store worker who stocks shelves stock as many cans of food and boxes of slop in 32 hours as he does in 40?It is absurd, disingenuous, and even sinister to suggest that their productivity is equal with a reduced week. There are hundreds, probably even thousands, of distinct jobs where this is the truth.There are relatively few jobs where equal productivity continues with the reduced work week. They are all office jobs.It is impossible that even if companies were forced to go with a reduced work week and were unable to cheat this regulation to any meaningful degree, that they would continue to pay the same for 20% less productivity. Worst case scenario for them is that they simply allow inflation to erode pay more than it does already. Given that even many menial workers earn above minimum wage, there are very few jobs where this isn&#x27;t possible (and those few jobs are likely part-time anyway, where this reform is irrelevant).If one truly wanted to help those who are hurting the worst, this is completely ass-backwards. It seems designed to make those who are already comfortable a little more so. reply supertimor 10 hours agorootparentA nurse is a pretty bad example to use for this. Nurses often already only work 3-4 days a week (doing 10 to 12 hour shifts). They’re already on a 4 day week (or 3 day). reply toomuchtodo 23 hours agorootparentprevFor sure, we&#x27;re going to have differing opinions based on life experiences, data consumption, and the resulting mental models. Outcomes are going to be driven by voting (politically) and unions. With union support being at the highest in history in the US, along with rapid electorate turnover (4M 18 year olds aging into voting each year, ~2M 55+ annual age out rate of voters), I&#x27;m hopeful workers will be able to secure a greater piece of the value they generate (through a combination of wages continuing to be pushed up and a shorter work week) at the cost of those currently holding substantial assets and wealth. There will be some inflation, that is inevitable due to the US freeloading on substantially underpaid labor for so long it has become accustomed to it (the federal minimum wage is laughably at $7.25&#x2F;hr for example [1]) as well as structural demographic compression of the working age cohort. Lots of macro unwinding that is going to be painful due to the poor economic choices made over the last half century. Importantly, most people under 30 didn&#x27;t have a hand in shaping these poor choices.> If one truly wanted to help those who are hurting the worst, this is completely ass-backwards. It seems designed to make those who are already comfortable a little more so.Very broadly speaking, the very wealthy have enough [2], and can make due with less. Tax them more if necessary [3]. Those hurting the worst are hurting because of greed and selfishness of a minority, not workers who have been taking it on the chin for decades. But, most unfortunately, the mental model that gets you wealthy heavily discounts luck and overemphasizes individual exceptionalism [4] [5], so these folks aren&#x27;t self aware enough to come to the conclusion on their own, leaving collective action and the legal&#x2F;political system as the most likely path to success.Again, the productivity already exists. Where do you think all of this accumulated wealth is coming from?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;minimum-wage-tracker&#x2F; (\"The federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009.

This has not been my experience, especially in tech. I&#x27;ve seen that work for \"shift work\" type jobs, even highly paid ones like doctors, but for \"product work\" type jobs like most tech, where there is essentially an infinite amount of possibile future work to do, companies are, generally, much less amenable to having people less than full time. reply avgcorrection 23 hours agorootparentprevMaybe some unions will let the shareholders get a 20% profit-cut[1] and the workers a four-day workweek in return for not starting a strike.[1] In reality less than that; see the autoworker strike in the US where they are demanding (among other things) a 40% pay increase, meanwhile those companies could really afford to pay the union members 100% more. reply mitthrowaway2 22 hours agorootparentprevFor a sense of scale, the difference in pay for the same hours and same role (and same individual), just for moving 200 km between Seattle and Vancouver, is something like a 40-60% cut in total comp before tax. 20% is small potatoes. reply timbit42 23 hours agoparentprevHave you looked into worker cooperatives? Ocean Spray is an example in the US. Mondragon is an example of one in Spain that has tens of thousands of workers and has existed for many decades. reply Aunche 23 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t characterize any agricultural co-op like Ocean Spray as the same category as a worker co-op like Mondragon. There is a very distinct line between a farmer, who&#x27;s an owner, and a farm worker, who handles most of the day-to-day operations. reply timbit42 22 hours agorootparentYes, I know a company in my country where the store owners are in a cooperative but the employees are not. reply hgdfhgfdhgdf 22 hours agorootparentprevI suspect you are not familiar with farmer cooperatives. They are not employee cooperatives. They are corporatives of private farmers. reply timbit42 22 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t talking about farmer cooperatives. Worker cooperatives are owned and run by the workers, thus the name. Certainly some cooperatives are not worker cooperatives. reply zeroonetwothree 22 hours agoparentprevAlthough unions fought for a long time for 8 hour work days it seems the biggest push came after Ford switched to 8 hour days (and doubled pay) and saw productivity and profits rise. It’s hard to give all the credit to any one group. reply morelisp 23 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s \"they\" because it&#x27;s people in the past. If you want unions to win new rights today, you&#x27;d better start using \"we\". reply charcircuit 23 hours agoparentprevWeekends and 8 hour work week is not necessarily a good thing. There could be benefits to switching to 996 work week to compete better with China. reply toomuchtodo 23 hours agorootparentCompeting with China is easy when their working population is compressing and getting old rapidly due to structural demographics [1]. The competition is between the extremely wealthy and the people who perform the actual labor that generates the value being vacuumed up by the former. I am no fan of the CCP, but at least they gave Jack Ma (a big supporter of 996 [2]) the boot [3] and overall, are a lot more adversarial with their wealthy system participants.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;chinas-shrinking-populati...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;business&#x2F;jack-ma-996-china&#x2F;in...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jack_Ma#Disappearance_from_the... reply asoneth 23 hours agorootparentprevFirst, there are obviously diminishing and eventually negative returns to increasing work hours past a certain point. At the extreme end, 168h&#x2F;week is clearly less productive than 40h&#x2F;week despite being more than four times longer. At some point an additional hour provides zero marginal benefit, and past that point an additional hour lowers a worker&#x27;s weekly productivity. That point may be 72h&#x2F;week as \"996\" Chinese companies suggest, 40h&#x2F;week as Henry Ford suggested, 32h&#x2F;week as some 4-day workweek experiments suggest, or something else.Second, even policies that provide some benefit to companies may backfire for society if they increase mental health problems, lower social cohesion, prevent family formation, and&#x2F;or cause their best-and-brightest to leave. At some level the best way to \"compete better with China\" may be to focus on maintaining sensible policies focused on maximizing an individual&#x27;s \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" alongside overall national productivity and let short-sighted competitors burn themselves out. (Similar to the strategy adopted during the Cold War.) reply n4r9 23 hours agorootparentprevBenefits to whom? reply londons_explore 23 hours agorootparentBenefits to the country tend to also be benefits to the people of the country - or perhaps their children. reply n4r9 23 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"to the country\". Faster economic growth? reply londons_explore 23 hours agorootparentFaster economic growth tends to lead to happier citizens.In fact, there is a philosophical school of thought that shows that happiness isn&#x27;t related to the environment one lives in, but the improvement that one sees through one&#x27;s lifetime. Economic growth can deliver that. reply n4r9 23 hours agorootparent> Faster economic growth tends to lead to happier citizens.What&#x27;s the evidence for this? reply mostlysimilar 23 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately all of that improvement is concentrated in the hands of the ultra-wealthy. reply phone8675309 22 hours agorootparentprevLook at this graph and rethink your post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;2013&#x2F;ib388-figurea.jpgProductivity has gone up over 200% but wages have stayed flat.

Unions are ruining this country. reply oldtechworker 23 hours agoprevnext [9 more] [flagged] nonethewiser 23 hours agoparentThat is precisely what a union is - a political block. Ostensibly the block is based on enriching workers. Although in practice its always about satisfying the union which varies in actual alignment with worker enrichment. In this case there is less alignment than you would hope for. reply giraffe_lady 23 hours agoparentprev> unions are for fighting for better conditions for their workers regardless of gender or raceRegardless of, but not blind to. Different workers do experience different conditions because of race and gender among other things, and unions need to account for those differences not pretend they don&#x27;t exist.> I could in no way trust a tech Union to actually fight for me and not against meYou probably didn&#x27;t mean it this way, but this strongly implies to me you are knowingly doing things that someone who cared about racial or gender equality would feel like they would need to fight. Why is that? reply nonethewiser 23 hours agorootparentIt doesnt imply that at all. The union by its own admission is treating members differently based on race. You cant claim that its good and not happening at the same time. reply zilchnotta 23 hours agorootparentprevNot the OP, but I feel the racially focused initiatives of today are misdirected, counterproductive, and themselves racist. And like you, I deem it as not in my best interest, or society at large, to endorse or support those who are doing the wrong thing (even if they are doing so with the best of intentions). reply oldtechworker 23 hours agorootparentprevI think we should have completely race and gender blind hiring and promotions. That enough is something someone that cares about equity is against, is it not? Being against equity, which is equal outcomes regardless of input, does not imply one is discriminating people by race or gender or harassing people. reply giraffe_lady 22 hours agorootparentWe don&#x27;t have race and gender blind life so what would this even look like? When you are asking me not to see something that I can perceive very clearly, I cannot call that wisdom. reply benwerd 23 hours agoparentprevTo clarify, are you saying that fighting systemic discrimination is a bad thing?From my perspective (as, for what it&#x27;s worth, a cis white man), ensuring all my colleagues have equity is a pretty strong win. I want my company to have the best working conditions possible. That means ensuring that the most talented people feel welcome there, regardless of their demographics. Which, in turn, means removing systemic ways that people from some demographics may not feel welcome or able to take those jobs. Where&#x27;s the downside? reply oldtechworker 23 hours agorootparentThe initiatives pushed in this article are themselves discriminatory. For example YouTube was sued because they were not hiring Asian or white men and fired someone for still interviewing them. That is discrimination, regardless of the goal, which was presumably to increase the amount of women or specific ethnicities. More diversity in tech is great sure, but not if it means racial and sexist discrimination. reply say_it_as_it_is 23 hours agoprevUnions also kill companies when executives refuse their demands: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Archie_McCardell reply sundaeofshock 22 hours agoparentHmmm… that’s a very interesting take an article that suggests the hubris of the CEO ended up destroying the company he was hired to lead. reply Steltek 22 hours agoparentprevThat particular example seems to be entirely the fault of a CEO who was terrible at his job. reply sershe 22 hours agoprev [–] So a guy is walking down the street and he sees a worker along the road; the worker digs a hole in the ground, then waits a little bit and fills it back in.

Valve doesn&#x27;t want anyone on CS:GO anymore, so they just updated all copies to CS2.For what it&#x27;s worth Dota 2 lives in \\Dota 2 beta\\ because they didn&#x27;t want people to redownload the game after launch, and probably didn&#x27;t want to break things by messing with paths for cosmetic reasons. reply Arrath 15 hours agorootparentCool, Steam uses some of the same version control methodologies as me!\"SeniorThesisPresentation_Rev3_7.23.09_finalfinal_ReallyThisTime.ppt(2)\" lives on. reply justsomehnguy 14 hours agorootparentIn \"DropBox folder - Copy\\Backup of the old notebook\\HDDRESTO\\BACKUP\\FROM486\" reply baby 13 hours agorootparentprevOh wow interesting, so you can’t play cs:go anymore?

OW2 introduced a battle pass riddled with dark patterns, removed all passive cosmetics collection while focusing on pushing cosmetics, changed gameplay balanced haphazardly for the worse to justify the \"2\" in the name, and the playerbase saw these hostile actions for what they are.CS2 does exactly none of these things and instead keeps the gameplay and social contract largely unchanged. Gameplay issues with smokes have finally been addressed, the game renderer has been modernized, and the playerbase reaction is overwhelmingly positive. reply sznio 4 hours agorootparent>the playerbase reaction is overwhelmingly positive.Looking at reddit, it doesn&#x27;t look like it, but that&#x27;s just reddit.

Then it tells you that it can&#x27;t run, because cs2.exe can&#x27;t be found. reply themoonisachees 14 hours agorootparentI had the same issue on Linux 4 hours ago, and then got a 37 GB update which fixed it.

They seem to literally copy that model. reply jamesfinlayson 15 hours agoparentprevAgreed, but it seems like they didn&#x27;t want to split the community again - people are still playing the original Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source as well and I suppose they didn&#x27;t want people sticking with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as well. reply gsich 16 hours agoparentprevBecause it&#x27;s more of an update than a new game. reply jakebasile 16 hours agoprevI wish I could get into this game, but I just can&#x27;t. The difficulty curve isn&#x27;t so much a curve as a wall (see also Dota 2) and there&#x27;s weird (to me) things like you can&#x27;t change ADS to \"hold the right mouse button\" instead of \"click the right mouse button\". The most I can do in it is play against some very dumb bots.Hope it&#x27;s a nice upgrade for the people who enjoy it! Good to see it has a native Linux build as well (I know all Valve games do, but in my experience native builds don&#x27;t always work as well as the Windows versions under Proton).Edit: I installed it and lo and behold they have an option to make aiming a hold vs toggle. Now the only barrier is my incredible lack of talent and skill. reply kupopuffs 16 hours agoparentgetting better at this game requires fundamental lessons that are hard to communicate (like counter-strafing, how important it is to have good aim AND good movement). AKA level 1and then there&#x27;s the teamwork aspect (comms, strats, etc...) aka level 2and then there&#x27;s the game sense (counter-stratting, countering opponents bad habits) aka level 3honestly the wall can be less intimidating if you work on your mechanics (level 1), which is the base of all of this reply jakebasile 16 hours agorootparentI probably wouldn&#x27;t get past level 1! Despite playing FPS for decades at this point I&#x27;ve never been able to develop super accurate aiming. I&#x27;m good enough for vs CPU games (usually) but against humans I end up with around 5-10% accuracy.Oh well! reply cube2222 16 hours agorootparentI used to have this problem, thinking I just can&#x27;t get accurate in FPS&#x27;s. Then I read that your mouse sensitivity should generally be around 30-60 cm movement to do a 360 rotation.Mine was more in the area of 5-10 cm for a single rotation (so that I could use just my wrist for movements), which is almost impossible to properly aim with.The idea is to do movements with your whole arm and micro-adjustments with your wrist. It&#x27;s annoying and weird at first, but after getting used to it your accuracy gets an order of magnitude better.Not sure if that&#x27;s your case, but thought I&#x27;d share if others had this problem. reply spartanatreyu 15 hours agorootparent^ It&#x27;s absolutely this.I always thought I played normal, but I needed this to be pointed out to me.If no one has ever seen an e-sports player&#x27;s physical movements, They have very light mice (under 75g), a mouse pad about 1m (3ft) long and move their whole arm left and right to turn their character 180 degrees while using just their wrist and flexing their fingers to fine tune the cursor onto the head for a headshot.Here&#x27;s how to improve:First, start reducing your mouse sensitivity by 1.5 total percent each day. This is so the change is gradual enough that you can keep playing games like normal, but you&#x27;ll have brought your sensitivity down to a more manageable level. This will also give your body time to build new muscles in your arm that you&#x27;ll be using for holding your arm out and moving your mouse (you don&#x27;t tend to use these muscles in anything else during the day. Don&#x27;t try to skip to the end even if you&#x27;re fit, because you&#x27;ll over exert some specific muscles in your arms that you don&#x27;t use because they&#x27;re hidden under other muscles).Once you&#x27;re at the point where you comfortably need to move your mouse about 60cm (2ft) to perform a 180 in-game, you should start looking at aim-training. There are aim-training games that will teach you how to flick, track, etc... (If you&#x27;re not exactly sure what these are, you will learn by watching some in-trainer tutorial videos) Aim-trainers are a lot more focused and intense specifically on aiming compared to regular games which means you build up specific skills in them much faster than regular games.Spend about 10-15 minutes a day in the aim trainer right before playing your games. This will train you, but also warm you up so you&#x27;re already playing well when you move to an actual game. The aim-trainer will track your performance and you&#x27;ll notice it gradually trend upwards bit by bit for about 6 weeks.By this point, you&#x27;re probably better in some ways than the average player. But you&#x27;re still going to get demolished by a few specific people you&#x27;ll run into online.To start facing those players, you&#x27;ll be able to go into your aim-trainer (which has recorded all of your stats so far) and see which specific skills you need to practice. reply Noumenon72 11 hours agorootparentDoes the game provide a button when you actually need to turn around, or do you have to pick up the mouse three times since the mouse pad is not 2 feet wide? reply baby 13 hours agorootparentprevPeople use different sensitivity. I remember downloading some famous players configs back on 1.6 and some of them had a tiny one and it was basically impossible to do a 180 haha. Some of them were way too extreme imo. But yeah lower sensitivity is a good improvement reply tstrimple 15 hours agorootparentprevThis also helped me improve quite a lot. Though there are two types of aim which benefit from different sensitivities. Tracking aim, which is what you’d use with weapons which require multiple hits to kill like SMGs or beam weapons. You’re tracking the player with your aim as you move. Lower sensitivity really helps here. Flick aiming is typically used for sniper rifles with one hit kill capabilities. You’re not really aiming so much as relying on your reflexes and experience to snap off an instant shot. Think of those crazy 360 no scope shots. These can benefit from a higher sensitivity than tracking.Unless you’re playing a game where you’re literally just using a beam weapon, you’ll likely switch between these aim modes frequently and naturally throughout a game and having multiple sensitivities that you switch between can really fuck up your “intuitive” feel when aiming. In those cases I try to find a happy medium. Something a bit higher than optimal for tracking but usable for flicking. reply bravetraveler 15 hours agorootparentprevHonestly aim only goes so far. A lot of it&#x27;s knowing crosshair placement (ie: aiming where someone would be around the corner) and comfort with moving.It helps to know rough timings for where conflicts first happen. You can filter out a lot of this posturing by having a sense of where the other team should be, given timingFor example, in B-tunnels on dust2 in CS:GO and 2. With a decent spawn point, the opposing teams meet at the stairs - favoring whoever was slightly closer. It may be best to simply post up, or push throughI&#x27;ve always been a mediocre shot compared to my peers, but my gamesense and calm nature has made me super useful on invitational teamsIf you&#x27;re into it, just work on consistency - the rest will follow reply baby 12 hours agorootparentAnother pro move is to aim on the wall where you crosshair will meet the target after you straff. So you aim at the wall, move left and now you’re aiming at the correct position without having had to move your crosshair, then move your crosshair again to the wall, rinse and repeat. reply kupopuffs 16 hours agorootparentprevaiming in this game is very precise due to the movement constraintsnot that I know what other games you&#x27;ve enjoyedBut mastering movement is paramount to having good accuracy reply scorxn 15 hours agorootparentprevAgree with these points, but at 1.5 I&#x27;d insert: intimate knowledge of the maps. \"Holding angles\" is such a profound advantage, and requires knowing the maps inside-and-out. reply baby 12 hours agorootparentYou can get there by just playing really slow. Always wait for your opponent, don’t push, etc. reply ThatPlayer 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is why I&#x27;m glad they added per-map ranks in competitive. reply tstrimple 15 hours agorootparentprevTo me this fits under the game sense category. I don’t think these are really a linear progression. It’s absolutely possible to get much better at “game sense” as a way of compensating for aim that isn’t that great. At high levels, you’ll see pros who can take out cheaters with an aim bot because they know enough about the maps and angles and game mechanics to overcome perfect aim and reaction time. reply JohnMakin 16 hours agorootparentprevsometimes it&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s just weird esoteric game mechanics - like for a very long time the distance you stand from a corner while peeking will determine if the enemy can see you before you see them. You will never learn that unless someone just tells you. reply kupopuffs 13 hours agorootparentabsolutely! some nuances are hard to learn reply mdhen 5 hours agoparentprevI reccomend playing arms race to get good at the mechanics of it. Constant fighting, a lot of fun, and if you&#x27;re not good at moving and aiming you&#x27;ll get good because it&#x27;s constant practice. reply baby 13 hours agoparentprevJust play fun games at your skill level, and&#x2F;or play with friends. It’s all about having fun. Don’t try to get into competitive games right from the start. Or if you feel like you can, join a team at your level. reply jakebasile 11 hours agorootparentOh no, I never meant to get into it competitively. I don&#x27;t get much joy out of that. But it&#x27;d be nice to have a PvP shooter I could screw around in every so often. CoD kind of used to be that for me, but it&#x27;s both gone in a direction I don&#x27;t enjoy and doesn&#x27;t work well on Linux due to anti-cheat. reply Corrado 7 hours agorootparentTry TF2! It&#x27;s super fun and not competitive at all. Sure, its a little gimmicky but most of the players are in it for a good time and don&#x27;t mind messing around a bit. reply dzogchen 16 hours agoparentprevI had the same experience, until a friend told me you really need a good monitor (144 Hz+) and a good mouse, otherwise you are hopeless in this game. reply themoonisachees 14 hours agorootparentThose help but they are definitely not required. CS is fundamentally a game about first aiming skill (which you have to train) and reflexes, and then with skill becomes a game about strategy and map knowledge. Obviously at the highest levels you&#x27;re not getting very far on a $5 mouse and a 60FPS monitor but you can get about halfway up up the ranks before it starts being a problem. reply Jnr 16 hours agorootparentprevJust mouse should be sufficient. Back in 2015 I managed to get up to DMG rank on Macbook with a decent Razer mouse. Now you can get gaming mouse with a good sensor for ~20 eur. reply baby 12 hours agorootparentprevYou need a good mouse anyway. The monitor heh reply leshokunin 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve played the beta for about 30hrs. I&#x27;m really enjoying it.The new grenades work so much better. Smokes can give you a small peek, flash grenades feel more fair, molotovs have the right mix of cluttering the view and preventing progress.Also love small details lile the shading being very dull during the buy time, and likening up when the round starts.The game feels very tight, and less likely to rely on exploits (\"put the smoke on this pixel and crouch here so you can see them!\") than before.On a minor note, I wish Valve&#x27;s reporting system was a bit more friendly. They could take some UX lessons or two from Overwatch. reply remram 1 hour agoprevI love a numbered series but if you are going to use numbers, use them in sequence. This is Counter-Strike 5.

My occasional playing is limited in time and scope and usually involves reliving some old titles... is this really a new normal? We&#x27;re also not talking about a big MMORPG with an incredibly wide world... Counter Strike is still a FPS you play on small maps right?(edit: I just rechecked to make sure it doesn&#x27;t say 8.5 GB, which would have also seemed a lot to me... I&#x27;m really getting old) reply GuB-42 15 hours agoparentRAGE, a game from 2011 takes 25 GB, with compression and blurry graphics. DOOM (2016) is 55GB and Doom Eternal is 80GB.The reason: huge textures, where every detail is unique and that look good up close. Let&#x27;s say you map the world at a millimeter scale, let&#x27;s a byte per mm2, 1GB is 1000m2, which is about the size of a typical backyard, small maps are bigger than that, have a bunch of them and you can get to tens of GB easily. Plus textures are not just colors. Normals, material properties, etc... are mapped to textures too.I don&#x27;t know how Counter-Strike 2 gets to 85GB, but if you want things to look good up close and avoid repetition you get these sizes. Also, storage is cheap, so if it makes the game look better, why not use it? reply jamesfinlayson 13 hours agorootparentI thought the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was already in the vicinity of 80GB and Counter-Strike 2 has launched with fewer maps hasn&#x27;t it? reply sznio 4 hours agorootparentCSGO was closer to 24GB. reply capableweb 2 hours agoparentprevThe storage requirement is inflated. On disk, CS2 takes 33,6 GB (36 090 429 440 bytes), which is less than 50% of the mentioned 85GB. reply spartanatreyu 15 hours agoparentprev85gb is large, but not that large.Halo Infinite is around 50gb but has compressed textures and audio so it can fit on a blueray disk for Xbox One (the third xbox). It&#x27;s a very cookie-cutter game and also far far smaller on biomes compared to previous halo games (I think it&#x27;s only 2-3: mountain grasslands, and desert on a multiplayer map, and interiors if together you want to call them a biome).PC games will tend not to use compressed textures and audio so the games load faster (they don&#x27;t need to spend time decompressing) so they can easily reach 85gb. Faster loads is more important in games where there are many matches.Borderlands 3 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare are about 135gb.ARK is about 250gb. reply jakebasile 15 hours agoparentprevMy wife asked me to install ARK for her recently, and it was 500GB. The ship has sailed. reply Arrath 13 hours agorootparentARK is the poster child of unoptimized messes, though.

Base game should be around 135GB, and you don&#x27;t have to install all the different maps at the same time since you won&#x27;t be switching between them frequently. If you want to run a dedicated server on top of that, those are around 25GB per map, so it is not that crazy I think. reply jakebasile 11 hours agorootparentNo idea. I am just reporting what I saw when I clicked \"install\" for her. I&#x27;m not into survival games so I don&#x27;t play it, I just know I was stunned at the requirement and that she had to remove other games to fit it on her PC&#x27;s SSD. reply capableweb 15 hours agoparentprevHigh quality models, textures, animations and more takes a lot of space, like a lot a lot.But, I just installed CS2 and I think it only downloaded about 20GB or so, that maybe decompresses to about 40GB in the end.

And I was a server admin for my clan so I know about tickrate.Many years later I tried Hunt Showdown and this is the first time I heard of server side kill resolution. That leads to a insane number of trades where both people die in the game and it also can lead to people killing you after you killed them (that is on your screen anyway).But what made me really skeptical about this was the how this opens up so much for cheaters, and Hunt did indeed have lots of cheater issues but I am not sure if it was all related to that. I think its more common these days Valorant also has server side kill resolving?So this seems like a new technique the is like both combined to me but this is just my quick guess, but still this makes me super skeptical because if the client can just claim \"I did this at this millisecond\" how can the server verify that its all legit? reply I_Am_Nous 11 hours agoparentPlaying Escape from Tarkov is fun. The server tick is higher than the player tick. AI use the server tick (since they are on the server) so AI bosses will often shoot you one time on your screen and then the death screen will show you received 6 or 7 bullet wounds which killed you in an instant. Server ticked and the AI fired for long enough that when the server finally updates your client you receive all the extra tick info at once. Barely see the boss?

At higher levels you’re more likely to find people toggling on cheats only for clutch game moments. They are objectively good players, but use cheats tactically to get that last bit of boost. One of these is far easier to detect and ban. So it can give the impression there are fewer cheaters at high levels.

    "originLink": "https://hachyderm.io/@danderson/111136144708450117",
    "originBody": "Create account Login Back Dave Anderson @danderson@hachyderm.io Today's fun rabbit hole: there's a mechanical watch feature called a \"hack\". Why is it called that? The hack (aka a \"hacking seconds watch\") is a feature where the seconds hand of the watch stops advancing when you click over to the time-setting function. IOW, as you adjust the hour/minute, the seconds hand is frozen in place until you finish the time adjustment. Sep 27, 2023, 08:23 · · Web · 30 · 42 1d Dave Anderson @danderson On 20th century wristwatches, this is implemented surprisingly simply: when you pull the crown out to adjust the time, a little spring called the hack moves and makes contact with the mechanical oscillator that makes the watch advance (it drives the pallet fork and escapement wheel, which produces the ticking sound) The friction from the hack stops the balance oscillator dead in its tracks, and the watch stops ticking until the hack is released. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson This mechanism became popular in WW2, because the US army put together specs for watches to be issued to soldiers, and one of their requirements was that all the watches must have a hacking functionality. In war films, if you ever wondered what a bunch of soldiers standing in a circle shouting \"hack!\" at each other meant: they're synchronizing their watches. They use the hack to stop their watch's motion, line up their times, and release the hack all in sync. 2 1d Dave Anderson @danderson For watch movements of the time, an ensemble of hacked watches could stay in sync to within about 1-2s per day, more than good enough for things like coordinating the time of an assault. But... why's it called the hack? Why are these watches called hacking watches? 2 1d Dave Anderson @danderson AFAICT, that goes back to the 18th century, and the dawn of precision timekeeping. Ships on the open ocean navigated by the stars. Using a sextant, the navigator could establish with quite good precision the longitude of the ship, via some simple math... provided they knew the exact current time at Greenwich. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson For a long time the challenge was that clocks and ships didn't go together. Clocks used big pendulums, and, well, ships roll and shudder and generally are not a good environment for swinging pendulums if you want them to be reliable. Plus, turns out gravity isn't constant! And the sub-1% variations in local gravity could lead to very significant error. So, there was great interest in developing a timekeeping mechanism that didn't rely on gravity. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson This was eventually solved, by the invention of the balance oscillator, which uses a coiled spring and a clever energy replenishment mechanism to provide a very precise oscillation movement that is independent of gravity. It depends only on the properties of the spring, and the discovery of the Elinvar alloy allowed for the manufacture of springs whose properties didn't vary with temperature - the last big obstacle to stability. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson Amazingly, the balance oscillator was _such_ a good idea that it's still how mechanical watches are built to this day. With increasingly small refinements, but the fundamental movement of an 18th century ship's chronometer and a Rolex you could buy today use identical principles. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson Anyway, problem solved, right? The balance oscillator allowed for the construction of chronometers that could keep time within a few seconds per year, which resulted in navigational error of just a few miles. By looking at the stars! Amazing. However, there's still a problem. The ship's chronometer is very expensive, very delicate, and very picky about its environment. It wants to be isolated from the ship's movement, and doesn't like salty sea air (rust!). 2 1d Dave Anderson @danderson So, the very expensive, finicky chronometer was kept below decks, in a dry room near the center of the ship, mounted in a gimbal so that it wasn't subject to forces from waves and the ship rolling, which would introduce error into the timekeeping. But you may remember, you can't see the sky from a small room inside a ship. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson And the navigational fixes from celestial navigation do care about the time down to the second, so you can't just get a fix in the sextant, then run downstairs and write down the time. What do? 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson Well, you issue the navigator a cheap, altogether more ordinary pocketwatch. Maybe it's good to within a dozen seconds per day. And cheap enough that it can be replaced if it rusts from the ocean air. The navigator goes to the dry room, synchronizes their watch to the ship's chronometer, then goes above deck and takes their navigation measurements, using their pocketwatch as the time reference. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson The navigator's watch, allegedly, was called the \"hack watch\". I think it's referring to the meaning of hack as a shortened form of \"hackneyed\", aka vulgar, commonplace, ordinary. You have your very expensive, delicate ship's chronometer, which is very good indeed at timekeeping, and you use that as a reference to adjust a hack watch, which will keep the time well enough for the next 30min while the navigator needs it to. 2 1d Dave Anderson @danderson So... I think that's where that comes from. The hack watch in the 18th century navy didn't have a way to stop the seconds hand, as far as I can tell, that only showed up in the early 20th century. So, I _think_ this feature of mechanical watches is called the hack because the term carried over from celestial navigation in the navy, where the hack watch's primary purpose was to be synchronized to the ship chronometer for establishing position. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson And so, at some point, the US military decided that the ability to synchronize soldiers' watches was important, and called that a hacking feature, presumably as a backreference to the navy term even though the application and purpose were pretty different. Anyway, that's been my adventure down the paths of history to explain a 5mm springy metal rod that shows up in some modern wristwatches. 2 1d John Mueller @johnmu@mastodon.social @danderson On manual watches, the feature to stop the second hand from moving while setting is called \"hack stop\". This is how you synchronize watches. Not all watch movements have this though. 1 1d Dave Anderson @danderson @johnmu Yes, see the rest of the thread :) 1 1d John Mueller @johnmu@mastodon.social @danderson Mechanical watches are fascinating. 0 1d Francis Gulotta @reconbot@toot.cafe @danderson It makes for a wonderful story and sounds very plausible at that! Thank you for sharing 1 1d Francis Gulotta @reconbot@toot.cafe @danderson I shared your thread with a watchmaking friend who I thought would like it. He responded! I’m curious now! > Very interesting read and tremendous deep dive. I think he’s a little off-base though. What he is writing about sounds more like a Tourbillon. Those type of movements have their origins based in ships and other large mechanical timekeeping devices, where accuracy was critical. They were designed to account for motion and gravity. 1 19h Dave Anderson @danderson @reconbot I don't _think_ I was thinking of tourbillons here, in that they came along in the early 19th century and (AIUI) their major benefit was elimination of gravitational effects on an imperfect balance wheel held vertically (such as a pocketwatch in someone's pocket). What I was describing here is Harrison's marine chronometers that won the Longitude prize in the 18th century, which included a lot of structural innovations that endure in modern watches. 1 19h Dave Anderson @danderson @reconbot Digging a bit deeper, in particular: Harrison's H4 chronometer used a balance wheel oscillating faster than other oscillators of the time (18,000 beats/hour, still a common oscillation frequency today), because he realized that rapid movement of a smaller oscillator allowed less error to creep in. It also contained the state of the art of spring temperature compensation of the time (bimetallic spring, not as good as invar but a century sooner :) ). 1 19h Dave Anderson @danderson @reconbot It's also one of the first uses of jeweled bearings for friction reduction (although not _the_ first, like most remembered innovations, a lot of the ideas were already floating around the industry and Harrison gets the credit for combining them well). That's what I meant when I said that the first \"really good\" marine chronometers still share a lot of traits with modern mechanical watches, in that the bones of the movement and why it's built that way were developed at that time. 1 19h Dave Anderson @danderson @reconbot ... But also, building the very best chronometer out of all of these techniques made for pretty expensive movements, so there was still value in a hack watch that was a bit less state-of-the-art, but still allowed enough short-term precision for navigation! 0 4h Colin the Mathmo @ColinTheMathmo@mathstodon.xyz Calling @Chartodon Spine ...

If you're ever in London, Greenwich Observatory has some interesting stuff on clocks and longitude, and in particular H4 ( https://www. rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/ rmgc-object-79142 ). www.rmg.co.uk H4Royal Museums Greenwich 0 1d Eric Lindvall @lindvall @danderson I feel like 1-2s/day is optimistic for the time. That’s still hard to achieve from multiple positions. COSC only requires -4/+6 seconds per day and lots of watches today don’t even hit that. 1 17h Dave Anderson @danderson @lindvall COSC standards are pretty exhaustive, in that they're testing for longitudinal performance over 15 days, in a variety of orientations and temperatures, compared to a much more stable reference clock. I believe in the military, squads would synchronize watches daily, and all the watches then run in similar conditions until the next resync. Under those conditions, 1-2s of drift between synchronizations should be achievable. Whether it was that stable in practice though... I don't know. 0 2h Jamie Gaskins @jamie@zomglol.wtf @danderson When I was in the army, whenever we would synchronize the clocks on our radios (required for frequency hopping), we called it a “time hack”, and I’ve always wondered where that came from. Everyone said it, but none of us knew why. 0 1d tadzik @tadzik@social.tadzik.net @danderson Another fun fact: on watches without this functionality you can usually \"back-hack\" them – switch them to the setting position, and slowly and gently nudge the crown as if you were to set the time backwards. It might make the time run backwards, but if you do it just right you can stop it entirely. I think it's even mentioned in manuals of the likes of Omega, in their non-hacking watches, as a way to set the time precisely. 0 17h Rick Rae @RickRae@fosstodon.org @danderson Fascinating thread; thank you! 0",

The mainspring powers the train, which eventually drives the escape wheel, and the escape wheel provides energy to the balance wheel via the pallet fork.(If you think about it, it&#x27;s obvious that it couldn&#x27;t be the other way around, else the watch would stop very quickly as the balance wheel runs out of energy).The pallet fork is driven by both the escape wheel and the balance wheel, at different points in the cycle. reply kqr 8 hours agoprevClock people have great words for things.

I was reading the comments because I knew someone would explain the purpose of it. I have both hacking and non-hacking watches. I know what they do, but I never knew why it was something people would even care about.Changing TZ when travelling is definitely a perfect use case for non-hacking movements. Also before and after DST. reply dave_universetf 12 hours agorootparentThere is also a feeling by some horologists and watch fans that the hack interacting with the balance oscillator and suddenly halting its motion is detrimental to the movement&#x27;s health and precision. I haven&#x27;t found any data to substantiate this, but I&#x27;m told that some watch aficionados prefer non-hacking movements for that reason. reply ksaj 12 hours agorootparentI can imagine this being the case, but the mechanics tend to be so accurate that I could see either being the case. I think the start&#x2F;stop action is so quick that it likely is not damaging. But I&#x27;m clearly not an expert on this.Another thing - in the comments someone mentioned military folk using hacking watches to sync their watches together. This use case I do know about, although for civilian purposes. We used to do it as kids, and became well aware of just how inaccurate all of our kiddie watches were. We used to sort of race them if our day was long enough. But they were accurate enough for our various games. reply dave_universetf 12 hours agorootparentIt does seem a bit silly to me as well, given the stresses that watch movements are subjected to day to day, and that the hack&#x27;s mechanical design barely touches the balance at all. It doesn&#x27;t take very much friction at all to halt these movements, so I struggle to see where the source of damage would lie. But, people have their opinions.And yeah, mechanical movements are technological marvels, and can keep incredible time for being a completely analog machine... But seconds per day is still about as good as it gets unless you take expensive measures (like the marine chronometers did) to get diminishing returns. And less expensive or well tuned movements can easily drift by a minute or two per day.In a way, we&#x27;ve been spoiled by quartz and electronic timekeeping. Now that GPS blankets the world and lets any timepiece continuously synchronize to within microseconds, \"seconds per day\" sounds ludicrous. And yet, it built empires and ran the world for a couple centuries! Especially for civilian use, it&#x27;s rare to truly _need_ better precision, aside from the general desire for perfection. reply CydeWeys 14 hours agoparentprevNota bene, a GMT does hack in the second crown position, so you can set it accurately to the second.And independent jumping hours is super useful while traveling across time zones. It&#x27;s a complication, in the same way that hacking itself is a complication. Both are harder to implement than a time-only watch without hacking. reply randomcarbloke 4 hours agorootparentTravel time is such a beautiful complication but so rare, I know of PF and Patek...maybe Ball aswell, I can&#x27;t remember. reply _fat_santa 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s getting more common. Seiko recently released the Seiko 5 GMT which for the MSRP of $495 is a steal in the watch world, possibly the most affordable GMT on the market now. There are lots of \"GMT Watches\" you see on Amazon and other places for much cheaper but all of those use Quartz movements. reply randomcarbloke 1 hour agorootparentI mean specifically the travel-time in Patek&#x27;s parlance; a jumping hour advance for a second hidden hour hand, the best contemporary example would be the Parmigiani Fleurier Tonda PF GMT. reply _fat_santa 2 hours agoparentprevOdd how various watch features are advertised. I&#x27;m in the Seiko collectors world and \"hacking&#x2F;handwind\" movements are generally seen as more desirable. Since Seiko Modding is pretty common (compared to modding other watch brands at least), the \"hacking&#x2F;handwind movement replacement\" mod is one of the most popular. reply ferongr 15 hours agoparentprevWhich is completely asinine, as mechanical watches, even expensive ones are inaccurate by many seconds every day. reply Ancapistani 13 hours agorootparent“Many” seconds per day strikes me as an overstatement.The Hamilton I’m wearing right now gains about 10 seconds per week. I set it about once every 3-4 months - that’s hardly an onerous task. reply silisili 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d say you got a lucky one. From Hamilton&#x27;s own site -> Most watches that do not have a chronometer certificate have an average course deviation of -10&#x2F;+15 seconds per day. To be called a Chronometer, the mechanical watch mechanism must have an average course deviation of -4&#x2F;+6 seconds per day. reply WrongAssumption 10 hours agorootparentThat’s a min&#x2F;max daily range that is influenced by factors such as movement, angle, temperature and magnetism.

Hacking prevention would make sense if they were ±2 seconds a month. reply Raidion 14 hours agorootparent1 minute a month (upper bound) is hardly a deal breaker. If you were adjusting the watch regularly without hacking (as a pilot) you&#x27;d have an error rate that&#x27;s probably close to 10x higher. 10+ minutes a month WOULD make a difference. reply throw0101a 4 hours agorootparent> 1 minute a month (upper bound) is hardly a deal breaker.For a relative measure: if you&#x27;re off by one minute when using a sextant, then you could be off by (IIRC) about 15 nautical miles.So one should at least know the average drift of the time piece if it&#x27;s being used for navigation, and it should be sync&#x27;d up with UTC&#x2F;GMT regularly.For regular day-to-day stuff, one minute is probably less dire. reply NhanH 13 hours agorootparentprev+- 2 seconds per day is their worst case specifications (watches being stored in weird orientation, with high temperature etc.).

I worry this might be a little of that, but it&#x27;s a fun story regardless. reply dave_universetf 12 hours agoparentCould well be! I have no specialist knowledge, I just got curious about the origin of the fairly random feature name, and went digging. The two well substantiated facts are:Hacking movements gained popularity between WW1 and WW2 due to army interest (and during WW2 US mil-spec for watches required a hacking feature, leading to e.g. the Elgin A-11 hacking watch).In the heyday of mechanical marine chronometers (late 18th century through early 20th, roughtly), common use was to set a hack watch to the sheltered ship chronometer, then go above deck with the hack watch to make observations.The link between these two facts is more tenuous, and basically boils down to: watches with a hacking mechanism would obviously be really handy for marine use, given how the hack watch was used; and military terminology routinely bleeds between the services, so transposition from a navy to an army context around WW2 wouldn&#x27;t be surprising.As for why the Royal Navy called these watches hack watches... I pretty much just ran down the dictionary definitions of \"hack\", including the archaic uses that would have been commonplace in the late 18th century, and made an educated guess. I would hope that there&#x27;s a book out there somewhere about this era of sailing that has a more substantiated take, but I don&#x27;t have such a reference myself. reply ghostpepper 12 hours agorootparentGreat post!This has nothing to do with watches per se but I was wondering which war movies include soldiers shouting \"Hack!\" because I can&#x27;t remember ever hearing it in a film. reply dave_universetf 11 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a sibling thread making the same point, and: yeah, I overgeneralized on that bit. The instance I had in mind was the M.A.S.H. TV show, which has a couple exchanges involving \"hack\" for time synchronization (unsurprisingly, by the most over the top soldierly characters). All I can offer as a defense is that it was late and I assumed that I couldn&#x27;t remember others for that reason. But looking around now, film usually goes with the more recognizable \"mark\".Here&#x27;s a memoir from a retired USAF airman where he recounts what the hacking procedure looked like, though: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code7700.com&#x2F;2023_time_hack.htm reply mherdeg 9 hours agorootparentReading this writeup, the procedure takes up to two minutes:* each person in the room pulls up the stem when their individual second hand is pointing at 0, and also sets the time to the prearranged hour&#x2F;minute,* then everyone waits a bit longer until this is done;* after another minute, everyone pushes down the stem simultaneouslyIs there an alternative where you could have some way to force your second hand to the 0 position rather than waiting up to a minute for it to get there on its own then freeze it?I do see why hacking is nice for time zone changes. replyking_magic 1 hour agoprevNon-hacking mechanical watches are a giant pain to set.
