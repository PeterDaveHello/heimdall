    "originBody": "“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.” — C.S. Lewis “In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.” — Douglas Adams Dear strangers, From the moment I discovered the Internet at a young age, it has been a magical place to me. Growing up in a small town, relatively isolated from the larger world, it was a revelation how much more there was to discover – how many interesting people and ideas the world had to offer. As a young teenager, I couldn’t just waltz onto a college campus and tell a student: “Let’s debate moral philosophy!” I couldn’t walk up to a professor and say: “Tell me something interesting about microeconomics!” But online, I was able to meet those people, and have those conversations. I was also an avid Wikipedia editor; I contributed to open source software projects; and I often helped answer computer programming questions posed by people many years older than me. In short, the Internet opened the door to a much larger, more diverse, and more vibrant world than I would have otherwise been able to experience; and enabled me to be an active participant in, and contributor to, that world. All of this helped me to learn, and to grow into a more well-rounded person. Moreover, as a survivor of childhood rape, I was acutely aware that any time I interacted with someone in the physical world, I was risking my physical body. The Internet gave me a refuge from that fear. I was under no illusion that only good people used the Internet; but I knew that, if I said “no” to someone online, they couldn’t physically reach through the screen and hold a weapon to my head, or worse. I saw the miles of copper wires and fiber-optic cables between me and other people as a kind of shield – one that empowered me to be less isolated than my trauma and fear would have otherwise allowed. I launched Omegle when I was 18 years old, and still living with my parents. It was meant to build on the things I loved about the Internet, while introducing a form of social spontaneity that I felt didn’t exist elsewhere. If the Internet is a manifestation of the “global village”, Omegle was meant to be a way of strolling down a street in that village, striking up conversations with the people you ran into along the way. The premise was rather straightforward: when you used Omegle, it would randomly place you in a chat with someone else. These chats could be as long or as short as you chose. If you didn’t want to talk to a particular person, for whatever reason, you could simply end the chat and – if desired – move onto another chat with someone else. It was the idea of “meeting new people” distilled down to almost its platonic ideal. Building on what I saw as the intrinsic safety benefits of the Internet, users were anonymous to each other by default. This made chats more self-contained, and made it less likely that a malicious person would be able to track someone else down off-site after their chat ended. I didn’t really know what to expect when I launched Omegle. Would anyone even care about some Web site that an 18 year old kid made in his bedroom in his parents’ house in Vermont, with no marketing budget? But it became popular almost instantly after launch, and grew organically from there, reaching millions of daily users. I believe this had something to do with meeting new people being a basic human need, and with Omegle being among the best ways to fulfill that need. As the saying goes: “If you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door.” Over the years, people have used Omegle to explore foreign cultures; to get advice about their lives from impartial third parties; and to help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. I’ve even heard stories of soulmates meeting on Omegle, and getting married. Those are only some of the highlights. Unfortunately, there are also lowlights. Virtually every tool can be used for good or for evil, and that is especially true of communication tools, due to their innate flexibility. The telephone can be used to wish your grandmother “happy birthday”, but it can also be used to call in a bomb threat. There can be no honest accounting of Omegle without acknowledging that some people misused it, including to commit unspeakably heinous crimes. I believe in a responsibility to be a “good Samaritan”, and to implement reasonable measures to fight crime and other misuse. That is exactly what Omegle did. In addition to the basic safety feature of anonymity, there was a great deal of moderation behind the scenes, including state-of-the-art AI operating in concert with a wonderful team of human moderators. Omegle punched above its weight in content moderation, and I’m proud of what we accomplished. Omegle’s moderation even had a positive impact beyond the site. Omegle worked with law enforcement agencies, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, to help put evildoers in prison where they belong. There are “people” rotting behind bars right now thanks in part to evidence that Omegle proactively collected against them, and tipped the authorities off to. All that said, the fight against crime isn’t one that can ever truly be won. It’s a never-ending battle that must be fought and re-fought every day; and even if you do the very best job it is possible for you to do, you may make a sizable dent, but you won’t “win” in any absolute sense of that word. That’s heartbreaking, but it’s also a basic lesson of criminology, and one that I think the vast majority of people understand on some level. Even superheroes, the fictional characters that our culture imbues with special powers as a form of wish fulfillment in the fight against crime, don’t succeed at eliminating crime altogether. In recent years, it seems like the whole world has become more ornery. Maybe that has something to do with the pandemic, or with political disagreements. Whatever the reason, people have become faster to attack, and slower to recognize each other’s shared humanity. One aspect of this has been a constant barrage of attacks on communication services, Omegle included, based on the behavior of a malicious subset of users. To an extent, it is reasonable to question the policies and practices of any place where crime has occurred. I have always welcomed constructive feedback; and indeed, Omegle implemented a number of improvements based on such feedback over the years. However, the recent attacks have felt anything but constructive. The only way to please these people is to stop offering the service. Sometimes they say so, explicitly and avowedly; other times, it can be inferred from their act of setting standards that are not humanly achievable. Either way, the net result is the same. Omegle is the direct target of these attacks, but their ultimate victim is you: all of you out there who have used, or would have used, Omegle to improve your lives, and the lives of others. When they say Omegle shouldn’t exist, they are really saying that you shouldn’t be allowed to use it; that you shouldn’t be allowed to meet random new people online. That idea is anathema to the ideals I cherish – specifically, to the bedrock principle of a free society that, when restrictions are imposed to prevent crime, the burden of those restrictions must not be targeted at innocent victims or potential victims of crime. Consider the idea that society ought to force women to dress modestly in order to prevent rape. One counter-argument is that rapists don’t really target women based on their clothing; but a more powerful counter-argument is that, irrespective of what rapists do, women’s rights should remain intact. If society robs women of their rights to bodily autonomy and self-expression based on the actions of rapists – even if it does so with the best intentions in the world – then society is practically doing the work of rapists for them. Fear can be a valuable tool, guiding us away from danger. However, fear can also be a mental cage that keeps us from all of the things that make life worth living. Individuals and families must be allowed to strike the right balance for themselves, based on their own unique circumstances and needs. A world of mandatory fear is a world ruled by fear – a dark place indeed. I’ve done my best to weather the attacks, with the interests of Omegle’s users – and the broader principle – in mind. If something as simple as meeting random new people is forbidden, what’s next? That is far and away removed from anything that could be considered a reasonable compromise of the principle I outlined. Analogies are a limited tool, but a physical-world analogy might be shutting down Central Park because crime occurs there – or perhaps more provocatively, destroying the universe because it contains evil. A healthy, free society cannot endure when we are collectively afraid of each other to this extent. Unfortunately, what is right doesn’t always prevail. As much as I wish circumstances were different, the stress and expense of this fight – coupled with the existing stress and expense of operating Omegle, and fighting its misuse – are simply too much. Operating Omegle is no longer sustainable, financially nor psychologically. Frankly, I don’t want to have a heart attack in my 30s. The battle for Omegle has been lost, but the war against the Internet rages on. Virtually every online communication service has been subject to the same kinds of attack as Omegle; and while some of them are much larger companies with much greater resources, they all have their breaking point somewhere. I worry that, unless the tide turns soon, the Internet I fell in love with may cease to exist, and in its place, we will have something closer to a souped-up version of TV – focused largely on passive consumption, with much less opportunity for active participation and genuine human connection. If that sounds like a bad idea to you, please consider donating to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that fights for your rights online. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who used Omegle for positive purposes, and to everyone who contributed to the site’s success in any way. I’m so sorry I couldn’t keep fighting for you. Sincerely, Leif K-Brooks Founder, Omegle.com LLC To contact Omegle, please visit here for more information.",

I have so many fond memories of meeting fellow weirdos over text. The days where StumbleUpon always took you somewhere exciting, cool, beautiful, interesting, funny, or novel. Where you looked at what people did with The Web 2.0 and only marveled at the possibilities of what could come. Truly feels like the death of one of the old guard, a Usenet-of-the-2010s.I even used it during pandemic times as a way to dance with strangers over video; putting on ridiculous outfits and playing disco were some of the moments from those dark times that I still cherish.RIP Omegle! You will be missed, by me and many others. reply justsid 7 hours agoparentI didn’t use Omegle much, but I actually met my now wife on there. We used the text only thing where a third person suggests a topic. Must’ve talked for a good 2 hours on there before exchanging informations, I shudder thinking that even the smallest glitch could have changed my life so drastically.We met 11 years ago on the platform, a completely random fluke. And while I haven’t really used Omegle in a long time, it’s always had a soft spot in my heart due to how much it changed the trajectory of my life. It’s a sad day. reply amatecha 2 hours agorootparentNo way! That&#x27;s awesome. You should reach out to the creator of the site and let him know about this (if you haven&#x27;t already). He&#x27;d probably be super happy to hear this story :) reply jacquesm 10 minutes agorootparentAny platform that is large enough will sooner or later become a &#x27;slice of life&#x27;. I&#x27;ve seen this with ww.com&#x2F;camarades.com, and it was fascinating to see that development up close.One of the most memorable ones for me was a terminally ill patient in a hospital that was still conscious that used our fledgling video meeting service to stay in touch with family members all over the USA. And random strangers dropping in to wish them well. Some people would protest that this wasn&#x27;t material that should be shown online but I always defended such uses because (1) it seemed like the right thing to do and (2) life has nice sides and darker sides and I don&#x27;t think pretending the darker sides don&#x27;t exist is a realistic position. reply prox 1 hour agorootparentprevMaybe its a good idea to collect a lot of these positive stories and get them up somewhere for all the peeps at Omegle to see. reply reliablereason 22 minutes agorootparentprevThe chance of a small glitch or anything that did not happen in the past is as likely as a ghost dinosaur coming up to you and scamming you out of all your money.Looking at the past through a probabilistic lens is irrational, unless you are doing it to predict the future through information collection.Sort of, of topic but anyway…. reply admissionsguy 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat was the suggested topic? reply eru 7 hours agoparentprev> Where you looked at what people did with The Web 2.0 and only marveled at the possibilities of what could come. Truly feels like the death of one of the old guard, a Usenet-of-the-2010s.This is funny to me, because I am old enough to remember when web 2.0 was new, and people were nostalgic for &#x27;web 1.0&#x27;. (And, of course, it&#x27;s turtles all the way down with nostalgia.) reply maegul 6 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s turtles all the way down with nostalgia.And yet golden eras do occur, or so it would seem.I’m sure it’s hard to tell when you’re in or near one, which is an interesting topic in its own right, but it doesn’t mean we should dismiss outright the possibility that a passing era might just be taking something truly valuable with it. reply gcanyon 4 hours agorootparent\"I wish there was a way to know you&#x27;re in &#x27;the good old days&#x27; before you&#x27;ve actually left them.\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ujJQyhB0dws reply eru 4 hours agorootparentprevEven a non-golden era can have something truly valuable.Btw, we are living in a golden age. The vast majority of humanity has never had it better. reply Emma_Goldman 1 hour agorootparentThat&#x27;s a bit simplistic.If you haven&#x27;t noticed, advanced economies are experiencing secularly stagnating growth, a crisis of democratic representation and its populist backlash, the return of oligarchic inequality to levels not seen since the gilded age, and extreme social atomisation and mental health breakdown.We are also all hurtling towards catastrophic climate change, an AI revolution that could lead to generalised technological unemployment, and some indeterminate level of conflict between the US and China.Unsurprisingly, therefore, most people in advanced economies look back on the post-war decades as a golden age - obviously there were problems, but there was high growth, full employment, good public services, strong unions, and comparatively cheap housing. Others look back to the 1990s as a time of untroubled horizons.Also, the global &#x27;we&#x27; is unhelpful. Have native Americans, Syrians or Greeks never had it so good? reply vasco 1 hour agorootparent> Also, the global &#x27;we&#x27; is unhelpful. Have native Americans, Syrians or Greeks never had it so good?Syrians are starving and in war, so they&#x27;ve been better. The other two examples, undoubtedly yes they are better than ever. For anyone to think it was better in any other time in history for most of the global population than now, shows such a lack of knowledge of history and the human condition that its hard to take serious. For someone so concerned with the future of humanity to create a problem with referring to all humans as \"we\" is a bit rich.Scrolling instagram and fake depressions aren&#x27;t worse than having 7 miscarriages, half your kids dying as babies or children, being enslaved, starving to death and a million other nice things most humans had to deal with that they don&#x27;t have to deal with now. Basic access to medicine, food stability etc, on a large scale is so much better. We have the fewest people living in poverty there ever was.Wanting to better ourselves and being aware the Maslow hierarchy continues to create infinite steps should not blind you to the amount of work millions of humans over generations have done to create such an easy mode version of the world for us. To not at least acknowledge it and just say it all sucks is myopic at the minimum. reply Emma_Goldman 47 minutes agorootparentRead the first sentence with which I began. I said it was simplistic, not that it was categorically and completely wrong, and certainly not that its opposite was true.What I object to is the extraordinarily simplistic, one-dimensional view of progress peddled by the likes of Hans Rosling and Steven Pinker.True, lot&#x27;s of material and medical indicators of progress have consistently increased. That&#x27;s to be celebrated. Certainly, if asked, the vast majority of people in the West would want to be born in the post-war years, and the average would probably slant towards the end of that period. Though I do think a good slice of people would choose against the post-2008 years in particular.But that binary - better or worse? - is a crude measure of societal health. It lacks any dialectical sense of modernity, of that fact the same socio-technological expansion which brought about that progress, has gone hand-in-hand with extreme oligarchy, world war, nuclear weapons, climate change, the anthropocene. Certainly, the risks of catastrophic global breakdown are greater today than ever before.I also think it has a superficial and philistine grasp of politics and the common good. Besides utilitarians, few political philosophers would so easily equate the good with material abundance. Hence why I pointed, by way of counterpoint, to today&#x27;s secular stagnation, crisis of democracy, inequality, and withering of public life. These are not small problems, but speak to fundamental pathologies in our body politic.> \"The other two examples, undoubtedly yes they are better than ever.\"Many native Americans and Greeks would viscerally disagree with you. Perhaps you&#x27;re missing something?> \"For anyone to think it was better in any other time in history for most of the global population than now, shows such a lack of knowledge of history and the human condition that its hard to take serious.\"As above, you have misread what I said, and I think trying to understand and evaluate society solely from the binary standard of &#x27;better or worse&#x27; is extremely crude. I have a PhD in history btw.>\"Scrolling instagram and fake depressions aren&#x27;t worse than having 7 miscarriages, half your kids dying as babies or children, being enslaved, starving to death.\"True, but I think virtually no one would say otherwise. This is an unhelpful caricature of the argument I was making. reply vasco 17 minutes agorootparentIf you think being able to take all variables you can into account and have your model spit out \"better\" or \"worse\" is crude, than you can&#x27;t be asked anything cause any answer to anything is crude.The question is simple, given any century throughout history, would a person prefer to be born in 2000 or any century before then, not knowing anything else about their life, where they will be born, who their parents are etc. I&#x27;m pretty sure a rational person will always choose 2000 as of today if they are choosing actually thinking of the consequences and not just \"I wanna cosplay as a cowboy\".If you don&#x27;t think you can answer that question you don&#x27;t have any knowledge. You fell into the trap of \"I learned how much I didn&#x27;t know and now think nothing can be answered because everything is complex\" which is a trap some people fall into. At some point laws need to be written and you need answers. What is simplistic to me is saying \"aw chucks it&#x27;s too complex, nobody knows if it&#x27;s better because for one person over there it&#x27;s worse\". Even complex systems have answers at the end, said another way, whatever the distribution or long tails or whatever, I can still calculate a median. You should \"roll up\" your knowledge into being able to still answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to something. And the answer is yes, the world is better to live in today, regardless of how much hand waving you do about specific subsets of people or caring about 2008 till now vs before as if that realistically mattered on a large scale of centuries of human existence. reply peyton 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe you’re thinking of a “gilded age” in the sense of Twain. The Golden Age of Hesiod and Ovid was defined by peace and justice amongst a golden race. It’s about ideals and peace rather than material prosperity. The metals debase from gold to silver to bronze to iron as conflict increases and the social contract breaks. reply Emma_Goldman 1 hour agorootparent&#x27;Golden age&#x27; is typically used to mean a historic age of comparative greatness from which society has since fallen.See the idiomatic vs. the mythological meaning on Wiktionary:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;golden_age reply pdntspa 59 minutes agorootparentprevThat \"golden age\" is a huge cop-out for any topic that doesn&#x27;t span hundreds of years reply chx 4 hours agorootparentprev> we are living in a golden ageI would&#x27;ve agreed pre-covid. reply DonHopkins 13 minutes agorootparentCOVID is what saved us from four more years of Trump (and perhaps many more after that of his family and Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and Steven Miller and Steve Bannon and the list goes on and on...). reply Eisenstein 2 hours agorootparentprevLess than 130 years ago 47% of all children in the USA died before reaching age 5.

Or at least this is what I might mean when using \"COVID\" as an epoch. reply TerrifiedMouse 1 hour agorootparent> rapid deterioration of our discourse and politics that accompanied itThat has been happening way before Covid.IMHO it started with the internet. Pre-internet the flow of information is gatekept by traditional media - newspapers, radio, TV, … etc. Everyone watched, listened to, read more or less the same things. This resulted in a more uniform set of opinions and more common ground between people.The internet broke all that. People could choose what they watch&#x2F;listen&#x2F;read and different people picked different things, coming to very different conclusions. In the past you could ask someone if they watched X last night and there is a decent probability they did. Today it’s much harder to find common ground - you could both be on YouTube but watching completely different things.Edit: Don’t just downvote. You got a problem with this post, say something. reply berdario 2 hours agorootparentprevA teammate caught Covid this week, and they&#x27;re now isolating.Another teammate&#x27;s family caught Covid last week.Me and my wife caught Covid in August.We&#x27;re all vaccinated afaik (myself with 5 jabs), and thankfully we only got mild symptoms, but the problem with Covid is how easy it is for it to spread.Do people in your life do a rapid test when they get sick?

Depression wasn&#x27;t something that was invented or discovered in the last decade. reply WilTimSon 6 minutes agorootparentBut openness about mental health issues and lower stigma around it is definitely a more modern thing, actually. I don&#x27;t doubt that some subsets of the population got more depressed while others feel better, but it&#x27;s very possible that rates would have been the same 30 years ago, had people felt okay with talking about suicidal thoughts, depression or a variety of other things that are at least a bit less stigmatised now. I&#x27;m not that old (or at least I like to think I&#x27;m not) but I can say with confidence nobody in my circle of friends 25 years ago would even think of saying they&#x27;re depressed or suicidal.

Watched Sleepless in Seattle a while back. I heard it was very popular back in the day. Well … I’m not that impressed, sorry to say. The plot is very simple and a little weird when viewed using today’s social mores. Direction and pacing is adequate.

Films like The Warriors, Class of 1999, and even A Clockwork Orange play into this notion that juveniles have become worse and worse and we can expect a hellscape from future generations of young people.Truth, though, is that Gen Zs are so laughably well behaved compared to those my age were that we finally have a period where this genre simply has no place. I hear things from my nephews and nieces about \"staying home for the weekend\" and think of all the money my sister wasted on a home security system to make sure they don&#x27;t sneak out and get arrested all the time like we did.

First the de-fi angle. You want a distributed application, no need to shoehorn crypto into there. But second and most important: the ultralibertarian angle of \"you chose to be there so you take respinsabolity for whatever happens to you\" is also not good. For one, there&#x27;s children. For another, moderation and law enforcement is a good thing. Whatever replaces omegle will almost certainly have worse moderation, a less benevolent manager, and less eagerness to cooperate with authorities to, for example, hand over evidence of child predation.

If I remember correctly, the original inspiration for Omegle came from 4chan; or more precisely, a user thought of stretching the limits of \"anonymous free speech\" to realtime communications, and came up with the idea in late 2007. The PoC server for it was nothing more than \"telnet to this IP\" and it was sporadically advertised on 4chan for a short while.Astonishingly, Google still remembers after 16 years: \"forced_anon chat\" (with the quotes) finds the very origin, if you want to go down that dark and probably-too-offensive-to-the-current-generation rabbithole. reply kr0bat 7 hours agoparentGod, they&#x27;re complaining about newposters all the way back in 2007.

When one makes a post on an image or discussion board, I think one does take into account that his words are going to be judged by the whole community. Even he isn&#x27;t worried about preserving some identity, he still identifies with those words and responds to the reactions they get, and I think that ultimately leads to self-censorship and conformity. When there&#x27;s only one person passing judgment, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the same negative impact, and what&#x27;s more you can hit F5 and dismiss the entire thing, whereas a post still remains. reply soulofmischief 3 hours agorootparentEternal September is an observable phenomenon whenever a new demographic in a community outstrips the old guard.

In 2019, Omegle made 3,470 reports to NCEMC, which increased to 20,265 in 2020 and 46,924 in 2021 (NCMEC, 2020, 2021, 2022). In 2022, Omegle filed 608,601 reports of child sexual exploitation to NCMEC (NCMEC, 2023), a 1197% increase on the previous year. This figure is higher than the reports made by very popular social media applications including TikTok (288,125) and Snapchat (551,086) (NCMEC, 2023). When queried by a journalist about this increase, an Omegle spokesperson reiterated the website&#x27;s ethos of personal responsibility but indicated that their moderation efforts had been augmented. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;26338076231194451I don&#x27;t support the business model of scaling up social networks while skimping on moderation to make it profitable. The user LTVs are so low that moderation costs are probably prohibitive for a service like this. While I deeply respect Omegle and their increase in moderation, maybe some business models are just unsustainable and not worth the externalities.IMO the real life analog is more akin to organising a festival with hundreds of thousands of visitors while only having a guy at the gate making sure you&#x27;ve signed a release agreement.

Another interpretation is that periods of hardship are followed by ones of stability and the generation that lived through the hardship notices differences in their young. reply johnnyanmac 2 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s measurable, but not in an agreeable fashion. I&#x27;m sure if you tracked curse words, or simply looked at the number or reports an admin has managed, you can track a change.But you then argue with the metric. Maybe curse words aren&#x27;t a good measure of hostility. Maybe the admin was overzealous, or underzealous and then corrected. That&#x27;s what makes it hard to come to a consensus.Anectodally, on the internet, I would agree. I feel post 2016 saw an uptick in hostility, and then the pandemic years of 2021&#x2F;2022 saw another uptick. reply _factor 3 hours agoparentprevIn developing countries, living conditions improve and reduce the perceived value of work. reply LarsAlereon 8 hours agoprevI&#x27;m really sad about this. I know that a lot of really desperate people used the text chat feature when they needed someone to listen, and there&#x27;s certainly a lot of people who are alive and happy today because they found someone to talk to there when they needed it. I can&#x27;t deny that there have also been cases where people&#x27;s lives have been made worse or ruined because of something that happened to them, but I think on the balance the site made the world a better place. reply thot_experiment 8 hours agoprevWow fuck, I was on there sketching portraits of people just yesterday.

Briefly used Omegle for the same, but even years back when I tried it the signal to noise was a lot lower. I&#x27;d love it if someone found a way to do it sustainably. reply system2 4 hours agoparentI met so many people from ICQ random friend searches. Met them in real life, still talking to some.

From my understanding, there&#x27;s no addictive, profit-maximizing matchmaking or anything going on - it&#x27;s just a service which lets two strangers talk to one another. Of course you will have bad actors target any platform, but for a lowkey site, it seems sad that they would need to shut down because of something like this. reply PheonixPharts 7 hours agoparentI found this passage particularly relevant:> Moreover, as a survivor of childhood rape, I was acutely aware that any time I interacted with someone in the physical world, I was risking my physical body. The Internet gave me a refuge from that fear. I was under no illusion that only good people used the Internet; but I knew that, if I said “no” to someone online, they couldn’t physically reach through the screen and hold a weapon to my head, or worse. I saw the miles of copper wires and fiber-optic cables between me and other people as a kind of shieldOmegle, as one of the last places that didn&#x27;t tie your activity to a real identity, inherently limited the possible harm. Obviously there were creeps on there, but not interacting with them was easy and the only way for anyone to seriously harm you was to give them information about who you were outside of omegle.A while back I was curious about what sorts of awful things could happen from omegle chats and when you look into it, every single case ultimately involves people continuing conversations via Snap or Instagram.It&#x27;s sad that this free, no-harm site has to shut down while Snap&#x2F;Insta routinely ignore legitimate criticism of their ability to encourage abuse and have enough lawyers to ensure they&#x27;ll never have to face any consequences for enabling abuse. reply yellow_lead 2 hours agorootparent> Omegle, as one of the last places that didn&#x27;t tie your activity to a real identity, inherently limited the possible harm.I&#x27;m not sure about that, hasn&#x27;t omegle been using p2p all this time?

Our brains form largely on the basis of neurons talking and connecting to strangers. Clearly that model works there. But then again the neurons are simple (relatively) cells with much more cohesive goals and behavior, while humans are complex entities with behavior ranging from the cooperative to the ghastly predatorial.Ultimately it seems any such service can&#x27;t be anonymous. Talk to strangers... fine. But you need to register first, with your name, face, age, and meet consequences for what you&#x27;re doing on the service, if your intent is less than noble. Alas this takes people and money which Omegle apparently didn&#x27;t have. reply krisoft 8 hours agorootparent> Our brains form largely on the basis of neurons talking and connecting to strangers.This is nonsense. Our neurons don’t talk to strangers. They talk with other neurons from the same individual. There is more in common between any two connected neurons than between two family members.And besides there is no reason to think that what happens between cells is a good model to base human behaviour on whatsoever. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparentyou&#x27;re taking a metaphor overly serious.Socialization is important (we have decades of documentation on how you can permanently damage a brain in mere weeks of solitary confinement), and we can&#x27;t nor shouldn&#x27;t have to base that socialization with the same relatives for your entire life. If only because we biologically have urges to reproduce and are aware enough of biology to know that family reproduction is a horrible idea. reply mquander 8 hours agorootparentprevFor people who agree with the libertarian stance, the optics aren&#x27;t horrible, of course, they are good.

Great org overall. reply dclowd9901 8 hours agorootparentprevYou’re acting like the ACLU hasn’t _specifically_ stood up for child molesters in cases about sexual offense notification.

The cases they take on now tend not to align with an absolutist stance on freedom of speech and due process.When Trump got elected, donations poured in to them amd they made a pretty clear turn to liberal causes. I think the days that they would defend the speech of deeply unpopular viewpoints on free speech grounds are over.This is their plea for donations: \"Abortion care, trans people’s right to live freely, people’s right to vote – our freedoms are at stake and we need you with us. Donate today and fuel our fight in courts, statehouses, and nationwide.\"Now I am not saying these are bad causes but it seems their priorities have shifted. They don&#x27;t seem to be defending deeply unpopular people anymore reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentAnd frankly, they always had a very selective list of things they bothered to get involved in. There are a ton of civil liberties they always avoided doing anything about.But they’re mostly irrelevant anymore - the causes they’ve started going after have a thousand other non-profits doing as much for, or better now. reply tomnipotent 7 hours agorootparent> But they’re mostly irrelevant anymoreThe ACLU war chest has been over $400M the last few years, with many thousands of people in pretty much every state working with the organization in some capacity.There&#x27;s absolutely no evidence to support your claims that either the ACLU is irrelevant, nor that it has somehow shifted its momentum considerably since 2016 in what class of cases it handles (especially given the age of the organization and number of shifts vs. overall societal&#x2F;cultural changes).On the contrary, I can find many recent examples of legal actions spread headed by the ACLU across dozens of issues all over the country. If you can&#x27;t find any it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not looking, though you can start with their Annual Reports. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentOh my, their annual reports!I got my impression from following the actual court cases and related news.

They are pursuing their first software engineer job. In conversation with them, I learned that they have a pretty wrong perception of this job. This is because the reality for these new kids is so skewed. Photo by Kieran Wood / Unsplash Last weekend I had a chance to talk with some students who just got their degree. They are pursuing their first software engineer job. In conversation with them, I learned that they have a pretty wrong perception of this job. This is because the reality for these new kids is so skewed. They only see good pay, remote work, team building, and pizza parties. These are all good perks, but no one is talking to them about the real things that we do in this job. As someone who spent a lot of years in this industry, I gave them a slap of reality in the face. I told them good things but also some hard-to-swallow truths. After reading this article, some people will say I am talking overly negatively about it. but my opinion is that these things go together with the job and you have to accept it. 1) College will not prepare you for the job This is the first thing I explained to these guys. To precisely describe how college will prepare you for the job imagine that you are learning how to swim. Your instructor spends a huge amount of time to describe you all the moves you need to make. He makes you recite all those moves, asks you questions about it and you have exams about it. But you never touch the water. After 5 years, you get a piece of paper that proves your swimming skills. Then the day comes, and you have to swim now. The guys in the swimming place just kick you into the water. You have a hard time breathing, you fight for your life. Maybe you will drown, maybe you will manage to swim. That's what the first 6 months look like for a freshly graduated student in a software engineer job. The college will prepare you for some basics, but what most of the colleges teach is so far away from day-to-day jobs. Most of the professors who teach at universities are not good software engineers. Only a small percentage of them even worked as software engineers. Also, the university curriculums are heavily outdated. They trot years behind the software development market needs. You have to put in extra work while you are in college. Code more projects besides homework and seminars. Do some volunteering. Learn about business domains to prepare for the job that awaits you. Most of the students don't do that. They wait until they get their diploma to start working on their portfolio. 2) You will rarely get greenfield projects In college or boot camps, you get a lot of smaller assignments that you write from scratch. Total freedom to express yourself. You can implement all the fancy stuff you learn, like algorithms or design patterns. The time you spend on those assignments is at most a few weeks, but mostly a couple of days of work. Typically those assignments contain at most 500 lines of code. In day to day job you are working with projects that contain multiple layers and thousands of lines of code. Multiple people work at the same time on those projects. You have limited freedom, you have to adapt to the project. The time you spend on projects is usually half a year to a couple of years. Sometimes you spend a whole week fixing the nasty bug. The fix is just a couple of lines of code. You talk with your colleagues. You exchange information about the project. You collaborate with them to get approval for your solution. New projects are rare, and most of the time you work on existing projects. You can consider yourself lucky if you get the normal project and not some old legacy project. 3) Nobody gives a f*** about your clean code You can forget that your boss will tell you: \"Congratulations on writing this elegant and clean code, I am gonna give you a raise!\". Quite the opposite, nobody cares about your clean code. Don't get me wrong, people will expect you to write good and clean code. Still, you will rarely get any praise for it. Except sometimes from your colleagues who will review your code. This may be a shock for some new folks, but it makes perfect sense. As a software engineer, your primary task is to generate value for users. Writing code is just a step that accomplishes that goal. You can think of it as the following cycle: software engineer writes code users get new features more users use your products company profits from products So code is just a tool to get profit. I have seen so many graveyards of projects, with horrible legacy codebases. Still, these projects are successful as they have fancy landing pages and solve user's problems. So users are happy to pay for using them. The user doesn't know how the codebase looks. The user just sees what features that product is offering. So don't get overly attached to your clean and elegant code. Focus on shipping the feature on time and bug-free. 4) You will sometimes work with incompetent people People have prejudices that only smart and competent people work in the IT industry. Especially the software development branch. But this is far from the truth. As in every job, you will sometimes have incompetent people in your environment. Working with them is very frustrating. They waste so much time and create a toxic environment. On top of that, they are extremely unproductive. All this reflects on deadlines and produces delays. This costs companies money and resources. Unfortunately, I also had experience working with those kinds of people. I have to say, they tested my nerves so well that I spent a good amount of time thinking of ways to get around their incompetence. Here are some advice: try to be efficient and productive as much as you can, focus on yourself and not on them try other options/solutions that don't involve that person in the process document everything you do. If things go wrong, you will have proof of their incompetence if you have a blocker because that person didn't do their job, try to ask someone else to unblock you (if it's possible) talk directly to them, be professional but not mean, and tell them what and how they can improve Remember that there is no need to be a jerk to them. Sometimes you don't know the whole story. I have seen some cases where a person just can't do their job properly. They are burdened with tons of tasks and doing work for 2 people. 5) Get used to being in meetings for hours Meetings are an important part of the software development job. Some of them are good, but some of them are just time wasters. There are recurring meetings scheduled on a daily or weekly basis. Most of these are not productive. The majority of them are forced by a person who is organizing them because that's the only \"work\" that that person is doing. It's just an empty protocol to prove their purpose of existence in the company. On the other hand, there are productive meetings. Those meetings ensure information exchange between team members or different teams. The majority of software engineers hate meetings. But remember that your job is also to communicate about things openly and proactively. Sharing information is crucial for projects to move forward. When you share information it can help other teams to better understand what you are doing and the opposite. 6) They will ask you for estimates a lot of times Business revolves around numbers. Every project has its cost, and to calculate the cost, management needs to estimate how long it will take to build a certain feature. Then, it goes down to software engineers to estimate their work. Usually, estimates are time-based, but sometimes they also ask for complexity estimates. In a lot of situations, you will have no clue how long it will take to build something. You read requirements, do some research and you give a number. Later, when you start to work on that feature, you encounter many problems that you weren't aware of when you gave time estimates. Then you need to compensate for the wasted and hope not to break the deadline. That's why it's always good to underpromise but overdeliver. For example, when your project manager asks you to implement feature X by Friday, you won't say \"Oh, I can finish it by Tuesday\". Instead, you will say: \"Sure, no problem\". Why? Because if you promise to deliver it by Tuesday and you run into some problems, you won't be able to fulfill the promise. Instead, if you accept Friday as a deadline, and you finish it by Wednesday, you can deliver it 2 days earlier. There are a lot of formulas on how to do estimates, and everyone has their own rules. I also have my own rules. If I need to deliver some feature, and I think it will take 2 days, I add roughly 40% more time to it, just to be safe. So, in this case, the estimate will be 3 days. Later, if I am done in 2 days, I can just deliver it earlier. 7) Bugs will be your arch-enemy for life The more you code, the more you are aware that bugs in the code are everywhere. When you are just starting with programming, you think you will code something, it will work fine and it's the end of the story. But in reality, it's a different story. There are countless things that can produce bugs: your own code - humans make mistakes, and you should not trust that code is working perfectly. You can write tests, but bugs can occur after that due to various reasons that you aren't even aware of. 3rd party libraries - those libraries are also written by software engineers like you and me. Always watch for activity and how frequently those libraries are updated. hardware failure - software relies on hardware. Mark Hanna explained what your software is without hardware in his quote: \"It's fugayzi, fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust. It doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart. It's not f***ing real.\" electricity - yep, hardware needs electric power to run, without it, it's useless. I worked on one project with Raspberry Pi. The client had constant problems with the device turning off at random times. After days of investigation, we finally found out the issue. He used a different power supply than the original one provided. Because of that device was turning off at random times. So the truth is you should assume that everything has bugs. That's why experienced devs never trust their code if it runs successfully on the first try. Even if the QA engineer reports a bug, assume that the bug ticket has a \"bug\" and check for everything. 8) Uncertainty will be your toxic friend In this job, you will feel uncertainty almost all the time. I already explained the estimates example above. That's just one example where you feel uncertainty. You give your best shot but you are not 100% sure you can finish the work in that estimate. Besides that, there are countless other things that are uncertain. Here are some examples: implementing something in your project you never worked with, eg. 3rd party API - how are you going to implement something you aren't familiar with transfer to a new project, with new technologies - you will think about how you are going to be efficient and productive with something you need to learn move to a new company - you are unsure how you are going to settle in and vibe with new people bug report on the day you need to finish the work - you fear that you are gonna break the deadline job security - economic situations, pandemics, wars, and other factors heavily affect this industry which results in layoffs the evolution of technology - you are never sure if tomorrow you are gonna be replaced by some new technologies like AI The good thing about uncertainty is that drives you to be a better software engineer. It demands improvements and learning if you want to stay in the game. 9) It will be almost impossible to disconnect from your job From time to time, I catch myself thinking about my job, problems, and bugs. Or things I have to do tomorrow when I should relax and chill. Sometimes, cold water in the shower wakes me up from my thinking about how I am gonna fix the nasty bug I worked on yesterday. I had countless squabbles with my girlfriend about why I am on Slack when we are on the beach. So I publicly admit, that I have a hard time disconnecting from work. It's especially hard to disconnect when you are working from home. If your laptop is on, you can always check emails or Slack messages. So to avoid all this: I turn off my laptop after I am done with the work, I put quiet hours on my mobile phone for my business emails I pause Slack notifications after working hours. I disable them on weekends. When my mind gets into this \"think about work\" loop, I try to immediately cut it out. I remind myself that rest and relaxation are important to be productive. I take long walks after work. On some days I do sports like padel or football. I try to engage socially as much as I can, avoiding screen time after work. Still, with all these steps I do every day, I fail a lot of times. 10) You will profit more from good soft skills than from good technical skills Technical skills are the ones you can learn easily. With different projects, you can understand a particular programming language. You can learn its syntax, pros and cons. It's just a matter of practice. On the other hand, soft skills are much harder to improve. Improvement takes a lot of mental strength. You must do things you are not comfortable with. You have to put yourself in situations where you can improve or practice particular soft skills. For example, communication is one soft skill that people always talk about. Let's say you suck at public speaking. You have to force yourself into situations where you can practice some public speaking. It's very hard to intentionally put yourself into situations where you know you will suck at. Your mind will do everything to avoid those situations. It will bring hundreds of excuses and it's easy to give up. Besides communication, there are other soft skills: teamwork learning mindset organization/time management emotional intelligence/empathy approachability persistence/patience confidence I have met a lot of folks who are good with technical skills but awful to work with. For example, one colleague would ask me for help a lot of times. I helped him a couple of times. Then, I noticed after we fixed his problems, he would come back to me and blame me for messing up other things on the project. Then I had to spend more time with him fixing stuff I wasn't even aware of. And because he was blaming me with such a bad tone, I stopped helping him. I would say that I have a lot on my plate to do, so I can help him tomorrow. Another example, I was the new guy on the project. A colleague (let's call him George) was assigned to help me with anything I needed. I set up the project pretty much by myself, but there was one error I was getting when I tried to run the project. I asked George for help. He spent maybe 2 minutes with me in total to solve a problem and said that he didn't know the solution. I thanked him anyway, tried to solve the error on my own but finally succeded with the help of colleague Michael. On daily standup, George said that he spent his whole day supporting me. I never asked George for help, after that. One more example, there was one colleague who was the main man on the project. Still, the whole team hated him (other devs, project managers, QA, designers, etc). He was a good software engineer, but a real jerk. Extremely rude in communication with everyone. He never wanted to admit he was wrong or accept constructive criticism of his code. Management tolerated him as he was always the loudest one in the room. When he finally resigned, the whole team was celebrating. With good soft skills, people will like you more and you have a better chance of getting a raise or promotion. If you are technically gifted but hard to work with, your chances are slightly reduced. Also, with good soft skills, people who know you will spread a good word behind your back. They can recommend you for the job, without even you knowing about it. Conclusion Software development is not a dream job. Working in software engineering often means long working hours. Most of the time, you are glued to a computer screen, with little work-life balance. The job demands an online presence, sometimes even after work hours. This often leads to stress and limited personal time. Additionally, job satisfaction is frequently hindered by tedious tasks. Depending on the situation you have limited career growth prospects. There is also potential isolation in remote work. And there is always a threat of job insecurity due to rapidly evolving technology. But, there is also positive stuff. Software development nurtures continuous innovation. Software engineers can create attractive applications and solve interesting problems. The global demand for software solutions across diverse industries is big. This means there is always a demand for good software engineers. Software development careers provide flexibility with remote work options. It's one big blessing to work from any location. Flexibility allows you to sleep in the morning without an alarm. You can work from your home in comfy pajamas. Also, you don't waste your precious time and money on commuting.",

It&#x27;s the equivalent to keeping a tidy workspace with others in mind. Teams should spend time narrowing down coding styles, naming conventions, and general rules together over time, and stick to them.As new people are onboarded, stick with those rules but have periodic moments where you solicit feedback from your team on the approach and make changes.It really does help to have a team agreeing on these things collaboratively, and ideally having a more senior person enforcing it during code review where it&#x27;s reasonable. reply AdamN 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s basically like a construction site - plenty of low rent projects are done in a totally disorganized \"get &#x27;er done\" way.

The metaphor I use is restaurant kitchens. Some kitchens are permanently greasy and look like a bomb went off. The best 5-star kitchens are a whirlwind of constant cleaning and mise en place.\"Clean code\" is useless when it&#x27;s an artistic aesthetic, but operationalizing the sense of \"everything has a place, clean up as you go\" has concrete value.

I know what the previous comment said.Modern C++ codebases that make extensive use of templates, inheritance, exceptions, type coercion, closures are considered clean by many because the code looks nice.

The hardest thing I had to learn as a professional programmer: There are multiple styles of good taste. You need to be tolerant. When I look at some GitHub code reviews, I cringe at the number of pure aesthetic (aka low value) issues that people endlessly nitpick about. It is discouraging towards contributors.I work on a team now where the three main contributors (including myself) all have _reasonably_ different programming styles (naming, whitespace, structure, const&#x2F;immutable, algos). Having read enough code from the other two: I am confident they are good programmers, but their style is different from mine. Still, we try very hard to accommodate each other&#x27;s style.

From experience, this pain is a red herring, it’s symptomatic of a specific kind of change: new features or bug fixes that require tight coupling of previously-authored-as-decoupled things. Clean code, architecture, whatever - it always falls over in the specific transition from decoupled-to-coupled.Why do programmers hate making those changes? They always require tossing out a lot of existing code. So I guess I could say the antagonist is inertia. Certainly has been my experience interfacing with vendors and BigCo developers. If you have the ability to suppress this feeling, to delete stuff that works but is not correctly coupled to the new problem, you will thrive regardless of the architecture. reply oweiler 15 hours agorootparentprevDevs also overestimate the difference their \"clean code\" actually makes. Architecture is much more important. reply gazonk 7 hours agorootparentTotally agree. reply bumby 16 hours agorootparentprevThe heart of your comment is true, but good organizations establish a set of standards for how they define clean code.

If your first reaction is \"damn, guess we can&#x27;t do that\" three is a good chance you have a mess on your hands.Clean code (yes some of this is just taste) is mostly a symptom that people have been thinking about this stuff, not a guarantee.There is a corollary though, which is difficult. Quality of design and techniques used mostly put an upper bound on the complexity the system can have before it becomes unmanageable. If it grows long enough though, it will get there. reply dkarl 17 hours agorootparentprev> In my experience no coding standards or cleanliness can prevent this.

Clean code is easy to read and follow and works in obvious ways, it isn&#x27;t necessarily the fastest or most efficient code and nor does it mean it has to use deeply nested knowledge of how the system works to function in ways that are non obvious to new readers. reply siva7 17 hours agoparentprevI wish people would understand this better. \"Clean code\" doesn&#x27;t exist. You should define (and automate) quality gates for your code base as a regular team excercise.

Tony Hoare said, \"There are two ways to write code: write code so simple there are obviously no bugs in it, or write code so complex that there are no obvious bugs in it.\" All code needs module-level or API-level acceptance tests so that anyone can change it and deploy it with confidence, but well-written code needs fewer low-level tests of implementation details. reply deathanatos 17 hours agorootparentprevI agree with what you wrote, but I&#x27;ve worked with people who balk at even automatic gates. \"Pass pep-8, as enforced by pycodestyle\" was practically too much for one coworker I had, who, when it was pointed out in review that \"the automated CI step was failing, can you please make it green?\", would fix like one violation, then just ping their reviewer? And around the mulberry bush we went. Various odd arguments like, \"well, my IDE has pycodestyle built in, and it&#x27;s fine\" (it seemed like his IDE had its own, separate, lenient config? … but like, nobody cares about your IDE…?) etc.At $different_employ, there was lots of thrashing of teeth pertaining to `yarn audit` running against the codebase, and failing people&#x27;s builds. Some people fought tooth and nail to get it to not fail the build, because they didn&#x27;t like that their new feature, which didn&#x27;t introduce any vulns. per se, was failed. Later, other people did much gnashing and wailing over being \"confused\" because the yarn audit step was red-X, and they were confused as to why it was breaking on their feature branch. It wasn&#x27;t: it was failing, but marked to be ignored, so the build continued. Other, required steps, were failing. (And were also marked with red Xs.) This was \"all too confusing\", and it was petitioned for yarn audit&#x27;s CI step to just \"fail\" with a green checkmark. You can imagine, I&#x27;m sure, how many vulns. were addressed after that point.I&#x27;ve also worked with devs who are just amazing, and aside from being brilliant in how they architect their code&#x2F;systems in the first place, … they have a definite tendency to view lint errors as just \"oh, oops, silly me fixed\" and just Get It Done.QC is hard.(Regarding our audit step, too: we also had an ignore list. You could just add the vuln. to the ignore list, and that would technically placate CI. Obviously not the best … but CI didn&#x27;t demand that you fix whatever the issue was.) reply yjftsjthsd-h 16 hours agorootparent> Some people fought tooth and nail to get it to not fail the build, because they didn&#x27;t like that their new feature, which didn&#x27;t introduce any vulns. per se, was failed.Well... yeah?

This seems to be the broader issue, with the audit in the pipeline a managerial attempt to get vulns somehow fixed without doing the work to figure out how they will be fixed and who will do the work.Someone actually needs to be responsible for it and be given time to do the changes. It seems like this was not done. reply deathanatos 15 hours agorootparent> Who is supposed to fix thisThe team of eng responsible for the code against which a vuln. has been detected, would be my answer.> This tells me that the responsibility isn&#x27;t specifically assigned.Well, no, for the very reason you&#x27;ve highlighted: PMs will be damned to have that time come out of their bucket. That is a problem, and I rather doubt this subthread&#x27;ll solve the idiocy that is PMs.Nonetheless, if we accept that vulns. are something the industry should pay attention to, i.e., that \"keep stuff using secure versions of dependencies\" is actually a best practice the industry should adhere to, someone has to triage the audit report, and then someone yet has to do the deed of correcting it.Yet both your comment & a sibling have advocated the position of \"no, drown the test result, don&#x27;t block builds\". If builds aren&#x27;t blocked, there is zero impetus towards ever fixing vulns., so they don&#x27;t get fixed, ever. You cannot, IMO, ignore human nature when setting up these kinds of QC checks in CI: if you make them optional they&#x27;re as good as dead, cause people are lazy.You&#x27;re missing the larger point of my comment, too: there is no sensible setting for that CI step. Say I don&#x27;t care about what the CI step does, say I don&#x27;t attempt to take a position in this idiotic debate. I can&#x27;t: literally any configuration boils down to one of two cases: a.) we&#x27;re flagging the problem, and devs don&#x27;t like that and whine and complain or b.) we&#x27;re ignoring the problem, and security people claim they don&#x27;t like that, and whine and complain.I think you&#x27;re also forgetting how software is actually developed in the wild by many companies: this example, like so many, use a \"monorepo\". I don&#x27;t like this (I&#x27;d argue for single-purpose repos, and it&#x27;d be obvious who the owner of a vuln. is, since the whole repo is only owned by one team.) but nonetheless I&#x27;m pretty consistently outvoted on this point, and the majority of firms out there seem to go the monorepo route. So, in a monorepo, \"who\" is responsible for a vuln. against a third-party dependency? (It can be figured out, but the answer is certainly not as straight-forward anymore!)(Single-purpose repos aren&#x27;t without issue here either: often I find in that case that establishing these sorts of \"common\" CI steps to be hugely problematic: you sort of have to c&#x2F;p a lot of code between repos, keeping that step&#x27;s code updated is then a PITA, and many CI systems lack good support for \"use this common step, perhaps not even located in this repo\".) reply f1shy 16 hours agorootparentprevAnything that can be automated for QC, should be.

The more your codebase is alive, the more likely that upgrades, features and fixes will go across the grain.It&#x27;s not like people are slobs, it&#x27;s more like a living house where busy people come in out of the rain or snow, or put dishes in the sink for later, or occasionally spill a plate of food on the floor and have to clean it.The ultimate proof of this is that the new AI models are VERY useful, but are stored as blob more similar to grey matter than structured modular code. reply Tainnor 17 hours agoparentprevI think the problem is that, while most people agree that badly factored code that drags down productivity is a problem, people can&#x27;t agree on how to make it better.

It was so ridiculous it honestly took me longer than I care to admit to understand what I was seeing, who the hell expects to see that?OTOH, we have a codebase at my current employer that opens up a TCP socket to a service and passes pipe delimited strings. And you know what? I give the thumbs up to that. Why? The service it&#x27;s communicating with is an old C++ service that was written around the time that XML started coming onto the scene.

Some things that I used to write, I would find insane now.But it doesn&#x27;t make the problem any less real. At my current job, I think our tests are really bad because they mostly don&#x27;t test what really matters (also due to too many things being spread out across several services) and instead are coupled excessively to implementation details.

Instead of saying what people want to hear (it&#x27;s simple and can be implemented quickly), you need to imagine the long-tail worst-case scenario where everything that can possibly go wrong goes wrong, then give that number. If people don&#x27;t give you a somewhat incredulous look when you give an estimate, you probably were too optimistic. Just remind them that you&#x27;re imagining a worst-case scenario and say that you hope to have it done sooner, but don&#x27;t back down on your estimate.Another thing to realize: at the business level, deadlines are often picked arbitrarily to create urgency. The specific date of the deadline is usually less important than just having some deadline, any deadline, to motivate everyone.

The probability of something unexpected popping up and inflating the time something takes by an order of magnitude is much, much higher than the likelihood of the same happening while cooking.This ends up coupled with the fact that practitioners (of anything productive) tend to think in terms of 50-ish percentile estimates (i.e., there&#x27;s a 50% chance this project is done in this amount of time), whereas business people care about 90th-99th percentile estimates.

Ask me why they no longer have that issue. replyTangurena2 19 hours agorootparentprevI think the reason that estimating is hard is that no one ever returns to their estimates and tries to fix the estimates. What usually happens is that people throw out a number, mismanagers think that number is negotiable, and whether the project&#x27;s completion is in any way related to the estimate - the estimate is forgotten.No one writes down \"this is why I think the project will take X [time units]\".And no one goes back to that estimate and says \"I left Y & Z out of that estimate, I better include that next time.\"If you want estimates that have any relation to reality, your estimating process needs to have that sort of feedback.> When people saying that estimating is hard...I think they&#x27;re referring to the sort where management negotiates the estimates, like you&#x27;re haggling over something in the marketplace. If they have such a strong opinion about how long something should take, then asking you for estimates is setting you up for failure and blamestorming. \"It’s one banana, Michael. What could it cost, $10?\" reply Joeri 16 hours agorootparentIn my experience writing out assumptions together with estimates tends to improve estimate accuracy a lot, by challenging the assumptions (and estimates) more at estimation time, and making it more visible when changes occur at implementation time that impact estimates.As for negotiating estimates down, it is up to technical leadership to refuse to do that. Not easy, but doable. reply madeofpalk 15 hours agorootparentprevOne of the most productive teams I worked on spent time at the end of an iteration to look back on our previous estimates and re-estimate them.

Lets prepare for approach Z while we&#x27;re also preparing for approach Y and evaluate and switch to approach Z as early as we possibly can. We still want approach Y so we&#x27;ll continue working on it even if we start using approach Z to successfully launch\".The issue is that there&#x27;s a fluidity in that thinking that many many MANY technical people either don&#x27;t have or don&#x27;t employ. reply sroussey 17 hours agorootparentprevTeams definitely refine and alter estimates as new knowledge of the problem space is discovered. It’s a management (and team) failure if this does occur.Also, on the negotiation side of time it will take, I absolutely know for myself that I can code things fast and functional but a bit hacky, or beautiful and elegant and will take much longer.The negotiation should be about when to do which.At a higher level, you put your teams together within their temperaments in mind and match that to the work.Some code will be a nexus of changes and interaction with other code (invest early), and some code will get written once and never seen again (go fast and forget). reply SpaceNoodled 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve streamlined the process, and just say that anything will take five days to complete. reply steamer25 17 hours agorootparentprevMy favorite is being asked to estimate a bug fix before I&#x27;ve had any chance to analyze the issue.It&#x27;s like calling a mechanic over the phone and asking how much it will take to fix your car.

How about you bring it in first, then we&#x27;ll look it over and go from there?Sometimes you can ask some questions and get to, \"Well it&#x27;s probably X which would take Y but we&#x27;ll need to see\".

Yet managers will force you still out and to the shop because of your time estimate. reply Volundr 16 hours agorootparentprevPart of estimating is accounting for those contingencies. Given above, depending on my audience the above estimate will be either 30 minutes, or 15 minutes but could be as long as 30 depending on these factors. Part of estimating is accounting for the setbacks one can (reasonably) expect to see, to give the other party a timeframe within which they can be (reasonably) certain it will be done.Of course there could be a fire on-route causing a jam that turns your 15 minute trip into 2 hours, but that&#x27;s sufficiently unlikely it&#x27;s probably not worth building into your estimate (but could be depending on the stakes involved! If someone is going to die you should probably factor this in so we can plan for that contingency). In that instance instead you need to communicate when it happens so that everyone involved can recalibrate. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 8 hours agorootparent> the above estimate will be either 30 minutesYeah, I had a PM who taught me to do this by doing it themself. My estimates are actually just doubled from how much I expect it to take when I know the design and can work with no distractions.I’ve also worked with managers who “negotiate” as others sometimes describe. Of these I see good and bad. One who was aware of short- and long-term goals of our team and asked for estimates so they could decide what features we need to include; another who already promised the features and the deadline and is asking me to tell them that they did not overpromise despite my observations. (“I don’t believe I’ll be able to deliver those features by that date.”)Others in between, including some who don’t like being told explicitly that I double the estimate. Worse still, the one who halves it as if to correct for some mistake.I guess the moral is that developers aren’t the only critical party when it comes to communicating estimates. Managers do their own job; good, bad, or otherwise.-------> depending on my audienceOther than some managers I assume another developer or a good technical manager, and it’s a good approach. Sounds at least similar to explicitly stating that you doubled your “no distractions” estimate. Too bad it seems that an unfortunate lot of people work with the bad “negotiating” type who might even be so disrespectful as to correct their co-worker’s mistaken opinion -- which they asked for!(Not to leave this as advice for the parent commenter.

Instead, if you accept Friday as a deadline, and you finish it by Wednesday, you can deliver it 2 days earlier.Or you can deliver it on Friday.I once had a boss that taught me an important lesson. Some other party (business unit or company, I can&#x27;t remember) asked for some work to be done. He said for me to not work on it right away. I said I could get it done in a couple hours, so why not do it right away? He said it was to manage expectations and not give the other party everything they want right away or they&#x27;ll come to expect it.Edit: I also wasn&#x27;t to start it right away because the work may not get done at all. Some of it was to delay to determine whether the work was even necessary. And some of it was to push back to ensure that we&#x27;re not ALWAYS giving in to every demand. reply WendyTheWillow 15 hours agoparentYeah, that&#x27;s... awful. The real problem isn&#x27;t that you do this, per se, but that you&#x27;re not incentivized to improve the business.

Plan your work, expectations of delivery should be on those milestones of sprint releases or whatever yard-stick you are using for planning. Simply doing work as fast as it comes in is a sign that you have no planning. No road map. No future outlook of feature sets. You are flying by the seat of your pants.This isn&#x27;t a lesson to learn, it&#x27;s an anti-lesson. Yes, don&#x27;t work on things right away and deliver right away as your \"customers\" will expect it, but why is that a bad thing? Why can&#x27;t you easily deliver features when they are ready? Why is this boss giving you such bad advice? reply justin_oaks 15 hours agorootparentI may have oversimplified it. There were certainly other factors at play in the boss&#x27;s mind.The other part of it was to not do extra work for the third-party when that work wasn&#x27;t specified in the contract. If you do extra work every time you&#x27;re asked then it&#x27;ll quickly be abused. You don&#x27;t want to seem like a contract stickler, but you also don&#x27;t want to bend over backwards either. It&#x27;s something to keep in mind. reply WendyTheWillow 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a maladaptive approach to the problem, is the point. You should have the communication skills to do additional work when you can and firmly say no when you can&#x27;t. That&#x27;s how an adult handles that situation rather than through deception and avoidance.Of course, there are external reasons that may make this more difficult, but IMO 2&#x2F;3rds of the reasons people cite for doing things like this are solvable with proper communication. 1&#x2F;3rd isn&#x27;t, though. reply throw555chip 14 hours agorootparentI understand their position, I recently had a chat with a guy in DevOps, I&#x27;d made a request I knew would take at most, 5 minutes. He said he&#x27;d try to get to it by the end of the week. That would potentially have caused my story to carry over to the next week.I opened a Teams chat and asked about it. He said his manager told them to manage expectations. He said he&#x27;d cut me a break since I was technical and would understand and got it done in 2 minutes. reply WendyTheWillow 14 hours agorootparentA classic book called The Phoenix Project talks about ways to manage this. If I recall correctly, teams can fall into a vicious cycle where they only respond to immediate problems and, therefore, cannot schedule and prioritize their work. By maintaining a work backlog that gets prioritized and saying no to everything else, the team can ensure their work capacity gets respected and not get flooded with more than they can handle.So, in this way, your DevOps coworker is right. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true when a team isn&#x27;t at capacity, which is the scenario I envisioned when I replied. In the case where it costs little to nothing to quickly meet another team&#x27;s request, the mature thing, IMO, would be to either a) do that thing or at least b) engage in good faith to put the task into your work backlog and prioritize it based on the larger impact of the overall project to the company as a whole. When a team isn&#x27;t at capacity, the work would be done immediately while simultaneously reinforcing the value of the process to protect your work capacity and prioritization ability. Everybody wins.I suppose this is what I mean by \"maturity\"; teams have established processes to protect the team, but if the process allows for additional work, it&#x27;s maladaptive to gum up the works just to keep expectations low....but that response is the \"full PM\" treatment; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d tell my boss or answer in an interview. In reality, I think of process as a \"backstop\" of sorts. You invoke process only when you&#x27;re reaching some kind of capacity or limitation. If it&#x27;s no sweat, just do it. reply reactordev 14 hours agorootparentThis is the way. If you aren’t at capacity then the manager can step in and say “yeah, we can do that, let me get a ticket&#x2F;issue&#x2F;record of it so we can track it” and then proceed to work on it. This works in Kanban really well. If you are at capacity or have planned a sprint already and are midway through the run, it’s ok to say no and get it prioritized in the backlog. If you’re DevOps and the Ops part of the role requires you to respond to tickets in a timely manner then this breaks down.What we are saying though is that having a plan is a good thing. Protecting the plan is a good thing. Adopting work and helping others is a good thing. The work being adopted needs to be planned and prioritized though. If it’s a small task (like the OP said, it was a 5 minute thing) than opening a chat with them about it after creating the necessary record is fine. The fact they agreed (regardless of classification that they were technical so they would understand) shows there’s hope in your org for empathy.What you shouldn’t do is say no to adopting the work while you sit back and play wordle until you feel the person has waited the necessary amount of time. Also, don’t write systems that require 14 approvals and a shaman and waiting 48 hours for a status change before you can begin work. reply winwang 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is conditioned on both parties having that level of maturity and good faith. reply WendyTheWillow 14 hours agorootparentNot necessarily; only in the worst cases would a coworker actively harm you for not helping them once you&#x27;ve established that you can.

Change, when it is theorized, is frequently attributed to exogenous factors. This paper, by contrast, proposes that institutional change can occur endogenously through population loss, as institutional losers become demotivated and leave, whereas institutional winners remain. This paper provides a detailed demonstration of how this form of endogenous change occurred on the English Wikipedia. A qualitative content analysis shows that Wikipedia transformed from a dubious source of information in its early years to an increasingly reliable one over time. Process tracing shows that early outcomes of disputes over rule interpretations in different corners of the encyclopedia demobilized certain types of editors (while mobilizing others) and strengthened certain understandings of Wikipedia’s ambiguous rules (while weakening others). Over time, Wikipedians who supported fringe content departed or were ousted. Thus, population loss led to highly consequential institutional change.

Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the American Political Science Association INTRODUCTION Institutions theorists seek to explain institutional stability and change. However, most accounts have a status quo bias, as institutions are portrayed as stable. When change is observed, it is typically through alterations of the formal rules of the institution. These changes are frequently attributed to easily observable exogenous factors, such as external crises, influxes of new ideas, or alterations in actors’ power. However, endogenous processes may also create change and their neglect biases our accounts of institutions. This paper advances a theory of endogenous institutional change whereby members of an institution react differently to the outcomes of disputes within institutions. Losers (or those who disagree with the outcomes of the disputes) may become demotivated and disempowered, whereas the winners (or those who agree with the outcomes of the disputes) may become galvanized and empowered. If the winners and losers belong to coherent camps with divergent interests and ideas about the institution, disproportionate exits by the losers can cause drastic institutional changes over time. The contribution of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that consequential change can occur solely endogenously and that population loss can be the mechanism behind such change. Footnote 1 The paper provides a detailed demonstration of this occurring on the English Wikipedia. Beneath the hood of this popular website exists a large community of volunteers (Wikipedia editors) who collaboratively write all Wikipedia content. This population of volunteers comes together in deliberative and democratic fora where they adjudicate what kind of content belongs on the encyclopedia. This paper shows that the English Wikipedia transformed its content over time through a gradual reinterpretation of its ambiguous Neutral Point of View (NPOV) guideline, the core rule regarding content on Wikipedia. This had meaningful consequences, turning an organization that used to lend credence and false balance to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism into a proactive debunker, fact-checker and identifier of fringe discourse. There are several steps to the transformation. First, Wikipedians disputed how to apply the NPOV rule in specific instances in various corners of the encyclopedia. Second, the earliest contentious disputes were resolved against Wikipedians who were more supportive of or lenient toward conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and conservatism, and in favor of Wikipedians whose understandings of the NPOV guideline were decisively anti-fringe. Third, the resolutions of these disputes enhanced the institutional power of the latter Wikipedians, whereas it led to the demobilization and exit of the pro-fringe Wikipedians. A power imbalance early on deepened over time due to disproportionate exits of demotivated, unsuccessful pro-fringe Wikipedia editors. Fourth, this meant that the remaining Wikipedia editor population, freed from pushback, increasingly interpreted and implemented the NPOV guideline in an anti-fringe manner. This endogenous process led to a gradual but highly consequential reinterpretation of the NPOV guideline throughout the encyclopedia. The paper demonstrates these processes through qualitative content analysis, archival research, and process tracing. First, to document a transformation in Wikipedia’s content, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on a sample of 63 representative articles. Content on the pages was analyzed across time with a predetermined coding scheme (see Boreus and Bergström Reference Boreus and Bergström 2017; Elkins, Spitzer, and Tallberg Reference Elkins, Spitzer and Tallberg 2021; Herrera and Braumoeller Reference Herrera and Braumoeller 2004). The analysis shows that the content changed over time from lending credence to fringe views to delegitimizing the fringe views. Second, to explain why these content changes occurred, the paper uses process tracing on Wikipedia’s archives, analyzing article talk page discussions about rule interpretations, related discussions on general noticeboards, arbitration rulings, and editor sanctions proceedings, as well as the histories of individual Wikipedia editors. Analyses of debates regarding individual articles lend strong support for the theory of endogenous institutional change. Article-by-article evidence is supplemented by an analysis of a sample of referenda where editors are asked to express their views about the NPOV rule’s application to fringe topics. The analysis shows that the disproportionate population loss is systematic across the encyclopedia, as editors who hold the pro-fringe view exit Wikipedia at a higher rate than anti-fringe editors. These changes occurred despite structural biases in favor of stability. Even though the rules and content on Wikipedia are constantly subject to change, the organization’s decision-making procedures are biased to a conservative status quo. All changes on Wikipedia must be approved through consensus and editors who act contrary to consensus are punished. Furthermore, the transformation was neither an inevitability nor likely outcome of the original design of the institution. A comparison to other versions of Wikipedia demonstrates the contingent nature of the English Wikipedia’s trajectory. For example, even though the Croatian and English Wikipedia share the same core rules, content on the two versions of Wikipedia looks drastically different, as the Croatian Wikipedia lends credence to anti-LGBT rhetoric and pseudohistory (Sampson Reference Sampson 2013). These outcomes were not intended by Wikipedia’s founders, as shown by their own delineation of the rules in the early years, and in the case of Wikipedia’s co-founder, a complete disavowal of Wikipedia’s transformation. This paper uses the understudied politics of Wikipedia as a lens through which to examine institutional theories of change. It has two major contributions. One is theoretical, demonstrating how population loss can be an endogenous mechanism of institutional change. Losses in institutional clashes can be demoralizing and inhibiting for the losers, leading them to abandon the institution and leaving the institution in the hands of their adversaries. The winners subsequently have freer rein to push for changes in the institution. This form of change may potentially have explanatory value regarding the trajectories of bureaucracies, political movements, political parties, and professions, as discontented losers within those institutions opt to leave their institution rather than fight an uphill battle against empowered and emboldened winners. The other contribution is empirical, as the paper provides a comprehensive study of the politics of Wikipedia, a highly consequential organization in the online political information ecosystem. The paper documents a heretofore undocumented transformation in Wikipedia’s content over its life span. While scholars and commentators have remarked in recent years on Wikipedia’s status as a beacon of information in an online space plagued by misinformation, there is no comprehensive analysis of a transformation over Wikipedia’s life span. Footnote 2 INSTITUTIONS AND ENDOGENOUS CHANGE Most scholarly works on institutions have a status quo bias, as the focus is on accounting for the persistence of institutional arrangements over time. To explain change, scholars tend to look for exogenous factors. For rational choice institutionalists, institutions reflect equilibrium solutions to problems of cooperation between different actors. Footnote 3 In most rationalist accounts of institutions, these equilibria do not become unstable unless the external circumstances change (e.g., through alterations in power), and the appearance of new problems that require new solutions. For sociological institutionalists, institutions reflect shared norms and understandings. Footnote 4 Actors that compose the membership of an institution exist in a social environment where institutional practices become taken for granted. Individual actors have limited agency to alter the existing institutional arrangements. These shared norms do not get altered unless by powerful external sources or through the appearance of norm entrepreneurs. For historical institutionalists, institutions reflect decision-making made at critical junctures, temporal sequencing, and path dependency. Past decision-making has a persistent impact on institutions, contributing to stability over time, even if the existing arrangements are suboptimal. The sources of change tend to be external crises or changes in the broader environment that alter the functions and purpose of institutions. Footnote 5 Recent comparative politics scholarship (particularly in the historical institutionalist tradition; see Bleich Reference Bleich 2018; Mahoney and Thelen Reference Mahoney and Thelen 2009; Streeck and Thelen Reference Streeck and Thelen 2005; Thelen Reference Thelen 2004) and international relations-oriented research on norm contestation (see Dietelhoff and Zimmermann Reference Dietelhoff and Zimmermann 2020; Sandholtz Reference Sandholtz 2008; Sandholtz and Stiles Reference Sandholtz and Stiles 2009; Wiener Reference Wiener 2009) have identified rule ambiguity and norm ambiguity, respectively, as promising plausible mechanisms for gradual endogenous change. Footnote 6 The seeds of change lie in the intrinsic inability of rules to apply clearly and unambiguously to most situations that confront members of complex institutions. This permits actors to reinterpret rules and norms through their application in specific instances. However, while this literature points to the plausibility of endogenous institutional change through ambiguity in rule application, many cases are prompted by exogenous causes, such as (i) the involvement of new actors, (ii) environmentally driven changes in the balance of power between actors, and (iii) the appearance of new problems that need solving. While these may be gradual processes of change, the underlying causes are frequently exogenous. Footnote 7 A prominent example of this kind of change in the comparative politics literature is Bleich’s ( Reference Bleich 2018) study of the French High Court’s changing interpretation of hate crime laws over time. Bleich’s explanation for the shift in how the court applied the rules focuses on the entry and influence of new actors, as he delineates how activist organizations influenced how the French High Court interpreted hate crime laws. He also shows that the French High Court was influenced by the European Court of Human Rights. In the international relations literature, a prominent example of this kind of change is Sandholtz’s ( Reference Sandholtz 2008) study on the rules regarding wartime plunder of artistic and cultural artifacts. In Sandholtz’s study, rules regarding wartime plunder were reinterpreted after major wars (the Napoleonic Wars and World War II), as the victims of large-scale plunder pressed to regain their property. In both cases, the rules in question (hate crime laws and rules of war) were broad and unspecified, allowing for different application of the rules in practice. In both Bleich ( Reference Bleich 2018) and Sandholtz ( Reference Sandholtz 2008), a lack of specificity in the wording of the rules permitted changes in application over time, but those changes were caused by exogenous factors (new actors or major wars). My account of institutional change on Wikipedia contrasts with these other accounts in three ways. First, change was not caused by the entry of new actors, but rather the loss of actors. Whereas other approaches to the study of institutions tend to see the relevant population of an institution as being stable or increasing, my account shows that the loss of a particular population contributed to Wikipedia’s shift. Furthermore, other accounts see conflicts within institutions as resulting in winners and losers where the losers typically remain within the institution. As Conran and Thelen ( Reference Conran, Thelen, Fioretos, Falleti and Sheingate 2016) note, losers remobilize and live to fight another day, which may lead them to change the institution in the future. However, the extent to which that is true depends on the nature of the institution, as well as the characteristics of the conflicts and the participants involved. Losses may entrench power advantages that entail feedback effects and are hard to rebalance, thus ensuring that losers cannot return the institution to the status quo. That was certainly the case on Wikipedia. Second, power asymmetries are formed on Wikipedia. However, unlike many other studies of institutions, the power asymmetry was not due to broader environmental changes that altered the social or material sources of actors’ power. Rather, power asymmetries formed as actors gained power within the rubrics of the institution itself. In the case of Wikipedia, experience provided a potent source of power, which made victories in early disputes consequential. In other organizations, there may be other power dynamics that are made apparent and entrenched through wins and losses in institutional conflicts. Third, reinterpretation of Wikipedia’s rules was not prompted by the appearance of new problems that required new solutions. Rather, the practical consequence of the rule reinterpretations on Wikipedia entailed fixing old problems (the presence of sources and content that legitimized fringe perspectives) that in large part stemmed from how the rules had been interpreted in the past. In contrast to much of the existing literature, this paper argues that institutions which are otherwise portrayed as stable are in fact constantly subject to change from within. The change can occur entirely endogenously. Footnote 8 There are four steps to such change. First, consistent with some of the historical institutionalist and norm scholarship, the seeds of change are located in the intrinsic inability of rules and norms to apply clearly and unambiguously to most situations that confront members of the institution. Second, rule ambiguity creates openings for members to impose new meanings on the rules at the micro level, as the rules are applied to specific situations. Since institutions are composed of actors that have different interests and diverse views, rule interpretations can be a potent source of conflict. Third, the conflicts may be resolved, resulting in winners and losers. The resolutions of these conflicts in favor of actors with certain rule interpretations can alter the balance of power within the institution, as the losers of past conflicts get demobilized, sanctioned, or lose status, whereas the winners get mobilized, elevated, and gain institutional power. Fourth, if actors with similar and overlapping viewpoints and interests (coherent camps) win early and frequent victories across an institution, they may shape how the overarching rules of the institution are understood to work in practice. For the process to play out in this manner, camps with coherent interests and views must exist (A and B in Figure 1). Otherwise, settlements in individual disputes lead to indeterminate long-term results. Additionally, for trajectories to form over time, victories must result in power advantages. In the absence of a meaningful power advantage, losers should be able to regroup and live to fight another day over the interpretation of the rules, with indeterminate long-term results. The relative ease with which actors can exit institutions affects the speed of change. Migrating from a country may entail considerable costs, whereas leaving a voluntary association may be relatively cost-free, which means that rapid change may be more likely in the latter case once a power asymmetry forms. Finally, for the process to play out in this specific manner, it presumes that exogenous factors do not intervene with the process. Both exogenous and endogenous factors can work in tandem, but the contribution of this paper is to show theoretically and empirically that consequential change can occur solely endogenously. Figure 1. How Do Rules Obtain New Meanings? Footnote 9 The remainder of this paper provides a detailed demonstration of how this process of endogenous change plays on the English Wikipedia. The paper explains what Wikipedia is, justifies why Wikipedia is a worthy case of inquiry, documents how Wikipedia’s content has transformed over its life span, and explains how this transformation happened. The penultimate section of the paper examines various alternative explanations, showing that they fail to account for Wikipedia’s transformation. WIKIPEDIA AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLITICAL INFORMATION ECOSYSTEM The Structure of Wikipedia Wikipedia is a nonprofit, multilingual, open-access online encyclopedia started by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001. The encyclopedia is user-generated. Anyone is free to edit it. By May 2021, there were more than 40 million registered users, of whom nearly 140,000 were active editors. Wikipedians generally edit pseudonymously, but extant data indicate that Wikipedians are disproportionately white males from the Global North. One in four Wikipedians primarily edit the English language version of Wikipedia (see Hill and Shaw Reference Hill and Shaw 2013; Wikipedia 2021b; Yasseri, Sumi, and Kertesz Reference Yasseri, Sumi and Kertesz 2012b). Editors must comply with three core Wikipedia content guidelines: 1. Neutral point of view (WP:NPOV): “representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic” (Wikipedia 2020a). 2. No original research (WP:NOR): “you must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and directly support the material being presented” (Wikipedia 2020b). 3. Verifiability (WP:V): “verifiability means other people using the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source… All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable” (Wikipedia 2020c). WP:NPOV is the guideline at the heart of most disputes on the encyclopedia. The NPOV guideline affects whether something should be covered, the weight of the coverage, and whether the cited sources are reliable. On subjects where there are diverse and incompatible views, “edit wars” frequently arise. These are situations when a change is made to an article (e.g., removal of text, addition of text, and rewording of text), and the change gets reverted, leading to an unstable cycle of additions and reverts of the same content (see Jemielniak Reference Jemielniak 2014; Tkacz Reference Tkacz 2015; Yasseri et al. Reference Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai and Kertesz 2012). How does the encyclopedia deal with disputes like these? One might think that such disputes would lead to an inconsistent product where articles look drastically different from day to day, but Wikipedia produces a very stable and consistent product. This is because there are multilayered dispute settlement mechanisms and elaborate norms regarding editor behavior. Wikipedia’s community reaches decisions about rules and content through a combination of deliberative discussions and referenda. These democratic processes have the goal of determining whether content has “consensus.” If a proposed change does not have consensus, the article experiencing edit wars will be returned to the status quo. A typical edit war will be resolved in the following manner: an editor makes changes to a page. Other editors disapprove of the change and revert the change. The status quo ante is established until a consensus for inclusion can be found on the talk page of the article. Editors may be able to work out mutually acceptable compromises. If they are not able to work out acceptable compromises among the small subset that are engaged with a single article, they can subject the dispute to input from the broader Wikipedia community. For example, if the editors who edit the Margaret Thatcher page are having a dispute that they cannot resolve among themselves, they may take the dispute to noticeboards that are frequented by large numbers of Wikipedians who do not frequent the Thatcher page. However, these procedures are not always sufficient to establish stability on a page. This is particularly the case on large high-profile articles with stable and coherent camps of editors, frequent editing, and multiple controversial aspects. When articles experience extraordinary levels of edit-warring, editors may request dispute settlement before administrators on the “Administrators Noticeboard” or arbitrators on the “Arbitration Committee.” These bodies primarily adjudicate behavioral problems among Wikipedians rather than adjudicate content directly (that is something for Wikipedia’s deliberative democratic processes to resolve). The bodies tend to sanction the most active and raucous editors on the dysfunctional pages. Administrators and arbitrators are elected by the Wikipedia userbase. To become an administrator, an editor goes through the “Request for Adminship” process, which is essentially an election on the suitability of an editor to become an administrator. Any experienced editor can make a request for a position as administrator. Footnote 10 The request is unlikely to be granted unless they have a well-established history as a contributor on the encyclopedia and have demonstrated an ability to get along with other editors. The threshold to become an administrator is high, as editors generally require support by 75% of voters. Editors who are new and who behave in divisive ways are unlikely to get the support needed to become administrators. Footnote 11 The English Wikipedia has approximately one thousand administrators. The Arbitration Committee is vastly smaller, with membership oscillating between 13 and 18 members. Elections to the Arbitration Committee are more formal and eventful processes than the requests for adminship, as the elections occur annually, eligible registered editors are notified about the elections on their user talk page, and cast secret ballots. Footnote 12 Experienced editors who are not divisive are better poised to garner the votes to become arbitrators. Case Selection Justification There are several motivating factors in choosing the English Wikipedia as a case to study institutional change: (i) it is an important case; (ii) it is an understudied case; (iii) it could be construed as a least-likely case for institutional change; and (iv) it has unique availability of data, which makes it possible to observe slow, gradual, endogenous processes that result in consequential drastic change over time. First, Wikipedia is an important institution. One that is worthwhile to study in its own right. Wikipedia.org is one of the most popular websites in the world. The English Wikipedia is frequently at the top or near the top of Google searches for a known person or event in the English language (e.g., Vincent and Hecht Reference Vincent and Hecht 2021). Wikipedia is also widely perceived as a trustworthy and reliable source of information (e.g., Bruckman Reference Bruckman 2022), giving it considerable power in public discourse and ideational diffusion. Wikipedia’s influence is also boosted by the fact that Wikipedia pages, unlike other forms of content (such as news reports and scholarship), are often written in summary style and in layman’s terms, thus making the information in Wikipedia articles more accessible to readers. Furthermore, tech giants, such as YouTube, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have incorporated Wikipedia into their own platforms. Due to its popularity and perceived trustworthiness, Wikipedia has the power to legitimize and delegitimize subjects. This is a website that can declare whether something is a pseudoscience, a falsehood, a conspiracy theory, or bigotry. World leaders can be described as dictators, perpetrators of violence can be identified, and the effects of implementing certain public policies can be characterized as positive or negative. Additionally, in many cases, it seems clear that actors who are covered by Wikipedia believe that Wikipedia matters, as politicians have on many occasions been exposed as having edited their own Wikipedia pages, and authoritarian regimes have blocked Wikipedia in parts or in its entirety. Wikipedia’s salience has increased over time, as scholars express concern over the intersection of the Internet and politics. The Internet has displaced traditional gatekeepers, and contributed to the wide diffusion of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and extremist rhetoric. Whereas the other major online platforms have been criticized for their role in monetizing, inculcating, and diffusing extremism and misinformation, Wikipedia has often been hailed as an exception: a distinctly positive actor in the online political ecosystem, Footnote 13 an actor that serves a proactive gatekeeping role where it outright debunks, fact-checks, and highlights the errors and fringe nature of the very same discourses popularized on the other platforms. Second, Wikipedia is an understudied institution in an understudied organizational environment. Aside from its importance in politics, there are several things about Wikipedia as an organization that political scientists and organizational scholars should find intriguing. It is an enormous organization that is based on the open-source or commons-based peer production organizational model (e.g., Benkler Reference Benkler 2002; Reagle Reference Reagle 2010; Tkacz Reference Tkacz 2015). Unlike traditional organizations, such as firms and bureaucracies, Wikipedia is characterized by a lack of “formal hierarchy.” Editors on Wikipedia are not managed and instructed by “managers,” but rather self-assign tasks to do. Editors are not motivated by monetary rewards, unlike members of traditional organizations. Decision-making on Wikipedia is deliberative and democratic. The rules of Wikipedia are always subject to change, which effectively makes all rules, norms, and content on Wikipedia subject to constant plebiscites. Consequently, Wikipedia both reflects and accentuates processes that are analogous to those in other organizations. Scholars have consequentially used Wikipedia to study collaboration, conflict, polarization, and partisanship, as well as politics and organizational dynamics more broadly (Greenstein, Gu, and Zhu Reference Greenstein, Gu and Zhu 2021; Heaberlin and DeDeo Reference Heaberlin and DeDeo 2016; Jemielniak Reference Jemielniak 2014; Konieczsny 2009; Lerner and Lomi Reference Lerner and Lomi 2019; Reagle Reference Reagle 2010; Shi et al. Reference Shi, Teplitskiy, Duede and Evans 2019; Tkacz Reference Tkacz 2015; Yasseri et al. Reference Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai and Kertesz 2012; Yasseri, Sumi, and Kertesz Reference Yasseri, Sumi and Kertesz 2012). While Wikipedia has been the subject of study by computer scientists, physicists, information scientists, and sociologists, it has been neglected by political scientists. Third, Wikipedia could be construed as a least-likely case for institutional change and most-likely case for organizational stability, as the organization has several structural biases in favor of stability and the status quo. The requirement that there needs to be a “consensus” among editors in favor of both addition of content and rule changes should make it hard to enact substantial changes. Footnote 14 In the event of disputes, the guiding rule is to retain the status quo unless a consensus can be established for any change. A minority of editors can therefore block controversial changes. Furthermore, the presence of a large and diverse userbase means that ideational changes among individuals and small groups should not result in frequent or sudden changes over time. Wikipedia also strongly enforces compliance with the rules, which means that large-scale rule violations will not be a likely source of change over time (see Piskorski and Gorbatai Reference Piskorski and Gorbatai 2017). The strong enforcement leads editors to edit within accepted boundaries and within consensuses. Given these institutional characteristics, one might expect Wikipedia to have a conservative status quo bias. Footnote 15 Furthermore, the founders of Wikipedia have not intervened to cause new interpretations of the guidelines among the userbase. Sanger, who crafted the core NPOV rule, has condemned the interpretations of the guideline that emerged over time. Footnote 16 Wales has held a more agnostic view of change on Wikipedia over time, saying in 2006, “One of the great things about NPOV is that it is a term of art and a community fills it with meaning over time” (Reason 2006). Fourth, Wikipedia has a unique availability of data. A major problem in most case-specific accounts of institutional change is the inaccessibility of comprehensive data to evaluate causes and effects. Scholars must rely on a sliver of data that are available to piece together what the preferences of various actors might be, what actions these actors took, and how the preferences and actions of these actors led to institutional change or stability. What adds to the problem is that the publicly available data may fail to reflect the actual processes that led to change. For example, debates may take place in front of cameras and voting may be logged into records, but the meaningful negotiations occur behind closed doors. In comparison with other institutions, Wikipedia has several advantages in terms of studying institutional change. In other largescale institutions, it is not feasible to identify and collect data on every participant, and to track the behavior of every participant over time. Scholars are often forced to fill gaps with theory or by making assumptions. There is a risk that unobserved variables have a significant impact on outcomes, which makes it hard to make robust claims about the causes of institutional change. On Wikipedia, on the other hand, virtually all edits and comments are logged and open to public viewing. This means that it is possible to trace each input in every debate, as well as to sift through the editing history of each Wikipedia editor. Thus, there is an enormity of relevant data on which to test, refine, and build theories of institutional change. RESEARCH DESIGN The research design of the paper has two components. First, the paper codes content in the lead of Wikipedia articles, showing a pro-to-anti-fringe shift in content. Second, the paper does process-tracing of trends within Wikipedia’s governance to show how this shift happened (George and Bennett Reference George and Bennett 2005). In terms of analyzing changes in the content of Wikipedia articles, the paper uses nonautomated qualitative content analysis to classify whether Wikipedia pages use language that legitimizes or delegitimizes fringe positions and entities. An advantage of qualitative content analysis is that it permits analysts to observe subtle, yet meaningful nuances in meaning. Footnote 17 It entails human coding and interpretation of textual sources according to structured and systematic coding schemes (see Boreus and Bergström Reference Boreus and Bergström 2017; Elkins, Spitzer, and Tallberg Reference Elkins, Spitzer and Tallberg 2021; Herrera and Braumoeller Reference Herrera and Braumoeller 2004). More specifically, the paper systematically classified a sample of 63 article leads with a predetermined coding scheme. Footnote 18 The 63 pages were chosen because they are representative of the population of relevant cases: all the pages are on topics that have been linked to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, extremism, and fringe rhetoric in public discourse. Within the relevant population, the chosen pages reflect diverse topic areas (health, climate, gender, sexuality, race, abortion, religion, politics, international relations, and history). The pages also vary in terms of the time of creation (some pages were created early and others later), and temporal prominence (the topics covered in the pages were more prominent during different time periods). The pages include biographies (which have more restrictive standards for inclusion of pejorative content) and nonbiographies. The contents of the chosen Wikipedia pages were classified according to a five-category coding scheme. These categories reflect varying degrees of neutrality. On one end of the spectrum, the language lends credence and legitimacy to fringe views. On the other end, the language firmly delegitimizes the fringe views: 1. Fringe normalization: The fringe position/entity is normalized and legitimized. There is an absence of criticism. 2. Teach the controversy: The fringe position/entity is presented as a matter of active scientific or political dispute (A says X, B says Y). 3. False balance: The lead places emphasis on the expertise, credibility, evidence, and arguments of the anti-fringe side (e.g., “some scientists say,” “some medical organizations say”), but the pro-fringe side still gets space to rebut. 4. Identification of the fringe view: The lead places emphasis on the legitimacy and the overwhelming numbers that compose the anti-fringe side (e.g., “scientific consensus,” “the scientific community”), but space is still given to the pro-fringe side. 5. Proactive fringe-busting: Space is only given to the anti-fringe side whose position is stated as fact in Wikipedia’s own voice. Footnote 19 The evidence that supports the anti-fringe position is presented, whereas the flaws of the pro-fringe perspective are outlined. The paper uses a cross-temporal analysis of each article’s lead, thus tracking changes over time. A stable version of each article was analyzed at the end of each year. Articles were checked more frequently if the pages had frequent and erratic editing patterns. Changes on Wikipedia articles can be accessed through archives that show each change, thus making the study replicable. Table 1 and the Supplementary Material include examples of language from each article’s lead. Due to space constraints, changes in nine representative article leads are shown in Table 1, whereas 54 additional articles are in the Supplementary Material. Table 1. The Lead to Controversial Science- and Politics-Related Wikipedia Pages, January 2001 to June 2020 Table 2. Wikipedia’s List of Deprecated Websites, as of September 4, 2021 Footnote 23 Table 3. Referenda and Subsequent Exits Per the analysis (see Table 1 and the Supplementary Material), content on the English Wikipedia shows a clear trend from language that legitimizes fringe positions to language that delegitimizes fringe positions. Newer articles tend to adopt language from the anti-fringe categories at their creation, whereas older articles tend to adopt language that is more fringe-normalizing at their creation. None of the articles move in a direction where they become more fringe-normalizing. The analysis shows that in its early years, the English Wikipedia adhered to a “strict” NPOV approach whereby Wikipedia content was open to a diversity of opinions and sources, and where Wikipedians could not state contested views as facts in Wikipedia’s own voice. Thus, a typical page on a subject related to pseudoscience and contested science would adopt a “Some say X, others say Y” style, even on topics where mainstream scientific opinion overwhelmingly favored X. ENDOGENOUS CHANGE ON WIKIPEDIA Explaining the Findings The paper has demonstrated that English Wikipedia content changed over time. This section seeks to explain why the content changed. In doing so, the paper uses process tracing. The paper systematically analyzes the internal Wikipedia discussion forums where editors duked out content. More specially, the paper analyzes the archived talk pages of the 63 articles and relevant discussions about article content on general noticeboards. Footnote 20 To classify editors into the Anti-Fringe camp (AF) and the Pro-Fringe camp (PF), the paper uses a variety of data sources: the viewpoints expressed by editors on the article talk pages themselves, the views expressed by editors brought up for sanctioning on the Administrators’ noticeboard or the “Requests for Enforcement” page before the Arbitration Committee, and lists of editors brought up in arbitration committee rulings. These data sources provide article-by-article evidence about relevant individual editors on the pages in question. However, to assess systematically what happens to AF and PF editors across the English Wikipedia (not just the 63 articles), the paper uses a sample of referenda where editors are implicitly asked whether they support a pro- or anti-fringe interpretation of the NPOV guideline. The user histories of the participants in the referenda are then analyzed to uncover whether they are still active or whether they have voluntarily left Wikipedia, substantially reduced their number of contributions, been banned from the relevant topics, or blocked from Wikipedia in its entirety. The evidence is broadly consistent with the observable implications of the paper’s theory of endogenous institutional change (the processes of the theory are outlined in Figure 2). Footnote 21 Figure 2. How Did the NPOV Rule Change? The key piece of evidence is that PF members disappear over time in the wake of losses, both voluntarily and involuntarily. PF members are those who vote affirmatively for policies that normalize or lend credence to fringe viewpoints, who edit such content into articles, and who vote to defend fellow members of PF when there are debates as to whether they engaged in wrongdoing. Members of AF do the opposite. The causal mechanism for the gradual disappearance is that early losses demotivated members from PF or led to their sanctioning, whereas members of AF were empowered by early victories. As exits of PF members mount across the encyclopedia, the community increasingly adopts AF’s viewpoints as the way that the NPOV guideline should be understood. Step 1: Rule Ambiguity The NPOV rule of Wikipedia is ambiguous in its specific application. During the early period of Wikipedia, Wikipedia’s NPOV rule was understood as indicating a “describe-the-controversy” approach to disputes between sources: Wikipedia should not take sides on contested issues, and Wikipedia should be open to a diverse array of sources. Thus, the policy allowed for inclusion of lower-quality sources, so long as they were attributed. This meant that if sources disagreed in terms of how they covered the topic of homeopathy, the Wikipedia article on homeopathy would present both sides of the issue and avoid taking a firm stance. The Wikipedia page on homeopathy included text that effectively said “Advocates for homeopathy say…” and “Critics of homeopathy say…,” whereas it was frowned upon among early Wikipedians to state decisively in Wikipedia’s own voice that “Homeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine” (as the first line of the Wikipedia page stated in 2020). This was largely in line with Larry Sanger’s intentions when he crafted the NPOV rule (ArsTechnica 2014). Step 2: Clashes between Camps over Rule Interpretations On contentious topics (e.g., American politics, conspiracy theories, and pseudoscience), editors had vast differences in terms of how they understood the application of Wikipedia’s rules. Editors who were anti-conspiracy theories, anti-pseudoscience, and liberal (the AF camp) pushed understandings of NPOV that took a firm anti-conspiracy-theory and anti-pseudoscience stance. Thus, they argued for reliance on strong sources (such as studies and highly reputable mainstream news outlets), nonuse of lower-quality sources (such as partisan outlets and disreputable outlets), stating claims from strong sources in Wikipedia’s own voice (rather than attributing them as a source’s opinion), firmly stating that minority views are fringe, and stating that falsehoods are falsehoods. Editors who were more supportive of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and conservatism (the PF camp) argued for reliance on sources across a broad range of reliability (in part, because they perceived academics and newspapers of record to be biased), stating claims from sources as if they were always an attributed POV, and avoiding firm stances on the state of a controversy. On the homeopathy page, this meant that PF members raised questions about relying on reporting by the New York Times and Washington Post, insisted that studies skeptical of homeopathy’s efficacy be phrased as opinion, and sought to include rebuttals by pro-homeopathy organizations and pseudoscientists. AF members held the opposite view, as they sought to phrase skeptical content in Wikipedia’s own voice and strongly opposed content sourced to pro-homeopathy organizations. Step 3: Formation of a Power Asymmetry Over the course of years, AF successfully shaped how to understand the practical application of Wikipedia’s NPOV guideline. These early victories gave AF an upper hand in editing disputes on pages related to conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and American politics. There was no single critical juncture. Rather, there were many gradual mutually reinforcing steps across several spheres of Wikipedia. One type of change that was important early in Wikipedia’s development was intervention into content disputes by arbitrators on highly dysfunctional pages. Highly dysfunctional pages are those characterized by edit-warring among a multitude of editors to the point that the pages are unstable over extended periods of time, and editors cannot even agree on the status quo version of the pages. Two particularly important early arbitration rulings in the early years were the arbitration committee cases on climate change (2005) and pseudoscience (2006), which largely reaffirmed some viewpoints held by AF in those specific disputes and led to sanctions that primarily targeted prolific PF editors (although some AF editors were also targeted) for behavioral wrongdoing. The disputes were at their core about edit-warring between different camps as to whether climate change articles should reflect the scientific consensus on climate change or lend weight to those who dispute the scientific consensus, and broadly about how pseudoscientific ideas and minority scientific perspectives should be framed. A second type of important changes involve the writing of guidelines to supplement the existing NPOV guideline and clarify how the NPOV guideline should be applied. This includes the creation of the Reliable Sources guideline (2005), which introduced a basic framework for evaluating the reliability of sources, the Fringe Theory guideline (2007), which introduced a basic framework for evaluating minority views and fringe views, and the Reliable Sources (Medicine) guideline (2008), which set a higher quality threshold for sources on medicine-related topics out of a concern that poorly sourced content could cause harm to readers. These guidelines were crafted by a relatively small set of experienced editors, including many from AF who were involved in active content disputes on topics that related to these rules. All editors can participate in processes to change rules and add supplements to rules. These changes must go through the normal Wikipedia consensus decision-making process. While these particular rules were not written to specifically address content in those disputes, the enactment of these rules as supplemental modifications to the NPOV guideline would prove useful in those disputes. Furthermore, discussions related to those rules showed that editors wanted to privilege science and academic expertise in terms of identifying what is fringe, but the Reliable Sources and Fringe Theory guidelines were broad enough in scope that they could also be used to identify fringe discourse and beliefs outside of science, such as with conspiracy theories and extremist rhetoric in politics. Step 4: Reinterpretation of Wikipedia’s Rules The early victories and selective departures had positive feedback effects for three reasons: (i) they enhanced the value of experience, (ii) they created a numerical advantage, and (iii) they spurred a sourcing bias. Consequently, AF editors experienced greater success in editing, whereas PF editors did not, which led to lopsided exits over time. Together, these factors led AF to increasingly get what it wanted and sway the broader Wikipedia userbase to see one interpretation of the rules as the undisputed accurate interpretation of the rules. First, experience matters a great deal on Wikipedia, which makes disproportionate exits early on highly consequential. Since Wikipedia is notoriously complicated for new editors to maneuver, experienced editors have a decisive advantage in content disputes (Jemielniak Reference Jemielniak 2014). Experience helps in understanding the rules, norms, and processes of Wikipedia. This leads to greater success in content disputes and edit wars, as well as makes experienced editors able to drive disruptive “newcomers” away from Wikipedia and instill in newcomers’ certain understandings of how rules should be interpreted. Experience also raises the likelihood of becoming an administrator, thereby gaining the power to enforce the rules and sanction editors. Footnote 22 Additionally, experience increases the likelihood of participation in general noticeboard discussions where sanctions of individual editors and specific rule interpretations are discussed in detail. Experienced editors also become aware of administrator elections and arbitration committee elections, which are important levers of power on Wikipedia. Second, there is power in numbers. It is easier for PF members to fall afoul of the rules if they are frequently at a numerical disadvantage in editing disputes. It makes them less likely to win content disputes (which are often determined by numbers), forces them to spend more time to advance their views, and makes them more likely to have to edit war (make frequent reverts of AF editors). Whereas multiple AF editors can share the burden of doing reverts of PF’s edits and not violate any edit-warring restrictions, a PF editor may be forced to do multiple reverts, thus risking sanction. Third, the gradual development of a sourcing hierarchy—whereby some sources were deemed reliable, and others were deemed unreliable—created advantages for AF editors. The culmination of a long, gradual conflict over the use of sources on Wikipedia was the 2017 vote to deprecate (ban) the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, from being used as a source for statements of fact. Over the next 4 years, 38 additional sources were deprecated. The gradual development of the sourcing hierarchy reflects how the Wikipedia community shifted its understanding of reliability over time, facilitated by the experience and numerical advantage of AF. An examination of pages in the early years of Wikipedia shows that Wikipedians had very lax standards for sourcing. By the mid-2000s, momentum had formed to privilege scientific publications. This did not mean that other sources were unusable, but that priority and prominence should be afforded to scientific publications. During these early years, Wikipedians did not appear to distinguish between news sources in terms of reliability in any clear manner. Articles into the 2010s show considerable usage of sources that would ultimately by the mid-2010s be deemed unreliable, including sources that were deprecated from 2017 onward. Footnote 24 Discussions about these sources in the previous years had not concluded with support to prohibit them, demonstrating a change in how the community looked at them. The key difference is that the ranks of PF editors who blocked previous attempts to ban sources had been thinned out considerably by 2017. This hierarchy of sources has implications both for what kind of content can be added to Wikipedia and how it will be phrased. For example, if the New York Times (a source that Wikipedia editors came to recognize as highly reliable) describes something as a conspiracy theory, whereas the New York Post (a source that Wikipedia editors have determined to be unreliable) differs from that description, then Wikipedia content can be added that firmly states in Wikipedia’s voice that something is a conspiracy theory. Under a previous collective understanding of Wikipedia’s rules, Wikipedia’s content would not give a firm statement in Wikipedia’s voice but would rather attribute particular claims to the Times and attribute rebuttal claims to the Post. Thus, over time, Wikipedia has accepted the use of contested labels and taken sides on contested subjects, ultimately producing a type of content that is distinctly anti-pseudoscience and anti-conspiracy theories, and which has the perception of a liberal bent in U.S. politics. Each shift in policy further weakened the position of PF in editing disputes and made the editing experience less rewarding for those editors because they ended up on the losing end of content disputes. Over time, PF editors responded in three ways Footnote 25: 1. Fight back: By increasingly editing against consensus and in violation of new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. These editors were subsequently banned. 2. Withdraw: By leaving Wikipedia or reducing their contributions. 3. Acquiesce: By gradually adapting to the new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. Article-by-article evidence substantiates these patterns, with prominent PF editors getting banned, retiring, or adjusting to new interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines. Footnote 26 In explaining their departure on their talk page, retired PF editors frequently decried what they perceived as Wikipedia’s increased bias, hostile editing environment, and the pointlessness of fighting against what they described as a cabal. Footnote 27 This stands in contrast to the explanations offered by non-PF members for retiring. Some PF editors proved more flexible to Wikipedia’s changing environment, acquiescing to new interpretations of Wikipedia policy. For example, a PF editor might affirm the new standards in Wikipedia’s sourcing policy by insisting that content from a source like the New York Times should be stated in Wikipedia’s own voice when a Times story criticizes a left-leaning politician or left-leaning cause. However, in doing so, those PF editors help enshrine the emerging new interpretations of Wikipedia guidelines. In addition to article-by-article evidence of departures of Wikipedia editors, the paper uses a sample of hotly contested referenda (where editors are asked to express their views about the NPOV rule’s application to fringe topics) to gage whether the disappearance of PF editors (measured by their support or opposition for a fringe position) is systemic across the encyclopedia. This is a unique and useful data source that shows that the relative disappearance of PF editors is systemic. The raw numbers undersell the importance of those who have departed the encyclopedia. Many of the departees were highly prolific experienced editors from PF, whereas many of the editors who sided with AF and disappeared over time were not highly prolific editors in the first place. These disproportionate exits meant that over time, understandings in line with AF’s interpretation of Wikipedia policy become taken for granted as the way the rules should be interpreted, causing gradual institutional changes that amount to a drastic institutional change over a nearly 20-year period. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS This paper has sought to explain why content on the English Wikipedia transformed drastically over time. The explanation hinges on endogenous factors related to early victories, feedback effects, and population loss. In this section, the paper examines two key alternative explanations, finding that they are inapplicable and generally inconsistent with the data (three additional alternative explanations are addressed in the Supplementary Material). Footnote 28 External Events and Processes One alternative hypothesis is that external events caused ideational change among Wikipedians. For example, Donald Trump’s 2016 election, the 2016 Brexit referendum, and the emergence of “fake news” websites may have caused Wikipedians to re-evaluate how they understand the rules of Wikipedia and the role of Wikipedia in society. However, as the paper documented, the transformation on Wikipedia has been gradual over time, preceding prominent shocks from 2016. Furthermore, the emergence of “fake news” websites does not fit neatly with Wikipedians’ decision to deprecate long-standing traditional news sources, such as the Daily Mail. The events of 2015 and 2016 did not bring source reliability to the fore in a new way on Wikipedia. Rather, Wikipedians had intensely debated the reliability of sources for nearly a decade prior. It took Wikipedians until 2017 to start deprecating sources because the editors that previously vetoed such attempts were no longer active on the encyclopedia. Footnote 29 Another version of this hypothesis is that slow exogenous processes led Wikipedians to re-evaluate their own attitudes toward the guidelines. For example, Wikipedians may have increasingly come to hold more pro-LGBT views, stronger anti-racism views, and pro-science attitudes. While attitudinal change can certainly be documented among certain Wikipedians, they have remained very stable among many of those belonging to AF and PF, as they vote consistently for and against certain items in predictable ways over long time periods. If a disproportionate number of PF editors had not disappeared over time, they would have been able to block drastic changes. A third version of this hypothesis is that the sources that Wikipedia relies on for content changed how they cover pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism. In other words, the news media and the scientific community changed, not Wikipedia. While it is true that Wikipedia is necessarily a reflection of what sources say, it is not correct that news sources and studies have uniformly moved in the same direction on all the subject matters listed in Table 1 and the Supplementary Material. Even on subject matters where coverage has changed, such as climate change, climate change denial sources have changed tactics in how they argue against climate change. Rather than deny that any warming has occurred, they dispute the precise role of human activity, emphasize how “alarmist” mainstream climate scientists are, and highlight events that purportedly contradict the scientific consensus. Rather than reflect these updates to climate change denialism in mainstream sources, Wikipedians have simply excluded or debunked climate change denial rhetoric in articles. Furthermore, the particular sources that continued to promote pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and extremism were over time ultimately deemed unreliable on Wikipedia. Influx of New Editors Anyone can create a Wikipedia account and edit. It is therefore reasonable to query whether Wikipedia experienced an influx of new editors with new ideas, thus causing the transformation over time. This would mean that the old guard of Wikipedia editors were simply replaced or outmaneuvered by a new breed of editors. There are several reasons why this is unlikely to have caused the transformation. Wikipedia has a very rigid and complex structure of rules and norms. New editors that edit in ways that older editors disapprove of often find themselves in trouble. As highlighted above, experience is a source of power of Wikipedia that makes it easier for the old guard to shape the encyclopedia, both by sanctioning disruptive newcomers and by indoctrinating newcomers into a “correct” way of editing. Newcomers, therefore, find themselves forced to assimilate or be booted off the platform. It is also unlikely that the later generation of Wikipedia editors tended to be more likely to be experts and predisposed to mainstream science than the first movers on Wikipedia. Judging by self-described descriptions of themselves, many of the earliest Wikipedians were scientists or had advanced degrees, in particular among editors on pages related to pseudoscience. CONCLUSION Since its inception in 2001, Wikipedia has transformed from an encyclopedia that adopted a strict “teach the controversy” approach (whereby a diversity of opinions and sources were reflected in articles) to one where Wikipedia takes firm sides on contested subjects. Whereas Wikipedia used to normalize and lend credence to pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and fringe rhetoric, it has over time become firmly anti-pseudoscience and anti-conspiracy theories. This transformation occurred through endogenous processes that were ultimately rooted in rule ambiguity, early dispute outcomes, and population loss. The resolution of early disputes in several areas of the encyclopedia demobilized certain types of editors (while mobilizing others) and strengthened certain understandings of Wikipedia’s ambiguous rules (while weakening other understandings of Wikipedia rules). Change occurred endogenously and gradually, as shared meanings from within Wikipedia’s collective about the rules got altered through a combination of compulsory power (sanctioning of dissenters by elite actors) and productive power (collective delegitimization of certain rule interpretations). This explanation for institutional change on Wikipedia can plausibly help to explain institutional change in other contexts. We might observe in other institutions that institutional change happens as losers become demotivated and sanctioned, and winners become motivated and rewarded. For example, career bureaucrats might leave public service when the bureaucracy shifts toward policies that they disagree with. The bureaucrats could stay in the bureaucracy and make it harder for opponents to transform the bureaucracy, but they might instead leave the bureaucracy because they find it demotivating to fight uphill against other bureaucrats. Rather than obstruct change, the population loss of dissident bureaucrats can propel change. Within political movements and parties, we can also see how establishment figures who are out of step with newly dominant ideas choose voluntarily to retire rather than obstruct change within the movement. This can plausibly be seen in the Republican Party, as Trump critics have opted to retire rather than use their position to steer the movement in a direction that they find more palatable. Similarly, victories for one side within a movement may energize winners and encourage like-minded actors to jump on the bandwagon in support of that side. This may help to explain how the Tea Party cemented its control of the Republican Party (Blum Reference Blum 2020). It may also help to explain how the conservative legal movement gradually accepted the legal theory behind the unconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was considered fringe and weak in 2010, but grew in support as conservative justices in lower courts ruled the ACA unconstitutional, ultimately almost leading the Supreme Court to rule that the ACA was unconstitutional in 2012 (a narrow 5-4 decision upheld the law while hobbling aspects of it). It may also explain why certain police department cultures form, as some police are driven out of the organization, while others get boosted. It has also been posited that the stability and strength of illiberal regimes within the European Union have gradually been strengthened as dissatisfied citizens migrate from authoritarian states to liberal states (Kelemen Reference Kelemen 2020). However, more research is needed to assess the generalizability of this endogenous mechanism for institutional change.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST The author declares no ethical issues or conflicts of interest in this research. ETHICAL STANDARDS The author affirms this research did not involve human subjects. Footnotes 1 Mahoney and Thelen (2009), Streeck and Thelen (2005), and Thelen (2004) have made important contributions to our understanding of endogenous institutional change. This paper builds on these contributions and adds a new mechanism behind endogenous institutional change: the losers do not stick around to fight another day (as they do in Conran and Thelen 2016) but exit the institution, leaving it in the hands of the winners. 2 There are historical and ethnographic works about Wikipedia (Jemielniak 2014; Reagle 2010; Tkacz 2015), but no systematic analyses of the encyclopedia’s content. 3 See Voeten (2020) for overviews of strands of rationalist choice institutionalism. 4 See Jepperson and Meyer (2021) for an overview of sociological institutionalism. 5 Other approaches to organizational study, such as organizational ecology and evolutionary theories of organizations, emphasize how the environment selects out organizations that are optimally suited for the environment or how organizations adapt to their environment (e.g., Hannan and Freeman 1977; Levinthal 2021). In these frameworks, exogenous factors remain key components in explanations of institutional change. 6 See Gerschewski (2021) for a typology of organizational theories on two dimensions: the source of a cause of institutional change (endogenous vs. exogenous) and the time horizon of the change (sudden vs. gradual). The theory advanced in this paper would be characterized as a gradual and endogenous theory in Gerschewski‘s framework. 7 For exceptions, see Mahoney and Thelen (2009), Streeck and Thelen (2005), and Thelen (2004). 8 For other endogenous accounts of change, see Mahoney and Thelen (2009), Streeck and Thelen (2005), and Thelen (2004). 9 The steps are sequential. 10 Registered accounts with at least five hundred edits and 30 days of experience can file a request. 11 The vote on requests for adminship is characterized by lengthy public discussions between the requester and other editors. In these discussions, the requester outlines their philosophy toward Wikipedia and users cast their votes amid the discussions. All registered accounts can vote on a request for adminship. 12 Experienced editors also become aware of the elections, candidates, and stakes through discussions on general noticeboards, the talk pages of individual prominent Wikipedia users, and Wikipedia‘s internal newspaper, The Signpost. Editors are eligible to vote if they have at least 150 edits in total, 10 of which must occur approximately a year before the deadline for candidate nominations. The turnout in the earliest elections was in the low hundreds with an increase over time. The 2015 elections were the highest turnout election, with 2,674 valid cast ballots. Subsequent elections have had turnout between 1500 and 2200. 13 For example, Cooke (2020). 14 “Consensus” on Wikipedia usually requires that two-thirds of votes favor particular content and that the votes in question are substantive in terms of demonstrating knowledge of Wikipedia rules and precedents. Editors self-select into deliberative discussions on any given topic. 15 Existing large-N analyses of Wikipedia content indicate that interactions between ideologically polarized Wikipedians tend to result in moderate content, lending support for notions that extreme shifts in content are unlikely (Greenstein, Gu, and Zhu 2021; Shi et al. 2019). 16 Per Sanger, the NPOV rule was meant to include a broad spectrum of perspectives and adopt a report-on-the-controversy approach, rather than exclude perspectives (e.g., ArsTechnica 2014; Sanger 2015). 17 While this approach reduces the risk of measurement error, there are limits to the methodological approach. Further studies on the phenomena might benefit from using a large-scale big data analysis to assess how robust the overall trend is, even if those studies are vulnerable to measurement error. Big data analysis might also assess trends across different language versions of Wikipedia, making it possible to observe whether the trend on the English Wikipedia is unique. 18 The lead of each page was chosen as that is the most widely read part of each page. It is also the subject of the most contention among Wikipedians, making it unlikely that the content in the lead does not reflect a consensus. 19 “Homeopathy is a pseudoscience” is an example stating something in Wikipedia’s own voice, whereas “Some say homeopathy is a pseudoscience” or “Homeopathy has been described as a pseudoscience” is not. 20 For example, editors on a specific article may bring their dispute up on the WP:NPOV or WP:BLP noticeboards, which are frequented by the larger Wikipedia community. 21 Alternative methods that could be used in further studies to assess the change on Wikipedia include experiments and interviews. Interviews with Wikipedians that directly address the questions of interest to the researchers would enable additional evidence of Wikipedians’ own understanding of their behavior. 22 Administrators are well-respected members of the Wikipedia community who must demonstrate an understanding of the nuances of the Wikipedia guidelines and demonstrate an aptitude for interacting well with other Wikipedians. In “requests for adminship” discussions, editors frequently remark on whether they perceive the editor to have a track record of working collaboratively with other editors or having a combative track record. Requests by inexperienced editors are declined, with editors encouraged to apply again at a future date when they have accumulated knowhow and a proven track record of collaborative editing. 23 See Wikipedia (2021a). In addition to these websites, it was determined that sources widely described by reliable sources to be state-sponsored disinformation should be deprecated. 24 Wikipedia editors distinguish between sources that are (1) generally reliable (across issue areas), (2) specifically reliable (within an issue area), (3) neither reliable nor unreliable (cases where editors could not reach a consensus on the reliability of a source), (4) generally unreliable (the source is considered highly questionable and should generally not be used), and (5) deprecated (usage of the source is generally prohibited). Over time, Wikipedia editors have developed a clear hierarchy whereby sources have either moved firmly into category 1 or been demoted to categories 3–5. 25 The responses line up well with Hirschman’s (1970) Exit, Voice and Loyalty framework. 26 To assess bans, the paper examines block logs for individual editors, as well as Wikipedia‘s arbitration enforcement log for topic bans. To assess withdrawals (retirements or reductions in contributions), the paper uses the Wikimedia Foundation’s Xtools (which shows granular statistics for individual editors), as well as qualitatively assesses the nature of these edits on each editor‘s “user contributions” tab on Wikipedia. 27 The rhetoric of three prominent PF editors provides illustrative examples. First, a long-standing editor with approximately 65,000 edits (by 2022), who had reduced their editing significantly, complained about a liberal bias on Wikipedia, attributing it to “Unequal treatment of editors based on politics, by admins and even occasionally by arbcom. Editor headcount at contested places is also a cause. Policies that favor ‘old media’ in the US also contribute.” A second long-standing PF editor with 27,000 edits organized Wikipedia’s Conservatism project and ran a newsletter related to conservatism on Wikipedia. The editor’s rhetoric, as well as the content of the newsletter, had a consistent theme that Wikipedia’s editing environment for conservatives had grown increasingly hostile. The editor retired from 2012 to 2018 before returning briefly in early 2018 and retiring again toward the end of 2018. A third prominent PF editor with approximately 2,700 edits compiled data that purported to show that Wikipedia’s administrators were biased against conservative editors before abruptly retiring. 28 See Bennett (2008) on adjudicating between competing explanations through process tracing. 29 Wikipedia’s Reliable Sources noticeboard, the key body for evaluating source reliability, was established in 2007.

Instead, it seeks verifiability. This means that editors don&#x27;t have to be experts to write articles, which is the main reason the site is useful at all.The truth can be very elusive. So it makes sense to move that burden to the sources. reply esafak 15 hours agoparentI&#x27;d expand that: Wikipedia&#x27;s greatness is due to its policies and guidelines in general.

So right at the start, there&#x27;s some overlap between wikis, design patterns, and agile development (from back when those terms actually meant something). A big lost opportunity in the history of wikipedia was to name the body of best practices the \"Policy\"&#x2F;\"Guideline\"&#x2F;\"Essay\" system, as opposed to \"Community Patterns\". In reality they do function closer to patterns anyway, which should be unsurprising seeing the original source(s).There&#x27;s also the whole way the software works.

But if I talked to Fox News and said I was born in X, suddenly it&#x27;s \"a good source for wikipedia\".I think it&#x27;s a good rule of thumb to not have people edit articles too close to them, but for some objective facts you may as well let it in (and remember: \"facts\" means \"can be proven OR disproven\".

I can sort of see the reason if you look at something like say vaccine safety, primary sources would be papers and the like, secondary articles in the nyt and the like. The trouble with papers is there are loads and hard to understand for non specialist and you can find one saying they caused problems in this instance or not in that according to your biases.

This one pains me the most, but if we trust news sites to vet anonymous sources, may as well trust social media communities to vouch for a source really being that person. IME social media loves to call out lies, so them trusting a personality isn&#x27;t as scary as it sounds.3. be able to mark a source as \"primary\" to give a bit of distinction so we know there is some lack of vetting compared to a mainstream resource (which hopefully has such vetting built in). similar to [citation needed], it can be footnoted like [2, primary].There is and always will be nonsense that penetrates through, but I don&#x27;t think we should discount primary resources as much we do currently.

There&#x27;s no way to have a nuanced and constructive topic if it ever touches, either by implicit or explicit association, other sensitive topics. Example, create a list of the qualities that a country must fulfill to be socialist, compare that list with the characteristics of countries that are considered socialist, and find examples of countries that fit those characteristics and ask yourself why they are not considered socialist. At the end of the argument you notice that there are no country totally socialist, capitalist, communist or any other economic theory.

So yay wikipedia. reply hnbad 16 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a huge functional difference between fundraising ads (no matter how manipulative) and the kind of commercial (and behavioral) ads you see everywhere else: the incentive structure it creates. Behavioral ads also require extremely intrusive tracking.Commercial ads incentivise optimising for impressions, i.e. getting users to see as many ads as possible. This leads to clickbait, bloating one-line news bits into entire articles and extending the number of clicks necessary for a user to get what they want. Social media makes this even worse by making the ads \"content\" (i.e. \"sponsored posts\") and thus trying to drive up \"engagement\" which in practice leads to outrage bait (because people are more likely to comment or share what they disagree with or dislike).Wikipedia on the other hand just has a slightly annoying banner made more annoying by lazy-loading (and thus shifting the layout) that shows up for a few weeks each year.Unless your complaint is with \"supposedly non-profit organizations trying to make more money\" (in which case I&#x27;d say your problem might be more systemic than just a website with an ad) I&#x27;d take this over the former any day. reply nvm0n2 14 hours agorootparentThe Wikipedia ads are nothing but clickbait. Wikipedia itself doesn&#x27;t need any funds, but the ads urge users to click by claiming that the site may go offline if they don&#x27;t. Then the money is embezzled and spent on left wing causes.

The \"jerks\" thing is true in part, but I think the majority of that feel comes from a disconnect between what people want Stack Overflow to be. Many of the contributors (and the founder) want it to be Wikipedia, a place to enter search terms and find your specific problem and its solution, documented exactly once. But many novices get used to finding answers on Stack Overflow, and they quite reasonably see a bunch of questions and answers and decide it&#x27;s a place to ask for help, which it a thing that looks similar on the surface but is quite different. And so you get a lot of well-meaning answers&#x2F;moderators closing the majority of what comes in as repetitive noise, because from their perspective it is, and so the majority of people who ask (quite reasonable) questions, especially novice questions, have a terrible experience initially engaging.

I also remember the speaker relating a conversation he had with someone from whom it seems like he was asking for money: maybe a VC? The VC told the speaker, \"I sat on a plane next to somebody who told me he doesn&#x27;t answer anything on stackoverflow any more because all the questions are answered too quickly.\" And the speaker responded, \"So wait.

I quote from Jeff Atwood:> At Stack Exchange, one of the tricky things we learned about Q&A is that if your goal is to have an excellent signal to noise ratio, you must suppress discussion. Stack Exchange only supports the absolute minimum amount of discussion necessary to produce great questions and great answers. That&#x27;s why answers get constantly re-ordered by votes, that&#x27;s why comments have limited formatting and length and only a few display, and so forth.

There should be organized, easy ways to consume and switch between 2.0 and 1.0, and while I know this already exists to some extent, I am referring to a social movement on top of the technical differences. Publishers should be pressured to offer web 1.0 (or at least know that a sizeable subset of viewers only consumes 1.0).Next, there should be a market for re-publishing web2.0 into 1.0. For instance, if a news article is posted on a major outlet, services (people, bots, whatever) should crawl it and strip the content and pictures and re-serve it as web 1.0 content. Then, a browser add-on or internet service should allow you to enter the URL to the main article, but then switch to the 1.0 version (thanks to someone who already translated it).This is NOT the same as \"disable javascript in your browser\". If you do that, many sites will turn you away. I&#x27;m proposing a translation layer of a rendered webpage back to 1999 style, then sharing that document in p2p network.This would take the edge off one major form of enshittification of the web, make your mobile page load faster, eliminate tracking, and so forth.

It tends to be pretty good as a spingboard to other stuff.For politicized stuff I see it no differently than any other aggregator like Reddit or Hacker News. get a quick feel from the post and comments (yeah I even read the editor comments), look at several sources and get a feel for their bias. Then try to form my own view based on that. I see bias&#x2F;editorialization there because I see it in every single person&#x27;s POV.

There is very little diversity in the fediverse. reply afavour 19 hours agorootparentI disagree about your assessment of the early internet. It was extremely white and nerdy when looked at on average. Certainly diversity was out there but it wasn’t easily found, much like the fediverse today.Even Wikipedia (not that it counts as early internet):> I knew that early Wikipedia editors were (and kinda still are) academically-inclined hacker dudes, but it&#x27;s crazy when you realize the article about mole day, created January 2002, is an entire year older than the article \"hip hop music\" and five years older than \"fashion show\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;depthsofwiki&#x2F;status&#x2F;1716655903695425695 reply OfSanguineFire 19 hours agorootparentBy 1995 I was regularly interacting on the internet with Japanese, people in the former USSR (who wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be considered \"white\"), Romanians, etc. What was special is that when those people had political and social views that may have differed from one&#x27;s own, but were representative of their countries, they could air those views. And the result was that a user of the nascent internet could learn about the world&#x27;s diversity of societies and views.Mastodon&#x27;s federation policies, which require mod instances to police anti-LGBT speech for example, expressly excludes that. If you spend any time on the Nigerian internet, for instance, you see this is a matter that ordinary people are strident about, but they would be unwelcome in the fediverse except for those few, often westernized+hipsterized people whose views conform to what the Mastodon founding generation is comfortable with.

What is the bad kind of diversity, and what is the good kind of diversity? reply RationalDino 18 hours agorootparentThe bad kind of diversity is projecting your ideology onto others, and deciding to like them. The good kind of diversity is attempting to understand what it would be like to think in ways that are alien to you.To consider current events, let&#x27;s take Hamas. Hamas is a deeply conservative and radicalized group. They believe in banning abortion, killing gays, killing Jews, and that atheists are evil. This is not slander, they would agree with all of this. And there are good historical reasons why they believe these things.Suppose that you&#x27;re LBGTQ+ and aren&#x27;t a member of a church, and are carrying a sign saying, \"Palestine will be free from sea to sea.\" What are you actually supporting? You&#x27;re supporting people who are brown and oppressed, who in turn would like to see you dead. Now it may be that in your ideology it is worth this on ethical principles. But most people like that who I&#x27;ve dealt with simply ignore the fact that they are supporting people who believe in banning abortion, killing gays, killing Jews, and that atheists are evil. And then are caught by surprise if they encounter the fact that Hamas believes in banning abortion, killing gays, killing Jews, and that atheists are evil. (And try to forget that they heard it.)I, personally, like knowing a diverse group of people. And understanding them for who they are. I may disagree with them violently, but I still like trying to understand them. But this requires a very different kind of tolerance than most progressives preach. For a start, you can&#x27;t start by banning intolerant speech. Because there is no way to express the intolerant views that many people actually have without being willing to listen to (though not agree with) intolerant speech. reply 2devnull 14 hours agorootparentprevLike San Francisco used to be more diverse, that’s what I’m getting at. People will argue that point, because the word diversity has taken on different meanings. I’d say there is diverse-diversity and less-diverse-diversity. I prefer one thing, other people are more tribal and prefer that other structure. Both types are needed, but I think we could use a bit more diverse-diversity at the moment, to increase dynamism. Mix things up a bit. At least with respect to the internet. reply shadowgovt 13 hours agorootparentInteresting. If I&#x27;m understanding the analogy to San Fran&#x27;s past diversity, you mean like it used to be far more multicultural-but-overlapping and now it&#x27;s a bit more homogeneous-techbro even though a lot of people from different backgrounds still live there?If I&#x27;ve understood correctly... Yeah, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for good or ill but I think we see less of that kind of diversity as the enlargement of the Internet allows people to build virtual communities that are more like-minded and have less need to tolerate uncomfortable differences (in that you have the option of going somewhere else instead of \"putting up with the asshole next door\" because this is the only online space that caters to the thing you like).On the other hand, I have no strategy to force people to coexist in the same virtual space when they don&#x27;t want to, nor do I have concrete evidence that&#x27;s even a desired outcome. reply soundnote 18 hours agorootparentprevPresumably: The bad sort is a diversity where people look different but all think more or less the same, so the proponents can pat themselves on the back for being good and openminded people but don&#x27;t actually have to deal with genuinely different people.

But it was at least interesting to see the creative URLs some people come up with. reply t-3 18 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be viewing the fediverse as a blob, but it&#x27;s actually a federated network. There&#x27;s no need to join an instance if you don&#x27;t like the moderation! reply soundnote 18 hours agorootparentThe point is that the federation mechanism explicitly means that any server that is federated will have to follow those policies, because the admins of all the large servers hew to a certain ideology that will not tolerate dissent from key talking points.

I&#x27;m not running experiments, I&#x27;m trying to have a conversation. Do you or do you not believe the fediverse is ideologically homogeneous? I see people here arguing that it is, but that it is justifiably so. I don&#x27;t see anyone clearly claiming it&#x27;s not, but someone might. I think it is homogeneous for the very reasons you gave (i.e. people are not obliged to propagate speech they think is bad), but I&#x27;m not sure whether I think that&#x27;s a good or a bad thing. If you think I&#x27;m wrong about it being ideologically homogeneous, feel free to tell me.

I believe that you think that :D reply t-3 16 hours agorootparentprevThe fediverse is not ideologically or politically homogenous, there exist right-wing and apolitical instances, there exist instances targeted at exclusive and obscure subgroups, etc. If you never bother to look beyond the most popular instances, you obviously won&#x27;t see many unpopular views. reply seti0Cha 15 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s a terminology issue here. If the left and the right servers are never federated, then the experience will be homogeneous even if the fediverse is itself not. In other words, I probably shouldn&#x27;t not have used the term homogeneous and stuck with \"echo chamber\". I was trying to avoid that term because of its pejorative connotations. It seems to me there is value in being exposed to what people you disagree with are saying, and there&#x27;s value in not having all the drama that entails, which tends dominate all discourse. The fediverse by and large has chosen the later, no? reply t-3 14 hours agorootparentExperiencing homogeneity is a natural thing. Humans always self-segregate into groups when gathered in large numbers. I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with people choosing an echo chamber if that makes them happy. It&#x27;s being coerced into the echo chamber or the open forum that I disagree with. reply seti0Cha 13 hours agorootparentI more or less agree with that, but can&#x27;t help but feel that a certain amount of exposure to contrary views (even though unpleasant&#x2F;unwanted) is more healthy for society. It at least has the potential for defusing straw-man understandings and also keeps people realistic about where they stand with respect to the larger society in terms of beliefs and practices. I&#x27;m not sure that the Twitter model does much for that, but the longer form conversations like Facebook may. reply t-3 12 hours agorootparentPretty much everyone gets exposure to contrary views, and they probably wouldn&#x27;t seek out echo chambers for recreation if they didn&#x27;t! Most people don&#x27;t actually want to argue about politics when they vent on their social media, they want to engage with their friends, who probably feel similarly to them. There&#x27;s no need to worry about these conversations being unbalanced any more than you worry about balance when line workers talk shit about managers and managers talk shit about employees. If people wanted balanced conversation, they would join a political debate forum rather than a social network that connects them to their real-life friends. replyt-3 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s wrong with that, though? Forcing people who don&#x27;t want to interact to interact in the name of diversity isn&#x27;t likely to lead anywhere productive.

They don&#x27;t want me listening to Douglas Murray, or Gays Against Groomers, or Thomas Sowell.I think you&#x27;re committing the error of treating social categories as set-theoretic absolutes when humans are far more multidimensional.It&#x27;s like \"Well they&#x27;re not really patriots; they tell me Americans are great but they don&#x27;t want me talking to Benedict Arnold or Aaron Burr.\" No, they don&#x27;t, because those Americans were traitors who hurt their fellow countrymen. \"Listen to more LGBTQ voices\" and \"Don&#x27;t listen to Gays Against Groomers\" aren&#x27;t actually contradictory concepts; &#x27;listen to&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;give equal, uncritical weight to every&#x27;.The missing sociological tool you may want to dive in on is &#x27;Intersectionality,&#x27; which is the concept of how one&#x27;s privilege is contextual and multidimensional factor; a person can be both oppressed and oppressor. reply gvurrdon 17 hours agorootparentprevYour comment reminds me of a time I was a member of a sports club. One other member was thrown out as they were revealed in a newspaper article to also be an active member of a neo-Nazi organisation. But, they&#x27;d never said or done anything that gave the slightest hint of it and appeared to be quite pleasant and liked within the club.I wonder if anyone in the sports club would ever have noticed if it weren&#x27;t for a journalist looking into that neo-Nazi group. reply KittenInABox 18 hours agorootparentprevHow can you possibly claim that social diversity was universal in the old school internet when \"tits or gtfo\" was an extremely common meme for anyone who claimed to be female?No, in my experience people mostly kept to individual federated spaces dependent on interests or demographics. LGBTQ people kept to their IRC channels, black people kept to their channels, and banned anyone who was also a member of the local nazi IRC channel. This was totally normal and I don&#x27;t see a difference between 1990s era IRC and Fediverse in this respect. reply shadowgovt 18 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s nothing about the fediverse, as a protocol-backed set of services and nodes, that prevents a group of like-minded individuals from forming an LGBTQ hostile family of, for example, mastodon nodes. But there&#x27;s also nothing about the fediverse, as a community, that compels anyone else who owns a node to host or share that content.You are remembering experiences on forums or, depending on your age, BBSs or perhaps even USENET, the only system I can think of that was architected to move much power from the hands of the service administrators to the hands of the clients attaching to the service (and, not coincidentally, an experiment that lapsed into obsolescence because that&#x27;s a terrible bargain for a",

It was honestly perfectly fine, but it has a slightly different tone than ChatGPT that&#x27;s kind of hard to explain. reply wfhBrian 10 hours agoparentPeople constantly recommend Bard to me, but it returns false and&#x2F;or misleading info almost every time reply _dark_matter_ 10 hours agorootparentI had the opposite experience. I was trying to figure out what this weird lightbulb was that I had to replace, and it had no writing on it. I uploaded the description and picture to gpt4, and it just got it clearly wrong over and over. Tried bard, got it right in the first try, with links to the product. I was extremely impressed. reply dgacmu 8 hours agorootparentI had a similar experience with Google lens recently. I&#x27;ve gotten used to Yandex image search being better than Google&#x27;s for many searches, but I needed to figure out what model of faucet I had on my sink, and Google nailed it. My hunch is that because of all the work they did on Google shopping gathering labeled product images and things like that, they have an excellent internal data set when it comes to things like your light bulb and my sink. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentprevThe vast knowledge trove of Google can&#x27;t be understated, even if sometimes the model isn&#x27;t as competent at certain tasks as OpenAI&#x27;s GPT models. reply kccqzy 8 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t there just a comment today on HN saying Google had an institutional reluctance to use certain data sets like libgen? I honestly don&#x27;t think Google used everything they had to train their LLM.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38194107 reply taneq 9 hours agorootparentprevIf there&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s becoming clear in the open source LLM world, it&#x27;s that the dataset really is the &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; for LLMs. There are endless combinations of various datasets plus foundation model plus training approach, and by far the key determinant of end model performance seems to be the dataset used. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s that the dataset really is the &#x27;secret sauce&#x27;alwayshasbeen.jpgThere have been articles about how \"data is the new oil\" for a couple of decades now, with the first reference I could find being from British mathematician Clive Humby in 2006 [0]. The fact that it rings even more true in the age of LLMs is simply just another transformation of the fundamental data underneath.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Clive_Humby#cite_ref-10 reply still_grokking 34 minutes agorootparent2006?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scientia_potentia_est reply notfed 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is almost certainly just delegating to Google Lens, which indeed works great.Bard&#x27;s probably just a middle man here. reply downWidOutaFite 9 hours agorootparentI would think that ChatGPT is also delegating to some other subsystem. reply broast 8 hours agorootparentRight, a glance at the new Assistant API docs, which seems to mirror ChatGPT in functionality, suggests that the \"Assistant\" determines which tool to use, or which models to use (code or chat) to generate a response message. The API is limited in that it can&#x27;t use Vision or generate images, but I imagine that those are just \"Tools\" too that the assistant has access to. reply hackernewds 9 hours agorootparentprevwith a poorer dataset than google reply tomrod 9 hours agorootparentprevUnless wired to Bing, probably not? reply huytersd 9 hours agorootparentprevAh that’s interesting, did know bard had multi modal inputs. reply jfoster 8 hours agorootparentprevI asked Bard the question \"Who is Elon Musk?\"The response: \"I&#x27;m a text-based AI, and that is outside of my capabilities.\" reply guiambros 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s interesting. Did you have anything else in the thread, or was it just the first question?For me it returns a seemingly accurate answer [1], albeit missing his involvement with Twitter&#x2F;X. But LLMs are intrinsically stochastic, so YMMV.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;bard&#x2F;share&#x2F;378c65b56aea reply jfoster 2 hours agorootparentIt was the first question in the thread, and I&#x27;ve been testing queries along these lines on it for a while. Interestingly, it started writing a response initially and then replaced it with that. It used to refuse to answer who Donald Trump is as well, but it seems that one has been fixed.Another interesting line of inquiry (potentially revealing some biases) is to ask it whether someone is a supervillain. For certain people it will rule it out entirely, and for others it will tend to entertain the possibility by outlining reasons why they might be a supervillain, and adding something like \"it is impossible to say definitively whether he is a supervillain\" at the end. reply fijiaarone 8 hours agorootparentprevSo Elon is the engine behind Bard? reply Alupis 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes you think ChatGPT isn&#x27;t also returning false and&#x2F;or misleading info? Maybe you just haven&#x27;t noticed...Personally, I struggle with anything even slightly technical from all of the current LLM&#x27;s. You really have to know enough about the topic to detect BS when you see it... which is a significant problem for those using it as a learning tool. reply glitchcrab 8 hours agorootparentThis is my problem with chatgpt and why I won&#x27;t use it; I&#x27;ve seen it confidently return incorrect information enough times that I just cannot trust it. reply nazgul17 8 hours agorootparentThe version with search will give you links to the references it bases its answers on. reply Alupis 8 hours agorootparentYou still have to go read the references and comprehend the material to determine if the GPT answer was correct or not.I don&#x27;t know the name for the effect, but it&#x27;s similar to when you listen&#x2F;watch the news. When the news is about a topic you know an awful lot about, it&#x27;s plainly obvious how wrong they are. Yet... when you know little about the topic, you just trust what you hear even though they&#x27;re as likely to be wrong about that topic as well.The problem is people (myself included) try to use GPT as a guided research&#x2F;learning tool, but it&#x27;s filled with constant BS. When you don&#x27;t know much about the topic, you&#x27;re not going to understand what is BS and what is not. reply tombert 7 hours agorootparentIn my particular case, the fact that it returns bullshit is kind of useful.Obviously they need to fix that for realistic usage, but I use it as a studying technique. Usually when I ask it to give me some detailed information about stuff that I know a bit about, it will get some details about it wrong. Then I will argue with it until it admits that it was mistaken.Why is this useful? Because it gets \"just close enough to right\" that it can be an excellent study technique. It forces me to think about why it&#x27;s wrong, how to explain why it&#x27;s wrong, and how to utilize research papers to get a better understanding. reply tatrajim 7 hours agorootparentprevThe Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect reply faeriechangling 3 hours agorootparentprevI get information from unreliable sources all the time. In fact all my sources are unreliable.I just ignore how confident ChatGPT sounds. reply lodovic 3 hours agorootparentprevTrue, it often returns solutions that may work but are illogical. Or solutions that use tutorial style code and fall apart once you tinker a bit with it. reply cainxinth 7 hours agorootparentprevGpt-4 has the lowest hallucination rates:> OpenAI’s technologies had the lowest rate, around 3 percent. Systems from Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, hovered around 5 percent. The Claude 2 system offered by Anthropic, an OpenAI rival also based in San Francisco, topped 8 percent. A Google system, Palm chat, had the highest rate at 27 percent.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;technology&#x2F;chatbots-hallu... reply mmasu 5 hours agorootparenti just skimmed through the article - it seems that the numbers are quoted from a company called Vectara. Would be interesting to see how they are getting to this estimate reply fijiaarone 8 hours agorootparentprevSounds like Bard is catching up with ChatGPT in features then. reply schleck8 10 hours agorootparentprevI noticed that too, it just doesn&#x27;t seem that good reply verdverm 14 hours agoparentprevBard has different training data and regime, that alone is enough to start to understand why they are different.The main thing as a user is that they require different nudges to get the answer you are after out of them, i.e. different ways of asking or prompt eng&#x27;n reply tombert 14 hours agorootparentYeah, which is why I use the paid version of ChatGPT still, instead of the free Google Bard or Bing AI; I&#x27;ve gotten good enough at coercing the GPT-4 model to give me the stuff I want.Honestly, $20&#x2F;month is pretty cheap in my case; I feel like I definitely extract much more than $20 out of it every month, if only on the number of example stubs it gives me alone. reply verdverm 13 hours agorootparentI stopped paying OpenAI because they went down or were \"too busy\" so much of the time I wanted to use it. Bard (or more so the VertexAI APIs) are always up and reliable and do not require a monthly fee, just the per call reply water-your-self 11 hours agorootparentHow often was OpenAI down that you wanted to look elsewhere? reply Baeocystin 10 hours agorootparentNot the person you asked, but (paid) ChatGPT was down so often for me that I almost cancelled... Until I switched to connecting via VPN. Only one outage since then For some reason whole swaths of the Spectrum IP block in Gilroy has trouble. reply nomel 5 hours agorootparentprevThe custom prompts feature, and the \"about me\" mostly fixed this for me, with my usual conversations. In both, I convinced it that I&#x27;m competent, and that it doesn&#x27;t need to hold my hand, so much.I&#x27;ve also noticed that API based clients (rather than the web or iOS client) result in conversations that hold my hand less. The voice client seems hopeless though, probably because I write ok, but have trouble saying what I want before the stupid thing cuts me off. It seems to love making lists, and ignoring what I want. reply lodovic 3 hours agorootparentprevIs there a difference between OpenAI and Bing AI? They both claim to use GPT-4. reply TillE 7 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve found that Bard has an overly aggressive filter, like if I&#x27;m brainstorming ideas about thieves in a fantasy world (think Lies of Locke Lamora), it will frequently refuse to cooperate.I think it&#x27;s running some kind of heuristic on the output before passing it to the user, because slightly different prompts will sometimes succeed.ChatGPT&#x27;s system is smart enough to recognize that fantasy crimes are not serious information about committing real crimes or whatever. reply vasco 1 hour agorootparentYou saying \"help me plot a real crime\" or \"help me write the plot of a crime for a book\", should yield the same result. Any moral system that forbids one but not the other is just for show, since obviously you can get the exact same outcome both ways. reply lopatin 16 hours agoparentprevI used it for the first time today too, for the same reason. It was slower and much worse at coding. I was just asking it for SQL aggregation queries and it just ignored some of my requirements for the query. reply tombert 16 hours agorootparentIn my case, I was just asking it for a cheeky name for a talk I want to give in a few months. The suggestions it gave were of comparable quality to what I think ChatGPT would have given me. reply Tommstein 12 hours agorootparentIn my experience, Bard is much, much better at creative things than at things that have correct and incorrect answers. reply nomel 5 hours agorootparentI subscribe to the belief that, for a chat model with the same parameters, creativity will be proportional to tendency to hallucinate, and inversely proportional to the factual answers. I suspect an unaligned model, without RLHF, wouldn&#x27;t adhere to this. reply tompetry 16 hours agorootparentprevI have seen noticably worse results with Bard, especially with long prompts. Claude (by Anthropic) has been my backup to ChatGPT. reply Filligree 12 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT was down, so of course it&#x27;d be slower. And possibly that accounts for some quality loss as well.For a fair comparison, you probably need to try while ChatGPT is working. reply willsmith72 9 hours agorootparent> ChatGPT was down, so of course it&#x27;d be slowerActually at Google scale I wouldn&#x27;t expect so reply kccqzy 8 hours agorootparentYeah but Google missed the boat when it came to hardware accelerators specifically meant for LLMs (their proprietary TPUs aren&#x27;t optimized for LLMs) so it&#x27;s just a matter of whether Google or Microsoft paid Nvidia more. In the current cost cutting climate at Google I doubt the answer is so certain. reply IanCal 11 hours agorootparentprevThe extension with gpt4 as a backend was ime extremely slow as standard. I&#x27;ve not tried it again with the v7 model though which is supposed to be a lot faster reply zhenyakovalyov 2 hours agoparentprevi like antropic’s claude.ai, use them side-by-side. reply siilats 15 hours agoparentprevI used https:&#x2F;&#x2F;you.com&#x2F;chat wasn&#x27;t bad, they have a free month trial coupon \"codegpt\" for the GPT4 model and GPT3.5 is free ... reply frabcus 19 hours agoprevPhind is pretty good for coding (LLama 2 trained on billions of extra code tokens) and is still up https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phind.com&#x2F;s reply ttcbj 13 hours agoparentI am curious how people are using Phind.I actually had a discussion with Phind itself recently, in which I said that in order to help me, it seems like it would need to ingest my codebase so that it understands what I am talking about. Without knowing my various models, etc, I don&#x27;t see how it could write anything but the most trivial functions.It responded that, yes, it would need to ingest my codebase, but it couldn&#x27;t.It was fairly articulate and seemed to understand what I was saying.So, how do people get value out of Phind? I just don&#x27;t see how it can help with any case where your function takes or returns a non-trivial class as a parameter. And if can&#x27;t do that, what is the point? reply tacone 11 hours agorootparentI am using Phind quite a lot. It&#x27;s using it&#x27;s own model along GPT 4 while still being free.It is also capable to perform searches, which lead me - forgive me founders - to abuse it quite a lot: whenever I am not finding a good answer from other search engines I turn up to Phind even for things totally unrelated to software development, and it usually goes very well.Sometimes I even ask it to summarize a post, or tell me what HN is talking about today.I am very happy with it and hope so much it gains traction! reply rushingcreek 12 hours agorootparentprevFounder here. We have a VS Code extension that automatically fetches context from your codebase. reply aatd86 11 hours agorootparentSo if source available libraries are imported, they are also parsed by the AI?So if I create a GPT for my open-source library as a way to fund it, all these copilot etc. are going to compete with me?Just wondering because that would be a bummer to not have this avenue to fund open-source code. reply CGamesPlay 9 hours agorootparentI am not related to Phind or any other AI company, but yes, this is definitely the case, and you should assume that they will be ingesting your code through regular web scrapes now (giving extremely general knowledge about your library) and through reading specifically the library source code soon (this is what you are asking about here). If you wanted to try this strategy, I would suggest that you do it by providing the model with a large database of high-quality examples specific to your library (so, perhaps the examples section of your website, plus snippets from open source projects that use the library). These will probably be the last to be specifically ingested by general coding models. reply pozol 4 hours agorootparentprevDoes the plugin use the codebase code in the model itself for training, or does it stay locally? Just curious about the privacy. reply rushingcreek 4 hours agorootparentWe won’t use your codebase for training. And there is an option you can toggle that disables data retention entirely. reply tacone 11 hours agorootparentprevWoah , didn&#x27;t know that! Thanks for pointing out! reply taneq 9 hours agorootparentprevThanks for releasing Phind-CodeLLaMA-34B-v2, it&#x27;s been helping me get up to speed with node and web apps and so far it&#x27;s been spot on. :) Super impressive work. reply beautifulfreak 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve used it to interpret messages in the Mac console app. I wish it could explain what causes certain messages to appear over and over. reply leumassuehtam 18 hours agoparentprevI had great results with Phind. Their newest fine tune model (V7) has been a pleasant experience and better than most open source models out there.Nit: your link has a trailing \"s\" which makes it 404 :) reply Isthatablackgsd 17 hours agorootparentMe too. For past few weeks, I had been working on my AHK scripting with Phind. It produced working code consistently and provided excellent command line for various software.Also I use it for LaTeX, too. It is very helpful providing various package than trying to hunt more information through Google. I got a working tex file within 15 min than it took me 3 weeks 5 years ago! reply coffeecantcode 18 hours agoparentprevI’ve had some consistency issues with phind but as a whole I have no real complaints, just glitches here and there with large prompts not triggering responses and reply options disappearing.As a whole I think it works well in tandem with ChatGPT to bounce ideas or get alternate perspectives.(I also love the annotation feature where it shows the websites that it pulled the information from, very well done) reply JCharante 18 hours agoparentprevPhind seems to be down\"The inference service may be temporarily unavailable - we have alerts for this and will be fixing it soon.\" reply enoch2090 5 hours agoparentprevBeen playing with Phind for a while and my conclusion is: the Phind model works well on those long existing stuff like C++ libraries, but works generally bad on newer stuff, such as composing LCEL chains. reply m3kw9 18 hours agoparentprevThe first coding question I tested it on, it gave me something completely wrong and it was pretty easy stuff, I’m sure it gets a lot right but this just shows unreliability reply lannisterstark 15 hours agorootparentPhind for me has worked pretty bleh compared to just back and forth conversation with a python GPT4 bot I made lol. reply nomel 5 hours agorootparentGPT4 completion or chat model? reply bomewish 13 hours agorootparentprevTo use the api and stop them logging your chat?

So having that option is good.And perhaps the biggest deal of all, I can finally \"shop from home.\" That was a huge problem for me before, I kept thinking, \"if only I had a better refrigerator I could finally buy things on websites.\"And this is a great bargain for only 3-5 thousand dollars! I can&#x27;t believe I was planning to buy some crappy normal refrigerator for less than a thousand bucks and then use the extra money I saved to mount a giant flat-screen TV hooked up to a Chromecast in my kitchen.

It&#x27;s most useful with the backend XML markups, not WYSIWYG editors.So, we take the inputs from engineers and other stakeholders, essentially in email formats. Then we pass it through prompts that we&#x27;ve been working on for a while. Then it&#x27;ll output working XML that we can use with a tad bit of clean-up (though that&#x27;s been decreasing).It&#x27;s a lot more complicated than just that, of course, but that&#x27;s the basics.Also, it&#x27;s been really nice to see these chat based AIs helping others code. Some of the manuals team is essentially illiterate when it comes to code. This time last year, they were at best able to use excel. Now, with the AIs, they&#x27;re writing Python code of moderate complexity to do tasks for themselves and the team. None of it is by any means &#x27;good&#x27; coding, it&#x27;s total hacks. But it&#x27;s really nice to see them come up to speed and get things done. To see the magic of coding manifest itself in, for example, 50 year old copy editors that never thought they were smart enough.

Either in a context where you&#x27;re not sure what the a good approach is (for myself, when writing Javascript for example), or when you know what needs to be done but it&#x27;s just somewhat tedious.Here&#x27;s a session from me working on a side project yesterday:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;a6928c16-1c18-4c08-ae02-82538d...The most impressive thing I think starts in the middle:* I paste in some SQL tables and the golang structrues I wanted stuff to go into, and described in words what I wanted; and it generated a multi-level query with several joins, and then some post-processing in golang to put it into the form I&#x27;d asked for.* I say, \"if you do X, you can use slices instead of a map\", and it rewrites the post-processing to use slices instead of a map* I say, \"Can you rewrite the query in goqu, using these constants?\" and it does.I didn&#x27;t take a record of it, but a few months ago I was doing some data analysis, and I pasted in a quite complex SQL query I&#x27;d written a year earlier (the last time I was doing this analysis), and said \"Can you modify it to group all rows less than 1% of the total into a single row labelled &#x27;Other&#x27;?\" And the resulting query worked out of the box.It&#x27;s basically like having a coding minion.Once there&#x27;s a better interface for accessing and modifying your local files &#x2F; buffers, I&#x27;m sure it will become even more useful.EDIT: Oh, and Monday I asked, \"This query is super slow; can you think of a way to make it faster?\" And it said, \"Query looks fine; do you have indexes on X Y and Z columns of the various tables?\" I said, \"No; can you write me SQL to add those indexes?\" Then ran the SQL to create indexes, and the query went from taking >10 minutes to taking 2 seconds.(As you can tell, I&#x27;m neither a web dev nor a database dev...) reply distortionfield 12 hours agorootparentThis lines up with my general experience with it.

This must be done within the same transaction as the create or update, so you&#x27;re adding an unnecessary overhead to every single one of those ops. Now, if the data is relatively small or the use-case doesn&#x27;t warrant it, it doesn&#x27;t matter.Lesser issues: additional strain on index rebuilding whenever that happens; messing with execution plans and causing the query planner to be inefficient; primary&#x2F;secondary memory overhead; or if your DB engine uses locks you can run into a myriad of issues there.I&#x27;m all for SWEs learning about databases, as I&#x27;m morally opposed to the proliferation of ORMs and the like, but I don&#x27;t think ChatGPT is the right way to go about things long-term.

Even for short sentences I don&#x27;t like, I&#x27;ll ask it for some options to reword&#x2F;simplify.I also use it heavily for formatting adjustments. Instead of hand-formatting a transcript I pull from YouTube, I paste it into Claude and have it reformat the transcript into something more like paragraphs. Many otherwise tedious reformatting tasks can be simplified with an LLM.I also will get an LLM to develop flashcards for a given set of notes to drill on, which is nice, though I usually have to heavily edit the output to include everything I think I should study.In class, if I&#x27;m falling behind on notetaking, I&#x27;ll get the LLM to generate the note I&#x27;m trying to write down by just asking it a basic question, like: \"What is anarchism in a sentence?\" That way I can focus on what the teacher is saying while the LLM keeps my notes relevant. I&#x27;ll skim what it generates and edit to fit what my prof said, but it&#x27;s nice because I can pay better attention than if I feel I have to keep track of what the prof might test me on. This actually is a note-taking technique I&#x27;ve learned about where you only write down the question and look up the answer later, but I think it&#x27;s nice I now can do the lookup right there and tailor it to exactly how the prof is phrasing it&#x2F;what they&#x27;re focusing on about the topic. reply paradite 2 hours agoparentprevI experimented with using a streamlined workflow to use ChatGPT (GPT-4) for coding tasks.In the end I settled on a standalone desktop app to \"compose\" prompt with source code, instructions and formatting options which I can just copy paste into ChatGPT.The app is available for download if anyone is interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prompt.16x.engineer&#x2F; reply chrisjc 12 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know what you do for a living&#x2F;hobby, or what you might be interested in using ChatGPT to do for you, but here is how I became familiar with it and integrated it into my workflow.

I have the tendency to get caught up in some trivial functionality, thus losing focus on the overall larger and greater objective.If I need to create some trivial functionality, I start with unit tests and a stubbed out function (defining the shape of the input). I enumerate sufficient input&#x2F;output test cases to provide context for what I want the function to do.Then I ask copilot&#x2F;ChatGPT to define the function&#x27;s implementation. It sometimes takes time to tune the dialog or add some edge cases to the the test cases, but more often than not copilot comes through.Then I&#x27;m back to focusing on the original objective.

    "originLink": "https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/",
    "originBody": "This is the Torre Hercón (Hercón Tower) in A Coruña. It has 31 floors, 24 of which are dwelling units. It was inaugurated in 1975 and is the tallest building in Galicia🏙 It was developed by a publicly 'protected' (subsidised) housing cooperative. The architect convinced them to build high-rise and that the flats should be large, well-ventilated and well-lit☀ Tall buildings allow for more people to live in less space. A Coruña is the city with the largest average building height in Spain and some of its square kilometres are the most densely populated in the entire country. Let's look at the map, which shows all the buildings constructed in the capital of the Galician province according to their height. The ones in pink are the tallest buildings and the ones in green are the ones with the fewest floors. In A Coruña, as in all big Spanish cities, people live in apartments🏢 Spain is one of the countries with the highest percentages of apartment dwellers in the world, according to data from the OECD. The concentration of population in a small spaces is even greater than in countries such as Switzerland, Germany or Italy. Only in South Korea more people live in collective dwellings than in Spain. Percentage (%) of population living in collective dwellings, as opposed to single-family houses and townhouses Country % living in apartments South Korea74% Spain65% Switzerland62% Greece59% Germany56% Italy53% Sweden47% Portugal45% Japan44% EU41% France34% Canada33% USA26% Belgium22% Netherlands21% UK15% Source: OCDE Why and how did we get here? Join us on this historical tour and we'll show you. Let's travel to Barcelona's old town: the Ciutat Vella district. These narrow streets were enclosed by a wall 🏰 until 1854. The population density was high. It was believed that diseases🦠 were spread in the form of poisonous air through miasmas. This is how cholera was depicted in the 19th century 👇 Ildefons Cerdà wanted to demonstrate that the high population density was deadly. With his design of the Eixample, influenced by the hygienist movement, his proposed planning for the city lowered population density and regenerated the air. Cerdà thought of open blocks with interior gardens🌳. Speculation truncated his plan. In the end, some areas of the Eixample became denser than the Ciutat Vella. Today, Barcelona is one of the tallest and densest cities in the country. So are the municipalities on its periphery, such as L'Hospitalet or Santa Coloma, which grew from the 1950s onwards, as a result of the rural exodus👨🌾. Data from the Spanish Cadastre (not includign Euskadi and Navarra) shows this relationship in most Spanish cities. The taller the constructions in the cities are, the higher its population density. In addition to the Barcelona metropolitan area, other urban areas such as Cádiz and Valencia are among the densest and tallest so far. Comparison between population density and average height of cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants Source: Spanish Cadastre, INE (Spanish Statistical Office) Between 1950 and 1975, thousands of Spaniards migrated from the countryside🚜to the city🌆. Franco's dictatorship Ministry of Housing promoted the construction of high-rise housing estates to accommodate them. This is the \"Antonio Rueda\" housing group, consisting of 1,002 low-income social housing units. This type of development was influenced by the modern movement. During the 60's and 70's more dwellings were built in Spain, and these were higher than ever. Thus, the first 'metropolitan crowns' were created, surrounding the historic nuclei and the 'ensanches' (widenings) of the beginning of the century. 👇 Buildings with 5 or more stories per decade Source: Spanish Cadastre Housing blocks built under Francoist developmentalism started with four stories because there was no money for elevators. Then came the H-shaped blocks, which incorporated an elevator and more stories so as to make it profitable. The distribution of dwellings in each city according to the number of floors in the building shows this phenomenon. For example, most of the industrial belts within large cities concentrate their housing in 5-story buildings. Also developed in the 1970s, other industrial estates such as Fuenlabrada, Alcorcón and L'Hospitalet condense most of their housing in buildings with seven, eight or more floors. Distribution of dwellings in each municipality according to the number of floors of the building Source: Spanish Cadastre An example of these H-shaped polygon developments is in Móstoles, on the outskirts of Madrid. From the 1980s onwards, the rural exodus slowed down. At the same time, the 'urban sprawl'🏡, inspired by American suburbs, arrived in Spain. Municipalities such as Sant Cugat del Vallès (Barcelona), Godella (Valencia) or Pozuelo (Madrid) are good examples of urban sprawl. The housing is single-family🏠. The population density is very low, which increases the cost of public services. But such real estate is a luxury and does not reach many people. Urban sprawl would continue in the form of townhouses🏘, especially during the 1990s, and housing blocks. In Santa Marta de Tormes, in the metropolitan area of Salamanca, there are several developments of townhouses, also called 'pearl necklaces'. This change is clearly shown in the evolution of housing built in each decade in Spain. While buildings of five or more floors were in the majority during the first development boom in the 1960s and 1970s, during the real-estate bubble mainly low-rise dwellings were built. Evolution of the number of dwellings built in each decade, according to the number of floors of the building Source: Spanish Cadastre Parallel to the townhouse fever, and after the polygons and H-blocks, came the next generation of housing blocks: the perimeter block, which would predominate from the 1990s until the bursting of the real-estate bubble and after the recovery. Parque Venecia, a neighborhood in Zaragoza, is a prime example of a new neighborhood with perimeter blocks. It was planned in the middle of the bubble and its urbanization began in 2008. Its 7,000 residents, young families with children, have denounced the lack of public services. . These new 'ensanches' offer more affordable housing than the consolidated city and attract the middle classes. They tend to be sparse and disconnected from the city. City centers rised in value before the outbreak of COVID-19. After the pandemic, the demand for single-family homes and apartments in the metropolitan areas has increased. Evolution of the percentage (%) of single-family home sales and purchases Source: Bank of Spain But contemporary urban planning trends point in another direction: compact, complex and cohesive cities. What is the appropriate height for a city? And what is the appropiate density? Where is Spanish urban planning heading and where should it be heading?",

Wish more titea were build this way. It was an awesome experience! I’m an outsider living in Spain for the last 22 years, I think that while the content portrays a reality of the high rise movement in Spain, there is an angle that was missed. It is important to say that the at time draconian land laws pay an important role in the urban landscape. Not to mention that Spain relative young democracy ( we won’t talk about that the today ) also plays am important role into shaping the urban seen. Lots of change in the government parties have also lead to constrains and or retains during several periods. Ok his has mean that different areas would grow artificially dependent on the “favoritism” at play at the moment through favorable zoning changes or subsidized public housing. Albeit and thankfully at the moment, Spain has not discovers property taxes like the US, it contains growth with little planning and driven by massive speculation which has been an economic driver for major cities even with relative low occupation rates. There is also the fundamental culture of buy vs rent that drives for more flats been built to keep up with the demand. On the plus side, one the the biggest differences I have seen in Spain is a relative wide spread economic demographic in the cities, where you don’t see the major changes like most other major city across the world, it happens but it’s neither common or as drastic as the rest. reply wackget 14 hours agoparentUnpopular opinion but I hate the design of the site.

But most of them are single family houses connected &#x27;rijtjeshuis&#x27;. Think of them as flat buildings flipped over. I can imagine with the countries muddy soil it was the cheaper solution to build this way.About weight, you can see the strength of the soil in the historic buildings. Like Delft: 3 stories high. Zaandam: 2 stories where one is build from wood. Amsterdam is build on wooden piles allowing for 5 stories.And you can also see wealth in the height of the building. The Hague is most famous for that (as they say you come from clay or from sand), poor areas were build on clay -> low buildings. Rich areas were build on sand, high ceiling heavy buildings. Living on sand was&#x2F;is healthier also, another reason why the rich flocked there. reply em500 12 hours agorootparent> But most of them are single family houses connected &#x27;rijtjeshuis&#x27;.

Similarly, drain water needs special care to ensure the falling water doesn&#x27;t burst the plumbing.You local fire may code allow for less strict standards if the fire department ladder trucks can just drive up to each window and rescue someone in a burning building. If that cannot happen people need to get down the stairs in case of fire (I&#x27;ve always wondering how the disabled will do this) so you need to ensure those stairs can be used in case of fire.Floor space per person is also a factor. Richer people tend to be willing to pay for more space than poor people, and poor people tend to have more kids. Thus if you make larger apartments you don&#x27;t need as much elevator space. This one is tricky though as rich people tend to prefer newer buildings so you might discover that when the building gets old you can&#x27;t rent some apartments because of the building max occupancy. Still, office buildings tend to have a lot more people per area, and they are more likely to leave at the same time, so I don&#x27;t think space per person can be a big factor. (but school dorms need to consider all students going to class at the same time)As the person paying for a building you get to optimize those factors (generally for profit, but you can pick other considerations). Good luck. reply jupp0r 13 hours agoparentprevThis is obviously a function of the price of land, otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t see very large high rises in Manhattan or similar. reply bombcar 13 hours agoparentprevThe optimum is based on land value, clearly, because in places where the land is effectively free or incredibly low cost, buildings don&#x27;t seem to naturally get above 2 or 3 stories.So somewhere between 3 and 12 stories is a local optimum, and it&#x27;s probably about where you need additional \"machine floors\". reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentWhere land is free 5 floors is the optimum just because nobody will accept more than 3 without expensive elevators (it may not even be legal if you would accept it!). Most people are willing to pay a little bit more for a larger foundation just for less floors.For car oriented locations 1 floor is optimal because the type of building that can handle more than one level of cars is so expensive you want to just build a large parking lot. (In theory the humans could be in taller buildings, but the space used for humans becomes a rounding error, and so you may as well avoid the expensive elevator) reply germandiago 17 hours agoprevIt is true.

I guess some of our heat insulation demands make it so that we get extra thick walls and floors, but I&#x27;ve never heard any noise from neighbors. No tv sounds, no stamping feet etc. Maybe twice a year someone drills a hole to mount something on the walls and I hear that for a few minutes. Even have a train passing by outside I can&#x27;t hear with the windows closed.Point being that it depends.Edit: modern fire safety also dictates a bit how contained each unit should be, I guess. reply J_Shelby_J 17 hours agorootparentI live in a modern mid-rise in Dallas.Same experience. Most noise comes from people in the hallways because a solid wood door does not insulate sound.Traffic noise could be improved with triple pane windows, but really it&#x27;s just un-restricted mufflers that penetrate, and that should be handled by the city. reply Karrot_Kream 14 hours agorootparentThe problem is that while the shape of single-family home suburbs are meticulously controlled (e.g. minimum width between each house, minimum width from the street to your home), the world of apartments are conversely very lightly regulated. California building codes added an optional appendix for noiseproofing standards for multi-family units that cities can opt-into and yet the cities with some of the strictest&#x2F;most expansive SFH zoning in the Bay Area refuse to opt into this standard. I live in a multi-family unit where the HOA meticulously controls R-value of the units and puts up a huge process&#x2F;review phase when changing any flooring material, but the end result is that unless kids are screaming at the top of their lungs we hear nothing. We&#x27;ve held karaoke parties past midnight and our neighbors have heard nothing (we&#x27;ve asked.)In other words, the problem is politics. Cities need to want to make multi-family development appealing to encourage their residents to live there.

Several people I know that have moved into recently-built units have complained that they can hear far more neighbor noise than they used to in their old units. This also seems to track with my experience -- I live in an older unit and can only hear my adjacent neighbors when they slam their front door, or when they&#x27;re having a very loud party on a weekend. Yet when I visit friends that live in newer units, sometimes I can hear the neighbors talking at normal conversation levels through the walls.I&#x27;m completely speculating, but maybe in newer construction, they can now use insulation materials with a very high R rating that are still fairly thin, so while you get the good thermal insulation, sound transmission is increased because there&#x27;s less material in the way now. Older buildings that made up for the materials not being as high R-rated tended to do so via volume, which also helped with sound deadening. I think in a lot of places, you also need to have firewalls between units so that fire in one unit doesn&#x27;t easily spread to others, but I expect those materials have also improved over the decades to where they still provide the same fire protection, but no longer have the mass to offer as much sound deadening. reply hadlock 14 hours agorootparentA lot of units use 1&#x2F;2 inch or in many cases less. Upgrading to 5&#x2F;8\" makes a big difference, and installing another 1&#x2F;2\" on top of that gives impressive noise dampening via additional mass. As does fiberglass insulation, and filling gaps around the edges. If you don&#x27;t have to meet firewall code for certain walls, you can go a lot thinner and noise reduction goes down dramatically. We had an apartment that was converted from condos and noise dampening was significant. Noise was a major consideration (closely after neighborhood) when doing selection. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s often not much insulation requirement between units because the entire building envelope is what carries the main insulation, so it&#x27;s builder&#x27;s choice if they want to noise insulate above and beyond the firewall requirements.The worst in my experience has been units originally designed for rich quiet people that now are being rented by families. reply wing-_-nuts 16 hours agorootparentprevJust a tip for anyone dealing with noise in a multi-tenant situation.

I suppose it also matters if any of your neighbors are 23 and like powerful stereos - but that holds pretty much anywhere that isn&#x27;t very rural.Oh, and in dense urban&#x2F;busy areas, height matters too.

London is similar, despite not everyone needing a car there is traffic everywhere, you can notice that there&#x27;s back streets and they tend to be very quiet until there are lots and lots of people, think >200 in a 100sqm area.Having the ability to escape noise is the most important part of noise management.

Public transit is generally whisper-quiet (as far as the riders; the trains themselves of course are not), as people generally don&#x27;t talk much, and talking on the phone is prohibited. People who make too much noise will probably get the police called on them, but that only works in a society where there&#x27;s a culturally low tolerance for noise, so it&#x27;s not really up to the authorities. reply rickydroll 18 hours agorootparentprevWhen I live in rural low noise areas bp is 125&#x2F;75 range. high noise areas bp is 155&#x2F;105 range.

Why are you and grandma yelling?\"Nope, nothing was wrong. That&#x27;s just how they talk to each other in Spanish. Weird. It also never occurred to me why I didn&#x27;t notice until whatever age I was, a teenager in high school. It never really occurred to me that they were always &#x27;yelling&#x27; while talking to each other until that moment.There is the possibility that they really were upset and yelling, but my mother didn&#x27;t often keep things from me (at least not as far as I know). I also noticed the yelling afterwards, so I&#x27;m confident that was me simply realizing that&#x27;s how they talked after years of not noticing. reply throwaway8877 18 hours agoparentprevNowhere else I have seen a conversation to constantly erupt between total strangers than in Spain.

Can’t remember if they did the ceiling too.Unfortunately, no flooring standards are an issue. In my Canadian condo, if you redo the floors, there’s some noise insulating requirement for your choice of flooring as it’s against concrete. reply treespace8 17 hours agoparentprevI feel that&#x27;s why many people, especially families prefer detached homes. Sound proofing is guaranteed by the air gap. And if there is a problem with soundproofing you can solve it yourself by making changes.Perhaps row houses are best? Good density, and with a solid concrete wall seperating units to stop sound and fire from spreading? reply treis 17 hours agoprevSpain also has the lowest fertility rate in Europe at 1.28. Not sure how much apartment living is cause or effect on that but it&#x27;s a grim number. Every generation is only 60% the size of the one that came before it. reply Lord-Jobo 17 hours agoparentThis is slightly aside, but the concerns over fertility rates in the first world really seem REALLY misplaced to me. Population growth concerns are easily mitigated with immigration which will stay in demand until the rest of the worlds fertility rates catch up(40+ years), and the population growth concerns themselves are a reflection of an outdated (or soon to be outdated) economic model that we should probably focus on replacing or phasing out? Im not sure why THAT isnt the next step, and instead we have so many whackos in government trying to force pregnancies and other wild policies. Yeah, its a hard, big, complex problem and will probably require a decade of modeling&#x2F;testing like what is happening with UBI testing in small cities. Maybe its just a reflection of the times when the people we elect reach for the most insane heavy handed solutions for every problem, and proceed to publicly fill their pants at the very concept of change. reply ShrigmaMale 16 hours agorootparentyou&#x27;re acting as though an immigrant from any of the dense population centers has the same impact as a native-born child on the culture and economy. that is false. sometimes it&#x27;s for the better (in America, we have many well-educated immigrants from India and China). sometimes it&#x27;s for the worse (see Europe&#x27;s struggles with uneducated muslim immigrants from north Africa and the Middle East).importing large groups of people sometimes works; we did it pretty well in America because we had so much room to grow. transportation and communication were also much harder, so it was less easy for people to maintain ties to their former country and family there; they adapted a little more, though ethnic ghettos were still a problem.it&#x27;s not an intractable problem but saying \"just get immigrants bro\" isn&#x27;t really a good solution. we are sometimes biased in the US because we are selective (too much so, I think). we bring in the best from high-population areas like Africa and India and we see benefits for that. on the other hand, while migrant working and a moderate level of illegal immigration are fine and even economically beneficial, it would be silly to deny that the current levels are causing severe problems. when you lose that selectivity and control, things don&#x27;t turn out so well. and to import enough people to make up for falling birthrates we would have to broaden our horizons beyond skilled workers. reply btbuildem 15 hours agorootparentYou omit the masses of working poor immigrants that do a lot of the manual labour North Americans do not want to do -- predominantly in agriculture, construction, small manufacturing, and healthcare. They&#x27;re the de-facto essential workers.Europe&#x27;s struggles seem to be caused more by a culture clash. Immigrants will always bring their way of life with them, and group together - it&#x27;s a constant of human nature, this is how we preserve identity. Moving to a different country is a traumatic experience when done voluntarily; imagine having to permanently leave home under duress and on short notice.As an immigrant myself, what always struck me as paradoxical is the nationalist &#x2F; cultural pride that a lot of immigrants tend to display. I&#x27;d sum up my knee-jerk reaction to it as \"Bro, if X is so great, why did you leave?\" -- again, this is spoken as a person who left their homeland, with first-hand experience of some of the complex issues that surround all that. I still don&#x27;t quite understand what drives that \"flag-waving\", but I hope to one day.Having said all that, I would encourage my adoptive country to be proactive in their immigration policies. Putting it harshly, \"get the good ones before they go somewhere else\". The geopolitics of the world will only become more chaotic as the impacts of climate change cause hardship in the less habitable areas of the planet -- big migrations are inevitable. If you want your country to arrive in the 22nd century while preserving most of your way of life, you can&#x27;t be clinging to outmoded ideas. reply strken 14 hours agorootparentThe idea that immigrants are a good idea because they do labour your existing population won&#x27;t do is quite socially destructive and the cause of technological stagnation. It separates people into a de facto caste system where unpleasant jobs are also underpaid, prevents automation from becoming cost effective, and can block a country from reaping the benefits of skilled migration. reply btbuildem 10 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t mean to assign a value judgement to this -- maybe I can phrase it better. It&#x27;s not that the \"local\" people don&#x27;t want to do certain jobs, it&#x27;s that the capital owners are not willing to pay fair wages for labour, and then only people who are desperate enough (poor immigrants) end up doing do these jobs.I&#x27;d love to hear some examples where this has caused technological stagnation and blocked skilled migration -- US and Canada provide solid counter-examples to these claims. Both countries take in immigrants at both ends of the economic spectrum, from coveted H1B high-paying tech jobs, to seasonal farm workers who exist in slavery-like circumstances. Both countries show significant, sustained technological innovation.I agree this is destructive to the social fabric, and it separates us into strata. But I have a hard time believing that immigration is the cause; a simpler explanation would interpret it as one of the symptoms, with the underlying causes being closely related to the relentless transfer of wealth to an ever-shrinking \"elite\". reply strken 2 hours agorootparentThe one I was thinking of was slavery in the US, and the technological innovation in the south vs the north.A better example might be the low price of labour-intensive hand-picked fruit (particularly berries) in the US and the correspondingly low agricultural automation. It&#x27;s not that machines don&#x27;t exist, or that berry picking is going to prevent the next Facebook, it&#x27;s that they aren&#x27;t cost effective in the short to mid term even when longer term investment would eventually improve the whole industry. This is really hard to measure and I don&#x27;t have any good sources for either side of the argument right now.I also want to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled migration. I don&#x27;t think skilled migration is harmful to the social fabric in an enduring way, nor migration with the same proportion of skilled and unskilled labour as the host country. reply lappet 14 hours agorootparentprev> what always struck me as paradoxical is the nationalist &#x2F; cultural pride that a lot of immigrants tend to display.Also an immigrant, and I have observed that some immigrants tend to be become more conservative when they move. Or perhaps they have stopped evolving when their peers in the home country have moved on. I think this might be partly due to dealing with the trauma of displacement, and partly due to lack of diversity in thinking. I have mainly noticed this in a generation older than mine. reply Lord-Jobo 15 hours agorootparentprev>you&#x27;re acting as though an immigrant from any of the dense population centers has the same impact as a native-born child on the culture and economy. that is falseI am not, i am acting like immigrating literally anybody is going to be massively better than a declining population. If they live in a country, they are paying for housing, food, and services, and almost certainly have a job. taxes on top of all of that. I think the attitude of being picky is fine and wise, right now, but eventually you are really going to just want anyone instead of going inverted. reply shiroiuma 1 hour agorootparentThis simply isn&#x27;t true. They&#x27;re not going to be paying for housing and services and having a job if they commit crimes and go to prison. Certain host countries have found that certain immigrant groups tend to have very high crime rates and cause a lot of social problems. And even if they avoid crime and have a job, extremely low-paid immigrants aren&#x27;t going to be paying much in taxes under a highly progressive taxation scheme.High-skill immigrants are almost always a big win for the host country because of the things you cite, and more (they bring innovation, start businesses, etc). Low-skill&#x2F;low-education ones are a crapshoot. It&#x27;s better to have an inverted population pyramid than deal with all the social ills that come from immigrants that cause too many problems. reply BeetleB 14 hours agorootparentprev> This is slightly aside, but the concerns over fertility rates in the first world really seem REALLY misplaced to me.Since the early days of humanity, we&#x27;ve relied on children taking care of us in our old age. I haven&#x27;t seen a solution for that.Nursing homes are not a solution. I listened to some grim statistics from my state recently. In many nursing homes, the ratio of staff to patients is 6:1. It takes 6 full time employees to take care of 1 patient. Now I&#x27;ll grant that these numbers were outliers, because the population was challenging - many&#x2F;most of these patients had dementia, etc. And they were handling rural areas - you&#x27;d get better scaling in the city. Still, I&#x27;m sure in a major metropolitan area it&#x27;s at least 2:1.And that doesn&#x27;t account for the poor existence in those places (abuse by employees, abuse by fellow residents - you&#x27;re screwed if you don&#x27;t have family members advocating for you).And that&#x27;s for patients who get to go. Many elderly will have chronic conditions which are bad enough that you can&#x27;t live alone, but generally not bad enough for Medicare or health insurance to pay for assisted living. Examples are things like mobility issues - only long term health care insurance covers this, and it&#x27;s way too expensive. I don&#x27;t own such a policy and likely won&#x27;t ever be able to afford it. reply Tade0 15 hours agorootparentprev> world really seem REALLY misplaced to me. Population growth concerns are easily mitigated with immigration which will stay in demand until the rest of the worlds fertility rates catch up(40+ years)The population of prospective immigrants who completed 12 years of education or more is already largely gone, because the fertility rates in countries with this level of development are either already below replacement or on the way to it at a rapid pace.And you need at least that to contribute to an advanced economy. reply Joeri 16 hours agorootparentprevI agree that immigration is a quick fix for a low fertility rate. But the people worrying about fertility rates fear cultural displacement by immigrants. They want less immigration, not more, and instead see a return to family values as the answer to the fertility rate problem.Anyway, the problem is not the current decline in population, it is a fertility rate that remains far below a replacement rate. That means there is no bottom to the population decline. The immigration solution would need to be applied again and again. reply Toutouxc 13 hours agorootparent> That means there is no bottom to the population decline.The only reason I still don&#x27;t have a kid is expensive housing (i.e. too many people for too little space).

Its like the movement of air from different pressure areas. Most spanish people are actually a mix of moors and visigoths, other mediterranean people through history, and even celtic or germanic peoples who by and large displaced some earlier occupant of the iberian pennisula, who displaced some even earlier people, and so on and so forth until we get to whoever displaced the neanderthals. And all of this displacement involved assimilation too. Acting like migration should stop now would be like asking the wind to stop blowing or the tides to stop. Its like a natural law that people will go where theres better opportunities for them. reply csharpminor 16 hours agorootparentprevA government’s source of revenue is working age taxpayers. Its biggest cost is the social safety net for the elderly. It seems natural for them to care about population growth? Where would they get the money for UBI if their tax base is contracting every year?Immigrants (at the scale Spain needs) don’t want to move to a shrinking economy. Spaniards themselves are leaving the country to look for work. As an example, Central American immigrants will immigrate through multiple low growth countries specifically to get to the U.S. for work.To GP’s point though, I think Spain’s population problems aren’t all that related to dense apartments and more tied to economic opportunities. reply Unearned5161 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m curious to hear what sort of economic models you have in mind that works with a non-growing or declining population reply cies 16 hours agorootparentWe can look at \"prosperous\" (let&#x27;s find some happiness index) countries that have seen declining population for a while.

    "originBody": "Your phone is our billboard — Chamberlain blocks smart garage door opener from working with smart homes Chamberlain packed its app with ads while disabling third-party access. Ron Amadeo - 11/7/2023, 10:12 PM Enlarge / A photo of the myQ app from LiftMaster's website. Liftmaster reader comments 337 with Chamberlain Group—the owner of most of the garage door opener brands like LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Merlin, and Grifco—would like its customers to stop doing smart home things with its \"myQ\" smart garage door openers. The company recently issued a statement decrying \"unauthorized usage\" of its smart garage door openers. That's \"unauthorized usage\" by the people who bought the garage door opener, by the way. Basically, Chamberlain's customers want to trigger the garage door and see its status through third-party smart home apps, and Chamberlain doesn't want that. Here's the statement: Chamberlain Group recently made the decision to prevent unauthorized usage of our myQ ecosystem through third-party apps. This decision was made so that we can continue to provide the best possible experience for our 10 million+ users, as well as our authorized partners who put their trust in us. We understand that this impacts a small percentage of users, but ultimately this will improve the performance and reliability of myQ, benefiting all of our users. We encourage those who were impacted to check out our authorized partners here: https://www.myq.com/works-with-myq. We caught wind of this statement through the Home Assistant blog, a popular open source smart home platform. The myQ integration is being stripped from the project because it doesn't work anymore. Allegedly, Chamberlain has been sabotaging Home Assistant support for a while now, with the integration maintainer, Lash-L, telling the Home Assistant blog, \"We are playing a game of cat and mouse with MyQ and right now it looks like the cat is winning.\" Our immediate question is why would any garage opener company care about customers using its garage door opener. You sell garage door openers—isn't usage the goal? A quick perusal through the app store reviews reveals what's going on. The iOS app is sitting pretty at 4.8 stars, but the Android app has suffered a wave of one-star reviews starting in October. \"Sadly, this app now displays advertisement at the very top and I cannot find a way to disable it,\" writes one Play Store reviewer (Google doesn't provide links to reviews). \"This is very disturbing and on top of it, it moves my garage opening button out of the visible part of the screen. So to use it I now have to first look at the ads, then scroll down and hope to find my button.\" Another user writes, \"I don't want ads in an app that I have already paid for the companion product.\" Other one-star reviews mention things like, \"I clicked door open/close event and it popped up the video storage subscription dialog to ask me to subscribe,\" and, \"Most of the app is dedicated to trying to upsell you on services and devices you don't need.\" Advertisement Ah, now it makes sense. Your garage door opener app isn't here only to open your garage door; it's here to display ads and upsell you on services. Using third-party apps would get around Chamberlain's hardware-app-as-ad-platform strategy, so they are now banned. Another part of this is probably the plug at the end of Chamberlain's statement to \"check out our authorized partners,\" which includes companies like Amazon and Alarm.com. The logo of the Chamberlain Group, which owns over 60 percent of the garage door market. Chamberlain Group Presumably, these \"authorized partners\" are paying a fee to work with garage door openers that have already been sold to customers. Home Assistant's founder, Paulus Schoutsen, writes that while Chamberlain Group has never responded to Home Assistant's requests to work together, the open source project \"cannot pay a partnership fee. Not only is this financially not viable, it also goes against our values.\" The integration is being removed in next month's release, though Schoutsen says, \"We would happily welcome this integration back if Chamberlain Group would work with us for the good of their customers.\" For users stuck with a Chamberlain garage door opener, Home Assistant recommends a little circuit board called a \"ratgdo,\" which is specifically meant to hack into Chamberlain/LiftMaster garage door openers. This connects the garage door button wires to your Wi-Fi—something Chamberlain presumably can't break on purpose—and freely communicates with everything. It can even \"report back the actual status of the door (closed, opening, open, closing)\" somehow. We'll leave you with some consumer advocacy from Schoutsen and the Home Assistant team: \"Once a company decides to be hostile to its customers, the only way we can win is by not playing their game at all. Do not buy products or services from companies that treat their customers this way. Tell your friends not to deal with companies that treat their customers this way. Buy products that work locally and won’t stop functioning when management wants an additional revenue stream.\" reader comments 337 with Ron Amadeo Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

They are authorized if they are trying to control their own garage door.The company I work for has a policy where we don&#x27;t block third party clients, as long as they use a uniquely identifiable user agent and API key that we provide to them. That way we can easily monitor if they&#x27;re calling endpoints excessively and make sure that our alarms don&#x27;t go off when they did something wrong, but still offer power users flexibility. Power users are the users you can get good feedback from, and they spread the word more than a regular user would.

I stayed at an AirBnB a while back that I selected precisely because the listing mentioned that a garage was available. It turned out that yes, you could use the garage, but the remote was not provided by the host. So I had to disengage the door and lift it manually, then close it behind me when I left every morning.\"Fuck that,\" I said to myself, as any self-respecting hacker would. \"I&#x27;ll just hook a $20 remote key fob switch from Home Depot up to the button on the garage wall.\"That&#x27;s when I found that they actually DRM&#x27;ed the button.

Odds of some AirBnB driving off accidentally with the remote approach 100%. reply Kirby64 13 hours agorootparentHonestly, a bigger worry imo is cars that have something like homelink. You can copy a garage door opener, and basically give yourself a garage door opener access whenever you want. I did this accidentally to an old rental house I lived in. When I moved out later I drove by one time and … turns out the homelink still worked. For a criminal, it’d be a very easy way to get back in without any trace. reply lazide 12 hours agorootparentJust wait until you see how easy it is to copy keys - and how basically zero landlords ever change them between tenants. reply CamperBob2 10 hours agorootparentprevNot a concern for AirBnB hosts and the like, because once they let the bad guy into their house, it&#x27;s game over anyway.However, one thing that is interesting is when you get a loaner car from the dealership, and not only is there a valid Homelink recording, but the nav system still shows the start and end points for the last trip(s) the previous person took. Bonus if their phone&#x27;s contact list is still there.Always use the vehicle handover function whenever turning in a rental or loaner car, folks. reply dheera 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah but in reality former tenants are statistically unlikely to be criminals -- you probably ran a background check on them prior to them moving in, didn&#x27;t you? Former tenants could have copied front door keys after all, and probably did for noble reasons like SOs, etc.The garage door remote I modified with the Zigbee relay is a remote I purchased and paired with my rental unit&#x27;s garage door opener, and then took apart for modification. I don&#x27;t own the property or the garage door opener, I just looked up which model of remote it used, bought one, and paired it. I also have the landlord-provided remote as a backup.I don&#x27;t think HomeLink is particularly dangerous in this regard; anyone can purchase additional remotes and pair them, they don&#x27;t need a car with HomeLink.If you&#x27;re really worried as a landlord, reset your garage door openers for every new tenant re-pair the remotes they presumably returned to you, and re-key your front door locks while you&#x27;re at it. Microscopic cost compared to what the tenant probably paid you. reply Kirby64 10 hours agorootparentWe’re talking about Airbnb here. I don’t know of any vetting you really do for an Airbnb. And, unlike a key, you can copy a garage door to homelink without do almost any work.Add to that the fact that garages tend to be less covered from a camera perspective (usually there’s a doorbell camera at the door) and it’s a bit of a blind spot for homeowners I’d think. reply dheera 15 hours agorootparentprevIf that really happens you can factory reset a garage door opener which will unpair all existing remotes.Re-keying the front door is arguably a bigger pain in the ass, and many Airbnbs just lend you the front door keys. reply ska 15 hours agorootparentRight but then you have to buy a new remote, lather rinse repeat.I can see why an AirBnB host wouldn&#x27;t bother after 1st or 2nd time, is all I&#x27;m saying.Agree the front door key is a bigger pain, but less likely to accidentally happen.I mean, I would have a slight preference to have a functioning remote but it&#x27;s not going to ruin a stay.

Yes I understand the open protocol options that are out there.Are there industry groups representing home automation solutions that push back on these decisions?But I suppose a company that controls 70% of the market is uninterested in what anyone thinks, including their own customers. reply lightbritefight 18 hours agoparentUse products on open protocols. Zigbee is the current standard. Anyhting using a zigbee radio, and to a lesser extent another protocol called zwave, can talk to any hub with a compatible radio. They are local, dedicated radio networks that do not have to talk to anyone else&#x27;s servers.There is a newer protocol called \"matter\" that a lot of big names have gotten behind. These devices are slowly rolling out, but id check for matter compatibility with any hub at this point.As for the hubs, use open source that are not cloud based. The largest and most active project is called Home assistant. Its robust, has good options to build it yourself or buy devices, and it&#x27;s dedicated to being forever FOSS. Another hub in the same \"local, FOSS\" ethos is called Hubitat. Their UI&#x2F;hardware was easier than home assitant for a long time, but not really anymore. I still consider them more \"turnkey\" but both systems work great and support literally thousands of devices. reply bell-cot 23 hours agoprev> ...

I think I have mostly had Chamberlain brands and of course the door itself always works but the tech behind is has been lacking. I suspect ODC is similar. Lots of gimmicky systems like adding video cameras to the opener which requires yet another subscription along with controlling the door through the web along with a similar subscription. Last I looked the fee was something like $45&#x2F;year which felt steep, would be happy to pay but the price felt out of line with what it does.Along with poor tech decision I always felt that the product itself was not very interesting or innovative. Shoot, look what Ryobi did with the now discontinued opener, it had a battery backup, excellent lighting, extension cord, plugs. I don&#x27;t remember the story on why it was discontinued but I believe it had something to do with supply chain and covid....I might be misremembering.So yes, I am always a little stumped why someone does not jump in and just make a solid unit.

If it&#x27;s using Matter-over-WiFi, yes, a firmware could change that. If it&#x27;s using Matter-over-Thread (or ZigBee) it&#x27;s still tied to that frequency so there&#x27;s no point in changing or dropping support for the protocol except to intentionally brick the device (assuming it doesn&#x27;t support another type of communication but for cost reasons most devices only support one comms frequency and that&#x27;s hardwired).Note that dropping Matter if the device has WiFi still means it needs to have some pre-existing redundancy or at least add something else instead.

    "originBody": "Back to blog The 'eu' in eucatastrophe – Why SciPy builds for Python 3.12 on Windows are a minor miracle Published November 8, 2023 h-vetinari Axel Obermeier You've probably heard already that Python 3.12 was released recently. For a while already, we've been getting new feature releases every year, so perhaps this wasn't big news to you – though there's lots of interesting stuff in there! It would appear even more \"ordinary\" that key packages (think pandas, matplotlib etc.) in the ecosystem would have a release compatible with the new Python version shortly after1, and broadly speaking, you would be right. Not that there isn't a huge amount of dedicated maintainers (mostly volunteers!) working tirelessly behind the scenes to make that happen, but overall, it's a pretty routine situation. However, behind the ordinary-seeming \"SciPy released builds compatible with Python 3.12\" hides an extraordinary story worth telling, because of how several unrelated, multi-decade-long timelines happened to clash in a way that could have very easily led to no Python 3.12-compatible releases for a long time. To understand why this was such a lucky coincidence (though we tried our best to tip the scales, a lot of luck was necessary), we need to zoom out a bit and explore the big players involved in this situation. Fair warning: In the interest of brevity, the following recap is going to be incomplete and opinionated. From our perch on the shoulders of giants, let's take a quick look at the landscape. We'll briefly shed some light on the following: Why is Fortran still used in so many places? How is that relevant to Python? Past struggles of NumPy/SciPy with vanilla Python packaging. What role conda-forge plays in this context. If you feel you have a good-enough understanding of all this, or not much time, skip right past the background. 😉 Fortran … is almost unfathomably old in our day and age. Started in 1953, first appearing in 1958, it quickly became the most important programming language of its time, in an age when computing made several important evolutionary leaps. Most importantly for our story: A lot of scientific code was written in Fortran (meaning often: the accumulated math knowledge of many decades got crystallised into code), and: There was a huge number of Fortran compilers, and in the age before Open Source Software, all of those were proprietary. Compilers Depending on how far behind the curtains you've dared to venture, you've probably at least heard of the concept of a compiler. Basically, computers have an exceptionally limited amount of operations at their disposal, and it's agonisingly painful to write anything in those primitives directly. The job of the compiler is to translate whatever the programmer is writing in a given compiled language, and turn it into something the computer can execute. In many ways they're the closest to the hardware, which is why they often were hyper-specific to one CPU architecture, or one operating system – not least because you cannot write an operating system without a compiler, so the two were often tightly coupled. For example, Microsoft, from very early on, used its own compiler to create Windows and all the bits on top of it. This coupling further compounded the tendencies towards closed source compilers, because the compiler source code might not only reveal secrets of the compiler itself, but also of the architecture or the operating system built with it. And since vendors were keen to capitalise on every advantage in an intensely competitive market, there was no incentive to share sources at all. The pioneer to break that mould was the GNU compiler collection (GCC), which became one of the key pillars of the nascent Free & Open-Source Software (FOSS) movement in the 80s and 90s. The coupling to the operating system still stayed – in this case various flavours of Unix, most prominently Linux of course – but GCC became a truly universal compiler when it came to CPU architectures. Let's visualise this quickly – we have a matrix of Operating Systems (OS) vs. CPU Architectures; often compilers were specific not just to one OS, but also 1-2 specific architectures (for a long time the most dominant architecture has been x86, but that has been changing in recent times). What GCC did was essentially cover an entire column of that matrix, rather than just 1-2 cells. 👉 OS 👇CPU Arch. Linux Windows macOS x86_32 GCC MSVC Apple Clang x86_64 arm64 (added recently) aarch64 ➖ ➖ ppc64le ➖ ➖ ... ➖ ➖ This matrix would be a lot larger if it included historical OSes and less common architectures, where support with the respective compiler was often in a 1:1 relationship (i.e. that combination would cover a single cell in the matrix). The matrix also does not cover which programming languages a given compiler is able to process, but for simplicity, you can picture C/C++ here. Of course, GCC remains usable on macOS due to shared Unix roots, there are ways to make it work on Windows (through cygwin or MinGW), and the whole truth is way more complicated still. But as a first-order approximation, this shouldn't raise too many eyebrows. Alright, after a full page about compilers, we can hear you thinking: \"What does all this have to do with Python?!\". And you're right, but just one last thing: Once a program in C/C++/Fortran/etc. has been compiled, there are a lot of expectations built into that so-called \"binary\", which will expect very explicitly-sized inputs, read things from – and load things into – very specific CPU registers etc. Basically, at this point, the training wheels come off, and if you use said binary under even slightly different circumstances (different sized inputs, changed order of function arguments, different in-memory layout of some structure etc., much less another CPU type), you're going to have a bad time. This is the so-called Application Binary Interface (ABI), and any compiled program is subject to this. Python We won't bore you with the history here, but the immediate thing to note is: you don't need a compiler to use Python. That's a blessing as well as a curse, because on the one hand, it dramatically lowers the difficulty of using it, and on the other hand, this makes Python slow compared to compiled languages. Python's duck-typing means it will go through many layers of wrapping and fall-backs, before anything actually is executed. Sidenote: this process is taken care of by Python's interpreter, which – uh oh… – has itself been compiled2. Unsurprisingly this approach is slower than a compiled program that will just run with whatever instructions you've given it (and fail, if any part of the ABI is violated). This slow-down doesn't matter so much for prototyping, or general scripting, but it becomes immensely limiting once there's medium-sized or larger amounts of data involved. The best-of-both-worlds solution to this problem was to have performant compiled code under the hood, but a nice, pythonic \"wrapper\" around it as the interface towards the programmer. Remember all that scientific code that had been written in Fortran? Things like BLAS and LAPACK were already well-established standards for dealing with common problems in linear algebra, and so it was an obvious choice to reuse that when libraries like NumPy and SciPy wanted to expose such functionality to the Python world. SciPy additionally also used Fortran code to provide special mathematical functions and other mathematical tools like interpolation & integration – it's not like the basic math had changed since the 70s… However, this came with a terrible price: Users needed a compiler to install the package. In the early Python days, when many people were on Linux distributions (which comes with GCC pre-installed), this was less of an issue. But it made it extraordinarily difficult to do this in a cross-platform way – particularly on Windows, it's not common for users to have a compiler installed, much less know how to use it. It's even worse on the maintainer-side, because they suddenly need to become experts in the vagaries of different compilers, linkers and runtime libraries necessary on different platforms, and with sometimes wildly varying behaviour. Python packaging This situation also happens to be the fundamental problem in Python packaging. There's so much complexity hiding under the surface, that actually dealing with it in any kind of sane way is really difficult. For example, the C & C++ ecosystems never managed to standardise any sort of build & distribution mechanism, and since Python is wrapping around basically any flavour of C & C++ code, the problems in Python packaging are a superset of what's already a hugely pressing issue in C/C++. The packaging world in Python has had to continually reinvent itself in order to solve these issues. It's instructive to check out this historical overview, to get a feeling of the many iterations things have gone through. One of the biggest problems over the course of this evolution has been the question about the right way to distribute a package. Letting users just download the sources is problematic, because: packages can take a lot of time to build. if the packages is not just pure Python, the user needs a working compiler setup (and the source code needs to be compatible with that setup!), which is a huge usability hurdle. there's no reliable metadata, because even something as fundamental as the necessary third-party dependencies used to get populated only through running setup.py. The alternative – distributing pre-compiled artefacts – is problematic for many reasons too, and especially fragile in the face of the above-mentioned ABI. Given the impact of breaking the ABI (random crashes, heisenbugs, etc.), doing \"binary\" distribution haphazardly is not an option. Eventually, a feasible approach for such distribution emerged in the form of the \"wheel\" format, which essentially creates a bubble for each package that brings along all the required libraries, but hides them from others through a clever mechanism. While wheels still have some downsides (especially on the maintainer-side), they are a massive improvement over the situation that existed before, and nowadays, most Python packages are installable through wheels from PyPI. But wheels were not around yet at the time when the Scientific Python community needed to solve some problems they were facing (as well as not versatile enough conceptually for solving all the key issues involved). This blog post by one of the founding contributors of NumPy and SciPy is full of relevant anecdotes: We in the scientific python community have had difficulty and a rocky history with just waiting for the Python.org community to solve the [packaging] problem. With distutils for example, we had to essentially re-write most of it (as numpy.distutils) in order to support compilation of extensions that needed Fortran-compiled libraries. Despite being the product of heroic efforts by many very bright people, numpy.distutils is generally regarded as a bandaid, and has been in minimal maintenance mode for years. This is largely due to fundamental limitations inherent in only having a build script (e.g. setup.py), without a way to precisely control in advance the conditions under which a package gets built. Again from that blog post: [...] numpy.distutils replaces most of the innards of distutils but is still shackled by the architecture and imperative approach to what should fundamentally be a declarative problem. In many ways, this is what led to the creation of conda: Therefore, you can't really address the problem of Python packaging without addressing the core problems of trying to use distutils (at least for the NumPy stack). The problems for us in the NumPy stack started there and have to be rooted out there as well. This was confirmed for me at the first PyData meetup at Google HQ, where several of us asked Guido [van Rossum; Python's BDFL at the time] what we can do to fix Python packaging for the NumPy stack. Guido's answer was to \"solve the problem ourselves\". conda & conda-forge Conda was designed to take a more holistic view of all the things that are required for packaging – including the non-Python bits – and unsurprisingly, done in a declarative way. The basis for this is a \"recipe\" that explicitly defines relevant quantities (e.g. what needs to be present in the build environment), before the first line of any build script is ever run. This introduced an unfortunate bifurcation in the Python world, because other Python tools like pip cannot install conda-packages, yet what conda had done did not easily fit into the standardisation-by-consensus model3, primarily because many things essential to conda were considered \"out of scope\" by the wider Python packaging community. However, for users and maintainers of packages that are affected by some of the deep-seated issues in Python packaging, it provided a much more powerful solution and got adopted widely – especially in scientific computing, though by far not everywhere. While the recipes conda uses are the basis for many key features (e.g. having enough control to ensure that the ABI is kept consistent, or that packages are recompiled where necessary), this means in turn that integrating a given package into the conda world requires creating such a recipe in the first place. Given the size of the ecosystem, not even a company like Anaconda4 could hope to integrate everything that users wanted, and over time, the community-driven conda-forge channel became the place to do this integration work. Anyone can submit recipes for a package that is missing, or provide fixes for those that are already being built on so-called \"feedstocks\". One of the things that complicates matters is that conda-forge – as a philosophy – is aiming to support all common platforms, and even some less common ones. This multiplies the kind of problems a Linux distribution might have by at least ~three, because very often a different set of problems will appear for macOS and Windows. To have any chance at success, conda-forge uses the platform defaults (compiler, standard library, ABI, etc.) wherever possible. Conda-forge is almost 100% volunteer-run, and dependent on public CI resources like those provided by Azure Pipelines, as well as Anaconda footing the bill for the hosting and download traffic of all the hosted artefacts. On top of that, conda-forge cannot arbitrarily package things where the licence does not allow it. There is no hidden layer for build tools; anyone can download and install the packages that the infrastructure is made of (or the underlying docker images), and that means conda-forge cannot use proprietary compilers5, but must use what's freely available. Remember how we discussed above that all Fortran compilers are proprietary (except gfortran as part of GCC), and how GCC is not directly usable on Windows? This has been a huge issue for conda-forge, especially as the expectation of general support on Windows became more and more wide-spread. For a very long time, conda-forge was not able to build SciPy at all due to this. Instead it had to rely on packages from the Anaconda channels6, until some particularly talented contributors hacked together an unholy amalgamation of MSVC (c.f. the default ABI on Windows) and gfortran, first in SciPy itself and later on the feedstock in conda-forge. The situation To recap: SciPy uses a lot of Fortran code, having incorporated existing and standard implementations (like BLAS & LAPACK) for mathematical computations. This did not play well with Python's native build tools, leading to the creation of numpy.distutils, which is however considered a bandaid and in minimal maintenance mode. The Python packaging world has been continually reinventing itself to overcome burning problems that are due to the immense complexity being wrapped by Python packages. A parallel ecosystem has arisen around conda & conda-forge, for packages and users that were underserved by the standard tools for Python packaging. This is where our story starts in earnest. Going back for many years already, the situation around distutils and setuptools had been a source of great pain in the Python packaging world. The two (in close interaction) represented the de-facto standard way of building Python packages, but changing anything about them was extremely hard because of how many use-cases had to be considered, how much everything had grown organically, and so on. The next evolutionary step turned out to be the combination of PEP517 / PEP518, which promised a level playing field between various possible build tools, and a way to specify the required information through a new interface (pyproject.toml). This eventually gained enough traction that distutils got scheduled for removal from the Python standard library per version 3.12. However, this had far-reaching consequences for all the things in Python-land which had grown around distutils, and even more so for things layered on top. The maintainers of numpy.distutils took the decision that they're not going to maintain this layer going forward – even though setuptools ingested much of the distutils interface, it did so in ways that were subtly incompatible with what numpy.distutils did, and ultimately no-one wanted to keep maintaining this old pile of hacks any longer than absolutely necessary. This kicked off a flurry of work – already years ago, because NumPy and SciPy are under excellent stewardship – to find a better solution. SciPy in particular took a long, hard look at the landscape, and decided to go with Meson as a build tool, which had a nice Python-style feel to it, and less of the historic baggage or cumbersome DSL of CMake. This was a far-reaching and forward-looking decision at the time, not least because Meson did not yet support all the things that would be necessary to pull things off. To put this effort into context, all this required many, many engineering months of highly talented people over the last ~2.5 years. Unbeknownst to most, we are benefitting from the great foresight of the SciPy and NumPy developers in tackling the issue this far in advance, rather than having an \"uh oh\" moment once Python 3.12 is released. It's necessary to note that Meson as a build tool has a much broader audience than Python developers – it is used widely for C & C++ projects for example7. As part of an overall design ideology to bring some much-needed sanity to this space (and especially the world of C/C++ where no uniform solution exists), Meson will not let you do things that are sure to go wrong in all but the most expert hands. In particular, Meson was going to refuse to accept the MSVC+gfortran combination that was in use in conda-forge. In fact, it looked like we were going to be completely boxed in. As of Python 3.12: distutils would be gone, and contemporary setuptools incompatible with numpy.distutils. Meson would refuse to work with the hack conda-forge was using. There were no free (and ABI-compatible) Fortran compilers on Windows at all. Fortran, the revival While Fortran has long been the butt of the joke in IT departments the world over, in a curious twist of fate, it has seen a dramatic resurgence over the last few years. While the reasons for this are not exactly obvious (at least to us!), a few possible explanations are: It has relatively simple syntax, and maps well to the structure of mathematical formulae. It produces performant code, especially in combination with parallelisation frameworks like OpenMP. Due to the large amount of Fortran code in scientific computing, and the promised performance gains through GPUs, it became an attractive target for supporting GPU computations. As such, there was renewed vigour in the Fortran compiler space, and several important developments happened in short succession. For example, PGI / NVIDIA open sourced a version of their compiler called pgfortran with a new backend based on LLVM (more on that below), which later turned into what's now known as \"classic\" Flang. In the process of trying to upstream this into LLVM itself, the compiler got rewritten completely under the name f18, which later turned into \"new\" Flang that eventually got merged into LLVM itself. Pretty much at the same time, another group started developing a Fortran compiler based on LLVM: LFortran. LLVM & Clang Further up we had looked at a matrix of Operating Systems versus CPU architectures, and how most compilers tended to only cover 1-2 \"cells\", whereas GCC covered essentially all possible architectures on Linux – i.e. a whole column of the matrix. As it happened, the last dimension of universality was tackled by another large project that grew from a research project into a fully cross-architecture and cross-platform compiler infrastructure8: LLVM, and its flagship compiler Clang. This was an absolutely massive undertaking, but due to its cross-platform nature, permissive licensing, and modular infrastructure, has become the focal point of efforts around all kinds of compiler development. Without going into the technical details, LLVM provides several so-called \"Intermediate Representations\" (IRs), which are somewhere in between machine code and the code that most programmers write, but in a way that is language-agnostic. In particular, it would be possible to target the LLVM IRs from Fortran, and then automatically benefit from all the \"backends\" that do most of the heavy optimization work between the IRs and the actual CPU architecture. This made LLVM an attractive foundation for these new Fortran compiler efforts, and both incarnations of Flang as well as LFortran followed this approach, though with different aims in what they built on top. Compiler bingo All of these FOSS Fortran compilers attracted great hope to unblock the general situation regarding the lack of free Fortran compilers on Windows. Classic Flang already had preliminary support for Windows, but this never fully took off, not least as the lion's share of resources behind Flang was refocussed on getting the rewritten version merged into LLVM itself. But these were not the only changes happening in this space. For example, Intel did a major overhaul of their Fortran compiler (also basing it on LLVM), and started making it freely available, though not open source. Unfortunately this precludes conda-forge from using it, unless Intel themselves packages the compilers for us; we asked, but there was no timeline. Furthermore, through the Mingw-w64 project, it slowly started to become possible to use gfortran with Microsoft's \"Universal C Runtime\" (UCRT), which is essentially the biggest hurdle in achieving ABI-compatibility on Windows. However, switching out the underlying C standard library would represent a major overhaul in the MinGW stack for windows within conda-forge, and was also not something we could count on to be ready in time. For people on the sidelines like ourselves, this turned into something akin to \"Waiting for Godot\" – a seemingly endless period as things kept stretching and stretching and stretching out further into the future. To give some perspective, things already seemed \"not too far out\" 3-4 years ago. At this point you may be asking yourself: \"wait a second… how did SciPy actually switch to Meson, if there are no Fortran compilers for Windows?\" How upstream SciPy does it (for now) While SciPy has some amount of funding through grants and such, and could conceivably pay for a compiler licence to use for producing wheels, the requirements of building things in CI regularly – to avoid the otherwise inevitable bitrot – would cost a lot and not be a judicious use of the limited funds available. What ended up happening is that one lone developer managed to custom-build a MinGW-based toolchain, carefully adapted to use the right-sized integers and to conform to the MSVC ABI. This is enough to pass through Meson's sanity checks (after all, GCC is a consistent toolchain), however it is again subtly-yet-crucially different from the requirements that would be necessary for wide-spread use in conda-forge. conda-forge and the migration problem One final aspect in the whole saga is that conda-forge has some additional constraints in terms of how large-scale maintenance efforts work, e.g. something like rolling out a new Python version. Essentially, this means rebuilding all Python-related feedstocks in the order how they depend on each other, and the only reasonable way to do it at scale is to do all OSes and architectures at the same time, as they're all built simultaneously per feedstock. So it looked conceivable that we'd end up in a situation where: We have no Windows builds for SciPy, because there's no Fortran compiler conda-forge can use. Not being able to rebuild SciPy for Python 3.12 on Windows would either hold up the migration for at least ~1000 packages that depend on SciPy on all platforms, or we would have to drop Windows from the Python migration completely, which would be similarly disruptive and a lot of effort to fix later. A pious hope So while the distutils removal was coming down the line like an oncoming freight train, all we could try to do was cross our fingers that one Fortran compiler would be ready in time (most likely either llvm-flang or LFortran), and be as prepared as possible in terms of having all the other pieces ready to go. LLVM is a big baby, and keeping all the pieces involved up-to-date is a non-trivial exercise already9, but we put extra effort into trying to identify potential problems with Flang early on, both in our own infrastructure, as well as upstream. But no matter how motivated we were to pursue this, the iron-clad constraints of FOSS remain at play: no-one can take care of everything, much less keep all the required knowledge in their head. That means we need other people's input & feedback – and when everyone's a volunteer10, things can take a while. As it happened, the release of LLVM 17.0 was coming up, which would be the first release where Flang had matured enough to remove the -flang-experimental-exec flag, and was estimated to be roughly \"0.8 level maturity\". As soon as we had the release candidates built in conda-forge, we tried to throw it at SciPy, only to realise that Meson did not support the new Flang yet. Even worse, it wasn't clear which ABI Flang was using (as mentioned above, conda-forge uses the default ABI on Windows everywhere), not least because the Clang driver which Flang uses under the hood can target both modes. Unfortunately, it wasn't clear which mode was being chosen, and generally it looked like Windows support was (as often happens in FOSS) the least mature platform. To top it off, there are also two different standard libraries, two different runtime libraries and two different linkers to consider in all this – all of which had the potential to lead to subtle breakage. At this point, we still hadn't compiled more than a \"Hello World!\" example with Flang, so it wasn't even clear that it could compile all of SciPy, much less pass the test suite... Eucatastrophe The final push came once SciPy got ready to remove support for setup.py, the last link to the \"old world\" before the removal of distutils. With some kind hints from the Meson devs and a bit of persistence, we managed to teach Meson to be able to handle llvm-flang just enough to compile something. We eventually passed the first build, and after some more wrangling with Meson, the first installation too. What happened next felt like nothing short of magical – while we were expecting test failures, hangs or even crashes, the test suite… just passed 100%?! ........................................................................ [ 99%] .................................................s....... [100%] = 54987 passed, 2866 skipped, 245 xfailed, 11 xpassed, 1 warning in 979.88s (0:16:19) = Resource usage statistics from testing scipy-tests: Process count: 43 CPU time: Sys=0:01:20.6, User=0:29:59.3 Memory: 1.7G Disk usage: 1.8K Time elapsed: 0:16:24.6 55'000 tests, and not a single failure? When does that ever happen on the first try after major surgery? Somehow, armed only with a pre-release of a still-experimental compiler and a hastily patched-up build system, we managed to dodge the freight train, and the migration in conda-forge could progress past SciPy with no more than a few days delay, rather than being stuck for months. In the end, the respective SciPy builds in conda-forge were available two days after the release of Python 3.12.0. Epilogue At the end of this journey, we can only marvel at how long and winding the ways have been that lead us here. Depending on where you draw the line, hundreds or even thousands of person years of effort went into the ingredients that were necessary for us to achieve the final result (SciPy, Meson, Flang, LLVM, LAPACK etc.). We cannot realistically thank everyone, but a few call-outs nevertheless: Ralf Gommers, for tirelessly positive support and for outstanding stewardship of NumPy and SciPy, and driving the massive effort to move SciPy to Meson. Isuru Fernando, for building & maintaining some of the trickiest pieces in conda-forge, and consistently helping out with keeping them running or building on top of them, as well as reviewing with incredible expertise. The Meson developers, for a clean build system with a solid design philosophy. The Flang developers, for providing the world with an open source Fortran compiler that also works on Windows. We are also very grateful that this work was supported in part by a grant from NASA to SciPy, scikit-learn, pandas and NumPy under the NASA ROSES 2020 program. PS.

Now I know why my pip installs are failing in 3.12 but we now have a brighter future ahead.Also while I love Python it’s helpful to understand why Python packaging is a (manageable) mess. It’s because of non standardization of build tools for C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;fortran and the immensity of the ecosystem, nothing to do with Python itself. It’s part irreducible complexity.It’s a miracle it works at all. reply cdavid 11 hours agoparentYes, that&#x27;s a fundamental reason python packaging is a mess. Python success is largely due to the availability of key mixed language packages. No other mainstream language package manager has to deal with this.For example, cargo for rust, which is great, can assume to package mostly rust-only code. And while it is compiled, the language \"owns\" the compiler, which means building from sources as distribution strategy works. I don&#x27;t know how&#x2F;if cargo can deal with e.g. fortran out of the box, but I doubt cargo on windows would work well if top cargo packages required fortran code.The single biggest improvement for python ecosystem was the standardisation of a binary package format, wheel. It is only then that the whole scientific python ecosystem started to thrive on windows. But binary compatibility is a huge PITA, especially across languages and CPUs. reply winstonewert 9 hours agorootparentMany rust crates actually do package code written in other languages. There are plenty of useful C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Fortran libraries that nobody has rewritten into Rust but for which wrappers have been created that call into C. It works in Rust because the build.rs lets libraries do whatever they want during the build process, including invoking compilers for other languages.Various factors still make the Rust and Python story different (Python uses more mixed-language packages, the Rust demographic is more technically advanced, etc). But a big one is that in Rust, the FFI is defined in Rust. Recompiling just the Rust code gives you an updated FFI compatible with your version of Rust. In Python, the FFI is typically defined in C, so recompiling the python won&#x27;t get you a compatible FFI. If Python did all FFI through something like ctypes, it would be much more smooth. reply glandium 7 hours agorootparent> It works in Rust because the build.rs lets libraries do whatever they want during the build process, including invoking compilers for other languages.It&#x27;s still its own mess.

Some people love to complain about python packaging. But from one perspective, it&#x27;s arguably been a solved problem since wheels were introduced 10 years ago. The introduction of wheels was a massive step forward. Only depend on wheel archives, don&#x27;t depend on packages that need to be built from source, and drag in all manner of exciting compile-time dependencies.If there&#x27;s a package you want to depend on for your target platform, and the maintainers don&#x27;t produce a prebuilt wheel archive for your platform -- well, set up a build server and build some wheels yourself, and host them somewhere, or pick a different platform. reply the__alchemist 7 hours agorootparentprevAs you might expect, compiling rust crates that use C libraries can lead to the inscrutable-block-of-text linker errors we know and love.

When they do call native code, it&#x27;s often in horrible ways (like copying a native library from within the JAR file to a temporary directory, and loading it from there, the JAR file coming with pre-compiled native libraries for all possible operating system and architecture combinations).

The problem is that the C runtimes used by MSVC and gfortran (whose own runtime library is written in C) are not ABI-compatible. The hack that numpy used was to link the Fortran objects into a DLL to add a level of indirection (the import library) that would pacify MSVC.So there was some extra work needed to create these DLLs. Either in the build description files, or in Meson. The SciPy people didn&#x27;t want to implement this indirection in either place, and the Meson developers were not eager to help them either (they did help in general, for example with Fortran and Cython support; but they don&#x27;t want to provide footguns) because it was indeed a hack. It only worked because the Fortran side didn&#x27;t use files that were opened on the Python&#x2F;C side, for example.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180711144501&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pav.iki.f... reply bsder 11 hours agorootparentThank you for the clarification.

I&#x27;ve come across bazel more often than meson. I guess because meson is written in python it seemed like a good choice for SciPy, and it worked out in the end so congratulations.But yeah, I think CMake is still the gold standard despite all its quirks, complexities and problems. reply wenc 11 hours agorootparentProjects that use Mesonhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;mesonbuild.com&#x2F;Users.htmlIncludes Gimp, Gtk+, nautilus, Postgres, qemu, Wayland… reply okanat 9 hours agorootparentOne thing that&#x27;s noticeable is most of those projects are Linux-only and many of them are around GNOME &#x2F; GTK ecosystem. Most of those projects have no Windows versions. The ones that have them have really bad compatibility with it (e.g. GIMP, GTK3). Meson has a preference of simpler code bases leaning more on the C-heavy side. That&#x27;s usually not the case with big, old and commercial C++ code bases.The programs that need complex build systems that require things like compiling a code generator first and then compiling the rest of the project with the generator etc. are quite common in C++ world to tame the language&#x27;s shortcomings. Libraries like Qt, Protobuf and GRPC often introduce a crazy amount of build complexity.CMake&#x27;s complexity is directly result of that and it is currently the only build generator that can cope with that using basically every compiler in existence (including proprietary ones like ARMCC, ICC, MSVC and very limited ones like SDCC). Even Bazel cannot handle the same number of compilers and feature sets. That&#x27;s the thing that makes CMake gold standard not its string-driven scripting language.CMake shares quite a bit history with C++ and you hear sentences like \"it&#x27;s the only thing that works for this level of complexity\" for both. reply galangalalgol 10 hours agorootparentprevI thought conan was the standard?

No project I know, besides those targeting Windows only even consider it. But, I&#x27;m probably biased by my software choices. reply davisp 8 hours agorootparentIf you’ve ever wished that CMake’s ExternalProject pattern could be lit on fire, launched into the sea, fished out of the sea and then incinerated via tactical nuclear strike before bundling up the ashes that are then launched into the sun, vcpkg is definitely something you should look into.I’m no Microsoft fanboy. I’ve been in software dev for roughly 20 years at this point so generally view anything from Microsoft with genuine suspicion, so I get the hesitation to take it seriously. But it works across the big three (Windows, Linux, macOS) and is MIT licensed so I’d definitely recommend giving it a whirl.The only serious knock against it is that they went the OG Homebrew route with a single Git repo containing all of their ports (equivalent to Homebrew Formulae). And then whoever designed the Git repo approach also knew slightly too much about Git internals and leveraged tree-ish refs as part of the versioning design which is just weird and confuses anyone that’s not spent time tearing into Git’s object model.So basically, vcpkg is honestly a good tool that does what it does fairly well. It may not do everything you need, but if it can it’s amazing.Also, the buried lede here is how vcpkg handles binary caching. Think of it like sccache but at the dependency level. I’ve seen it drop CI runs from over an hour to 10m purely because it helps skip building dependencies without resorting to bespoke caching strategies. reply galangalalgol 9 hours agorootparentprevI know orojects that have chosen it for linux only work, but I got the feeling they regretted it. Conan is what I was using before I switched to cargo, and it was fine as long as everything in your tree was conan. Dependencies you could wrap, but dependents were a headache. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentprevconan and vcpkg are pretty much head to head, depending on which circles one moves on.Everything else is mostly statistical noise.People on C and C++ ecosystems like choice, so there will never be one single solution. reply bsder 11 hours agorootparentprevMeson is a front end.Edit: Caution: This statement is incorrect--It can generate CMakefiles as a backend. It can also generate build files for MSVC. It can also generate standard Makefiles.Edit: Corrected downstream. CMake can make Ninja files which Meson also makes. I got this backwards but kept the edit so people won&#x27;t get confused.CMake is NOT a gold standard. CMake is an agglomerative disaster.For example: try getting CMake to accept zig as your compiler. \"Oh, your compiler command has a space in it? So sorry. I&#x27;m going to put everything after the space in all manner of weird places. Some correct--some broken--some totally random.\" If you&#x27;re lucky CMake crashes with an inscrutable message. If you&#x27;re unlucky, you wind up with a compiler command that fails in bizarre ways and no way to figure out why CMake is doing what it did.This is my experience with CMake every damn time--some absolutely inscrutable bug pops up until I figure out how to route around it. If I&#x27;m really unlucky, I have to file a bug report with CMake as I can&#x27;t route around it.Sure, if some unfortunate soul has beaten CMake into submission and produced a functioning CMakefile, CMake works. If YOU are the poor slob having to create that CMakefile, you are in for worlds and worlds and worlds of pain. reply bonzini 11 hours agorootparentNote that Meson does not generate CMake files.

I don’t think voluntary developers are very keen on dedicating contributions to a business entity who by the next major release would have stolen your code and hidden it behind ads or some not so smart assistant that requires online connectivity all the time.Linux is also the common ground. If you have to choose ONE system, you would choose Linux. Otherwise you are going to need BOTH Mac and Windows, possibly even more.

Most of the article notes that there was no Fortran compiler yet (though amazing how well the one they landed on worked -- a miracle alright!) but I was particularly struck by the ABI issues. The story of a lone developer hacking a MinGW build that used the right ABI struck home.I can provide some background on the ABI issues in Windows.The following is personal opinion not company opinion, and I am a product manager not an engineer so may have some technical details wrong. But:At Embarcadero we&#x27;re moving our C++Builder toolchain forward to a new Clang[1], and using a new C and C++ RTL layer [also see 1]. Like SciPy, we&#x27;re now using UCRT, and the key bits that cause difficulty are the C++ RTL and platform ABI. Boy howdy do we have some stories.Issues:* There is no standard Windows ABI beyond what msvc produces. This results in WinAPI (C-level, in other words!) APIs that could not in the past be reliably used from anything other than msvc because they could throw exceptions, rather than returning error codes, and Win64 SEH is not fully documented (clang-cl, which is open source, disappears into the closed source msvcrt to handle this.)* Or another issue: cdecl isn&#x27;t standardised. This may surprise those of you who think -- as I used to think! -- that cdecl is simple and a known calling convention for any platform. We have issues where sret for return values[2] can be different between our toolchain and something built with MSVC. Since we need to change multiple languages, and one of our languages (Delphi) handles some returns (managed types) differently, changing this is more complex than it looks. We already did a lot of ABI compatibility work several years ago between multiple languages[3].Back to the ABI: our new Clang is aiming at being fairly compatible with mingw-llvm on Windows. (And MSVC too, but we&#x27;re starting with mingw-llvm as the basis.) That does not include a C++ ABI which the C++ committee has been resistant to, but it&#x27;s a known good, working C++ toolchain, open source.If Windows ever did have a platform ABI, it would likely be based on MSVC, but I would suggest that we -- developers -- should resist that until or unless the entire toolchain including runtime internals that affect the ABI is open sourced, or at least documented so that other toolchains can match it.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.embarcadero.com&#x2F;win64-clang-toolchains-in-rad-...[2] sret is a hidden (?) or special return value used for structs, basically when a large (> register size) memory is required. I think. This is where I hope I don&#x27;t embarass myself too much in the explanation. See eg https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;66894013&#x2F;when-calling-ff... In other words, returning values is more complex than it seems, even for a plain simple C method returning a struct which should be _incredibly basic_ and becomes a complex ABI issue.[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.embarcadero.com&#x2F;abi-changes-in-rad-studio-10-3... reply tsegratis 11 hours agoprevThe κατα in καταστροφή means &#x27;down to&#x27; or &#x27;according to&#x27; rather than sudden, and implies strongly a bad turnThe inverse of κατα is often ανα though αναστροφή means literally \"up turn\" or invertSo maybe ευστροφη a \"good turn\" (eustrophe) would be better coinageBut arguing with JRR Tolkien on language coinage and being right would be a ... ευκαταστροφη i.e. good luck!But in general I love their noticing of the overflowing grace -- that&#x27;s something that gives joy and happiness in the world reply coldtea 9 hours agoparent\"Kata\" in katastrofi actually means \"against\", so katastrofi is things \"turning against\". reply pklausler 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;m very glad that f18 worked (so far as we know).

It has some great libraries, and installing them is easy, perhaps because the system was well-designed from the start, and recently enough to build on experience with other systems.Julia is really handy for reproducible work, because you can specify which versions of which libraries you&#x27;re using, and share that information with others easily so they can retrace your steps. That&#x27;s a big factor in scientific work.The other thing (returning to the main topic) is that Julia does not have to rely on fortran or C&#x2F;C++ for low-level work. Julia is very fast all by itself. Indeed, most of the Julia libraries are written in Julia itself, providing users with a tutorial for intensive work.In addition to these things, I have to admit that I love how Julia lets me program in unicode symbols, so my equations in code can look like my equations on paper.There are some downsides to Julia that I ought to point out.1. The error messages can be very cryptic. 2. The documentation is poor (no worse than Python, I think, but a lot worse than R). 3. The development community is a bit ivory-tower-ish. The usual answer to \"could you improve the documentation\" is \"please submit a PR\". 4. There is a learning curve to get used to Julia. It&#x27;s easier if you are already familiar with Fortran and Matlab. Then again, most scientists I know are familiar with both those languages (and Python, and R, and ...) so learning a new language is not a challenge. Scientists like to learn stuff -- that&#x27;s the whole point of being in science, for most of us. reply cycomanic 10 hours agorootparentprevMaybe instead the solution should be moving away from Windows. Almost all the issues described in the article (and I would argue with most language packaging systems) is due Windows being such a pain to develop on.

    "originBody": "Ombudsman: European Commission’s concealment of secret ‘expert list’ on CSAM regulation constitutes ‘maladministration’ 6 November 2023 In response to a request for documents pertaining to the decision-making behind the proposed CSAM regulation, the European Commission failed to disclose a list of companies who were consulted about the technical feasibility of detecting CSAM without undermining encryption. This list “clearly fell within the scope” of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties’ request. The European Ombudsman has now held that the Commission’s failure to disclose the existence of this list constituted “maladministration”. The technical feasibility question is a major sticking point in the EU negotiations around this file. Numerous experts have warned that it is not technically feasible. Public interest technologists and more than 450 academics have warned in public that “technology to detect CSAM in encrypted content is currently not mature and will not be mature in the next two to five years.”[1] This is in stark contrast to the views put forward by experts relied upon by the Commission, whose names the Commission is refusing to reveal. In December 2022, ICCL filed complaints with the European Ombudsman against the European Commission’s refusal to provide a list of experts who helped the Commission draft the text related to potential solutions to detect child sexual abuse material in end-to-end encrypted communications. After the Commission acknowledged to the EU Ombudsman that it, in fact, had such a list, but failed to disclose its existence to Dr Kris Shrishak, the Ombudsman held the Commission’s behaviour constituted “maladministration”. The Ombudsman held: “[t]he Commission did not identify the list of experts as falling within the scope of the complainant’s request. This means that the complainant did not have the opportunity to challenge (the reasons for) the institution’s refusal to disclose the document. This constitutes maladministration.” The proposed regulation on child sexual abuse material has been hugely controversial. In addition to concerns about mass surveillance and undermining encryption, further concerns have been raised about the incompatibility with existing EU laws which prohibit general and indiscriminate monitoring of people’s communications. These concerns have been raised by many bodies, including the European Council’s own legal service, the European Parliamentary Research Service, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and the European Data Protection Board and Supervisor. “In light of these concerns, the lack of transparency from the Commission regarding external experts is deeply worrying, more so considering alleged close links between the Commission and lobbyists in the preparation of the regulation”, said Dr Kris Shrishak, Senior Fellow at ICCL. The Ombudsman’s decision can be read in full here.

I also find it credible that it can form the basis of a \"street cred\" system that binds online communities of child abusers together.On car forums, you&#x27;re cool if you&#x27;re the first to do a particular mod.

Or rather - we know that people produce this kind of thing \"on order\" and we still don&#x27;t think that banning the posession of this material is going to stop the actual crimes behind them being commited. Why is this any different? reply omginternets 9 hours agorootparentI think you may be reading into my position on a separate, but related question: what exactly should be illegal with respect to CSAM possession?You&#x27;ve pointed out exactly the kind of incoherences in law that I was hoping to bring to mind. Agreed, on the surface there is little difference between possession of snuff vs CSAM. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with that observation, though, because I have trouble assessing:1. Is surface-level analysis is correct? Or is there something bigger at play?2. What is the appropriate level of punishment vs rehabilitation?To the first question, there are obvious differences between child abuse and murder, but I can&#x27;t think of an example in which one of those differences would also lead to a different conclusion about the nature of the recording. Similarly, I don&#x27;t think the act of recording the crime is significantly changed by any of the differences between child abuse and murder.With that in mind, what do we do? Do we consider video-taping murder as bad as video-taping child abuse? My own gut-check reveals that I rationally think murder is worse than rape, but then again, rape somehow seems more taboo. If I consider the taboo element, I reach the opposite conclusion: that rape is worse than murder. Adding in the \"child\" element, I observe a main effect of making everything worse, but the interaction of \"rape\" getting disproportionately worse than \"murder\".Again, this is just me, but I would like to understand where these conflicting feelings come from. My sense is that rape triggers us on a symbolic level... something about Man betraying Woman. I&#x27;m old-fashioned enough to think archetypes matter, so I&#x27;d like to get a bead on this before formulating any policy opinions. reply naasking 11 hours agorootparentprev> but I also have a hard time believing that circulating CSAM has no detrimental effect whatsoeverSome studies have shown that availability of animated CSAM reduced recidivism among child molesters.

But this conclusion is typically quite abhorrent to the same type of people who advocate for your position. Can&#x27;t have it both ways. reply dvdkon 11 hours agorootparentI think both viewpoints (contemporary civilisation is good and we should let \"uncivilised\" people live without interference) are reconcilable: I can believe that modern bureaucratic liberal democracy is the best system we have, partly because it allows for dissenting views, partly because of other reasons. At the same time I can advocate for letting groups of people control their territory and form states that aren&#x27;t liberal democracies, since that&#x27;s yet another form of allowing for dissenting views.This runs into problems for global matters (global climate change and pollution) and conflicts with an overriding belief in a global morality (depending on how much you are willing to entertain the idea that your idea of morality isn&#x27;t the \"correct\" one), but some compromise variation of this idea is certainly self-consistent. reply naasking 11 hours agorootparentDefine \"uncivilized\". If I choose to occupy a national park and live off grid and disconnected from society, do I qualify? Or is some kind of ancestry on a land required? If so, why? Isn&#x27;t such a requirement kind of arbitrary? Why does my accidental birth into this society necessitate that I must slot into this bureaucracy?> At the same time I can advocate for letting groups of people control their territory and form states that aren&#x27;t liberal democracies, since that&#x27;s yet another form of allowing for dissenting views.What if they want to home school all of their children, do they have to abide by some kind education standard? The bureaucracy will come for you for any choice it finds unpalatable.I don&#x27;t see a way to reconcile these without a lot of special pleading. In the end, a form of natural selection will dominate and only the type of people who can fit well into the most optimal bureaucracies will thrive. Maintaining indigenous rights and the rights of \"uncivilized\" humans will be simply a curiosity, like how we keep animals in a zoo, rather than some coherent recognition of an inherent right to exist and live apart.I&#x27;m not taking a particular side on this question here, I used to be all pro-civilization, science, research and expansion into space, etc. in the Star Trek sense, but I&#x27;ve increasingly recognized the natural selection aspects of this and the apparently inherent incompatibility with liberty. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparent> I used to be all pro-civilization, science, research and expansion into space, etc. in the Star Trek sense, but I&#x27;ve increasingly recognized the natural selection aspects of this and the apparently inherent incompatibility with liberty.Oh, that. I too have a gnawing feeling that progress of technology and civilization is fundamentally incompatible with individual autonomy. At the very least, because to the extent new advancement put more of potentially destructive power in the hands of individuals, the more control the civilization needs over said individuals, in order to protect itself from any of such individuals going rogue and using their power destructively. That&#x27;s one thought, I have couple more like this, and they all add up to \"progress and civilization, or personal autonomy, pick one\". reply almostnormal 10 hours agorootparentprev> This is just natural selection in action: only people who are good at slotting into bureaucracy and being well-behaved cogs in the wheel will thrive in this environment, and other types of humans will die out.It would require that slotting into bureaucracy increases the ability and opportunity to procreate for the individual over not slotting into bureaucracy. I doubt that is the case. Strong adherence to a bureaucratic lifestyle significantly reduces the number of offsprings compared to a more chaotic way of living. reply naasking 6 hours agorootparentI think it does to some degree. The chaotic life may lead to more accidental pregnancies, but also higher mortality of every kind. Stable, family-value oriented, borderline conservative belief systems like those circa 1950s US leads to steady population growth. Other systems, like where Western countries are now with negative native population growth and considerably less social cohesion, are possibly less stable long-term.

That is, it would have to include Russia and China. This is the only way to ensure that Western governments don&#x27;t abuse their access in the future to surveil dissident groups.Trusting that NCMEC can&#x27;t be compromised is a nonstarter. I would trust a system where Chinese, Russian, American, British, etc police agreed that the database only includes CSAM. reply jstarfish 13 hours agoparentThe hyperbole around the issue of CSAM is starting to outweigh the threat itself. The crimes committed against a minority of the population isn&#x27;t worth this much drama. We don&#x27;t even pay this much attention to murdered children.This isn&#x27;t going to unite international rivals against it any more than an asteroid hurtling toward the planet. Only the western world gives a shit about it, which means it&#x27;s easily weaponized by anybody outside of it.Rather than backdooring every device on the planet, a more practical solution would be to just take away kids&#x27; phones and chain them to the radiator. To protect the children from CSAM, lock them up.We don&#x27;t like to admit it but face the facts: children are property as far as the State is concerned. Same as any other asset, livestock and firearms, they can be \"taken\" away from you and \"given\" to others for dividends (which, when you think about it, describes the act of trafficking itself).You don&#x27;t protect your home by unlocking everyone else&#x27;s. That sort of \"solution\" makes you an actual menace to society. reply nonrandomstring 12 hours agorootparent> to just take away kids&#x27; phonesAbsolutely. Just the first part, seriously. No need for chains and radiators. Let&#x27;s ban kids under 16 from access to phones and the open Internet. It would MASSIVELY improve just about everything about childhood and mental health of the young.There are plenty of technologies emerging with the density of memory and GPT type compression (that&#x27;s what neural networks really do... compression) to facilitate \"curated education in a box\", and small network (family and friends) communication. reply xcdzvyn 12 hours agorootparent> It would MASSIVELY improve just about everything about childhood and mental health of the young.Honestly it&#x27;d make the internet a lot better for adults too. reply jstarfish 12 hours agorootparentprevSure.

Prisons don&#x27;t protect the public by being free-range. Nuclear disarmament is too complex to go into here, but hypocrisy abounds. Barring that one incident, the Mint doesn&#x27;t protect the money supply by storing it in the middle of a Walmart parking lot (predictably, it got stolen).Every time we seek to secure anything, we make the coveted object more inaccessible to pursuers. That&#x27;s how Protection works.Anyone telling you lowering your guard and becoming vulnerable will somehow increase anyone&#x27;s safety is one distraction away from slipping a roofie into your drink.

Something that is empowering? reply jstarfish 10 hours agorootparentIn some hands, empowering, in other hands, a weapon. It&#x27;s less about smartphones specifically and more an abstraction for the internet itself. Take the internet away and it removes the metaphysical vector for exploitative outreach to children.It would make it very difficult to produce new CSAM if you eliminate the channels over which children are discreetly coerced into running away or producing it themselves. reply nonrandomstring 9 hours agorootparentI lived through the 70s. Worked at the BBC for a while. Nonces (kiddy fiddlers) are a social psychiatric problem. Policing networks or endpoints is treating the symptoms.Nonetheless I agree the utility that children get from access to the mainstream \"Five Giant Enshitified Websites\" doesn&#x27;t really surmount the damage done. The main harm, in my opinion, is simply to general mental health and wellbeing. So that just adds to the case for an age restriction for smartphones. If that reduces potential contact with nonces then all-good, but the reality is that child abuse happens by people IRL, usually trusted family or neighbours.Maybe the tide is turning and we&#x27;re \"getting there\", and that&#x27;s why I defended and supported many parts of the UK Online Safety Bill - even though other parts of it are trash. However this focus on CSAM to push unworkable restrictions is the usual dishonest politics and posturing.We have more general problems with minors and the Internet, and most of them are \"live rail\" issues the media and politicians won&#x27;t touch. replyfragmede 16 hours agoparentprevThat sounds as effective as, oh, I don&#x27;t know, the UN security council.

There has to be an effective veto by all the countries involved for anything to be included. reply 4ugSWklu 16 hours agorootparent“To be included in the Baseline list, child abuse images and videos must be recognized as such by our specialist network of investigators, and meet specific criteria in terms of the severity of the image content, for example those believed to feature children aged 13 and under.The strict criteria ensure that the Baseline list refers only to images and videos which would be considered as illegal in any country.”INTERPOL has a very large membership, including Russia and China. The baseline list is reviewed so only media that is illegal in every country INTERPOL operates in is included.I’m not sure how a veto system as you’re suggesting would work practically, but this might be the closest thing. reply Despegar 16 hours agorootparentThe veto system would have to require that the equivalent of Russia and China&#x27;s NCMEC agrees that the image&#x2F;video&#x27;s signature that&#x27;s going to be included in the database is actually CSAM at a low level operational level. Without that consensus, it should be technically impossible for anyone to include a signature. reply 4ugSWklu 15 hours agorootparentI think in a perfect world that would be great. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to see how a system like that could ever be implemented within our lifetimes.I personally think Baseline is a good pragmatic approach. It includes only known media, where they retain the originals for sense checking, and only includes things judged to be CSAM by trained experts. It’s probably the lightest touch possible solution that is still somewhat effective. reply Despegar 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s impossible. It requires coordination and millions of dollars in funding by all the respective governments, but if the world thinks CSAM is a serious problem, then it&#x27;s a drop in the bucket.CSAM doesn&#x27;t need to be added to the database in real-time.

Revealing some of the strategies and tactics of companies, or specific technical approaches also carries a risk of informing offenders on ways to avoid detection. The Commission representatives provided additional confidential information during the meeting with the Ombudsman inquiry team on why the list of experts could not be disclosed.If the goal of your company is to promote and get a wiretap on every single device and messenger app, IN SECRET, you should be concerned about your public image.

(With almost none of them ever acting on this attraction, or mentioning it to anyone other than a psychiatrist.)So potentially 10% of men everywhere — scattered all throughout industry and government — have clear motivation to push back against the creation of laws that would see their proclivities discovered and persecuted.Of course, such people wouldn&#x27;t out themselves by just defending the \"rights of pedophiles\" in any direct way. But they would act on any opportunity to ensure that mechanisms for \"complete privacy\" exist; and they would also stand behind others when they see them doing the same; and they would also learn all the rhetoric used by privacy advocates, and use it.(Yes, there are other people on the side of \"no wiretaps\" besides pedophiles. I&#x27;m not saying \"we can ignore the people against wiretaps because they&#x27;re all just pedophiles anyway.\" What I&#x27;m saying is more that, insofar as \"10% of men\" is an accurate measure, that&#x27;s a big implicit voting interest bloc! Probably one larger than all the world&#x27;s egalitarian \"privacy advocates\" put together!

Let that sink in. reply nvm0n2 14 hours agorootparentThe sad, awkward and near-unspeakable problem is that totalitarianism flourished in 20th century Europe partly because the culture was tolerant of it. That culture wasn&#x27;t totally erased by the Allies at the end of WW2, which is why the EU&#x27;s history is full of WTF moments like when Jean-Claude Juncker unveiled a giant statue of Karl Marx and then gave a speech defending him, claiming communism wasn&#x27;t his fault [1]. Were European national leaders up in arms about this? No, not really :( The primary objections came from the Brits, some Hungarian MEPs, and, um, US Congress, three members of whom wrote to Mr Juncker reminding him that Marxist ideology led to extreme violence and the oppression of eastern Europe.I think many Americans don&#x27;t realize what the EU&#x27;s history actually is. Juncker&#x27;s honoring of Marx wasn&#x27;t unexpected. The original proposal for the EU was made by communists imprisoned on an island during WW2. The Ventotene Manifesto specifically called for a socialist federation [2]. Spinelli devoted his life to the construction of the EU and spent 6 years as a member of the Commission, during which time he was actually a member of the Italian Communist Party! There is a major building in Brussels named after him, in his honor.This attitude can be seen in the many disturbing quotes from major EU figures, like these from [3].Juncker:- \"When it becomes serious, you have to lie\"- \"We decide on something, leave it lying around and wait and see what happens. If no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don&#x27;t understand what has been decided we continue step by step until there is no turning back.\"- \"Britain is different. Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty.

Most are actually idealists (somewhat at odds with their materialist viewpoints). reply nvm0n2 34 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not aware of any alt origin story given the very clear and direct line between the EU and the Ventotene Manifesto. The EU&#x27;s own diplomatic service tells the story the exact same way:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eeas.europa.eu&#x2F;eeas&#x2F;ventotene-manifesto-and-futu...The Manifesto spread like wildfire through all the circles of the European resistance. This resulted in the founding of the movements for a European federation in several countries, the decisive Hague Congress of 1948. It resulted ultimately in the Schuman Declaration of 1950, which proposed the European Coal and Steel Community, the first step on our integration process, based on the supranational principle. Later on, in a career that included being Commissioner and Member of the European Parliament, Spinelli promoted the Treaty of the European Union of 1984, which was approved by the European Parliament. Originally rejected by the Council, it became a major influence in the writing of the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 that launched the monetary union and created the foreign and security pillar, of intergovernmental nature.The EU was founded by communists, there&#x27;s no real way around it.Still, you are totally right that the EU is not specifically Marxist today, even though it has its origins in that world. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no problem. Marxism is just one turn of the wheel, an iteration of the same underlying ideology that constantly shapeshifts whilst retaining its basic idealistic core. By the end of the 20th century Marxist economics was discredited. The working classes failed to rise up and revolt against their capitalist masters, turning out to be actually quite conservative and OK with capitalism. The places where \"professional revolutionaries\" did it for them trashed their economies and wrecked their societies.So no longer would people who shared Marx&#x27;s basic intuitions focus their energies on organizing the working classes. They adopted standard capitalist orthodoxy instead, which is why the old left tend to describe the EU as \"neoliberal\". And they are indeed to some extent New Liberals economically, albeit their love for capitalism is half-hearted at best. They are reluctant converts. But the same underlying intuitions about human nature didn&#x27;t go away. The principles that there are big gaps between the best and worst people, that society should be united under a dictatorship of the best people, and that it&#x27;s OK to bend or break the rules to get that outcome, well, unfortunately these ideas somehow did not get discredited.And so the people who would once have been Marxists shed the idea of fully planned economies and violent revolution, replacing it with a new form of subtle diplomatic revolution. The outcomes would be the same: people are still forced into a trans-national dictatorship of \"professional revolutionaries\" against their will, but now the mechanisms have altered. The mechanism would be a steady accumulation of international treaties erasing differences between nations, exploiting a loophole in many countries constitutions that allows governments to sign treaties without needing the consent of representatives, and by linking all those apparently separate treaties via carefully disguised \"guillotine clauses\" in which an attempt to back out of one causes the immediate revocation of all of them.This focus on subterfuge is why so many quotes from EU elites are on the theme of backroom dealings, misleading the public about what they&#x27;re doing, hiding things from the public, ensuring countries can&#x27;t back out when it&#x27;s too late and so on. It&#x27;s why the EU has a culture of intense secrecy about everything, reflected in the article this thread is about, but it&#x27;s not unique to CSAM expert lists. The way von der Leyen was selected is a secret, even the way EU law is made is itself a secret:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;euobserver.com&#x2F;eu-political&#x2F;136630And often even things that are stated publicly are manipulative propaganda, which is why HN has so many posters convinced of things that aren&#x27;t true, like the supposedly democratic nature of how the Commission is appointed (not true, Juncker has said in the past he vetoed any Commissioner he didn&#x27;t like, which is not how it&#x27;s supposed to work and not how people usually claim it works).So the EU is fundamentally still engaged in the same old tricks. It is in some sense progress that they do it via the pen now and not the sword, but that&#x27;s relatively small consolation given that the desired end state is so similar. reply boppo1 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah but the EU is relatively progressive & promotes immigration & multiculturalism, so they can&#x27;t be totalitarian. reply bradley13 16 hours agorootparentprevUm, no.

If something is going to piss off their citizens[0], they make the Commission make them do it, then blame the EU.The specific reason why policy laundering is possible is because international organizations are only accountable to their member states and not citizens. Making them accountable to citizens means getting rid of those member state vetos and having direct elected Commissioners instead - i.e. moving closer to a federal model of Europe.In America, we used to appoint Senators rather than electing them, as a vestige of pre-federal America where states were supposed to actually be co-sovereigns. The result was that - once Americans figured out how to use their political power effectively - every state gubernatorial race became a proxy vote for Senate anyway. I suspect we need something like this to happen in the EU, where politicians precommit to specific Commissioner appointments, until this becomes enough of a problem that the EU decides to make Commissioners elected.[0] And, more generally, all EU citizens reply cultureswitch 12 hours agorootparentprevThe Commission is the governments of the member states.Which makes it ironically the most corrupt and undemocratic part of the EU, despite being literally made of people elected through national elections.

The remaining 26 Commissioners are selected by the Council of Ministers (appointed ministers for each EU member state, and hence an additional layer of indirection away from the actual electorate.) Then Parliament has some substantially more limited ability to review these appointments, but I don&#x27;t think they get an outright veto. reply realityking 15 hours agorootparentThe European Parliament does get an outright veto or rather the opposite, without explicit approval from the EP commissioners can‘t be appointed.The catch, they can only approve (or not approve) them as a group.

Thanks for clarifying.Can German chancellors appoint anyone they like as ministers, or do they have to appoint someone who has been elected to the Bundestag? Because commissioners are not elected.So, as I recall, there&#x27;s been exactly one instance in which the EU Parliament has rejected all the Commissioners; they sacked the lot, because it was evident that they were mostly corrupt.

Each meeting of the Council of Ministers is a different group of people. And anyway, they can&#x27;t select anyone they like, because each member country gets an allocation of commissioners (one or two, I think).I believe there are plans afoot to remove that rule, so that countries like Liechtenstein no longer get one commissioner.

Certainly the Commission often ends up with extremely dubious Presidents where nobody can explain on what merits they gained that position.And then the selection of both President and Commissioners is supposed to be ratified by the Parliament but last time they were given a vote with a single option on it. You could either support vdL or abstain.

Most smart phones have AI-enabled chips that would be able to run images&#x2F;videos against classification algorithms. The tricky part would be enforcing that users use clients which do this, so the task becomes regulating allowed messaging clients, which might be impossible. That being said, one could probably knock out 80% of the problem by legally forcing the hand of all the major platforms to do client-side scanning.

It occurs to me now that these were all Brutalist-influenced buildings. This is something I never ever talked about, growing up in the wake of Columbine.In retrospect I guess it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m a psychopath, but that I unconsciously recognized that that sort of design was smack in the middle of the Quake engine&#x27;s wheelhouse.Still probably going to keep those thoughts to myself. reply gorkish 13 hours agorootparentMy friends and I made levels of our school campus dorms, etc. for both Doom and Quake. This was all prior to Columbine and nobody thought it was strange in the slightest; on the contrary everyone thought it was awesome (faculty included). A couple of years later, and who knows how it would have been perceived or if we would have even felt that it was appropriate.We only had two buildings with an architectural style that favored the game environments though. They were both built as \"modern\" buildings some time in the 70&#x27;s. Somewhat unsurprisingly the school has since torn them down at great expense and replaced them with buildings that are stylistically compatible with the rest of campus. reply ep103 8 hours agorootparentWe did that post-columbine. One of our friends made the map in something like CS or something. Our little friend group thought it was awesome, but it was also tacitly understood that at no point could we tell anyone outside our tiny little trust circle about it, god forbid they thought we were like the columbine kids, instead of just trying to play a game in like, one of the two buildings we spent half of our lives in thus far. I don&#x27;t know if he ever even ultimately shared it with us. We also made the school in a starcraft map using the blue resources as hallways IIRC, and were quiet about that one too, for the same reason haha reply jprd 7 hours agorootparentToys R Us. 90s.

They keep making more and knocking it out of the park. I&#x27;ve played all of it, and keep coming back for more :). reply Narishma 11 hours agoparentI think TrenchBroom deserves credit for that. reply chilmers 17 hours agoprevI love how level creation for games like Doom and Quake has developed into these small, independent scenes, with a rich community history and a real sense of taste and refinement in how they approach designing for these games. In the same way that \"pixel art\" has evolved from a necessity driven by the limits of early hardware, through early attempts to recreate a \"retro\" look, to the point where it is a well-developed aesthetic that is used as an informed choice.It might sound a bit pretentious, but it really feels like the video games have begun to reach a point of maturity akin to older forms of art, where people are no longer fumbling around in the dark so much, or chasing the technological zeitgeist. Instead creators are consciously embracing and exploring different limitations and aesthetics, in the same way a painter might use different types of paint, with all these diverse styles and scenes, which are at once independent yet also informed by each other. reply derefr 17 hours agoparentI agree, it&#x27;s great to see people rummaging through old game engines to find the \"right medium to express their thought\", the way one might rummage through a pile of art supplies.The only thing I personally think is a shame, is that the structure of interactive experience inherently lends itself to collage — to a potential for different \"scenes\" made from entirely distinct \"media\" — but that it&#x27;s prohibitively difficult currently to (seamlessly) weave together different game engines into one game art project; especially when some of those engines aren&#x27;t open-source engines, but only exist in the form of old games that are usually turned into art through ROM-hacking.An artist should be able to have me walk through a door in an RPG Maker game end up playing a Quake level! And then, upon killing a certain enemy, be suddenly in a bossfight in a SMW ROMhack! And then, upon succeeding or failing in the boss fight, I should be able to either end up in their custom Unreal-engine-coded finale, or back in the RPG Maker \"space\" from before! All without loading times or futzing with the display settings!I&#x27;ve been working on a \"solution\" to this \"problem of artistic collage\" — a runtime that supports custom (i.e. zero-installed from the internet on demand by a game) sandboxed cores wrapped in realtime-per-frame in-memory-state import&#x2F;export logic, where \"a game\" is actually a set of sub-game modules, with each module being expressed in terms of its own core, and having either a plain API call (for open engines) or a RetroAchievements-like memory-watch rule, to trigger state-transitions over to other modules. reply dack 16 hours agorootparentI know about the developer who, instead of building their game, decides to build a game engine. But that appears to have not been enough for you - this appears to be a game meta-engine! :)It sounds like quite a technical achievement to accomplish that, but it also sounds like it would fill only a very tiny niche of developers who actually want this and are willing to build assets in entirely different engines just so they can transition to different aesthetics during the game.Not to knock on the idea though - it would certainly be very cool to see. Curious if you have any other use-cases in mind for such a technology? reply derefr 15 hours agorootparent> Curious if you have any other use-cases in mind for such a technology?Yes. In fact, the collage thing is the secondary pie-in-the-sky non-MVP use-case.The primary use-case: a Mario Maker-like UX for playing cloud-hosted ROMhacks, where each ROMhack&#x27;s game engine has been carefully cut down so that the experience is of just playing a level in isolation, with some state (e.g. life counter) managed by the runtime and passed in&#x2F;out of the running core; where, just like in Mario Maker, the UX takes over between executions of the \"per-level simulation\", and so it&#x27;s the UX, not the game, that determines whether you retry on death; and that determines what happens next when you \"complete\" a given level. So it can do various things like run you through playlists of experiences, shuffle a filtered set of all experiences, etc.That \"cutting down\" of ROMs into game engines would be automatic&#x2F;generalized, and would involve the classic techniques of \"program-slicing\", applied to the domain-specific tooling of emulation: input-movie control-path tracing + memory-watch rules for where the \"boundaries\" of the sub-engine in the game are, followed by unreachable-code and data elimination; then base memory-state capture to kick off the game at a given point + overlay-state synthesis to control what it looks like when it kicks off. Jumping control \"out of bounds\" ends the emulation, with memory rules to then determine whether that constituted a \"win\" or a \"game over.\"Also, the base \"game engine\" ROMs would have all IP \"assets\" (art, music, etc) removed &#x2F; factored out; these would instead ship as [modder-provided] \"game asset\" packs, of which there could be multiple used in a single game project, and which would synthesized into ROM memory-bank files at publication time.End-user supplies base-game ROM images locally; client synthesizes \"game engines\" from these ROM images. Or clean-room reversed \"game engines\" can be distributed, given that they&#x27;re an alternative compilation from the reversed source, that doesn&#x27;t contain any of the original game&#x27;s assets — those all being wholesale replaced by the mod! — and so (I believe) don&#x27;t violate copyright. In which case, the end user having the original ROM image available, only unlocks the ability to (potentially) \"change the asset theme\" of the game from its custom one, back to the original game&#x27;s IP assets.The core user-story, would be sitting there with a controller in hand, continuously consuming free-to-play \"experiences\", presented to them through playlists &#x2F; recommendations &#x2F; shuffle. (Game jams would be playlists!)But there&#x27;d also be a store — for buying experiences that artists want to charge for, yes†; but also for buying asset packs, or for licensing the use of \"engines\" that others have put their hard work into developing, since the same UI that lets you play the games, is also the UI for publishing the games. (I&#x27;m not sure if I want to get involved with it being a UI for developing games, though. Maybe for the multi-module stuff; but I&#x27;m more expecting tooling like GB Studio and Lunar Magic to step in on the development side, allowing export to a package format that you&#x27;d use to publish on this thing.)† (Paid experiences could have \"demo versions\" that show up in the free-to-play shuffle; where at all times while playing the demo, there&#x27;d be a little unobtrusive UI element that could take you to the store page for the paid version of the experience.)You could add whatever \"game engines\" you want to this platform — as these aren&#x27;t just limited to being ROMs, but rather can also contain a \"native layer\" (I&#x27;m currently thinking a PPAPI executable, even though it failed in its original browser use-case.) Engines can be designed \"on top of\" other engines; all the extracted-from-game-ROM game engines would actually be running on top of a set of native emulation-core engines that ship with the runtime. But \"RPGMaker-compatible runner\" is an engine. Love2D is an engine. RenPy is an engine. StepMania is an engine. The early Win32 GameMaker engines are engines. The Macromedia Flash projector is an engine. Etc. You can publish experiences with these, too; and there would be porting tools to take finished projects from these runtimes and shift them onto the platform.And, perhaps less obviously, big third parties (e.g. Adobe, Unity) could publish pay-to-license engines on the platform, where you could design your more domain-constrained engine to run on top of their engine, and the whole licensing&#x2F;royalties aspect would be handled automatically.---One of the key things I actually want from this project, is to \"commodify\" these other engines, in the way that MAME&#x2F;RetroArch&#x2F;etc \"commodify\" emulators into cores. I want to \"containerize\" all the old Flash games, old visual novels, RPG Maker 95 projects, etc. such that you could just pick-up-and-play them the same way you can pick-up-and-play a ROM on a modern multi-core emulator. And with all the same modern niceties, e.g. cloud-based save-states, super-resolution, etc.The other, perhaps less obvious trick here, is that you can slice up the actual original games themselves — the ones whose game engines are the basis of the mods — and allow the bits and pieces of these original titles to be listed as these same kind of bite-sized \"experiences\" on the platform — but where these \"experiences\" are only accessible to owners of the original game (i.e. to people who have the ROM image locally, or maybe who have bought the game from its IP owner(!) through the platform; or who can prove they have paid some other licensing fee to the IP owner, e.g. by SSO-binding an account of that IP owner&#x27;s platform that proves they have access to a subscription tier that comes with leased licenses for those titles.) Sometimes I just want to re-play a particular small section or mini-game from one of my favorite old games. This platform would treat that section&#x2F;mini-game as its own addressable resource that I can navigate to and play. reply awayto 14 hours agorootparentprev> walk through a door in an RPG Maker game end up playing a Quake level!

However, the Doom community both embraces faithful ports like prBoom, Crispy, and Chocolate Doom; and carries at its centre the wonderful GZDoom engine.GZDoom zigs where every other game engine zags. Rather than moving away from BSP into static meshes, and other standard \"modern\" shifts, GZDoom embraces the fundamentals that make it mod-friendly. It maintains BSP at its core, and while it supports voxels and meshes it remains 2D-focused. What it adds is all the trappings that make it attractive to rapid iteration: good scripting, a toolkit of predefined events, and tools with excellent asset importation and management.If I imagine where Quake would go, if it were to follow GZDoom&#x27;s model, I imagine it would lean into Quakeworld&#x27;s client&#x2F;server architecture, the QVM, realtime vis, static lighting, and so forth. Particularly the static lighting; which is something I find modern engines tend to treat as a performance feature and not an aesthetic feature.Both Quake and Doom, but moreso Doom, have unrealistic lighting; with overly sharp and unnatural transitions. When playing modern games everything is softer, the shadows are more natural, the scenes are realistic; but they lose that harsh aesthetic that gave rise to the horror of Doom and Quake. The shadows aren&#x27;t just dim, they&#x27;re black, and who knows what they hold.Anyhow, I digress. reply badsectoracula 13 hours agorootparent> It maintains BSP at its core, and while it supports voxels and meshes it remains 2D-focused.

I was trying to draw Napoleonic battle lines on the board, and push back the opponent. And it kinda worked for very entry-level games, but mostly didn&#x27;t make sense? Because then the opponent would just place somewhere behind my \"line\" and it all fell apart.Over time, I started imagining each of the spots on the board as being a person in a city. And placing a stone, really, was like bringing the AOE II priest to \"wololo\" convert the person to my team. So really, the goal wasn&#x27;t to create battle lines, the goal was to pick and choose who on the board to join my team, so that by the end of the game, I would have the most influence in the city. (I&#x27;ve heard others describe it as planting plants to grow over the majority of a garden, which is similar) At that point, I started choosing spaces around the board in order to make sure I had enough friends in each neighborhood that I would be the most popular person there, even once my opponent started advertising in the region too.That begs the obvious question, are there different neighborhoods that are more important than others? And the answer is yes. As you learn about eye shapes, you&#x27;ll realize its easier to be popular and own in a corner than it is a side, and a side than it is the center, so when you start the game, you prioritize being popular in these regions, in that order (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xqpqa5NCbMY&t=52s)And then over time, I&#x27;ve learned how to do that more and more efficiently, and the tradeoffs that come from that.It also helps to start on smaller boards, then move to bigger ones as you get a feel for what&#x27;s going on : ) reply jurynulifcation 17 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not alone.

Voters in Maine overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure Tuesday that enshrines the right to repair cars, a major win for consumers and a blow to auto manufacturers who have spent millions lobbying against similar legislation and fighting against it in the courts. “Question 4,” which enshrines consumers’ data access to car diagnostics for the purposes of repair, passed by a margin of 84.3-15.7 in Tuesday’s election with 94 percent of the votes tallied. The yes/no question was simple: “Do you want to require vehicle manufacturers to standardize on-board diagnostic systems and provide remote access to those systems and mechanical data to owners and independent repair facilities?” Maine’s vote shows yet again that right to repair in all of its forms is overwhelmingly popular with consumers, and that they are not swayed by fear mongering campaigns from manufacturers. A similar measure in 2020 passed in Massachusetts with 75 percent support from voters. In Massachusetts, car manufacturers spent tens of millions of dollars on ads that said the law would be used by stalkers and hackers if it was passed. Auto manufacturers have been engaged in a three-year lawsuit there to prevent the law from going into effect. Proponents of the law say it is necessary because car manufacturers are moving toward systems where car diagnostics can only be read wirelessly by people who are authorized by the manufacturer to do so; on cars up to now, such data has been accessible through a wired port underneath the car’s steering wheel. “Maine residents have won the right to control their destiny when it comes to car repairs,” Tommy Hickey, director of the Maine Automotive Right to Repair Coalition, told 404 Media. “There’s a new technology in cars, they’ve become computers on wheels, and with this law owners in Maine will be the gatekeepers of that information.” Hickey also worked on the Massachusetts law in 2020. Hickey said that after getting crushed in Massachusetts, auto manufacturers didn’t lobby as hard against the Maine law as they did in Massachusetts: “They didn’t spend nearly as much money,” he said. “When you spend $30 million and you lose 75 percent of the vote, I think the writing is on the wall.” Nathan Proctor, head of consumer rights group USPIRG’s right to repair project, told 404 Media that “right to Repair is incredibly popular because it’s common sense—at least to those who aren’t manufacturers. Society works best when we are empowered to fix our stuff.” The Maine law is a big deal not just for people in Maine. In the past, when states have passed legislation like this, manufacturers have functionally had to make this data available in other states. An earlier law passed in Massachusetts became de-facto national legislation after manufacturers signed a “Memorandum of Understanding” in which they agreed to comply with the law throughout the country rather than face slightly varying laws in every state. The CAR Coalition, which is pushing right to repair legislation throughout the country, told 404 Media that “Maine voters' overwhelming show of support for Question 4 adds momentum to the growing national push for right to repair protections. The CAR Coalition will continue this important fight at the federal level with bipartisan bills like the SMART and REPAIR Acts to ensure every American—no matter where they live—has the right to repair the car they own.”",

All features related to driving the vehicle, including but not limited to steering, braking, using traffic signals, starting&#x2F;stopping, toggling locks or lights, opening or closing doors or compartments, and other standard features of a non-connected car must not require a network connection.I think it’s probably OK if automakers want to onboard and support network features like maps or outsourced computation&#x2F;diagnostics, but bricking everything because the company wants to collect user data and they want to opt out is obviously unethical. It’s important for these regulations to include the fact that they cannot be worked around or stapled on by the auto company post-hoc via firmware upgrades or the like. reply troupo 3 hours agorootparent> All functions that a consumer could reasonably expect a car to perform without an internet connection must be operable without an internet connection.Welcome to \"the law is vague and impossible to implement\" shouts from HN reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentprev> As phrased, you&#x27;re just making any features that use network connections illegal.Just as planned. reply JumpCrisscross 5 hours agorootparentYou do see how proposing banning maps with traffic updates tanks the whole concept, right? reply goodlinks 9 minutes agorootparentThis could still work, just not have data.Something can be functional but uselessEdit, or rather.. functional but unused reply nulbyte 5 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn&#x27;t want this built into my car.

Which is exactly the intended outcome. reply kelnos 29 minutes agorootparentSpeak for yourself. I like being able to lock my car from far away when I&#x27;ve forgotten to. I like being able to remotely start the engine so it&#x27;s nice and warm inside for meet in the winter.Making these sorts of features illegal is unacceptable and short sighted.What I&#x27;d like is to force carmakers to open up the APIs and protocols used to enable these features, and allow me to use my own backend that I run in my own hardware, away from their prying eyes. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, I see exactly zero features that would require network connection that make sense to be offered by the car maker directly. So let&#x27;s refine it to \"All first-party functions of the car ...\", and add some provision to prevent bundling and un-commoditizing third-party networked additions. reply qwytw 58 minutes agorootparentI would definitely want my car to be able to call an ambulance if I run off the road and hit a tree for instance and there are no other people around.Of course perceived privacy is more important than something like that for many people here which is understandable. reply kube-system 10 hours agorootparentprevCarPlay integration is a feature bundled into the infotainment in many cars that requires an \"external network connection\". It will not work if you disable the \"external network connection\". reply numpad0 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d argue in-car LAN is an internal network connection.

It&#x27;s supposed to enable integrating your car and your phone. Surely that should mean local network connection. reply kube-system 10 hours agorootparentWifi is a network external to the vehicle. An internal network would be something like CAN.Whatever the case, my point is that a good solution is probably not quite as simple as phrased above. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparentA WiFi router built into the car is something I&#x27;d classify as internal networking for the purpose of this thread. reply 1_1xdev1 9 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t CarPlay only over USB?And either way -- just keep supporting connection over USB and it&#x27;s not a problem? reply gruez 8 hours agorootparent> Isn&#x27;t CarPlay only over USB?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT205634>If your car supports only wireless CarPlay ... reply kube-system 8 hours agorootparentprevCarPlay supports connection over WiFi, and I think if a law prohibited it, it would be problematic. reply chaps 10 hours agorootparentprevA lot of it exists to sell your lat&#x2F;lng and trip information to organizations like Wejo, who then goes on to sell it to gov organizations. reply amalcon 11 hours agorootparentprevLoJack-alike and accident alerting features do make some sense to be offered directly by the car maker. The latter is obviously difficult to retrofit, and the former would likely be easier to defeat if retrofitted.I don&#x27;t buy the music and navigation arguments in a smartphone-equipped world, but I think a good case can be made for those two. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentFine. Still, those two could be made as optional features that could be turned on or off at purchase, and&#x2F;or during visit to a dealership or authorized repair shop. And neither of these should be sending telemetry during normal operation of the vehicle. reply Arainach 11 hours agorootparentprevIn-car Wifi, Spotify on the car radio, OEM maps with traffic.... you see zero? reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentYes. In-car WiFi should obviously work even if the network connection break (remember, we&#x27;re talking about working without Internet, not disallowing Internet at all) - WiFi is a local wireless network protocol, not magic Internet summoner. With actual Internet connection down, it should still maintain the local network for connected devices.As for the rest, none of those look like they should be first-party features. \"Spotify on the car radio\" is a third-party integration to a system that should also work off-line, e.g. for playing music off removable storage, casting from your phone (via WiFi, without Internet), or, you know, working as an actual radio. OEM maps with traffic is something hardly anyone wants anyway, because they universally suck relative to some TomTom screen, or even Google Maps. reply kube-system 10 hours agorootparentColloquially speaking, \"In-car Wifi\" has come to mean \"in-car internet connectivity\".

If automakers want to use a cellular connection in your car for non-critical functions, it should come with a legitimate user-uncontrollable off switch, just like airplane mode on a phone. reply brewdad 11 hours agorootparentRight. We&#x27;re trying to stop the world of heated seat subscriptions with a remote license verification at startup before it gets a foothold. reply Arainach 7 hours agorootparentprevRight - but as the parent said, the proposed language of \"all car features must keep working\" isn&#x27;t compatible with that.Defining a law that allows those features to be turned off and yet disallows \"data is broken, heated seats are disabled\" is very difficult.

They also seek to prevent manufacturers from mandating the use of exclusive tools or software.But that’s not what the law text says. As you mentioned the law is about access to the on board diagnostics, but nothing about the rest of the vehicle.A contrived example would be that the manufacturer needs to tell people how to reset the Oil Change sensor on the car. But has no obligation to share how to actually perform an oil change. No obligation to provide the torque value for the oil drain plug.So all this law obligates them to do is provide access to the diagnostic computers, but nothing about the actual mechanics of the vehicle. Perhaps this is legislated elsewhere.But here in California, I can not get the factory service manual for my motorcycle. It is unavailable. Were this legislation to have been passed here, i still may not have access.Yet that’s what the ballot summary says, “provide the same diagnostic and repair information”, but it’s not what the law as written says. reply jsight 12 hours agorootparentprevI did, but it left ambiguities.

For the most part, since 1996. There are specific software sets for doing more advanced operations, but these all talk over the ODB ports, which is done typically by an elm27 on a simple data line. The problem is there is standard and non standard commands you can issue and get replies for.The requirement should be \"all cars with digital systems will come with a on-board diagnostic computer.The one for saab - pre OBD2 is almost impossible to find. It&#x27;s called an ISAT and I only know of about 5 on the east coast.post ODB2 there&#x27;s somthing called a \"TECH2\" that GM used across all their lineups. They cost between 400 and 1000 dollars depending on the addons and such.Instead, they should just build a tech2 into the car&#x27;s infotainment system. reply jcrawfordor 11 hours agorootparentOBDII is only a minimal standard, compliance requires only reporting that is related to emissions systems and engine systems that affect emissions. Basically everything else is manufacturer-specific and requires either a manufacturer diagnostic computer (every manufacturer has one) or third-party software with (usually reverse engineered) support for manufacturer diagnostics. Since CANbus became the normal implementation for OBDII, much of this is done by communicating with individual modules over OBDII using message sets proprietary to the manufacturer of that module. Newer vehicles incorporate more and more functionality into these modules, such that the usefulness of the core OBDII set tends to decrease.OBDII is really quite far from solving the problem - unsurprising because it wasn&#x27;t intended to. It&#x27;s an emissions standard, not a general diagnostics standard. Common modern fault points like the brake system and SRS are unaddressed by OBDII, and that&#x27;s without getting into infotainment and telematics. reply buildbot 1 hour agorootparentprevWow someone else who actually knows that the Saab 900 had a diagnostic port!I miss my 900 Turbo.

Traits that only come into play when something goes wrong -- repairability, warranty, customer service, etc. -- are minor factors in the average consumer purchasing decision because people don&#x27;t expect things to go wrong. If a given piece of, say, electronics only breaks in a reasonable timeframe 5% of the time, most people aren&#x27;t going to factor in how easy to fix it is when they decide whether to buy it.The reality is that most people only factor in a few more obvious variables in their purchasing decision. It&#x27;s hard to get consumer momentum for less prominent aspects of a product to get manufacturers to change their behavior.It&#x27;s the same reason we have basic labor regulations or building&#x2F;health codes, rather than relying on the market for everything. Consumers are good at applying pressure on companies for some things, sure, but not everything. reply vegetablepotpie 5 hours agoparentprevThe short answer is that investors like the companies in their portfolios to have recurring payments. This leads companies to offer product features as subscription services. This makes them do things to keep you from modifying the device, such as using proprietary parts, employing device serialization, and using the DMCA to sue you when you attempt to modify a device.There’s an awful lot of collusion behind the scenes. When one company starts a practice that drives revenues, all companies start doing it. Investors demand it. Then you see things like industry wide shifts.

    "originBody": "Ads, ads, and more ads — After luring customers with low prices, Amazon stuffs Fire TVs with ads OEMs are increasingly focused on using TVs as a way to show customers ads. Scharon Harding - 11/8/2023, 5:46 PM Enlarge / A non-Amazon TV displaying a fire. Getty reader comments 145 with People who buy a Fire TV from Amazon are probably looking for a cheap and simple way to get an affordable 4K smart TV. When Amazon announced its first self-branded TVs in September 2021, it touted them as being a \"great value.\" But owners of the devices will soon be paying for some of those savings in the form of more prominently displayed advertisements. Charlotte Maines, Amazon's director of Fire TV advertising, monetization, and engagement, detailed the new types of ads that Amazon is selling on Fire TVs. In a StreamTV Insider report from November 1, Amazon said the new ads will allow advertisers to reach an average of 155 million unique monthly viewers. Some of the changes targeting advertisers, like connecting display placement ads with specific in-stream video ads, seem harmless enough. Others could jeopardize the TV-watching experience for owners. New ads tied to generative AI Alexa For example, Amazon is preparing to make Alexa with generative AI more useful for finding content on Fire TVs. This could help Alexa, which has struggled alongside other tech giants' voice assistants to generate significant revenue. Amazon gets money every time someone interacts with digital content through Alexa. However, the company is double-dipping on this idea by also tying ads to generative AI on Fire TVs. When users ask Alexa to help them find media with queries such as \"play the show with the guy who plays the lawyer in Breaking Bad,\" they will see ads that are relevant to the search. Amazon has discussed evolving Alexa into a tool that can not only bring you to the right app for the show you want but that can also recommend specific shows based on prompts like the above. This has been one of the most promising potential futures for the voice assistant. But positioning the feature next to ads seems to prioritize advertisers over Fire TV customers. Advertisement Maines told StreamTV Insider that advertisers had been asking for a way to advertise against Fire TV searches. “It just makes sense to expand our existing sponsor tile offering to show advertisements on the search screen with no extra effort or cost for the advertiser,” she said. Finally, Amazon is adding \"contextual sponsored tiles\" that use machine learning to show ads based on whatever content genre or search term the Fire TV user is browsing. “Persistent” ads Amazon Fire TV users will also start seeing banner ads on the device's home screen for things that have nothing to do with entertainment or media. This ad space was previously reserved for advertising media and entertainment, making the ads feel more relevant, at least. Amazon opening the ad space to more types of advertisers is similar to a move Google TV made early this year. The company seems to be aware of how dominating these types of advertisements can be. Maines emphasized to StreamTV Insider how the native ads are \"right at the top of the Fire TV's home screen\" and take \"up half the screen.\" Maines continued, telling StreamTV Insider: It’s persistent, so as a customer browses around the UI… they continue to see it. The banner ads will occupy the first slot in the rotating hero area, which Amazon believes is the first thing Fire TV users see. These users may have purchased a Fire TV primarily for streaming content from ad-free subscriptions, but Maines described how Fire TVs can still manage to force ads on these users. StreamTV Insider reported: Maines explained how with on-device ads, even if viewers ultimately choose to watch something that’s not ad-supported, brand advertisers still have the opportunity to get their message in front of viewers and talk to them as they browse and decide what to watch.

It&#x27;s deceptively simple - they are taking old shows like Murder She Wrote and streaming them non-stop on a \"channel\" much like the old terrestrial broadcast networks did. They&#x27;re solving the streaming problem for older customers that don&#x27;t grok Netflix or Hulu.These shows take pseudo-commercial breaks and send you 2-3 ads tailored to you specifically. My wife didn&#x27;t believe it until I did a simple Amazon search on my phone for automotive batteries. Not more than 30 minutes later the ads switched to some random LiPo battery for RVs. reply swatcoder 10 hours agoparentLinear streaming is central to PlutoTV, which has been around for a while and is available on many platforms.It’s not really for people “that don’t grok Netflix or Hulu”. That’s one reason, I suppose, but the stronger reasons are:1. Licensing and cost nonsense that none of us care about.2. Channel surfing is an entirely different way to engage with low-attention content and has its own place. You may not “grok it” yourself, but the gist is that it greatly reduces the analysis paralysis of picking movies and episodes and doesn’t make you feel like you’re sitting down to watch something from start to finish. You just surf around and leave something and let it play. The lack of control is intentional and positive, and it can be a great avenue for discovery in a world where every on-demand front page has been lost to poor algorithm recommendations. reply joezydeco 10 hours agorootparentThe casual discovery was the thing people missed the most about cable TV. This comes close, as in they&#x27;re linear channels of the same program in most cases, but it&#x27;s familiar enough to work. reply gosub100 12 hours agoparentprevI recently bought a \"smart TV\" and I was pleased to see that it comes with essentially &#x27;cable TV&#x27; (IPTV, I guess?) without even needing to run an app or set up an account. You just click CH+&#x2F;- or guide and you watch another channel. One of the channels plays 21 Jump Street (the 80&#x27;s show) and a few other 80&#x27;s classics, another 2 just play 80&#x27;s&#x2F;90&#x27;s music videos exclusively. I think it&#x27;s kind of neat that the internet has finally come around to make cable TV obsolete. reply disposition2 11 hours agorootparent> I think it&#x27;s kind of neat that the internet has finally come around to make cable TV obsolete.As a counterpoint, decisions by the FCC (during the previous presidential administration), are effectively making the internet a requirement for OTA TV in the new ATSC 3.0 spectrum.[1]Here’s hoping we get more consumer focused considerations in the future. The internet features are nice (if you have internet access) but shouldn’t prevent a consumer from accessing OTA ‘out of the box’1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;nClxgUunmeE reply gosub100 11 hours agorootparentI just watched that video a day or 2 ago. I was pretty surprised to see that, and I agree it makes no sense for the case of broadcast TV. My guess is it&#x27;s a push from sports networks (90% NFL) and they&#x27;ll arrive at some \"compromise\" to only turn it on during NFL and NBA games. Not only is it oppressive to viewers, but I think it&#x27;s a terrible move for local broadcasters by actively blocking people who are already leaving&#x2F;left in droves for the internet. reply theage 6 hours agorootparentMany broadcasters are positioning to accepted the broadcast part of their business as the freemium entry point into their online app. The ads will never be turned off everywhere but the better experience will only be found over the jump. reply whynotmaybe 10 hours agorootparentprevFunny thing I discovered with mine, when there&#x27;s an ad during the show, I switch channel and come back.

What if ad networks allowed the advertiser to SUBSCRIBE to events generated by the ad viewer. For example, XYZ Toothpaste Inc gets a web hook that Targeted Consumer 123 has just started streaming TV Show \"Foobar\". reply ndriscoll 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not quite what you&#x27;re describing, but look up demand side platforms.

For a while Hulu thought I was Hispanic and living in Texas.Got a lot of ads for the Texas Lottery with Spanish audio. reply nvy 12 hours agorootparentAds are ads as far as I&#x27;m concerned. They&#x27;re all universally trash. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentAds, generically, are one thing. Car insurance when I&#x27;m not looking for car insurance. The problem with targeted advertising is when they&#x27;re for something I didn&#x27;t know I wanted. A band I like is coming to town, or a product that solves a problem I&#x27;ve been having. because then I&#x27;m spending money I wasn&#x27;t previously going to spend. reply gosub100 11 hours agorootparentCar insurance ads when you know they are paying those millions of dollars out of the premiums that you pay, just so they can tell you how cheap their premiums are. That&#x27;s what ticks me off! reply jrockway 10 hours agorootparentInsurance involves having a large pool of good drivers to subsidize the bad drivers. So the money they spend to make the pool larger could make things better from you; more good drivers, they pay out less claims, they charge you less. It&#x27;s one business where the \"network effect\" really matters, and so it&#x27;s not a guaranteed waste of money like advertising other products is.(For example, it really doesn&#x27;t matter whether you drink Coke or Pepsi. Those ads are just inflating the cost of the product; there are no more efficiencies to be had in the production of sugar water.) reply gosub100 9 hours agorootparentI assume there&#x27;s some regulation against only insuring drivers with perfect records? Otherwise I think I would have heard of it by now. I see the logic you&#x27;re using, but considering that almost nobody would have insurance if their lender&#x2F;state didn&#x27;t force them to, the same number of people would have insurance regardless of whether they advertised. It&#x27;s a zero-sum game, no? Separately, the same ads that might attract good drivers to my pool could also attract bad, and sadly I suspect that the people who are persuaded by ads are slightly less intelligent and more risky behind the wheel. replyeastbound 12 hours agorootparentprevI sometimes spam Youtube’s “visit website” button. Just to cost them money. Now Youtube thinks I’m really interested in [that ad from that day] and now shows me all competitors. reply joezydeco 12 hours agorootparentI think polluting the data with random shit is the way to go. The mix of ads becomes somewhat entertaining, including the knowledge that I&#x27;ll never buy any of this stuff. reply cultureswitch 11 hours agorootparentGet ad nauseam if you want to scale this reply joezydeco 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll have to check that out, thanks reply nvy 11 hours agorootparentprevThat was the point behind AdNauseam, I think. reply pxx 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d much rather my ads be targeted than generic. It increases value on both sides here.Comparing against the baseline of terrestrial broadcast, this is a far better experience than before. reply ndriscoll 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re making the mistake of assuming the ad is for the best offer you&#x27;d be interested in instead of the one that makes the most money from you (i.e. the worst one for you). The expected utility to you is negative. reply pxx 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re missing an important nuance. The best advertisement is for a product that, in expectation, makes the most money from me. My relative interest is still important, and you can&#x27;t just jump from the fact that somebody is making money to the unfounded claim that the \"expected utility is negative.\"When I buy an item I&#x27;m making a decision that the marginal value of that item to me is worth more than the marginal cost. If the ad is targeted, a transaction is more likely to happen. Transactions happen when both parties derive utility from them.If you advertise only high profit items without concern for the probability of transaction, your audience will not buy anything or end up buying the same item from somebody else. reply ndriscoll 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just that someone is making money. It&#x27;s not a friendly old man at the local bookstore giving you recommendations based on your tastes. It&#x27;s a system where all of the battery vendors are bidding in real time to be the one you see, and the most dodgy one with the best margins is the one that can place the best bid, causing you to get the worst possible deal.These systems are not for your benefit. They are meant to use any information they can to extract more from you. reply mrighele 11 hours agorootparentprevAs a customer, you will try of course to get the best deal. The best deal for you is the worst for them, so the target of advertising is convincing you that you are getting the best deal while actually giving you the worst possible.Targeted advertising is not giving you better deals, but providing you with a greater mismatch between your expectation and the reality. You may get a better deal out of it, but that is an unintended side effect reply hibernator149 12 hours agorootparentprevYou assume that they value longterm profits over shortterm ones. reply savanaly 12 hours agorootparentprev>You&#x27;re making the mistake of assuming the ad is for the best offer you&#x27;d be interested in instead of the one that makes the most money from you (i.e. the worst one for you). The expected utility to you is negative.A customer buying something isn&#x27;t a zero-sum transaction. My default assumption is that the product that stands to make the most money from me is the one that would most benefit me. For example, the grocery store sells apples, which I love, and chicken gizzards, which I don&#x27;t love. The product which I want most (apples) will stand to make the most money from me. If I didn&#x27;t know that apples were for sale near me, or that a particular store had particularly delicious apples, I would benefit from that and so would they after I spent my money on them. Win-win, not zero-sum. reply ndriscoll 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s again assuming the system is making good recommendations for you. That&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re meant to do. A much better analogy is you go to the grocery store. The clerk knows you like apples and says \"hey, I&#x27;ve got a bag of Johnny&#x27;s apples here for $6\", and pulls out a bag with a sticker that says \"Johnny&#x27;s\" on it. Next person comes in, and the clerk offers them a bag of Dan&#x27;s apples for $3.The bags come from the same orchard. Same tree. You paid for a sticker. The clerk just knows you make enough money not to notice because they have a dossier on every person in town. reply olyjohn 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not even that... they aren&#x27;t recommending Apples at all, but they&#x27;re going to try to get you to buy something else that is more profitable. It&#x27;s like going into the store and then they&#x27;re like \"Here&#x27;s a bag of oranges.\" reply ndriscoll 11 hours agorootparentIf the system has a higher expectation that you will buy the apples, making them the more profitable option to offer, it&#x27;ll do that. So people aren&#x27;t entirely wrong in that way. But the point is even when it&#x27;s \"helpful\" (by coincidence), it will still do everything it can to screw you. And yeah it&#x27;ll happily offer you oranges if it thinks it can get you to bite. Or beer, particularly if it knows you&#x27;re an alcoholic! reply titzer 12 hours agorootparentprev> My default assumption is that the product that stands to make the most money from me is the one that would most benefit me.Well, see, that&#x27;s where things like cigarettes, liquor, and gambling just blatantly violate that assumption. Ads are psychological manipulation for the advertiser&#x27;s benefit, hands down. reply Sebb767 13 hours agorootparentprev> You&#x27;re making the mistake of assuming the ad is for the best offer you&#x27;d be interested in instead of the one that makes the most money from you (i.e. the worst one for you)You are making the mistake of thinking that this is a zero-sum game. The product that makes the most money is not necessarily the worst one, it might actually just be one with higher margins or even an actually superior product that just lacks mindshare; in the end, buying it might still add value to your live. reply ndriscoll 12 hours agorootparentMarkets like Amazon are already full of people who will sell the exact same product with a computer generated brand name at slightly different markup. Even \"trustworthy\" brands do this kind of thing, and have for a long time. A system that knows everything about you (their goal) and tailors ads to you (or manipulates your ability to find offers) will inevitably converge on something that sells you the same thing, but at the maximum price you can be expected to be duped into. reply Lammy 12 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn’t because it means they spied on me more often and more effectively. Broadcast TV was one-way except for Nielsen people, and they at least got paid. reply owisd 13 hours agorootparentprevNot necessarily, it could mean the ads get better at tricking you into buying something you never use, or that it adds greater costs to the supply chain for something that you would have found out about via conventional means anyway. reply t-3 13 hours agorootparentprev\"Targeted\" ads are not targeted though, they&#x27;re just trying to sell you the same thing you just bought. It&#x27;s the most annoying, stupidest, and least effective form of targeting they could possibly use. reply whalesalad 15 hours agoprevThe trick is to never give your TV access to the internet and to pair it with an Apple TV. If you buy a TV and it won&#x27;t even boot or work without an internet connection - return it and get a different one. reply vladvasiliu 14 hours agoparentThat works fine with a TV. I bought one knowing that the \"smart\" features weren&#x27;t all that great. I tried connecting it to the internet, and it felt more sluggish, although it&#x27;s a brand new 2023 model. I was able to reset it to factory defaults and it&#x27;s working well enough for what I bought it for (the image is very good, at least for my needs). For reference, it&#x27;s a TCL with Google TV.But the Fire TV TFA talks about... well, the whole point of the thing is to stream internet content. So not connecting it to the internet kinda defeats 90% of the thing&#x27;s purpose. reply Retric 14 hours agorootparentThe fire stick is the pure streaming dongle, a Fire TV is an actual TV which includes that dongle built in and sold at a discount.So, buying a cheap Amazon fire TV and not connecting it to the internet is a reasonable choice for a cheap ‘dumb’ TV. reply squeaky-clean 13 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also the \"Fire TV\" which is a streaming box and not a stick, sold from 2015 to 2022, which doesn&#x27;t help the confusion in the naming. reply EricE 14 hours agorootparentprevyou can still stream stuff - just use something else and just leverage it as a cheap display.Unless it won&#x27;t work if not connected to the internet (wouldn&#x27;t put it past them).I bought my Xbox mainly because it was the best&#x2F;cheapest option for a 4K bluray player. I think I&#x27;ve loaded a game on it a handful of times at best, but watched lots of movies and other content with it. Thanks gamers for subsidizing a great BR player! reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentThe key is to verify that the TV will return to just showing \"HDMI 1\" or whatever after power off.Because the smart TVs have a history of returning to whatever ads they want to show after power on. reply vladvasiliu 14 hours agorootparentMy particular TV, if it&#x27;s never been connected to the internet, will not show any ads. It will show a notification that it isn&#x27;t connected to the internet when you turn it on, but it will work fine otherwise. It&#x27;ll even switch to the correct video input if you power it on through that port, say through a firetv stick. Otherwise, there&#x27;s a setting for power on behaviour: 1. go to home screen 2. Go to last used input. reply buildbot 14 hours agorootparentEven better, if you can avoid accepting the ToS for the apps, they don&#x27;t even start.

The TV never gets network access of course :) replyvladvasiliu 14 hours agorootparentprevThe FireTV is not an actual television set.

It&#x27;s like the people that complain about a Macbook being 20% more (or whatever), buying a PC-something, and then coming back complaining that Windows is loaded with ads or Linux has all kinds of issues on it.I&#x27;m with you - I went from being a die-hard Linux desktop, Kodi, Android, etc, etc user to just saying \"the hell with it\" and plunking down for Apple products.They&#x27;re expensive and they&#x27;re not perfect either but my life is much less stressing and annoying as a result. reply mholm 14 hours agorootparentAdditionally, if you&#x27;re willing to resell when you&#x27;re done with them, you can often get that &#x27;Apple tax&#x27; back on the resale price difference. reply graphe 12 hours agorootparentprevApple works unless you need something specific that every other devices supports but apple doesn&#x27;t.I&#x27;ve never had a great experience with any laptop but at least I can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t get screwed on the price most of the time (non apple times). Who remembers how apple didn&#x27;t admit or fix the Nvidia GPU on their laptop for years but it was easy to just get a new ipod? reply kkielhofner 10 hours agorootparentI’m not going to universally defend Apple (because no one can) but when you have to go back 10 years to come up with an example that as other commenters have noted was a supplier issue it’s not as strong an argument as you may think. reply graphe 10 hours agorootparentIt was my last relationship with a new Mac, and it will remain that way. Why you want to attack my experience I&#x27;m uncertain. reply stalfosknight 11 hours agorootparentprevThat nVidia GPU issue was a design flaw on nVidia&#x27;s part that nVidia refused to take responsibility for.The problem is that normal use and wear and tear over time would lead to the GPU physically failing, leading to a non-bootable system and necessitating a whole new logic board.Apple had a long standing special service program of covering (very expensive) logic board replacements for all of those MacBook Pros that were usually well out of of warranty¹ because Apple gave a damn about making it right whereas nVidia refused to even acknowledge the issue.Source: I was a Mac Genius at an Apple Store from 2008 to 2013.1) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;apple-ends-2011-macbook... reply graphe 10 hours agorootparentApple was supposed to vet them.

For example, Apple M1 8 Core score on cpubenchmark is about 14000. If you look for non-Apple laptops with equivalent CPU score, they would cost around $450. And they support Linux.The only good thing in Macbook is display, which covers more than 100% of sRGB color space and has giantic resolution. I wish it could be bought separately and installed into a normal laptop. reply kkielhofner 13 hours agorootparentArtificial benchmarks are interesting but as another personal anecdote, I bought a maxed-out Framework for over $3000 a couple of years ago when I was still Linux desktop oriented. Way more RAM, storage, faster on benchmarks than anything Apple at the time.It was the worst machine I&#x27;ve ever had. One day after doing yet another plug-unplug-reboot-wtf dance to get a display to work (that just worked the day before) I threw my hands up, went to Best Buy and bought some random basic Macbook Pro for $1200 (lower specs, of course). I don&#x27;t know what the specs or benchmarks look like, I don&#x27;t care. I just need a tool to do my work.What I do know is that it runs for at least weeks at a time, does absolutely everything I need it to do, and I never feel like I&#x27;m waiting for it. Plug&#x2F;unplug displays, thunderbolt docks, open&#x2F;close the lid, don&#x27;t charge it for days at time. Just runs along - cool and silent. I open it, get my work done, close it. Day after day.I absolutely guarantee that even if this Macbook was $6000 I&#x27;m way ahead in terms of productivity not to mention stress and frustration - which I value very, very highly.It&#x27;s been \"Ohhh, this is NICE\" experiences like this that have chipped away at my previous thinking and pulled me further and further towards Apple. Still not perfect (of course) but the time I spend fixing my tools vs being productive isn&#x27;t even close.I&#x27;m probably just getting old and cranky but I have very little patience for BS at this point in my life.

There exist other laptops with better displays, faster CPUs, better speakers, or just cheaper, but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are no alternatives with better or equal everything. reply Longlius 12 hours agorootparentMy experience buying laptops in 2023 was that most of what I found was cheap junk. Even when I was buying stuff in the $1800-$2500 price range, it was mostly junk with build quality problems, incomplete support for the hardware (USB-C especially being an issue), and terrible thermals.I don&#x27;t really like Apple as a company but I just hand them money and they give me a laptop that works without any nonsense. Maybe I&#x27;m just too old and overpaid nowadays but I legitimately feel like laptop manufacturers other than Apple are in a self-destructive race-to-the-bottom with each other. reply jdminhbg 13 hours agorootparentprev> If you look for non-Apple laptops with equivalent CPU score, they would cost around $450.

Maybe they could include little cameras, so they could keep an eye out for any Amazon products in their house. This would help achieve Amazon’s apparent goal of advertising things I’ve already bought from them to me.Or, they could just include a little cellphone radio. Probably only need to phone home once every couple months to get the new ads.And remember: hard drive space is cheap nowadays. You might not ever connect your TV to the internet, but it can at least record fingerprints for everything you watch.

They are basically just running android, right? reply mdasen 14 hours agoparentYes and no. People have figured out how to unlock the boot loader of some Fire TV devices, but it can sometimes involve opening up the device and making physical modifications (like shorting something on the motherboard) or having an older version of the Fire TV OS installed (it depends on the device).So yes, you can put an alternative ROM on some of these things, but I think the practicality of it isn&#x27;t really there. I would just say \"no\", but someone will link to an XDA post showing how you can (at least on some Fire TV devices) through a really complicated setup that even a lot of people on HN wouldn&#x27;t get though.If you actually want a custom rom, it&#x27;s better to get something like an Nvidia Shield where you can just unlock the boot loader. The problem with the Nvidia Shield is that it isn&#x27;t cheap like the Fire TV devices. It&#x27;s priced more expensive than an Apple TV with less capable hardware ($130 gets you an Apple TV 4K with A15 processor getting 2,100 single-core and 5,100 multi-core, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage; $150 gets you a Tegra X1+ with 300 single-core, 800 multi-core, 2GB of RAM, and 8GB storage).When a company&#x27;s business model (like the Fire TV) is selling you cheap hardware and then pumping you full of ads, they often don&#x27;t make it easy to avoid that. reply CoastalCoder 14 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s a practical way to replace the offending electronics.I.e., retain the device&#x27;s panel, panel driver, chasis, speakers&#x2F;amplifier, IR receiver, and perhaps power supply.But replace the computing hardware with something more open?I guess I have no idea how much custom firmware is needed to really get the most out of such devices.

    "originBody": "Ferrocene A Rust compiler toolchain for safety- and mission-critical environments. Details Do you need help with coding? Get in touch Get updates It’s official: Ferrocene is ISO 26262 and IEC 61508 qualified! You can even find the certificate in TÜV SÜDs certificate database. This means we achieved qualification for the open source Ferrocene toolchain. Ferrocene 23.06.0, based on Rust 1.68, is now fully usable in safety critical environments. Early last month, Ferrocene’s source code was open sourced on GitHub. After going through a couple rounds of dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s, TÜV SÜD officially sent over the certification on Monday October 29. This is the first qualification of a Rust compiler. With these qualifications, Rust can now be used to develop software for electronic systems in series production road vehicles. We’ve qualified Ferrocene for use in systems up to ASIL D – the highest classification of initial hazard as defined by this standard. This standard provides automakers with guidelines that make the software being used to develop, produce, operate and service the automotive sectors safe to use. Beyond the automotive, Ferrocene can also be used in electronic programmable systems in the industrial sector. Here the focus is on developing products or applications that carry out safety functions. Like the automotive certification, we’ve also gone for the highest level of risk reduction and qualified it at SIL4. “Ferrocene is a major achievement both for Rust and safety in automotive,” says Florian. “It shows that Rust software can be used in all critical environments. The process was challenging but matched what we’ve come to expect from Rust: It enables building correct software at a much lower cost.” With this step, we can start rolling out the sales process on Ferrocene. Our initial availability is limited to a minimum order of 10 license seats for 12 months, starting at €2.400,00 (€240 each) for the quality managed licenses. We’ve also got an overview of the reasons for Ferrocene on our YouTube channel: And if your organization is interested in purchasing licenses, then reach out to us. We’ll be rolling out an individual purchase option at €25 per seat per month or €240 per seat per year in early 2024.",

Even if it wasn&#x27;t for the advantages that Rust brings to the table the possibility to use a modern toolchain would be revolutionary. At the same time this is the biggest risk for adoption because these legacy systems are deeply ingrained and intertwined with existing processes that often span multiple tiers of suppliers and will be hard to change. reply tialaramex 17 hours agoparent> From my understanding that means that now Rust can be used for the development of security critical software in automotive.It has always been possible to do whatever you wanted in this respect, Ferrocene means that you don&#x27;t have to go to more trouble than a competitor who does their software development in a similarly qualified C++ software suite.Rather than pay some number of people to explain why it&#x27;s OK that you didn&#x27;t do the boring normal thing, you can pay Ferrocene for their paperwork which says actually Rust is just one of the boring normal things.Is \"Boring normal thing\" good enough? Well, on its own I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not even close, but pragmatism rules the day, people writing firmware which is in pretty old cars were knocking it together in C with no rules, and most people didn&#x27;t die, so, that&#x27;s our baseline, that was apparently OK, logically a bit of that won&#x27;t be a disaster... right?It reminds me of GRAS rules. On the one hand, there&#x27;s no particular reason to just assume parsnips are OK food while this random thing my chemists just invented is not - after all parsnips may be \"natural\" but so are all nightshades and some of them are straight up poison (and indeed the rest of Apiaceae, the family parsnips are in, are sometimes poisonous) - however on the other hand a lot of people have eaten parsnips already and they seemed fine, so, maybe that&#x27;s enough reason to require tests for my chemical but not parsnips ? Or at least, lets not require the tests before continuing to eat parsnips. reply weinzierl 16 hours agorootparent\"It has always been possible to do whatever you wanted [..]\"That is not quite what I meant. You can always do what you want if you are prepared to accept the consequences.German law requires the manufacturer of a technical product to take all measures objectively necessary and reasonable in order to avoid danger and harm.

One of them is legal compliance.\"From my understanding that means that now Rust can be used for the development of security critical software in automotive.\"What I meant here is that I&#x27;m not sure if what exists today (including Ferrocene&#x27;s certified toolchain) is enough to make Rust happen in safety critical automotive applications. I simply do not know enough to make that claim. reply Xylakant 16 hours agorootparent> In automotive safety critical systems ISO 26262 is a legally well established, necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) prerequisite for that.That is true, but an ISO 26262 qualified toolchain is neither sufficient nor required to achieve certification. It certainly helps when the auditor looks at your project, but you can also opt for other measures. So you could build ISO 26262 certified software in rust even before the Ferrocene qualification, and you still can build it using stock rustc, but it&#x27;s more work. Few people will do that and rather opt for a qualified toolchain.> What I meant here is that I&#x27;m not sure if what exists today (including Ferrocene&#x27;s certified toolchain) is enough to make Rust happen in safety critical automotive applications.It&#x27;s one of the foundational pieces, but others are qualified libraries and the entire ecosystem. So the adoption will by necessity still take time. We do have a few exciting things in the pipeline there, but that&#x27;s news for another day (it&#x27;s christmas soon, not all presents at once) reply weinzierl 16 hours agorootparentVery true. I&#x27;m coming from the supplier side and in the world I know the required ASIL level is a box we have to tick, no realistic way around it. That includes using a certified compiler. Probably that is not universally true but in my bubble for all intents and purposes a certified compiler was a hard requirement. This is in no way a contradiction to what you wrote but underlines why I think a Rust compiler that is not in the way for me ticking the ASIL D box is a big thing. reply DoingIsLearning 15 hours agoparentprev> Rust can be used for the development of security critical software in automotive.Perhaps you are native of a latin language?In the context of ISO26262, ASIL levels relate to the criticality of _safety_ not security.My house&#x27;s security will determine how easily someone can break in.My house&#x27;s safety will determine how well it will survive a hurricane. reply weinzierl 14 hours agorootparentOh yes, you are right, in my mother tongue safety and security are the same word. It is still embarrassing, I should have been more careful. reply chromatin 13 hours agorootparentWait -- I find this fascinating.They are also kind-of the same word(s) in German (Sicherheit &#x2F; Sicherung).Do native German speakers draw much distinction between Sicherheit and Sicherung, and to the same degree that we do in English?If no, I am curious how the differentiation in concepts developed in English developed and whether it is also present in other Germanic languages. reply Megranium 13 hours agorootparentHmm in German you could also say \"Betriebssicherheit\" (safety) vs. \"Angriffssicherheit\" (security), or at least that always was the translation that made most sense to me personally.I&#x27;d say native speakers of German distinguish it but it depends on the context ... talking about computers, it&#x27;s typically more about security, while when talking about construction sites, it&#x27;s typically more about safety. reply M3t0r 11 hours agorootparentBut they are both \"Sicherheit\" since in compound words the main word is the last word. You could say \"Ist dein Haus sicher?\" and mean \"is your house secure\" if a burglar is targeting your neighbourhood or \"is your house safe\" if a storm is passing over it. You can distinguish both cases with context or compound words, but it&#x27;s not generally done. reply weinzierl 1 hour agorootparentAs native German speaker I would like to second that.

At least you&#x27;ve learnt something interesting. reply pjmlp 20 hours agoparentprevWhile it is great that Rust is now also an option, some of those places still stuck in C89 and C++98, are hardly to going upgrade to anything else.Some times not even the tooling is an excuse, as most chip vendors do at least support C11 and C++14 in most cases. reply Xylakant 19 hours agorootparentDisclaimer: I&#x27;m one of the founders of Ferrous SystemsTo some extend I agree, but from our conversations with OEMs, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers we do see a significant interest in moving to rust, much more than moving to a new C&#x2F;C++ version.The reasoning is that moving to a new C&#x2F;C++ version is an incremental change, but moving to rust signifies a jump to a different tech level (let&#x27;s set aside whether that&#x27;s true on a technical level or not, I&#x27;m talking about perception). One of the signifiers is that we were able to qualify the rust language as it exists, with no such restrictions such as Misra C etc. So no \"reduce use of pointers\" etc.The other things that&#x27;s helping is regulatory pressure. The CISA, DARPA etc are all advocating strongly in favor of moving to memory safe languages, and for the chunk of the market that used C&#x2F;C++ before, rust is a pretty good offering there: It binds to C both ways, that means not only can you call C code from rust, but also the other way round - you can build a component in rust and integrate it in your existing firmware. That&#x27;s a rare capability.Chipset and ecosystem support are IMO the biggest hurdles at the moment, but with Ferrocene as a qualified compiler, at least that one bar is removed. It&#x27;s still a long way to go and a lot of work ahead of us :). reply pjmlp 19 hours agorootparentI see human behavior a more problematic issue to overcome than the toolchains, hence why I mentioned the toolings being more modern than what many are willing to adopt.Looking forward to regulatory pressure to help improving the situation, not only regarding the adoption of modern safer languages, but also to \"just\" adopt modern practices and tools while coding in C and C++.Already changing the mentality from unsafe at any speed, to quality matters, would be a big improvement.A plus from safer languages that aren&#x27;t copy-paste compatible with C, is that C style programming is already taken out, so we don&#x27;t need to spend time creating SonarQube rules and forcing them into teams.Good luck with the Ferrocene effort. reply Xylakant 19 hours agorootparent> I see human behavior a more problematic issue to overcome than the toolchains, hence why I mentioned the toolings being more modern than what many are willing to adopt.I absolutely agree. I agree that this is what&#x27;s holding back adoption of new tooling the most. However, the impression that I get from our conversations is that a new C&#x2F;C++ is seen as \"more of the old thing\" while rust is considered a break with the old thing, something new with substantial risk, but also substantial upsides. This perception helps when it comes to considering an adoption. reply cryptonector 12 hours agorootparentWe need an industry-wide break with the old thing. There have been enough problems caused by crappy unmaintainable spaghetti code full of UB. Now, a new thing (Rust) doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll get better code in every way, but at least in some ways. reply rdsubhas 11 hours agorootparentprevTo be frank, this seems to be a general comment on rust as a language itself, than ferrocene.One would instead start from an observation that rust has been filling a real need&#x2F;gap in the market which can&#x27;t be explained merely by human behavior alone, and looks like it&#x27;s been quite successful at doing that. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentYes and?That is a challenge, that Ferrocene alongside plenty of other companies, including those that tried to push C++ as a safer C, have to deal with.There have been safer languages on that domain, like Ada, which for various reasons did not take off as expected, and it wasn&#x27;t only due to compiler prices.Dealing with human psicology from folks that aren&#x27;t even willing to update themselves beyond the toolchains used 30 years ago even though more recent ones are available, it is a challenge, moreso when the newcomers need a full rewrite, instead of updating the compiler version.I am on the Ferrocene side, just like I enjoy the surviving 7 Ada vendors are still around, PTC, Aicas and microEJ keep selling their Real Time Java, or that Astrobe its Oberon compiler, MIKROE their mikroBasic and mikroPascal compilers.The more that challege the status quo, the better. replyzozbot234 19 hours agoparentprev> From my understanding that means that now Rust can be used for the development of security critical software in automotive.What about other safety critical domains such as aerospace, medical, railways, machinery, process control etc? It seems like each of these has its own bespoke standards, so Ferrous will need to seek certification for these separately? reply twic 18 hours agorootparentAs the article says:> Beyond the automotive, Ferrocene can also be used in electronic programmable systems in the industrial sector. Here the focus is on developing products or applications that carry out safety functions. Like the automotive certification, we’ve also gone for the highest level of risk reduction and qualified it at SIL4.Apparently [1] the SIL standard is used in at least the process control, nuclear, mechanical, and railway industries.

And security fixes wedged into old code. That is in effect forking the language. reply sheepshear 13 hours agorootparentThe direct competition between Ferrocene and AdaCore should take care of that.In any case, the compiler wouldn&#x27;t be certified if they didn&#x27;t vet the new features. These companies can&#x27;t control what gets added to the language, and it might take longer than a year to vet future changes.Their statement is an upfront, no-bull fyi about how reality works. I highly doubt it&#x27;s a statement of intent to stagnate. It would kind of defeat the purpose of switching away from a stagnated language and ecosystem. reply galangalalgol 12 hours agorootparentI can imagine no use case where ripping out features from upstream reduces risk vs adding it. I agree it makes no sense to stagnate, but I am familiar with the certified compiler space, and what I have described is exactly what I have witnessed. Compilers that are based on ancient versions of open source compilers, and have code incorporated from various point releases since then to minimize the amount of recertification necessary. reply sheepshear 10 hours agorootparentWhat happens when a new feature holds up the certification process for some reason? There are only two possible options, and they both suck:1. Stay on the last certified version until everything is certified.2. Incorporate the parts that can be certified. reply galangalalgol 10 hours agorootparentThe ferrous option appears to be 3. upstream changes that make certification of the new feature easier and then proceed. reply sheepshear 8 hours agorootparentIf that&#x27;s still an option, then they haven&#x27;t reached the point yet where they have to choose.They&#x27;re promising yearly updates. I&#x27;m asking what happens when a new upstream feature has already gone uncertified for one full year. Either they blow past the deadline and release nothing for over a year, or they ship what&#x27;s currently available.There&#x27;s no third option. Ferrous doesn&#x27;t have a time machine, and AdaCore is just explicitly saying that they&#x27;ll give you what they have at least once a year. replythesuperbigfrog 13 hours agorootparentprev>> That is in effect forking the language.It feels like the effectiveness and success of Rust could make that happen.Different industries have different needs and will want the language to meet their needs.Rust needs more funding, labor, and organization to create an official language standard to prevent it from fragmenting. reply galangalalgol 12 hours agorootparentFerrous created a language specification. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ferrocene&#x2F;specificationThey do say any differences between it and upstream behavior or documentation is a defect in the spec, not upstream.

Mostly system integration - for example things like interlocks and whether a valve will fail open&#x2F;closed etc.In one instance we wanted to use a FLIR camera to measure temperature as part of a control loop - had to provide guarantees about the cameras reliability (i.e. mean time between failure), have redundancy and fallbacks in place etc. In order to satisfy the SIL process. reply dwroberts 19 hours agoprevI was expecting it to be locked to quite an old rust, just because of how difficult&#x2F;slow it is to get this kind of accreditation, but it&#x27;s 1.68 which is not bad at all (latest stable is 1.73) reply faitswulff 18 hours agoparentCan any of the Ferrocene folks here can talk about what the release cadence for officially qualified Rust toolchains might be? reply Xylakant 17 hours agorootparentA lot of the timeline depends on the partner we&#x27;re working with to achieve qualification. Initial qualification definitely takes longer, but we&#x27;re having discussions on how we can cut down on the manual part of the certification. We do for example pull in all releases of the compiler, including nightly, and build them using our CI and test sytems. The versions that pass are made available to our customers, so they can follow the release cycle - though these are obviously not qualified and nightly comes with the usual nightly (lack of) stability guarantees.I obviously can&#x27;t make any promises here, but we aim to pick two of those rust versions per year and then certify them - how long that takes depends on the feedback we get from the auditor and on their availability. The exact cadence will need a little shakedown - no one has experience in qualifying rust compilers continously :) reply bonzini 14 hours agorootparentAccording to (second-hand) experience with auditors with respect to open source, they were quite open to considering things like CI, good commit messages etc. are useful when evaluating the development process, and even considered them sufficient (with adequate explanation) towards some of the ISO26262 requirements. However, that was for ASIL B only. reply Argorak 14 hours agorootparentThat matches our experience. They were super pragmatic. Also, their feedback was tough, but always technically grounded and from the perspective of \"is the user always well informed?\". reply the_duke 15 hours agorootparentprevSide question:Is your pricing in line with the norms in this sector? It seems really cheap to me. reply Argorak 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s certainly an unusual pricing style, but people grok it and appreciate it. Also, note that this is for the \"quality managed\" version - additional support and documents that I sign off for safety (so enter a liability) are more expensive.But on the other side, there&#x27;s so many that would buy if it were more accessible. reply AlotOfReading 15 hours agorootparentprevFrom past experience, other companies in this space typically charge 1-2 orders of magnitude more per seat.Their products are also usually worse than the free&#x2F;OSS options that don&#x27;t come with certification paperwork. reply whizzter 13 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re a new entry into the space and with something as \"groundbreaking\" as Rust their idea is probably to push for better&#x2F;cheaper up until there is enough seats that they can start charging more once people have invested enough to not want(or be able) to change toolchains.At that point they not only have locked in customers, they also have them as references for other customers to justify why new customers should pay more (Existing customers will probably be the ones paying least for the longest). reply Xylakant 12 hours agorootparentI’m happy to outline our general reasoning of how we arrived at the pricing, though I’ll obviously not go into specifics.First of all, our competition is the open source rust compiler. Current Ferrocene is a downstream of rust 1.68 and a drop in replacement, so you can develop your project using the open source rust compiler and at the point where certification is required switch. You obviously won’t get support, but the safety manuals and all the certification documentation is open source. The compiler source is also open source, so you can build from our source.So our offering is essentially the quality management and handling of all the minutiae required to use a compiler in a corporate environment, including LTS support when required, signed installers, management of known issues, certifications, etc.We could ask for prices an order of magnitude higher if we kept all the documentation closed, but that would mean our customer base is the people that require certification now. We’d rather have a reasonable price point and charge for the work we save the user - which puts a reasonable upper bound on the per seat price. Also, that ship has sailed - as I said, all accompanying documentation is open, which also keeps us honest. reply hobofan 12 hours agorootparentprev> until there is enough seats that they can start charging more once people have invested enough to not want(or be able) to change toolchainsI can understand how one could have that impression about generic suppliers in the field.

They&#x27;re not making major modifications to upstream, but they are crossing the Ts and dotting the Is to satisfy the that their compiler meets all the safety requirements set forth in those standards.As far as why use their compiler vs upstream? It&#x27;s similar to why you might use a managed database vs deploying your own in a $5 droplet; in a big corporate environment, you have no trouble paying for things that would be hard to do yourself, and satisfying regulators is one of those things.All at a very reasonable price point, too! reply tecleandor 20 hours agorootparentI mean, I was thinking more like:What&#x27;s the merits that allow the certification? Is it technical? Is it bureaucracy and \"just\" certifications?I&#x27;ve been on the healthcare business so I&#x27;ve seen how that works when doing FDA or CE certifications. reply Xylakant 19 hours agorootparentDisclaimer: I&#x27;m one of the founders of Ferrous Systems.Ferrocene as a compiler is not inherently more suitable for safety critical applications than stock rustc as distributed by the rust project. It is for all intents and purposes the rust projects compiler, with all the certification paperwork - that&#x27;s quite a stack of paper if you include all of it, but it doesn&#x27;t change any of the functionality.However, on a support&#x2F;organizational level, there are quite a few differences. We run our own CI for all of our supported targets which allows us to provide different QA levels than the rust project does or even could support.We do provide higher levels of assurance on some targets compared to upstream. For example, the aarch64-unknown-none target is treated as \"tier 2\" by the Rust project, meaning they don&#x27;t run any tests for it. Instead, Ferrocene treats it as fully supported, and we ensure all tests pass on it when we merge any change (contributing back fixes when something breaks).We can also provide support for targets that are not in the rust projects tree, or even require legal paperwork for access to test hardware etc., to the point that we can provide binary only targets that cannot be made available via the rust project.On a support level, we also provide support for existing rust version, to the point of long term support for certified versions (2 years by default, more or less infinite with a separate support contract).There&#x27;s also minor things that are interesting to organizations: Notification of known issues, signed installers, ...All of these things do not change the compilers behavior, but can be quite essential for organizations with long term, safety critical projects. reply tecleandor 19 hours agorootparentAaaaaah OK. So it&#x27;s a bit more like a certified distribution. Sounds similar to how we handled FDA&#x2F;CE certified versions of Open Source software.Thanks for the clarification, it&#x27;s very useful! reply weinzierl 13 hours agorootparentprevIs there a list with supported targets? Do you focus on ARM or are there other targets common in automotive, for example Power Architecture like the NXP MPC series? reply Xylakant 11 hours agorootparentDepends on what you mean with „supported“ - the qualification is at the moment for ARMv8-A bare metal (aarch64), see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public-docs.ferrocene.dev&#x2F;main&#x2F;qualification&#x2F;report&#x2F;..., mostly because that‘s what our initial customer intends to use.We have other targets on the roadmap and can implement&#x2F;qualify targets on request, so if you‘re interested in a specific target, we‘d be happy to talk. reply avgcorrection 15 hours agorootparentprev> What&#x27;s the merits that allow the certification? Is it technical? Is it bureaucracy and \"just\" certifications?What’s the technical difference between bureaucracy and technical merit in this context? Two compilers with equal source: (1) is rubber-stamped (audited or whatever by humans) while (2) is not.This is based on rustc(1) so a priori I wouldn’t expect much technical difference (other than perhaps the Ferrocene fork lagging behind a bit). reply Xylakant 11 hours agorootparentYou are correct, the technical differences are negligible for most intents and purposes.However, the certification covers not only the source that was used to build, but rather the entire process to produce the binary for the source, that is our (Ferrous Systems) organization, our processes, the review process to ensure that requirements match the tests, the CI, the quality management, how we handle new issues (for example reporting to customers) … So even if you’d build the Ferrocene compiler from the available Ferrocene source, this would not give you a qualified compiler - because it’s not been built by our standards.So to a large extend, the qualification does not produce better software, it „just“ documents that a certain quality baseline is fulfilled. But, as part of the qualification process we test the qualified targets to a higher standard than the rust project itself - the aarch64-unknown-none target is a tier 2 target for the rust project, it’s built as part of the compiler release but not tested. It‘s our qualification target so for us it’s tier 1. And indeed, we did discover issues as part of the certification effort, so ticking the boxes to fulfill that baseline did indeed improve the rust compiler. We wrote a little about the things that came out of the certification process in an earlier blog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferrous-systems.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ferrocene-improves-rust... reply Vespasian 20 hours agoparentprevCertification is super important in many industries like automotive.Your customers will do audits and send people to cover their own asses and stay in legal complience. Now a venturing software developer (or teamlead) can go to their bosses and ask them to use this new fangled rust technology for a small test project.It can be sold as a chance to innovate without compromising on customer requirements&#x2F;safety. After all it&#x27;s offically certified to some standard and the responsible manager can check that off their list. reply HankB99 19 hours agorootparentI was really hoping that certification involved some kind of testing to insure that the compiler always produces correct code, though I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s even possible. \"Always\" covers a lot of ground.It sounds like it&#x27;s more a \"cover your ass\" kind of thing. Is there any part of the certification that involves behavior of the tool? reply Xylakant 19 hours agorootparentDisclaimer: I&#x27;m one of the founders of Ferrous Systems> I was really hoping that certification involved some kind of testing to insure that the compiler always produces correct code, though I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s even possible.This is not what certification does or even aims to achieve. To boil it down in very few (grossly simplifying) words, certification provides a process framework that ensures that defects found are handled and adressed. No compiler is perfect and none will ever be, but the goal is to document the behavior of the compiler (which we did by boiling down all of the RFCs into the ferrocene language spec https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spec.ferrocene.dev&#x2F;index.html), ensure that all of these requirements have associated tests and document that association and then document where the compiler misbehaves, as well as ways to detect and avoid that misbehavior.If misbehavior is found in a future rust version, our task is to identify which of the certified version(s) are affected and notify our customers on how to handle the issue. Handling the issue does not always require a patch to fix it, it can also be handled by providing a suitable tool to detect it (a lint, binary checker, ...) and associated documentation on how to adress it in the customers code.> Is there any part of the certification that involves behavior of the tool?The spec, plus the associated safety manual. reply baq 18 hours agorootparentYou weren&#x27;t joking about the height of the stack of paper in another comment. reply Xylakant 17 hours agorootparentNo, not at all. reply HankB99 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks for explaining that. replylinuxlizard 19 hours agoprevI&#x27;m very excited about this.

The boxes to tick are of the kind \"do you have your requirements written down?\" (\"will someone later know what this thing does?\").So, we do have to tick boxes, but we&#x27;re free to pick on how to tick boxes :). What TÜV now certified is that our box-ticking process is fine.I have absolutely no problem with framing this as box-ticking in some way, but that box-ticking has _meaning_. However, on an existing tool, that means you write the spec (spec.ferrocene.dev) and check if everything has a test implemented. Yep, that&#x27;s an amount of pretty dumb and repetitive work. And pretty often, on widely-used software, for the happy path, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s rather bug-free. So, yes, you tick the box, but you now know that this is in order.In other cases and on less popular platforms, we frequently find issues like e.g. changes in code size between versions (which could hint to a bug). And it&#x27;s not just super-niche targets, the last version had a size regression on certain arm targets.Details on some of the fixes over the last years can be found here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferrous-systems.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-ferrocene-improves-rust.... We find a lot of things in corners and better ways to improve the Rust compiler.As we&#x27;re a downstream to Rust, we&#x27;re actually incentivised to push changes upstream with preference, so yes, we contribute to the general quality of the Rust compiler (also of older versions) and with that to bug-free-ness of the resulting software.So, we&#x27;re over here, ticking boxes, informing parties when one box doesn&#x27;t tick. reply dgacmu 18 hours agoparentprevThe biggest practical impact is probably from having the CI tests running on the certified platforms that were not already tier one for rust. reply KwanEsq 14 hours agoprevIf someone from Ferrous sees this, I&#x27;d advise putting the price in English punctuation when writing the article in English.

Scientists have warned of a “scary” surge in methane emissions in the past two decades, posing a major threat to efforts to contain dangerous global heating. The new satellite data, gathered by Kayrros, a French climate technology company, shows that methane is being leaked at a far higher rate from sites in Texas compared with neighboring New Mexico. Despite increasing its own oil production in recent years, New Mexico has no site with repeated methane leaks, unlike in Texas, which Kayrros said is likely due to a 2021 state law aimed at curtailing methane emissions from industry. “The effect that methane has on the global climate is devastating,” said Antoine Rostand, chief executive of Kayrros. “Good operators will re-inject the gas while others will vent it, which means it’s very easy to eliminate leaks of methane that would have a massive impact upon the climate.” Rostand said the difference between visible leaks in Texas and New Mexico is “huge” and should spur governments in the US and other countries to crack down on this pollution. “It seems the regulation in New Mexico has had an impact without hurting business,” he said. “It’s a message of hope because it shows that if you have regulation it works. Governments need to take up their responsibilities with this.” Methane is emitted from various activities, such as from the raising of livestock, but oil and gas production is the biggest source of the pollutant in the US and emissions have surged amid a frenzy of new drilling, some of it for fossil fuels to be exported overseas. Texas, despite being at the epicenter of the oil industry, has scant measures to prevent companies from dumping their unwanted methane into the shared atmosphere. It is “really frustrating that Texas continues to allow oil and gas companies to pollute with impunity when we’ve got a great solution staring us in the eye”, said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “Unfortunately it’s clear that Texas is not going to stand up to big oil and adopt sensible standards to cut methane.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Kayrros Environmentalists have pinned their hopes, therefore, on the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is finalizing a new federal rule for new and existing drilling sites that it says will slash methane emissions from these sources by 87% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. The regulation is expected to be unveiled later this month. The oil and gas industry, and its political allies, have complained that new regulations would be too onerous and risk pushing up fuel costs. “The current administration has made its intentions clear – it is determined to target our flourishing oil and gas sector, despite its substantial progress in reducing methane emissions, irrespective of how it might impact American energy security, reliability, and consumer cost,” Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat and coal company owner, wrote to the EPA leadership recently. But Rostand said that governments, set to gather at the Cop28 United Nations climate talks later this month, need to deliver quick and rapid cuts in methane if the world, on track to experience its hottest year ever recorded, is to act on the climate crisis. “Cutting methane would have the same benefit to the climate as removing all cars and trucks from the road,” he said. “This really should be the ‘Cop of methane’. If the US and Europe, which is the largest importer of natural gas, act, then it will just be the best possible news for the climate.” Explore more on these topics Texas Oil Gas Fossil fuels Energy New Mexico Reuse this content",

Old wells are more likely to leak, as shown in the link below, are often never checked on, and were often drilled and shut-in when there was a lot less regulation. They can be venting directly to atmosphere, and since natural gas is naturally odorless and wells are often in remote locations, the potential for them to leak a lot of gas for a long time is high.Texas has a lot more historical production of oil and gas, which should result in a lot more old and abandoned wells.

I used to be a PM for well abandonment.Minimum cost would be in the $80k-100k range. Double or triple that if you run into any issues.

Yes even in Texas. It&#x27;s not the full costs, in practice, and ownership often gets tricky, but there are regulations to the effect. You have to put up a bond to operate oil and gas wells in TX and many other cases. That bond is seized and supposedly used to properly plug and abandon wells if you fail to do so, but it&#x27;s not always sufficient.Also, old infrastructure is really old. It&#x27;s not things from 20 years ago. It&#x27;s 50-100 years ago. The law requiring escrow or insurance (it has some holes) dates from the 70&#x27;s.Finally, it often isn&#x27;t done properly. Either way, there are a ton of improperly plugged and abandoned wells and other leaky infrastructure that goes undetected.The regulations you&#x27;re describing have existed for a long time, but that&#x27;s not enough to fix the full issue. reply Bluecobra 5 hours agorootparentThanks for the informative reply.

Pipelines are booked solid and and 1-2 new ones are being commissioned yearly (google search for &#x27;Permian natural gas pipeline projects&#x27;).Oil&#x2F;gas companies generally never want to straight up vent (i.e. release directly into the atmosphere) natural gas. It gives no economic value. However, natural gas production is an inevitable byproduct of oil production, especially in the Permian basin shale plays, which can lead to either having to shut-in your oil well, or flare, or vent.I work for an oil&#x2F;gas company that operates in the Permian. Our wells range from ~3000 standard cubic feet per barrel of oil to 10000. Some of our bigger wells produce >1000 barrels of oil per day, which corresponds to 3-10 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. We do not vent unless an emergency situation arises. Even for pigging and other procedures (blow downs, etc.), we capture the natural gas. We do flare if needed, but that is limited. Small amounts of gas gather at the top of oil tanks and rather than risk an explosion (due to lightning and other unpredictable things like that), the small amount of gas is flared. The state of TX has flare limits per day and per month on both a pad and well level.We have also electrified a very large portion of our operations, reducing the amount of natural gas burned to generate electricity (this happens all over the basin). All of our large gathering facilities but one are electric powered. This can be a challenge with gas compressors, which have traditionally been gas powered. Gas compressors are commonly in the 1500-3000 horsepower range each, and there are 4-12 per facility. That&#x27;s a lot of electricity. One facility does have a gas generator powered component, which can be used to kick-start other facilities to get things going again in case of a major, multi-facility shutdown.Long story short - gas doesn&#x27;t have a ton of value in the Permian basin. In decreasing order of preference, operators will want to 1) sell gas, 2) use it to run gas compressors or generators, 3) flare it, or 4) vent it.Some enterprising people have constructed trailers with natural gas generators powering bitcoin miners. This option can be appealing to operators who would otherwise be flaring&#x2F;venting the natural gas. Not sure of the contract commercial terms but presumably it benefits both parties. Straight up burning methane is the same whether it is via flare or generator. Both are better than venting due to the increased greenhouse gas potential of methane vs CO2. reply anonporridge 14 hours agoparent> Straight up burning methane is the same whether it is via flare or generator.This isn&#x27;t correct. Flaring can be fairly inefficient. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;oil-industry-flaring...Even if you can make flaring more efficient, you&#x27;re going to need a fairly hard stick to keep oil producers in line because flaring efficiently is a pure cost. On the other hand, running it through a generator presumably earns money, so is a carrot that businesses can pursue.The big stick approach might work fine in the US with a strong handed state, but methane emissions are a global problem, and most poor oil producers in regions with no big stick may not even bother flaring at all and just vent, whereas they might pursue more money. reply auspiv 14 hours agorootparentInteresting, I was not aware of the 91% vs 98% flaring vs combustion efficiency.

Cheap gas would mean venting or flaring are the least expensive option in more situations. reply Ographer 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re exactly right. I used to be a production engineer for an O&G company and new wells were usually ready to begin producing oil before the gas pipeline company had finished construction of the pipeline or the compressor station to operate it.Because of the time-value of money, they want to produce the oil ASAP so that they can reinvest the proceeds to drill new wells. This meant that we had to flare gas the maximum legal amount every day for months until the pipelines were completed. I had to keep track of how much we flared and tell them to shut the well in if we were getting close to the legal limit.Oil companies will ALWAYS pollute the maximum amount they are allowed by regulations when that is the most profitable solution. reply auspiv 14 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of nuances to assign the gas a value. Our electricity is apparently in the 5-6 cents per kWh range. I did the math recently and running a generator on site can cut that in half. But then you&#x27;re in the business of running a fleet of hundreds of generators. Is it cheaper per kWh? Yes. But then factor in the cost of mechanics, techs, maintenance, etc. and that bring it close to even. You&#x27;ve also locked yourself into a bad spot if the price of natural gas spikes 3x like it did in summer 2022 with the Russia&#x2F;Ukraine war and all of a sudden your self-generated electricity is far more expensive than utility and you can&#x27;t sell any of your gas because you never build the gathering lines to get it to a pipeline. reply vel0city 10 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re self-generating from gas you&#x27;d otherwise just release to the air, your generation costs aren&#x27;t changing from the spike in markets you&#x27;re not even participating in. You&#x27;re not buying the gas, you&#x27;re getting it directly from the ground.If you have a water well on site, does a drought far away change the cost for you to get water from the ground? One could argue you&#x27;re not realizing the gains in the market by bringing your water to sale and losing out on opportunity, but those are theoretical dollars you&#x27;re losing. Your actual costs stayed the same. reply pixl97 7 hours agorootparentNo, not really...Most companies have a pot of money they can put across multiple projects and will typically put that money towards projects that are going to profit the most. If you have a well near a major transmission pipeline, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going to invest most of your time and effort.Self-generating still means your turning power over to the market, and in long runs of sunny&#x2F;windy days power prices may go negative for some amount of time.It&#x27;s a lot of risk, hence why the oil&#x2F;gas industry has lots of booms and busts. reply vel0city 5 hours agorootparentI was speaking to this:> You&#x27;ve also locked yourself into a bad spot if the price of natural gas spikes 3x like it did in summer 2022 with the Russia&#x2F;Ukraine war and all of a sudden your self-generated electricity is far more expensive than utility and you can&#x27;t sell any of your gas because you never build the gathering lines to get it to a pipeline.The war in Ukraine spiking natural gas prices aren&#x27;t increasing your costs if you&#x27;re using waste gas. Your costs are the same regardless of whatever the global market of gas prices are, because you&#x27;re not selling this gas on the market nor are you buying from the market. And for the vast majority of markets the war led to utility rates increasing, not decreasing, so chances are your self-generation rate was less than the grid not more.> Self-generating still means your turning power over to the marketThat&#x27;s an assumption, but depending on the setup it might be true or it might not be true. One could self generate just for their own local usage and not be tied to the grid.I agree with the idea of it potentially not being competitive with renewables, once again you&#x27;re talking potential lost opportunity when talking about renewables coming in cheaper. But the fact renewables came in cheaper some days doesn&#x27;t make your costs increase, it just makes it less competitive than the grid power. The grid going negative doesn&#x27;t change your costs if you&#x27;re not connected to the grid, it just means you&#x27;re spending more than you potentially needed to. And I agree its this risk of the price of electricity going lower than the costs of actually gathering and burning this gas for electricity that leads to it being flared and vented instead of put to something useful.But still, from the perspective of self-generation your costs aren&#x27;t changing from grid conditions. Say it costs you like $0.05&#x2F;kWh to self generate with the waste gas. The grid goes down to only $0.02&#x2F;kWh. Did your costs to generate go up? No, its still $0.05&#x2F;kWh. Sure, you&#x27;re overpaying by $0.03&#x2F;kWh compared to just using the grid power but your costs were still the same. reply nerdponx 14 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that the economics of not-venting gas aren&#x27;t great for operators is precisely an example of externalities and why they can&#x27;t be handled effectively without financial incentives or equivalent regulation.Either you buy gas from Permian basin operators at inflated prices to make it worth capturing, or you make the cost of not capturing it high enough that it becomes worthwhile to capture.

Regulations killed Texans because they are so obsessed with their fed grid rules theyd rather Texans die than grant ERCOT unregulated access. reply autoexec 12 hours agorootparentThe national grid works because it is regulated. If you allow states to hookup their garbage unregulated systems to it, there would no longer be a regulated grid and the entire system would be made vulnerable.It was the refusal to follow the same rules everybody else plays by that caused the problem for Texans, not the fact that rest of the country has standards and insists that they&#x27;re followed.The regulated grid works. The \"we don&#x27;t need rules\" grid failed, and it will continue to fail Texans until they care about themselves and families enough to demand better. They don&#x27;t even have to demand connection to the national grid, Texans could just demand regulations for their own grid that are even stricter than the national grid&#x27;s rules and stay separate.

Then we need to consider the net affect of oil produced by texas on humanity, and consider how that net affect is changed with more regulation.Simply saying \"yeah it seems like New Mexico doin real good with more laws\" is extremely dangerous, because most regulation DOES harm and destroy market affects and competitive businesses. The authors on the study here should AT LEAST report with due diligence on this before requesting for increased regulation and attempting to sway public opinion -- potentially having a net NEGATIVE affect on humanity.One possible example of not considering the net negative affect of regulation, is, for example, if there are many competing energy companies in texas, and there is a consumer demand for more responsible operations, then those competing energy companies are forcing each other to tighten their operations wrt environmental impact. However, if regulation destroys small producers and benefits big corporations, then we would see LESS competition and LESS Priority from companies to tighten their operations, negatively affecting the environment. reply smolder 11 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think \"hackernews is pro-regulation\" is accurate, but that might be an easy mistake if you are \"anti-regulation\". I&#x27;m neither thing. I like regulation that works well and dislike it if it doesn&#x27;t, which I dare say is the rational POV. I&#x27;m going to repost my comment from a thread on a recent story flagged as dupe:It&#x27;s not the amount of regulation that matters, it&#x27;s the intent. Is it written to benefit a greater good, or written to benefit a political party&#x27;s benefactor? The same applies to removing regulations. Where did the intent lie? New regulation and repeal are most often shades of grey --bad mixed with good in terms of overall consequences. Many changes disproportionately help a few at some expense to the many. That&#x27;s what happens when minority interests with a lot of money are overrepresented in government, lobbyists write bills, etc. reply cbb330 11 hours agorootparentMy conclusion on hackernews being \"pro-regulation\" is based on observance that posts discussing the downside of regulation are often downvoted.I agree with what you said. Knowing that repealing regulation is much less frequent than producing new regulation -- we should assume all new regulation is high risk, since its&#x27; impact is known to have tradeoffs, is to some degree created from perverse incentives and minority interests, and once in place is immutable. Regulation can be good and it can be bad.So if we know that regulation carries high risk, we need to be very apprehensive to anyone calling for more regulation such as this article via \"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kayrros.com&#x2F;\". We don&#x27;t know who they are, what they want, and what their suggested change in policy affects in net to humanity over time.I guess what I want is for companies like \"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kayrros.com&#x2F;\" to be held to a higher bar and be more responsible for the outcome of their research and conclusions. reply kelnos 11 hours agoparentprev [–] > because most regulation DOES harm and destroy market affects and competitive businessesI don&#x27;t see that as a problem, when the alternative seems to be essentially zero oversight over people who don&#x27;t care if they -- through their own negligence -- release chemicals into the atmosphere that contribute to the destruction of our planet&#x27;s biosphere.\"Business interests\" are irrelevant if our planet becomes unlivable for humans.Regardless:> Simply saying \"yeah it seems like New Mexico doin real good with more laws\" is extremely dangerousIs anyone actually saying that, though?

    "originBody": "The Cops You Can Now Film in NYPD Precincts, Thanks to This YouTuber SeanPaul Reyes won a temporary injunction in federal court last Thursday. The very next day, he was livestreaming in the 75th Precinct with a copy of the court order in his hand. 9:57 AM EST on November 8, 2023 SeanPaul Reyes livestreaming from the 75th Precinct Friday with the court order allowing filming in NYPD precinct houses. (Video still: YouTube / Long Island Audit) By Nick Pinto Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Email On Friday, the metaphorical ink was still drying on a federal court order barring the NYPD from illegally telling people they can't film the police in the public parts of precinct stations, when SeanPaul Reyes, who had sued the police department after being arrested for doing just that, marched into the 75th Precinct station house in East New York, recording with his phone in one hand, a copy of the judge's order in the other hand. \"We the people did it,\" Reyes told his livestream audience in a video broadcast viewed more than 300,000 times so far. \"We won.\" Sporting sunglasses, a neatly trimmed beard, and a baseball cap that read \"We the People,\" Reyes held forth in the precinct lobby, celebrating the victory. A police employee poked her head into the lobby to find out what Reyes wanted. \"I want to make a complaint against the NYPD as a whole,\" he told her. After several minutes, a police sergeant emerged and handed Reyes a complaint form. Reyes asked him for his name and badge number, then thanked him and the precinct for being in compliance with the federal injunction. \"I appreciate you guys not being in contempt of court,\" he said. The sergeant dutifully nodded. Reyes filed his lawsuit in July, after being arrested twice for filming in the public areas of NYPD precinct houses. An NYPD policy, announced in signage in every precinct in the city, forbids filming in station houses. To Reyes, who describes himself as a \"First Amendment auditor,\" that rule was meant to be broken. \"The police are there for accountability—if you do something wrong, they hold you accountable,\" Reyes told Hell Gate. \"But how do the people hold the police accountable? There has to be some sort of transparency and accountability for how the police treat people on an everyday basis. That's why I record. I just want to show people how public employees treat people.\" Reyes's lawsuit argued that the NYPD's policy is improper for three reasons: It violates the First Amendment's protections of free speech; it violates a state law and a New York City law, both known as the Right to Record Act, which explicitly guarantee the right to record the police, anywhere and any time, so long as the person filming isn't interfering with police work or otherwise breaking the law; and the NYPD instituted its policy without following the Citywide Administrative Procedure Act, which specifies the steps a City agency must take before it can put a new rule in place. Judge Jessica Clarke, who ordered the injunction last week, ruled that while the First Amendment claim might be a little more complicated, it seems pretty clear that the NYPD violated the state and municipal Right to Record Acts with its policy. \"The Right to Record Acts do not carve out police precinct lobbies as places where individuals are not allowed to record,\" she wrote in her order. Consequently, according to Clarke, Reyes was \"likely to succeed on his claims under the Right to Record Acts.\" Based on that likelihood, Clarke issued a temporary injunction barring the NYPD from enforcing its rule and directing it to take down the signs in every police station that forbid filming. That's not the end of Reyes's lawsuit—he is seeking a permanent injunction. With this provisional win under their belts, his legal team will now begin to pursue discovery, gathering information about how the NYPD made its rule in the first place and testing whether there's any evidence to support the NYPD's claim that its policy is necessary to protect the privacy of confidential informants and vulnerable victims of crimes who might be discussing delicate matters in the public spaces of precinct houses. The YouTube genre of First Amendment auditors is fairly rich, and encompasses everything from kids filming themselves sassing back during traffic stops to steely-eyed libertarians being coolly intransigent at Border Patrol checkpoints deep in the desert. Reyes was a fan of the genre before he was a practitioner. \"My brother-in-law, and as well as myself, we used to watch First Amendment audits and police interaction videos,\" he said. \"Traffic stops, going into government agencies and seeing how they really treat members of the public on a daily basis, things of that nature. It always fascinated me how law enforcement and government officials got so upset about somebody recording them, you know? You would think that they would appreciate the transparency.\" When COVID hit, Reyes, a Long Island resident, was furloughed from his job as a logistics director for a manufacturing company, and he found himself with some time on his hands. \"I was like, might as well just pick up the camera,\" Reyes said. \"Nobody really is doing it here at Suffolk County.\" Suffolk County police officers initially reacted very aggressively to Reyes's efforts to film them, he said, \"But to their credit, they learned very quickly how to adapt and retrain their officers to allow filming in public areas,\" Reyes said. \"So I branched out.\" That branching out took Reyes all over the country, as tipsters pointed him to departments that were treating people poorly. Reyes says he distinguishes himself from some other First Amendment auditors by being unfailingly polite. He carries himself in his videos with a sort of jovial formality, conscientiously thanking officers for their time. That manner has built him a following—his YouTube channel has more than 578,000 subscribers, and he says that across all his social media platforms, he has more than a quarter-billion views. Those views bring ad revenue, which Reyes now supports himself on, and he employs a team of colleagues as well. His manner has also earned him the respect of some police departments: He says he's been invited to give First Amendment trainings to departments in New Jersey and Ohio. Eventually, Reyes found his way to Brooklyn, where the NYPD's policy barring the public from recording how they are treated in police precincts seemed ripe for a challenge. Reyes may be claiming victory against the NYPD, but—the meek welcome its officers offered Reyes on Friday notwithstanding—the department doesn't show any signs of giving up. It has filed notice that it is appealing the judge's order to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. A ruling on that appeal could take years. In the meantime, the NYPD is also seeking a stay of the temporary injunction, allowing the department to continue to bar filming in the meantime. Reyes's lawyer, Andrew Case of LatinoJustice PRLDF, said that the NYPD's dogged commitment to the dubiously legal policy is characteristic of how the department has approached the entire case. \"The NYPD appears to be very resolute about defending the rule and seems to be unwilling to consider other alternatives, that wouldn't run afoul of the Right to Record law,\" Case said. The NYPD declined to comment on the order, referring questions to the New York City Law Department. \"The NYPD is committed to protecting the privacy of victims and keeping New Yorkers safe, particularly inside the public areas in precincts,\" a Law Department spokesperson told Hell Gate in a statement. \"While we are disappointed with the court's ruling, we are encouraged by the court's indication that NYPD's policy has a legitimate basis. We are evaluating the City's legal options.\" The NYPD is also continuing to fight another lawsuit brought over its ban on filming in police stations. Patricia Rodney, a grandmother who was arrested and had her arm broken by police who thought she was filming them in the outer vestibule of the 62nd Precinct station in Dyker Heights, also has an open lawsuit in federal court. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who wrote the New York City Right to Record Act, has filed an amicus brief in the case arguing that the NYPD's policy is illegal. The NYPD is seeking to dismiss that case, but the presiding judge has not yet ruled on that motion. The order in Reyes's case isn't binding precedent in Rodney's lawsuit, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the NYPD. Back outside the 75th Precinct on Friday, Reyes was ebullient. \"This is a major, major win for the people, ladies and gentlemen,\" he told the camera. \"Make sure you guys are smashing that 'like' button and sharing this video so everyone in New York City can see this video and know what we the people can accomplish together. We can accomplish true change. This is just the battle that we won. We still have a war that we need to win.\" Already a user?Log in Thanks for reading!

Being seen or heard by others in a public place should not mean that you, as a private person, also gets recorded. reply JohnFen 16 hours agorootparentI agree. I think that US law is actively harmful in this regard. It should be possible to be in public spaces without having to worry about being recorded, either by authorities or other people. reply ultrarunner 15 hours agorootparentThis reverses the subject, though: even if we grant that private civilians should have a (possibly limited) expectation of privacy in public, civilians acting in a public capacity, like the police, should not. Given the enormous power they have to act outside the law with impunity, removing the only check on that power— transparency into their conduct— would be a mistake. One only need to consider any of the many times police have been caught outright lying by video surfacing afterward to understand why. reply JohnFen 14 hours agorootparentI agree entirely. We give police extraordinary power over us, and it seems completely reasonable that they have little expectation of privacy when using those powers. replythemaninthedark 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat if the mob is paying people to film inside the Precinct? reply JackFr 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat about crime victims? reply JohnFen 16 hours agoparentprevI get the argument. This is a tough problem, though, because someone recording in a police building can easily prevent citizens from conducting their business in there. I know that if I saw some random person recording in the building (or in other sensitive places), I wouldn&#x27;t set foot in there. I doubt I&#x27;m the only one. Particularly if someone is going in there to deal with an issue where they don&#x27;t want others to know they&#x27;re going to the police. reply MrDrMcCoy 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m still in favor of absolute recording rights despite all that. You&#x27;re quite right to point out chilling effects of active recording, but you have to also consider that bad police behavior is chilling in and of itself. People don&#x27;t want to make reports when the police might make things worse or neglect things they&#x27;re supposed to help with. Recording can help with that and will become less common as bad police are held to better account. Another thing that can balance that would be for police stations to have a reception desk with a transparent, soundproof box for citizens to make reports with some privacy and safety regardless of recording. reply JohnFen 14 hours agorootparent> Another thing that can balance that would be for police stations to have a reception desk with a transparent, soundproof box for citizens to make reportsThat doesn&#x27;t really address the issue, though.

The people doing the recording would probably demand the right to record in any other place that is set aside for such purposes as well.That&#x27;s why this is a really difficult issue. The ruling may be technically correct, but it seems to me that this practice does more harm than good. replyJackFr 15 hours agoparentprevShould other people in a police station have any expectation of privacy?

If the public can legally get there they can legally film reply LegitShady 14 hours agorootparentprevi imagine that policy too would be subject to legal challenge, and if placed immediately after this judgement would probably not draw a lot of sympathy from a judge. The issue is that filming in the public foyer&#x2F;area of a public building IS legitimate business, even protected activity, so the more they do to make that difficult the worse it becomes for them. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 16 hours agorootparentprevStatutory law rarely spells that out, leaving it to judges and case law. My guess is that judges would be pragmatic in such matters, and in those parts of the building where there is no public interest in allowing video recording, they would disallow it.Likely, those rooms are off limits to the public anyway. And, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, as dumb as the public can be, no one&#x27;s actually attempted to film in those places (though, with the rise of influencers and Youtube and whatnot, maybe we should just be anticipating the coming flood?). reply anonymouskimmer 14 hours agoparentprevFrom what I&#x27;ve gathered watching Youtube legal videos, Qualified Immunity doesn&#x27;t apply when the government officials have been explicitly told by a court that their specific behavior is a violation of a right.

These privacy violations may compromise persons charged with crimes, witnesses, jury members, court staff, or plaintiffs.

The whole premise of the legal system is that it&#x27;s public. Closed door procedures are the exception. You can generally walk in to nearly any courtroom, observe the whole thing, write down what everybody said, and publish it, and that&#x27;s 100% legal. So the \"no cameras because it might violate privacy\" argument always felt weird to me. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentI see a really huge difference between being able to observe something and being able to record the thing.

I was thinking just in the courthouse&#x2F;police station&#x2F;etc. generally.In an actual court proceeding, things might be a bit different.

Basically restrictions on filming in courts are judicial orders (and they&#x27;re basically gods in courthouses) but restrictions on filming in public areas of a courthouse building in general are more complicated.

Better transparency into government misconduct, and defense against oppression committed against citizens by government. reply SamoyedFurFluff 17 hours agoparentThe only problem is there’s no step in social media to activate people to put pressure on the government to reduce police abuse. I want stuff like cops who beat their significant others taken off the force. Cops sent to jail if they rape or sexually assault their detainees. I want a reversion to the legal precedent that cops have no duty to defend civilians from crime. But there’s no way to do this without large popular action,.Hell even with BLM mass protests, no city actually defunded the police! reply kmeisthax 13 hours agorootparentThere were cities that literally defunded the police. More accurately, they deliberately engineered a crime crisis to discredit police reform activism under the common misunderstanding that \"defund the police\" means \"I want the Purge\" and not \"stop sending cops out to shoot at homeless people in a Wendy&#x27;s drive-thru\".The thing about cops getting taken off the force is that it actually happens fairly commonly. The term of art in law enforcement for them is \"gypsy[0] cops\", because they jump from force to force whenever they do something that attracts media attention. Ironically, they are enabled by literally defunded police departments who are looking for someone they can pay peanuts to go issue traffic tickets all day. The really abusive bullies are their perfect employee, at least until they cause a media stir and have to be fired to save face.In all these cases, there actually is active pressure from people to reform and it does go to the people that matter. The problem is that those people have a vested interest in keeping policing brutal, and they are also rhetorically slippery. They will actively misinterpret your sloganeering, they will ignore your political writings and pamphlets, and generally seek to embarrass you until you go away.Less depressingly, I do recall a few cities[1] run by people with their heads on straight that did what the \"defund the police\" people meant, not what they literally said. And it turns out that, given not-crooked people in power implementing these things faithfully, it does work. The problem is entirely the people at the top making the decisions. What we need is not merely bottom-up pressure, but an explicit democratic mandate - i.e. infiltrating local government with competent politicians favorable to the cause.Also, maybe we should change the slogan. I vote for \"Refund the Police\", because it has a double-meaning: send back the violent interventions and fund non-violent programs instead.[0] Their words, not mine.For those unaware, in Europe this word is basically the N-word.[1] Whose names I frustratingly DO NOT REMEMBER reply gruez 8 hours agorootparent>There were cities that literally defunded the police.
