    "originBody": "Look, Ma, No Matrices! https://github.com/enkimute/LookMaNoMatrices A forward renderer without matrices. Steven De Keninck Putting PGA ( 𝑅 3 , 0 , 1 R3,0,1) to the test! Since the 2019 SIGGRAPH course [1], Geometric Algebra, and Euclidean PGA (plane-based or projective geometric algebra) in particular, has been gaining traction within the computer graphics and machine learning communities [2, 3, 4]. Despite its broad applicability, including for higher dimensional geometry and physics, its adoption in traditional 3D graphics has been limited, often merely re-branding a dual quaternion as a PGA motor. The ’Look, Ma, No Matrices!’ project aims to broaden PGA’s application by introducing a modern, glTF-compliant, forward-rendering 3D engine that fully integrates the PGA algebra. In this write up, we will go over this project, highlighting the solutions and techniques that are required when moving to a PGA implementation. It was at times tempting to start from the existing techniques and attempt an 'algebra-level' translation. This however often leads to unsatisfactory solutions and in order for PGA to truly reach its potential a more fundamental revisit is often needed. Algebra without geometry, indeed, is blind. Introduction. Matrices are everywhere in computer graphics. In fact, there was a time when 4x4 matrices were both baked into the GPU and a mandatory part of all graphics API's. This project would then simply not have been possible. Today however, pushed in no small part by the advancements in AI, GPU's are highly programmable scalar processors, no longer tied into the long gone fixed function pipeline. Yet, 4x4 matrices are still omnipresent. And why should they not be? They can represent all linear transformations, and the typical forward graphics pipeline indeed involves both rigid and projective transformations. Seems like a good fit. Quaternions are also everywhere in computer graphics. Turns out, matrices have less than ideal interpolation properties, and modern formats like Khronos' glTF use quaternions for all their rotation needs. Fantastic for animations, and generally considered worth the cost of the unavoidable conversions to and from matrices. Out in the real world, however, the vast majority of matrices in your typical 3D engine setup are going to be orthogonal matrices, encoding just rotations and translations. And this is where the motor manifold of PGA comes in. At a lower computational and memory cost, PGA motors encode the full set of Euclidean motions, additionally offering conversion free inclusion of quaternions and dual quaternions. This of course raises the question - can we replace all matrices in a typical forward renderer by their PGA equivalents ? Is a true matrix free setup possible or even desirable ? Only one way to find out ... But before we start, a short disclaimer. This project aims to replace matrices without compromise. That, of course, is not how one should approach any engineering problem. As a reference for this project we are using the Khronos glTF viewer. This is a sensible choice, as no doubt others will use this as reference, but it does not attempt to be an optimal implementation. It uses 4x4 matrices in full, and the built-in glsl operators for them for most operations, when experienced graphics programmers know there are still wins there. The point here is not to make the most optimal implementation, especially in light of some of the findings here, the most optimal implementation is most likely a hybrid solution, subject to a future writeup! FPGA : Fast PGA! A full introduction to PGA is outside of the scope of this article, and we will assume the reader is familiar with at least the material in [1, 5, 6]. Instead, we will focus on the choices made for this particular implementation, and specifically work out in detail the basic operators that are needed, both for CPU and GPU. Basics and Basis The PGA algebra is generated by four basis vectors 𝑒 0 e0 to 𝑒 3 e3. The 𝑒 1 , 𝑒 2 , 𝑒 3 e1,e2,e3 vectors map to the 𝑥 = 0 , 𝑦 = 0 , 𝑧 = 0 x=0,y=0,z=0 planes respectively while the special degenerate 𝑒 0 e0 vector represents the plane at infinity. These four generators are then combined to form six bivectors, four trivectors and a single quadvector that together with the scalar represent all of the PGA elements. Our specific choice for basis and memory layout was selected to minimize convertions when handling typical graphics data. All of the elements of PGA are intricately connected, an overview of our choices and how they map to transformations and geometric elements is in the following table (where the second row denotes the square of each element) : e1 e2 e3 e0 1 e23 e31 e12 e01 e02 e03 e0123 e032 e013 e021 e123 +1 +1 +1 0 +1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 plane-reflection Motor / Dual Quaternion / Lie Group point-reflection Quaternionplane 𝑎 𝑒 1 + 𝑏 𝑒 2 + 𝑐 𝑒 3 + 𝑑 𝑒 0 = 0 ae1+be2+ce3+de0=0Line through orig. ∞ linepoint ( 𝑥 𝑒 1 + 𝑦 𝑒 2 + 𝑧 𝑒 3 + 𝑤 𝑒 0 ) ∗ (xe1+ye2+ze3+we0)∗ Line / Lie Algebra vector S bivector PSS trivector These choices translate to the following simple shader structures, where we opted to stay within the builtin types to retain addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication. (glsl does not support operator overloading for custom types). #define motor mat2x4 // [ [s, e23, e31, e12], [e01, e02, e03, e0123] ] #define line mat2x3 // [ [e23, e31, e12], [e01, e02, e03] ] #define point vec3 // [ e032, e013, e021 ] implied 1 e123 #define direction vec3 // [ e032, e013, e021 ] implied 0 e123 Get your Geometric Products! With our data structures defined, we can focus our attention on implementing the (subset) of PGA products we will need. Special atention is given to the composition and sandwich operators - the numerical efficiency of matrix-vector multiplication is well known, and as we will discover, some creativity is needed to get PGA up to par. Composition of transformations. The 8-float motors of PGA, isomorphic to the dual quaternions, naturally come with an efficient composition operator in the form of the geometric product. Recall that the product of two 4x4 matrices requires 64 multiplications and 48 additions. For two general PGA motors, their composition clocks in at just 48 multiplications and 40 additions. Working out the product at coefficient level produces the following implementation on the CPU: // 48 mul, 40 add export const gp_mm = (a,b,res=new baseType(8)) => { const a0=a[0],a1=a[1],a2=a[2],a3=a[3],a4=a[4],a5=a[5],a6=a[6],a7=a[7], b0=b[0],b1=b[1],b2=b[2],b3=b[3],b4=b[4],b5=b[5],b6=b[6],b7=b[7]; res[0] = a0*b0-a1*b1-a2*b2-a3*b3; res[1] = a0*b1+a1*b0+a3*b2-a2*b3; res[2] = a0*b2+a1*b3+a2*b0-a3*b1; res[3] = a0*b3+a2*b1+a3*b0-a1*b2; res[4] = a0*b4+a3*b5+a4*b0+a6*b2-a1*b7-a2*b6-a5*b3-a7*b1; res[5] = a0*b5+a1*b6+a4*b3+a5*b0-a2*b7-a3*b4-a6*b1-a7*b2; res[6] = a0*b6+a2*b4+a5*b1+a6*b0-a1*b5-a3*b7-a4*b2-a7*b3; res[7] = a0*b7+a1*b4+a2*b5+a3*b6+a4*b1+a5*b2+a6*b3+a7*b0; return res; } This block of code, with some reshuffling and pattern matching can be written in glsl using dot and cross products as: // 48 mul, 40 add motor gp_mm( motor a, motor b ) { return motor( a[0].x*b[0].x - dot(a[0].yzw, b[0].yzw), a[0].x*b[0].yzw + b[0].x*a[0].yzw + cross(b[0].yzw, a[0].yzw), a[0].x*b[1].xyz + b[0].x*a[1].xyz + cross(b[0].yzw, a[1].xyz) + cross(b[1].xyz, a[0].yzw) - b[1].w*a[0].yzw - a[1].w*b[0].yzw, a[0].x*b[1].w + b[0].x*a[1].w + dot(a[0].yzw, b[1].xyz) + dot(a[1].xyz, b[0].yzw)); } While already reasonably efficient, the above code block handles general motors and there are many scenarios where we deal with e.g. pure translations or rotations around the origin. In those scenarios many of the motor coefficients will be zero, and reworking the above code block to incorporate that is an easy task. For example, for the composition of two rotations around the origin we find we need only 16 multiplications and 12 additions: // 16 mul, 12 add motor gp_rr( motor a, motor b ) { return motor( a[0].x*b[0] + vec4( -dot(a[0].yzw, b[0].yzw), b[0].x*a[0].yzw + cross(b[0].yzw,a[0].yzw) ), vec4(0.) ); } Our implementation provides these optimised versions for any combination of translation (_t), rotation around the origin (_r) and general motor (_m). Operation Multiplications Additions gp_mm 48 40 gp_rr 16 12 gp_tt 0 3 gp_rt / gp_tr 12 8 gp_rm / gp_mr 32 24 gp_tm / gp_mt 12 12 Transforming points For the transformation of a point 𝑝 p with a motor 𝑀 M, done in PGA with the sandwich product, the situation is more involved. 𝑝 ′ = 𝑀 𝑝 𝑀 ~ p′=MpM Working out these two geometric products naively results in a whopping 33 multiplications and 29 additions, or more than twice the 16 multiplications and 12 additions required for the matrix-vector equivalent. The reason for this is that this naive expansion does not take into account the fact that PGA motors satisfy 𝑀 𝑀 ~ = 1 MM=1. It is however not to difficult to incorporate this into our sandwich product. To do so, we suggest starting instead from the expression 𝑝 ′ = 𝑀 𝑝 𝑀 ~ + 𝑝 ⋅ ( 1 − 𝑀 𝑀 ~ ) p′=MpM+p⋅(1−MM) Where the second term evaluates to zero for a normalized motor M. Evaluating this new expression at coefficient level allows us to reduce the operations needed to 21 multiplications and 18 additions (which for the isomorphic dual quaternions is the best known solution) : // 21 mul, 18 add point sw_mp( motor a, point b ) { direction t = cross(b, a[0].yzw) - a[1].xyz; return (a[0].x * t + cross(t, a[0].yzw) - a[0].yzw * a[1].w) * 2. + b; } Transforming directions For directions, aka points at infinity, with an implied 𝑒 123 e123 coefficient of 0 0, we can do a bit better still. Applying the same normalisation trick we find a solution that requires only 18 multiplications and 12 additions. // 18 mul, 12 add direction sw_md( motor a, direction b ) { direction t = cross(b, a[0].yzw); return (a[0].x * t + cross(t, a[0].yzw)) * 2. + b; } Anticipating our needs when dealing with tangent spaces, we also work out the sandwich product on the basis directions. (as opposed to the general direction above). In that scenario, the computational cost can be reduced even further. In fact, if we produce an output normalized to 0.5 0.5 instead of 1 1 we can reduce the computational cost for the transformation of e.g. the x axis to an amazing 6 multiplications and 4 additions - about the cost of a default cross product: // 6 mul, 4 add direction sw_mx( motor a ) { return direction( 0.5 - a[0].w*a[0].w - a[0].z*a[0].z, a[0].z*a[0].y - a[0].x*a[0].w, a[0].w*a[0].y + a[0].x*a[0].z ); } This is an important observation, and as you will see will allow us to challenge the common belief that matrices are unconditionally the fastest choice ... Normalisation The squared (pseudo)norm of a PGA motor 𝑀 M is given by ∣ 𝑀 ∣ 2 = 𝑀 𝑀 ~ = 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑒 0123 ∣M∣2=MM=a+be0123For a normalized motor, ∣ 𝑀 ∣ = 1 ∣M∣=1, but in general the result of this expression is 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑒 0123 a+be0123, a Study Number (a multivector whose non-scalar part squares to a scalar). As a consequence, the normalized motor 𝑀 ‾ M, 𝑀 ‾ = 𝑀 ∣ 𝑀 ∣ M=∣M∣Mis a bit more involved to calculate. In 3D PGA it involves inverting a Study Number that here is isomorphic to a dual number. We've worked out the details for a number of algebras in [7], from which we only need the inverse square root formula in 3D PGA : 1 ∣ 𝑀 ∣ = 1 𝑀 𝑀 ~ = 1 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑒 0123 = 1 𝑎 − 𝑏 2 𝑎 3 𝑒 0123 ∣M∣1=MM1=a+be01231=a1−2a3be0123This leads to the following efficient implementation for 3DPGA: // 21 mul, 5 add motor normalize_m( motor a ) { float s = 1. / length( a[0] ); float d = (a[1].w * a[0].x - dot( a[1].xyz, a[0].yzw ))*s*s; return motor(a[0]*s, a[1]*s + vec4(a[0].yzw*(s*d),-a[0].x*s*d)); } Note that this procedure should be compared not to vector normalisation, but instead to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, as the resulting motor is guaranteed to be an orthonormal transformation. As before, when we are dealing with a pure translation or rotation, far more efficient versions of the normalisation procedure are available. Square Roots The square root plays an important role in PGA, as it is the key to constructing transformations between elements. Given any pair of points/lines/planes 𝑎 , 𝑏 a,b, there exist a rigid transformation that moves 𝑎 a onto 𝑏 b. Such a rigid transformation always has a motor form, and this motor is always given by the same simple expression : 𝑀 = 𝑏 𝑎 M=abCombine this with the fact that for any normalized non-null blade 𝑎 a its inverse is ± 𝑎 ±a, and we can rewrite this as ± 𝑀 2 = 𝑏 𝑎 ±M2=ba Or, in other words, the geometric product 𝑏 𝑎 ba of any two points, two lines or two planes produces a motor that represents double the transformation from 𝑎 a to 𝑏 b. The square root comes in to halve this result and indeed find the motor that moves 𝑎 a exactly onto 𝑏 b. Here too, geometric algebra provides a single elegant method that universally applies : 𝑀 = 1 + 𝑀 ‾ M=1+MHere the overline denotes the Study-normalisation procedure from our previous block. Hence the computational cost of a square root is exactly that of the normalisation procedure with one extra addition. // 21 mul, 6 add motor sqrt_m( motor R ) { return normalize_m( motor( R[0].x + 1., R[0].yzw, R[1] ) ); } Exponential map To complete our PGA toolbox, we adapt, also from [7], efficient implementations of the logarithmic and exponential maps. Recall that the logarithm of a PGA motor is a (sum of) scaled lines, and similarly, any scaled line can be exponentiated to construct a rotation around it. While the exponential map for general 4x4 matrices is numerically very expensive, for our PGA motor manifold efficient closed form solutions are possible. // 14 muls 5 add 1 div 1 acos 1 sqrt line log_m( motor M ) { if (M[0].x == 1.) return line( vec3(0.), vec3(M[1].xyz) ); float a = 1./(1. - M[0].x*M[0].x), b = acos(M[0].x) * sqrt(a), c = a*M[1].w*(1. - M[0].x*b); return line( b*M[0].yzw, b*M[1].xyz + c*M[0].wzy); } // 17 muls 8 add 2 div 1 sqrt 1 cos 1 sin motor exp_b( line B ) { float l = dot(B[0],B[0]); if (l==0.) return motor( vec4(1., 0., 0., 0.), vec4(B[1], 0.) ); float a = sqrt(l), m = dot(B[0].xyz, B[1]), c = cos(a), s = sin(a)/a, t = m/l*(c-s); return motor( c, s*B[0], s*B[1] + t*B[0].zyx, m*s ); } Inverses If there's one place where Geometric Algebra sets itself clearly apart from our standard vector and matrix algebra aproach, it is the existense of inverses for (multi) vectors. Not only do these inverses exist, but for the normalized objects we are working with in our context, they are very efficient to calculate. Element 𝑥 x Inverse 𝑥 − 1 x−1 Plane𝑥 − 1 = 𝑥 x−1=x Line𝑥 − 1 = − 𝑥 x−1=−x Point𝑥 − 1 = − 𝑥 x−1=−x Motor𝑥 − 1 = 𝑥 ~ x−1=x Where 𝑥 ~ x, the reversion operation, changes the sign of the bivector and trivector coefficients only. There is one more inverse that is occasionally needed, which is the inverse of a general bivector 𝐵 B. Recall that a bivector 𝐵 B only represents a single line iff 𝐵 ∧ 𝐵 = 0 B∧B=0, the so called Plucker condition. If a bivector 𝐵 B does not satisfy that requirement, it is no blade, i.e. not the result of meeting two planes or joining two points. For such an element the inverse is slightly more complicated. To find this inverse, we start by multiplying with the reverse bivector from the right. 1 𝐵 = 𝐵 ~ 𝐵 𝐵 ~ B1=BBBAs before, the squared norm of ∣ 𝐵 ∣ 2 = 𝐵 𝐵 ~ = 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑒 0123 ∣B∣2=BB=a+be0123, is a Study number, isomorphic to the dual numbers. This allows us to use the definition of a dual number inverse. 1 ( 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑒 0123 ) = 1 𝑎 − 𝑏 𝑎 2 𝑒 0123 (a+be0123)1=a1−a2be0123Multiplying this last expression with 𝐵 ~ B produces the inverse we are looking for. Motor Factorisation Just as the process of factorizing matrices can be very insightful, so is the factorization of PGA motors. Two particular factorisations will be useful to us, and we will add them as the last tools to our box. The first of those is called the Euclidean Factorisation, and it decomposes a motor into a rotation around the origin followed by a translation. 𝑀 = 𝑇 𝑒 𝑅 𝑒 M=TeReThis factorisation is particularly easy to calculate, as the Euclidean rotor 𝑅 𝑒 Re is simply the Euclidean part of our motor - the first four floats - isomorphic to a regular quaternion. If it is needed, the translation 𝑇 𝑒 Te can be computed as 𝑇 𝑒 = 𝑀 𝑅 ~ 𝑒 Te=MRe The second factorisation of interest is the so called Invariant factorisation. It decomposes a motor 𝑀 M into a commuting translation and rotation, which is always possible and generally known in 3D as the Mozzi-Chasles theorem. You may have heard of it as every rigid body transformation can be decomposed into a rotation around a line preceded or followed by a translation along the same line. 𝑀 = 𝑇 𝑅 = 𝑅 𝑇 M=TR=RT In 3D PGA, the invariant factorisation is also easy to calculate, with the commuting translation given by 𝑇 = 1 + ⟨ 𝑀 ⟩ 4 ⟨ 𝑀 ⟩ 2 T=1+⟨M⟩2⟨M⟩4Where the angle brackets denote the grade extraction, and the general bivector inverse from above comes in handy. The matching rotation can now be constructed as 𝑅 = 𝑀 𝑇 ~ = 𝑇 ~ 𝑀 R=MT=TM. We will in particular use the Euclidean factorisation when composing the transformation of the tangent frame with that of the object to world motor, as such a frame is invariant to translations and the composition of rotations around the origin is more efficient. Escaping the matrix The prevalence of matrices in computer graphics means that interacting with existing content inevitably will confront you with matrices. The Khronos glTF project from which we have started uses matrices throughout, for transformations, binding poses for skinning etc. Our commitment to a matrix-free environment implies we will have to convert these matrices to their PGA equivalents at load time. Converting matrices to motors. To convert a 4x4 orthogonal matrix to a motor, we happily employ the isomorphism to quaternions and upgrade an industry standard solution to handle the entire PGA manifold. export const fromMatrix3 = M => { // Shorthand. var [m00,m01,m02,m10,m11,m12,m20,m21,m22] = M; // Quick scale check const scale = [hypot(m00,m01,m02),hypot(m10,m11,m12),hypot(m20,m21,m22)]; if (abs(scale[0]-1)>0.0001 || abs(scale[1]-1)>0.0001 || abs(scale[2]-1)>0.0001) { const i = scale.map(s=>1/s); m00 *= i[0]; m01 *= i[0]; m02 *= i[0]; m10 *= i[1]; m11 *= i[1]; m12 *= i[1]; m20 *= i[2]; m21 *= i[2]; m22 *= i[2]; if (abs(scale[0]/scale[1]-1)>0.0001 || abs(scale[1]/scale[2]-1)>0.0001) console.warn(\"non uniformly scaled matrix !\", scale); } // Return a pure rotation (in motor format) return normalize( m00 + m11 + m22 > 0 ?

[m02 - m20, m01 + m10, 1.0 + m11 - m00 - m22, m12 + m21, 0,0,0,0]:[m10 - m01, m02 + m20, m12 + m21, 1.0 + m22 - m00 - m11, 0,0,0,0]); } export const fromMatrix = M => { // Shorthand. var [m00,m01,m02,m03,m10,m11,m12,m13,m20,m21,m22,m23,m30,m31,m32,m33] = M; // Return rotor as translation * rotation return gp_mm( [1,0,0,0,-0.5*m30,-0.5*m31,-0.5*m32,0], fromMatrix3([m00,m01,m02,m10,m11,m12,m20,m21,m22]) ); } These conversions are run on all of the matrices in our imports, at load time. Handling uniform scaling. PGA motors, in contrast with 4x4 matrices, do not incorporate scaling, as it clearly is not a rigid body transformation. Scaling, and specifically uniform scaling is however commonly used in scene graphs to scale resources coming from potentially different sources and authored in different absolute sizes. While less than 0.5 0.5% of the almost 400 random glTF files tested had any animation on the scale, quite a large number of them has some fixed uniform scale applied. The advantage of uniform scaling is that it is invariant to both rotations and translations, and as a result it requires only one floating point number per node, where each element's total scale is simply the product of its own scale and that of its parent. Our implementations tracks scaling in this manner, applying the total scale to the vertices either at load time or as first step in the vertex shader, and applying the parent scale to the translations, again at load time and when updating animations. The impact of incorporating uniform scaling like this is absolutely minimal, enabling us to cover almost all existing content without abandoning the PGA motor efficiency. Handling non-uniform scaling. For non uniform scaling the situation is trickier - in the scenario where non-uniform scaling is used, ultimately a fall-back to 4x4 matrices is unavoidable. A non-uniform scale is not invariant to rotations, and tracking these scales as we did in the uniform case is tedious. However, again from our sample of glTF files, we could only find non-uniform scale applied on leaf nodes. (and given the problems caused by non-uniform scaling, this is not unexpected). For such a scenario, animation keys are not impacted and we simply apply the non-uniform scale separately before the rest of the transformations. Forward Rendering. Armed with our fully stocked PGA toolbox, we can now tackle the actual rendering task. Guided by the reference implementation provided by Khronos, let us revisit those places where matrices are the defacto solution. The general idea of a forward renderer, is to transform all mesh geometry, and determining for each triangle which pixels it covers. This is to be contrasted with a ray tracing approach where one starts from a ray throuh a pixel and determines which triangles it hits. In a typical forward rendering setup the transformation of the mesh from its specification in object space to its position on the screen is usually handled by a set of matrices called the model, view and projection matrices. Model - View - Projection. Our conversion at load time of all matrices and transformations into PGA motors, is already a substantial optimization on the amount of computation needed to update the scene graph hierarchy. For complex setups many composition operators are required, and the gain of switching to motors is obvious. However, while the CPU is concerned with producing updated transformations, the GPU has the task of applying these transformations to the vertices, normals and tangents that make up our mesh, and as we've seen, the computational complexity involved appears to make our motors a disadvantage. As we will soon discover, the situation is more subtle, and at this point we push through, replacing the model and view matrices with motors, and using the above defined sandwich products to transform the incoming vertex attributes. vec3 worldPosition = sw_mp( toWorld, attrib_position ); vec3 worldNormal = sw_md( toWorld, attrib_normal ); vec4 worldTangent = vec4(sw_md( toWorld, attrib_tangent.xyz ), attrib_tangent.w); For the projection matrix, the situation is different. The typical 4x4 projection matrix has only 5 non-zero entries, and even without PGA it is much more performant to simply write out the resulting expression. The same simply holds here and we use a standard projection function for this. vec4 project( const float n, const float f, const float minfov, float aspect, vec3 inpos ){ float cthf = cos(minfov/2.0) / sin(minfov/2.0); // cotangent of half the minimal fov. float fa = 2.*f*n/(n-f), fb = (n+f)/(n-f); // all of these can be precomputed constants. vec2 fit = cthf * vec2(-1.0/aspect, 1.0); // fit vertical. return vec4( inpos.xy * fit, fa - fb*inpos.z, inpos.z ); } With our basic transformations all setup, let us turn our attention to one of todays most common shading techniques, tangent space normal mapping. Tangent Space Normalmapping. Vertex Shader For a tangent space normal-mapped mesh, the vertex shader needs to transform the position, the normal, and the tangent vector. So it seems unavoidable that our choice for PGA means we are incurring the higher transformation cost threefold. However, the normal, tangent and bitangent vector together form an orthonormal frame. In PGA, any orthonormal frame is related to the canonical basis frame through a 𝑘 k-reflection. When 𝑘 k is even, these are just the rotation-only motors we encountered before (isomorphic to the quaternions), and when 𝑘 k is odd, this k-reflection instead represents a similar rotation followed by one extra reflection. This implies that we can remove both the normal and the tangent vectors from our vertex description, replacing them instead by a tangentRotor, which represents the rotation from the basis frame to the desired tangent frame. Such a tangentRotor 𝑅 R in fact double-covers all possible tangent frames in the sense that both 𝑅 R and − 𝑅 −R produce the same transformation. We can use this double covering to disambiguate even and odd k-reflections, simply by making sure the sign of the scalar coefficient of 𝑅 R matches the classical handedness flag. Note that in doing so, we piggy-back on the IEE754 floating point specification, that is we depend on the signed representation of zero. In the vertexshader we can then unambigously extract the original sign using float handedness = sign(1/tangentRotor.x) Combining all this, we conclude that we can reduce our vertex descriptor for the most common tangent space normalmapping setup from 12 floats (3 position, 3 normal, 4 tangent, 2 uv) down to 9 (3 position, 4 tangentRotor, 2 uv). That is a substantial save, which is implemented at loadtime, converting loaded normal and tangent vectors with: // Normalize, Orthogonalize normal = normalize( normal ); tangent = normalize( sub(tangent, mul(normal, dot(normal,tangent) ) ) ); // Calculate the bitangent. let bitangent = normalize(cross(normal, tangent)); // Now setup the matrix explicitely. let mat = [...tangent, ...bitangent, ...normal]; // Convert to motor and store. let motor = fromMatrix3( mat ); // Use the double cover to encode the handedness. // in GA language, this means we are using half of the double cover to distinguish even and odd versors. if (Math.sign(motor[0])!=tangents[i*4+3]) motor = motor.map(x=>-x); But there is more good news. Recall that using 4x4 matrices, the transformation of position, normal and tangent includes 3 matrix vector products, totalling 48 multiplications and 36 additions. In the PGA version, we can however transform the entire tangent frame in one go, for a cost of just 16 multiplications and 12 additions. After which we can in fact extract the worldspace normal and tangent directly with just 9 multiplications and 8 additions using : // 9 muls, 8 adds void extractNormalTangent( motor a, out direction normal, out direction tangent ) { float yw = a[0].y * a[0].w; float xz = a[0].x * a[0].z; float zz = a[0].z * a[0].z; normal = direction( yw - xz, a[0].z*a[0].w + a[0].y*a[0].x, 0.5 - zz - a[0].y*a[0].y ); tangent = direction( 0.5 - zz - a[0].w*a[0].w, a[0].z*a[0].y - a[0].x*a[0].w, yw + xz ); } Add to that the 21 multiplications and 18 additions needed to transform the vertex position, and another multiplication to extract the handedness, and we come to the remarkable conclusion that in order to transform a vertex with full tangent frame to world space, our PGA approach needs only (16 + 9 + 21 + 1 = 47) multiplications and (12 + 8 + 18 = 38) additions. That is nearly identical to the 48 multiplications and 36 additions that would be required if we use 4x4 matrices and normal and tangent vectors instead. PGA motors can be just as fast as 4x4 matrices to transform your mesh vertices !!! method floats/vertex floats/transform multiplications additions Matrix + normal + tangent 12 32 48 36 Motor + tangentRotor 9 -25% 8 -75% 47 38 The resulting code block in the vertexshader now becomes // Now transform our vertex using the motor from object to worldspace. worldPosition = sw_mp(toWorld, attrib_position); // Concatenate the world motor and the tangent frame. motor tangentRotor = gp_rr( toWorld, motor(attrib_tangentRotor,vec4(0.)) ); // Next, extract world normal and tangent from the tangentFrame rotor. extractNormalTangent(tangentRotor, worldNormal, worldTangent.xyz); worldTangent.w = sign(1.0 / attrib_tangentRotor.x); // trick to disambiguate negative zero! At this point, no changes to the fragment shader are required, making this a drop-in replacement that can be used in any existing engine. Fragment Shader If we want to be able to load existing content, this is the point where we have to resort back to the TBN matrix. The reason for this is clear. When baking the high detail mesh onto the low detail mesh, the baking tool has interpolated vertex normal and tangent vectors over the face of each triangle. From these (no longer normalized or orthogonal) vectors, at each fragment, an orthogonal TBN matrix is constructed, and used to transform the high detail world space normal to the tangent space normal that is stored in the texture. This process of interpolating basis vectors introduces an error that is typical for matrices, and unfortunately this error is thus literally baked into the textures. This is why we opted to indeed extract the normal and tangent vectors explicitely from the tangentRotor. However, for scenarios where one controls the baking tool, we can do better still. In these cases we could just pass the tangentRotor unmodified to the fragmentShader, where it can be normalized and used to transform the sampled normal, without ever constructing a tbn matrix. In this scenario, we would save even more, removing the need to extract normal and tangent in the vertex shader, requiring one less varying parameter, and removing the need for expensive orthogonalisation in the fragment shader. Motor Skinning. With PGA motors isomorphic to the dual quaternions, skinning is an obvious candidate for our PGA approach. After converting inverse bind matrices to their motor equivalent, the skinning code for our motors follows the well known pattern from dual quaternion skinning : // Grab the 4 bone motors. motor b1 = motors[int(attrib_joints.x)]; motor b2 = motors[int(attrib_joints.y)]; motor b3 = motors[int(attrib_joints.z)]; motor b4 = motors[int(attrib_joints.w)]; // Blend them together, always use short path. motor r = attrib_weights.x * b1; if (dot(r[0],b2[0])<=0.0) b2 = -b2; r += attrib_weights.y * b2; if (dot(r[0],b3[0])<=0.0) b3 = -b3; r += attrib_weights.z * b3; if (dot(r[0],b4[0])<=0.0) b4 = -b4; r += attrib_weights.w * b4; // Now renormalize and combine with object to world toWorld = gp(toWorld, normalize_m(r)); Note how just as for dual quaternions, we make sure that any transformation that is blended in follows the shortest arc, and renormalize the resulting transformation. Animation Blending For animation blending, the same technique is used, directly blending and renormalizing PGA motors on the CPU. Idle Idle2 Failure Success Talk Walk Idle Idle2 Failure Success Talk Walk Conclusion This project started off with the goal to demonstrate it is indeed possible to implement a forward renderer using PGA exclusively. What we found is that, not only is this possible, the common understanding that this would come at the cost of more expensive transformations turns out to be much more subtle. The resulting improvements are both unexpected and quite spectacular, especially on the memory footprint where an extra 33% vertices in the same storage is quite a significant improvement. This technique can readily be deployed into other existing 3D engines, at virtually no cost on the vertex shader and without modifications to the rest of the pipeline.

That's it. Most intros present geometric product of two vectors: (x1*i + y1*j) * (x2*i + y2*j) as some deep mysterious thing, but its just the same FOIL polynomial multiplication you learned in freshman algebra: (x1*i + y1*i)(x2*i+y2*j) = x1*x2*i*i + x1*y2*i*j + y1*x2*j*i + y1*y2*j*j = (x1*x2 + y1*y2) + (x1*y2 - y2*x1)*i*j The quantity in the first parenthesis, above, is the our old familiar dot product. The quantity in the second parenthesis is our old friend the cross product, but expressed in a new dimension whose basis is i*j, and which--unlike the cross product--generalizes to any number of dimensions. In GA its called the \"wedge product\". Once you \"get\" that, you find that doing things like deriving rotation formulas, etc, become easy, because you can apply all the skills you developed in algebra to solving geometric problems. reply simpaticoder 13 hours agoparentIn another comment, they pointed out https://youtu.be/htYh-Tq7ZBI?si=lOmsCL2DoqUCQgh1&t=1540 in which Freya did an excellent job reducing the number of axioms to 1: If you define multiplying a vector by itself to be equal to the length of the vector, squared, then everything else falls out of simple polynomial multiplication.

A few days ago someone asked why math classes don’t the how and why and rather tend to just present the formulas for the operations and tell people to compute. Here you are focusing on what the operations do rather than on why they work. It’s an interesting contrast and one that teachers of mathematics have to balance. The two questions, How does it work? Why does it work? Can’t always both be answered well in a given course. reply ajkjk 5 hours agorootparentI think there's a big difference between \"presenting a formula\" and \"presenting rules for doing calculations\". People are very good at extrapolating complicated results from a few simple rules: that's why taking derivatives and doing (elementary) integrals is fairly easy and also fairly easy to remember a long time after you've taken a calculus course. On the other hand, a bunch of literal miscellaneous formulas is very hard to hold on to --- for instance that's how introductory physics is taught, a bunch of disjoint relationships that you have to make sense of in your mind to make any use of. In fact all anyone really wants for vector calculus is a bunch of \"tools\" they can use that will generally give the right answer if applied mindlessly. I think that's why GA is relatively popular, because it says how to do basic geometric operations (rotations, reflections, etc) without any thought. reply rhelz 14 hours agorootparentprev// focusing on what the operations do rather than why // YMMV, of course, but in general, I always found it easier to understand the why once I understood the what and the how, rather than the other way around. reply skhunted 11 hours agorootparentYes.

Exterior product can work in any higher dimension. A cross product of two 3D vectors is another vector, perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors. The exterior product is a 2-vector (thus bivector) that sweeps the parallelogram between the two vectors; it's on the plane containing the two vectors. In 3D, the cross product vector is perpendicular to bivector plane. reply noqc 14 hours agoparentprevOne of the things that it takes the longest to learn in mathematics is that most things are defined in the dumbest way possible. In particular, if (over a vector space V) you want to define a bilinear product m:V x V -> V, this is exactly the same thing as deciding on m just over pairs of basis vectors. If I were to call that \"the universal property of the tensor product\", you'd probably say \"uh huh\". reply ndriscoll 12 hours agorootparentIt's annoyingly one of those things that once you understand, you can't see how you didn't understand it before. e.g. the tensor algebra (aka free algebra) over a vector space is \"just\" the dumbest possible multiplication: if i and j are basis vectors, then i*j = i⊗j. No further simplification possible. j*i*i*j = j⊗i⊗i⊗j, etc. with associativity and distributivity and linearity: (5i+3j)*k = 5i⊗k + 3j⊗k, etc. Then, if you have a dot product, a Clifford algebra is \"just\" the tensor algebra with a single simple extra reduction rule: For a vector v, v*v = v⋅v. So now e.g. `kjiijl = kj(i⋅i)jl = kjjl = k(j⋅j)l = kl = k⊗l`, which can't be reduced further. The real magic is that it turns out you can prove[0] that ij=-ji for two basis vectors i,j, so e.g. (ij)^2 = ijij = -ijji = -ii = -1. So `ij` is a square root of -1, as is `ik` and `jk` (but they're different square roots of -1), and you get things like complex numbers or quaternions for free, and suddenly a ton of geometry appears (with `ij` corresponding to a chunk of plane in the same way a basis vector `i` is a chunk of line/arrow. `ijk` becomes a chunk of volume. etc.). But it's all \"just\" the dumbest possible multiplication plus v*v = v⋅v. [0] Proof: (i+j)^2 = i^2+ij+ji+j^2 = 1+ij+ji+1 = 2+ij+ji. But also (i+j)^2 = (i+j)⋅(i+j) = i⋅(i+j) + j⋅(i+j) = 2. So 2 = 2+ij+ji, so ij=-ji. reply ajkjk 5 hours agorootparentPedantic nitpick: it's not the dumbest possible multiplication; it's the dumbest possible bilinear multiplication. There are \"freer\" free products on vectors than tensor product; the freest possible one is their Cartesian product as sets, which just makes a tuple out of them ij = (i, j). If you regarded the resulting sets as a vector space, it would not be true that i0 + 0j = (i, 0) + (0, j) ≠ (i, j). The tensor product is the freest that is well-behaved as a vector space in the sense that it respects the underlying scalar operations from its arguments. reply Nevermark 8 hours agorootparentprevIn your proof, doesn't i⋅(i+j) + j⋅(i+j) = (1+ij) + (ji+1) = 2 + ij + ji, not 2? What am I missing? I think ij = -ji is an independent axiom. reply ndriscoll 8 hours agorootparentIt's dot products there, which are also distributive. So i⋅i + i⋅j + j⋅i + j⋅j = 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2. We got dot products from the fact that v^2 = v⋅v for any vector v (so in particular, i+j). Then dot products are linear so you can expand that out. So basically the proof compares using FOIL on geometric products to FOIL on dot products. Note that `ij` is not a vector; it's a tensor (or \"multivector\" and in particular a \"blade\" in the GA lingo). The dot product reduction only applies to vectors from the original space. But i, j, and i+j are vectors. For simplicity and practically this is all over real vector spaces. You can make similar definitions with other fields, but you have to be careful when working mod 2. For simplicity I'm also using an orthonormal basis. You also need to be a bit more careful if working with e.g. special relativity where your timelike basis vector t has t⋅t=-1 (though you can see things still work). reply cassepipe 2 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing that intuition reply corysama 16 hours agoprevIt's fun that there have been many approaches to interpolating rotations (geometric algebra, quaternions, even full-matrix interpolation [1]).

Requiring up to 2^n terms for what was an n-dimensional space seems a bit hard to deal with. It seems like it should be better able to deal with geometry (i.e. inner products), but I've never really found a good argument why you wouldn't just use the wedge product and the hodge star (or musical isomorphisms). Even something 'magic' like turning a bivector \"u^v\" into a rotation in that plane \"e^(u^v)t\" is essentially just using the musical isomorphism to turn the 2-form u^v into a linear automorphism, allowing you to make sense of \"e^(u^v)t\" as a matrix exponential. Another example that often gets mentioned is the ability to turn maxwell's equations into a single equation, but since the use of differential forms already makes it possible to summarize it into two equations which hold for very different reasons I never understood the utility of combining them into one equation. reply rhelz 14 hours agoparent// Requiring up to 2^n terms for what was an n-dimensional space// Sometimes, the economy is illusory, e.g. normal vectors transform differently than position vectors do.

What irks me is that the magnetic part of the Maxwell equations is 0 for geometrical reasons, whereas the electrical part is 0 for physical reasons (roughly speaking the curvature of the potential is proportional to the current). Putting them in one equations makes it seem as if you could have something other than 0 on the magnetic side, which is impossible without fundamentally changing the topology of spacetime. Treating them uniformly is a mistake in my opinion. reply adrian_b 56 minutes agorootparentYou think this way because you do not pair in the right way the Maxwell equations. The divergence equations are not paired. The same for the curl equations. Pairing the equations in the wrong way can actually lead to errors in the relativistic case. Two equations are intrinsic properties of the electromagnetic field because it is derived from a potential, i.e. the null condition for the divergence of the magnetic field and Faraday's law of induction. The other two equations are what you call \"physical\", i.e. they show the relationship between the electromagnetic field and its sources, i.e. electric current and electric charge. Alternatively, if you use potentials to describe the electromagnetic field, which is better in my opinion, you just have the relations between potentials and their sources (together with the conservation law for the electric charge). With potentials, you can get rid of the \"geometrical\" relations (though the choice of potentials is not unique). reply chombier 13 hours agorootparentprevA somewhat simpler way of keeping track in the case of normals is to use row vectors for, well, covectors, which is what normals are anyways.

Happily, in most cases it will also either be the fastest way to calculate it, or close enough to not be the bottleneck.

If you rotate around just one axis, the Lie algebra feels just like Euler angles .. in fact its exactly the same thing, but if you rotate around more than one .. it keeps working intuitively and usably - Euler angles absolutely do not. reply hn8305823 14 hours agorootparentAlso, the use case for quaternions depends on how many times you will be applying the same rotation. If it's a few or dozens of times then maybe not the most efficient. If it's million or billions then you are going to want to use quaternions. This is mainly due to the cost of converting to and from the rotation vector. reply xeonmc 12 hours agorootparenti.e. keep it in vector form if you're combining them a lot, convert to polar form when you want to work with angles reply hgomersall 2 hours agoparentprevIn exponentiated form, a GA rotor can be specified to spin as many times as you like, rotating continuously in the plane by the angle you specify.

    "title": "Why Choose Firefox: A Detailed Exploration",
    "originLink": "https://xn--ime-zza.eu/3",
    "originBody": "Why I use Firefox February 26, 2024 Questions like “Which browser should I use?” regularly come up on the r/browsers subreddit. I sometimes respond to these posts, but my quick replies usually only contain one or two points. To be honest, until recently I wasn’t even sure myself why I use Firefox. Of course it’s a pretty good browser, but that doesn’t explain why I’ve stubbornly stayed loyal to Firefox for more than a decade. After giving it a bit more thought, I came up with the following reasons. 1. The about:config page In Firefox, there is an internal about:config page with thousands (tens of thousands?) of individual configs that can be freely edited by the user. If you don’t like a particular UI element or behavior in Firefox, there’s a good chance that you can change it with a config. The about:config page is also used to individually enable experimental web platform features (without requiring a browser restart like in Chrome). Here are some of the configs that I’ve edited or added: devtools.toolbox.zoomValue = 1.2 increases the default text size in Firefox devtools to 120% browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab = false prevents the entire browser window from closing when the user closes the last tab (I find this behavior annoying) devtools.inspector.showUserAgentStyles = true shows user-agent styles in the CSS Rules pane in Firefox devtools (why are user-agent styles hidden by default?) browser.chrome.guess_favicon = false stops Firefox from attempting to load the website’s favicon from the default location when an icon is not declared in the HTML document (I use this config to get rid of the distracting ”favicon not found” errors in the devtools console) browser.urlbar.resultMenu.keyboard­Accessible = false removes menu buttons from the individual items in the URL bar dropdown list (those buttons make tabbing through the items slower) 2. Mozilla cannot decrypt my data on their servers All the major browsers have a feature for syncing the user’s browsing data across devices (Firefox Sync, Chrome Sync, Apple iCloud, and so on). The user’s data is stored on the browser vendor’s servers, and this data is of course encrypted. But can the browser vendor decrypt this data? Google can. Apple claims that they can’t, but they have disclosed user data to law enforcement in the past, so I don’t trust them. Mozilla says that they can’t, and I trust them. It seems that Mozilla goes out of their way to make absolutely sure that they can’t access the synced browsing data of Firefox users. The encryption is strong enough that with current technology it would take trillions of years to break into this data, so it’s pretty safe. However, if I somehow managed to lose all my devices where I’ve activated Firefox Sync, my browsing data on Mozilla’s servers would be lost forever; there would be no way of recovering it. Still, I like the idea of using a browser from a company that does not want to access my data on their own servers. I feel like this is how it should be. 3. Translating web pages is also completely private Firefox Translations is a relatively new feature that allows users to translate web pages to a different language (from a small set of supported languages) directly in the browser, without sending any data to any servers. This feature is based on machine learning and neural networks. This is another example of Mozilla going the extra mile to protect the user’s privacy. 4. Mozilla develops their own browser engine Firefox uses Mozilla’s Gecko browser engine. No other major browser uses Gecko. The web is my favorite platform, and since a diversity of browser engines is good for the web*, I want to support Gecko. By using Firefox and reporting Firefox and web compat bugs, I’m doing my part. *Allow me to quote Google’s F.A.Q. from 2013 when they forked WebKit: Hold up, isn't more browsers sharing WebKit better for compatibility? It's important to remember that WebKit is already not a homogenous target for developers. For example, features like WebGL and IndexedDB are only supported in some WebKit-based browsers. Understanding WebKit for Developers helps explain the details, like why , fonts and 3D transforms implementations vary across WebKit browsers. Today Firefox uses the Gecko engine, which isn’t based on WebKit, yet the two have a high level of compatibility. We’re adopting a similar approach to Mozilla by having a distinct yet compatible open-source engine. We will also continue to have open bug tracking and implementation status so you can see and contribute to what we’re working on at any time. From a short-term perspective, monocultures seem good for developer productivity. From the long-term perspective, however, monocultures inevitably lead to stagnation. It is our firm belief that more options in rendering engines will lead to more innovation and a healthier web ecosystem. How does this affect web standards? Bringing a new browser engine into the world increases diversity. Though that in itself isn't our goal, it has the beneficial effect of ensuring that multiple interoperable implementations of accepted standards exist. Each engine will approach the same problem from a different direction, meaning that web developers can be more confident in the performance and security characteristics of the end result. It also makes it less likely that one implementation's quirks become de facto standards, which is good for the open web at large. I couldn’t have said it better. We currently have three major browser engines—and a couple of smaller ones in development—and of those three, Gecko is the only one that may be at risk. I’m not sure what Gecko’s conservation status would be if it were a real animal (probably “Conservation Dependent”), but I don't plan on giving up on it anytime soon. 5. The best support for extensions on Android The web has unfortunately become slower and more annoying over the past decade. Extensions that block ads and other types of problematic content have become necessary to have a normal web browsing experience. On Android, Firefox has by far the best support for browser extensions. This includes uBlock Origin (the best ad-blocker) and extensions for adding user styles and user scripts to websites. I actively use all of these extensions (uBlock Origin, Stylus, Tampermonkey) on desktop to tweak websites to my liking. It is awesome that Firefox users on Android can do the same. 6. A great picture-in-picture player I should probably finally mention an actual feature in Firefox that a regular user might find useful. I don’t really use Firefox for its general features, but if there’s one such feature that I really like, it’s the native picture-in-picture video player in desktop Firefox, which is superb. It has everything that one could ask for. It can be quickly opened via an overlay button that is shown when hovering any video. It can be resized and positioned anywhere on the screen. It has the full controls, including pause, mute, and the seek bar for skipping to any point in the video. I use it all the time. In summary I trust Mozilla more than I trust Google, Apple, Microsoft, or any other company that makes web browsers. This trust is based on the fact that Mozilla chooses the highest level of user privacy when developing services such as Firefox Sync, Firefox Translate, and others. A web browser is an integral part of a person’s online life, so it makes sense to choose a browser from a company that one trusts the most. In addition to that, Firefox offers the highest level of customization, whether it’s through browser extensions or internal configs. This is important to me because I prefer websites over native apps. Any great feature, such as the picture-in-picture player, is just the cherry on top. I understand that for most people it’s probably the other way around. They care about features more than they care about privacy and customization. That is fine. There is no wrong answer. Everyone should use the browser that serves them best. Reply on Mastodon",

    "originBody": "Search for Life The mathematically perfect exoplanet system — a great place to search for alien tech News By Sharmila Kuthunur published 3 days ago \"Even if it is a negative result, that still tells us something.\" Comments (2) The six planets orbit their central star HD 110067 in a harmonic rhythm with planets aligning every few orbits. (Image credit: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Thibaut Roger/NCCR PlanetS) Late last year, astronomers discovered a fascinating star system only 100 light-years away from us. Its six sub-Neptune planets circle very close to their host star in mathematically perfect orbits, piquing the interest of scientists searching for alien technology, or technosignatures, which they argue would offer compelling evidence of advanced life beyond Earth. To be clear, no such evidence was found in the system, dubbed HD 110067. However, the researchers say they're not done looking yet. HD 11067 remains an interesting target for similar observations in the future. In our own tiny pocket of the cosmos, radio waves from satellites and telescopes beaming out in the plane of our solar system, meaning that if somebody outside our solar system watched Earth cross the face of our sun, they'd maybe be able to pick up a signal that coincides with the planet's transit. Related: This rare exoplanet system has 6 'sub-Neptunes' with mathematically perfect orbits HD 110067 is viewed edge on from Earth, so we are seeing the six planets in the plane of their system — a view that gives us an excellent chance of picking up such a signal if there exists one, study co-author Steve Croft, a radio astronomer working with the life-searching Breakthrough Listen program at the University of California, Berkeley, told Space.com \"Our technology in our own solar system has spread outside the habitable zone,\" Croft told Space.com. So technology-friendly civilization in HD 110067, if any, may have communication relays set up on multiple planets in the system, he said. \"Even if it is a negative result, that still tells us something.\" When HD 110067's discovery was announced, Croft and his team used the world's largest fully steerable telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia, and searched the system for signs of alien technology. The researchers looked for signals that were continuously present when the telescope was pointed at the system and absent when directed away, the smoking gun of technosignatures local to HD 110067. But such signals are difficult to distinguish from natural sources of radio waves and humankind's own technological signals, such as radio waves beaming from cell phones connected to Wi-Fi, SpaceX's Starlink satellite network in low Earth orbit. This creates a haystack of signals in which researchers look for a needle of a potential extraterrestrial signal, said Croft. \"I should add we don't know if there are needles in the haystack,\" he said. \"We don't really know what the needles look like.\" Despite this lack of sufficient knowledge of what alien technology looks like, the team employed a few techniques to ensure a detected signal is not local interference. For instance, if one were to build a transmitter in the hopes that somebody else would pick it up, that transmitter would pump a lot of energy into a narrow range of frequencies. Natural astrophysical phenomena, by contrast, beam radio waves across a much broader range. Signals from such a transmitter placed on a planet spinning around a foreign star would drift in time when observed from Earth, \"the same as when an ambulance goes past you, the sound of it shifts from very high to very low,\" study lead author Carmen Choza, an assistant researcher at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in California, told Space.com. The search ultimately did not detect a technological signal — however, the results do not eliminate the existence of technosignatures in HD 110067, Croft said, but rather tell us that no signal was beamed in our direction at the time of the observations. Meanwhile, the discovery team is refining the radii of the six detected planets using the European Space Agency's CHEOPS space telescope, and the planets' masses using HARPS-N and CARMENES instruments in Spain, Rafael Luque of the University of Chicago told Space.com. Accurate data on sizes and masses of the planets would shed more light onto the system's chemical makeup. Using that information, it may be possible to somewhat \"reverse engineer\" the evolution of the system and its planets to learn their formation mechanisms, the team had shared late last year.

In the case of life supporting planets though, it feels like we're trying to talk about the likelihood of rolling a given value when we haven't even determined whether the die has unique values on each face or not. If you're assuming that only one of the sides has a 3 on it, the interesting part is already over. yreg 2 hours agorootparentprevThrow a d6 six times and you probably won't see each value exactly once. reply thaumasiotes 1 hour agorootparentYes, I mentioned that in my comment, unless you believe that after seeing five rolls including a duplicate, adding a sixth might bring the total to six rolls with no duplicates. reply yreg 10 minutes agorootparentI refactored your comment. :) roenxi 10 hours agorootparentprevAnd with mathematically significant orbits, there is also the chance that some process stabilises to them which increases the chance of seeing them significantly.

So one solar system that has a division cycle of \"2/3, 2/3, 2/3, 3/4 and 3/4\" could be their representation of a value/\"bit pattern\" but written with planets in orbital mechanics, just like how we represent decimal 10 in binary 1010. as an aside, it is very easy to also ask \"why would humans spend so much energy taking silicate sand and turning it into intricate patterns at the size of angstroms and nano meters just to consume power? wouldn't it be easier to just let the sand organize itself into components as needed?\" of course, the answer seems obvious to us, but the question is analogous to yours. reply Etherlord87 9 hours agorootparentOr maybe, instead of using radio or a golden disc, the aliens decided to synchronize planets of some system (not necessarily theirs), in order to try to communicate intelligent life using the gravitational waves, so the message can reach much further - maybe even to other universes (there are various theories, that we might communicate with other universes in the multiverse using gravity, or maybe with the previous universe before the Big Bang...

It could be that what we're looking at on the planet surface is the output of a huge planet-sized radiator, with a civilization living in air-conditioned comfort underneath. But the problem with that theory is that you can't actually use the whole planet as a radiator. You can only use the space-facing side. You have to use the sun-facing side for energy harvesting. That temperature gradient would show up in the spectrum, and AFAIK it's not there. [UPDATE] I don't actually know if current exoplanet observing technology is capable of detecting such a temperature gradient, but given what I know we can observe I'd be a little surprised if it couldn't.

Resonances are very common. We have lots of resonances in our Solar system in all different places between bodies. For the resonance to be stable, two bodies do not need to have mathematically precise orbits in relation to each other. There is quite a wide margin for error. Once two planets are close enough to the resonance, the resonance may become stable due to feedback. What happens is planets will exchange energy back and forth on each orbit in a way, that preserves the resonance. A substantial input needs to be provided to break up the resonance. What is actually interesting about this particular system is the long chain of resonances. But that is also nothing super special -- once you know how resonances form you can see how all of the planets, when they are close enough to the resonance, will transfer energy between themselves to snap into it and then continue on their resonant orbits. There is absolutely no reason to suggest that a resonance like this must have come from unnatural origin. It would be like saying that because the period of our Moons rotation is so precisely the same as period of its orbit around Earth that it always faces Earth with one side, that somebody must have put the Moon on the orbit.

In real life, this is where I get a very intense look in my eye, and about 50% of the time, I can see that the person I'm speaking with has realized that they're now trapped in an hour-long conversation with me. I'll make it a short list of recent authors I've liked: - Adrian Tchaikovsky. He's best known for his Children of Time series, but his other scifi books are also excellent; I haven't read the fantasy ones. \"The Expert System's Brother\" is particularly excellent. - James Cambias. \"A Darkling Sea\" is a tremendously cool novel set at the bottom of an ocean under a moon's icy surface. Arkad's World has some very interesting world-building & aliens. And Corsair is a fun near-future technothriller about near-space and moon mining. - Stephen Baxter (author of the Xeelee Sequence) writes very good books, but just about none of them have a happy ending, and they're mostly grim - but very interesting. - It's not HN if I don't recommend Greg Egan, Peter Watts, and Neal Stephenson. reply nozzlegear 17 hours agorootparentChildren of Time is such a great series, one of my favorites. I really loved the two corvid characters in the latest book. Tchaikovsky really is a great sci-fi writer, I'd recommend his Shards of Earth trilogy. I'm also surprised to see somebody recommend A Darkling Sea! I don't think I've ever met someone else who's read it and recommended it before. The somewhat odd sidestory of the aliens who communicate through sex has turned off the couple people I've recommended it to from the story, pun not intended. reply pavel_lishin 17 hours agorootparentI am desperately trying to find the third book as a borrowable e-book at a library, but I'm coming up blank :/ reply digging 17 hours agorootparentprevThanks. I have yet to read the first 3, so I'll add them to the list. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll stumble into that art-project novel. reply pavel_lishin 17 hours agorootparentNone of those are that novel, but I gave the answer in base64 elsewhere in the thread! That particular novel isn't the author's best work, but it's decent - his other stuff is much, much better imo. reply dekhn 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm convinced Tchaikovsky must be a collection of writers or using a generative AI heavily because nobody can write that many interesting books in such a short time.

You'd also put it in orbit around a super stable dwarf star to maximize the useful life of the project. Even if they are planets, imperfect orbits lead to problems in the looooooong term. An alien civilization may forcibly alter the orbits of the planets in their solar system in order to stabilize it.

(You know, to get them to line up perfectly from the Earth's perspective, which clearly would be important.) But wait, that's not all. Not only are they so perfectly lined up, but they also put ONE of the stars just out of alignment, to show us exactly which star they came from, so we could go visit them.

The world's machines are now all AI-designed, prototyped, refined, produced, and distributed. The supply chain hasn't received human interference in over fifty years, and increasingly-accurate weather and tectonic predictions generated by computer algorithms have made supply chain errors obsolete. But humanity is dissatisfied. With no existential threats arising, people cannot find value in life. AI-generated entertainment satisfies no one, and because no algorithm can quantify \"originality,\" no machine would ever advise additional human involvement. There is only one area of human civilization where AI is not involved, and that's designing the CSS specification. \"But what if I want to position this element so that the ultraviolet radiation is displayed with variable additional intensity based on the size of the 3d projection on the latest gen virtual assistant, but only on Tuesdays? You can't possibly make me use javascript to account for something that common,\" bemoans one forum poster. What follows is chaos. Everyone has an opinion, some thinking that the treatment infrared got in 2190 was unfair to people with unmodified vision, others believing that the accessibility option prefers-visible-spectrum more than makes up for it. Still others want more robustness than simply prefers-visible-spectrum; there should be a native way to specify the exact wavelengths of light that one can see. Minimalists argue that when experiences are delivered directly to your brain, none of this matters, but no one likes that argument. The world hasn't experienced this large a conflict in hundreds of years, and it is unprepared.

Edit as a general response: Question answered, multiple times, thank you! Also, there my basic physics knowledge resurfaces, thank you for that as well! reply pavel_lishin 17 hours agorootparentThere is only one stable speed at which a planet can orbit in a circle; any slower, and it'll start falling in toward the star, and any faster and it'll start to move away from the star. The only way to vary the speed is a powered orbit, and that's not likely to happen with a planet. reply qup 17 hours agorootparentI respect that you reserved some room to be surprised. reply thfuran 17 hours agorootparentprevFor a given stellar mass and orbital radius (assuming a circular orbit), there's not really any wiggle room on how long the planet's orbital period is. Speeding up or slowing down the planet requires it to orbit at a different distance. If you meant the speed of a planet's rotation about its own axis, I guess the limit would basically be the point at which it tears itself apart by spinning so fast that its gravity no longer holds it together. reply TeMPOraL 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, but that would be dictated by how fast can it spin before shattering into pieces. So mostly gravity/composition thing, I'd imagine. Many things in solar systems are (postulated to) derive from the rotation of the protoplanetary disk, via conservation of angular momentum - however, planets can also get spun up or down after forming by e.g. collisions with other objects, including extra-system objects. reply hef19898 17 hours agorootparentJust realized, I meant orbit speed and not rotation aeound the planets axis. Shouldn't write in parallel to meetings... Your answer was very interesting so, thank you! reply TeMPOraL 17 hours agorootparentI see! In the other case, the answer is: velocity vector determines the orbit. For any given point at any given orbit, there's only one valid velocity vector relative to the star (direction and magnitude) - tweaking it tweaks the shape of the orbit.

It's just bad strategy, everyone within your galaxy knows you're there pretty much immediately when a star just up and disappears one day. Granted, the non-K2s just stare in awe maybe, but the other K2s will fuck your shit up. Can't exactly pack it up and run either, not with a medium-sized star in your suitcase. reply ben_w 17 hours agorootparentAnyone with only mildly better tech than we have now, can see your ecosystem changing over the course of the seasons before you invented fire, let alone built a Dyson swarm. We're just starting to have this capacity already in special cases, though we've not found any sign of an ecosystem, just \"boring\" diamond rain etc. A Dyson swarm will keep you safe from any threat smaller than another Dyson swarm — and while you may not be able to \"pack it up\", you can use one to run to other galaxies… in fact, almost all of them… at close enough to the same time that light cones matter… and get the settlers moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light… and have a lot of redundancy. reply jandrese 17 hours agorootparentprevI would assume it takes more than a day to build a Dyson sphere. But more to the point from a distant observer's viewpoint the star isn't going to just blink out. The Dyson sphere has to radiate just as much energy as the star produces, so it would probably appear just as a red dwarf. Unless the alien civilization has some way to destroy energy it will be in a constant battle to avoid cooking the inhabitants of the sphere. reply foofie 17 hours agorootparent> Unless the alien civilization has some way to destroy energy (...) If the point of a Dyson sphere is to collect energy, wouldn't it be enough to just use it or store it? reply ben_w 17 hours agorootparentTo use, not to collect. And thermodynamics appears to say you can't just store it. A stellar mass black hole might be an interesting \"cold end\" in this regard… if you can find or make one, but to do that you'd need to start with a Dyson swarm. reply foofie 16 hours agorootparent> To use, not to collect. And thermodynamics says you can't just store it. I don't think these semantic games are productive. Thermodynamics says you can transform energy. \"Collect\" in this context means using energy in a way that allows you to retrieve it in the future. For example, charging a battery or condenser with light with a PV panel, powering a motor that accelerates a flywheel, coiling a spring, heating a material, etc. reply jandrese 2 hours agorootparentUnless your civilization has ways of infinitely storing energy or exporting it somehow you'll need to be in equilibrium over the long term. This means radiating away the waste heat, at stellar scale. reply tastyfreeze 17 hours agorootparentprev> Can't exactly pack it up and run either, not with a medium-sized star in your suitcase.

    "originLink": "https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-2.1-OSS-Rejected",
    "originBody": "HDMI Forum Rejects Open-Source HDMI 2.1 Driver Support Sought By AMD Written by Michael Larabel in Radeon on 28 February 2024 at 03:37 PM EST. 93 Comments One of the limitations of AMD's open-source Linux graphics driver has been the inability to implement HDMI 2.1+ functionality on the basis of legal requirements by the HDMI Forum. AMD engineers had been working to come up with a solution in conjunction with the HDMI Forum for being able to provide HDMI 2.1+ capabilities with their open-source Linux kernel driver, but it looks like those efforts for now have concluded and failed. For three years there has been a bug report around 4K@120Hz being unavailable via HDMI 2.1 on the AMD Linux driver. Similarly, there have been bug reports like 5K @ 240Hz not possible either with the AMD graphics driver on Linux. As covered back in 2021, the HDMI Forum closing public specification access is hurting open-source support. AMD as well as the X.Org Foundation have been engaged with the HDMI Forum to try to come up with a solution to be able to provide open-source implementations of the now-private HDMI specs. AMD Linux engineers have spent months working with their legal team and evaluating all HDMI features to determine if/how they can be exposed in their open-source driver. AMD had code working internally and then the past few months were waiting on approval from the HDMI Forum... Sadly, the HDMI Forum has turned down AMD's request for open-source driver support. AMD Linux engineer Alex Deucher commented on the ticket: \"The HDMI Forum has rejected our proposal unfortunately. At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements.\" Thus a sad day for open-source GPU drivers with no apparent solution to safely implement HDMI 2.1+ functionality within open-source display drivers... Needless to say, open-source Linux advocates should try to use DisplayPort instead if at all possible. Update for added context [20:30 EST]: Further insult to the injury is also that it sounds like AMD spent months of engineering time prototyping code for showing HDMI 2.1+ features within their internal open-source AMDGPU codebase to provide for review to the HDMI Forum. If that never sees the light of day now, it's all a largely wasted effort of significant resources. As another tid-bit, in the early days of the open-source AMD driver effort there were concerns around exposing GPU video acceleration in the open-source driver as to not potentially compromise HDCP / digital video restrictions with MPEG-LA and the like... It's already been a decade since AMD open-sourced UVD video support. These HDMI headaches sound like much the same boat as their early days of open-source video acceleration. We'll see if AMD can find a compromise like implementing more bits within their (closed-source) firmware or some other blob protected by their PSP IP block or the like, but in any event today's news is very much a disappointment and means in the near-term there is unlikely to be any HDMI 2.1+ feature support in open-source drivers. So open-source supporters should be pursuing DisplayPort if at all possible for the best experience. 93 Comments",

    "originBody": "NOTE: This is in development; breaks in the API are bound to happen. What version of Zig to use 0.11.0 Getting Started With MicroZig I Want To Use MicroZig IMPORTANT: You don't have to clone this repository to get started! MicroZig uses a monorepo architecture, but provides a lot of different packages. If you just want to get started, head over to downloads.microzig.tech and download an example for the chip family you desire. We support several chip families like the RP2 family by RaspberryPi Foundation, STM32 by STMicroelectronics, and many others. Unpack the example, and run zig build in the resulting example folder gives you zig-out/firmware which contains the resulting files. Right now, you gotta figure out how to flash the MCU yourself, but as people say: Google is your friend. But you can also ask for help on our Discord server. I Want To Contribute To MicroZig IMPORTANT: Developer experience is degraded right now, and not really good. Windows isn't really a supported dev target and you got to expect some friction. There's a project for improving DX, feel free to grab tasks from there! Please see the project page, it’s used as a place to brainstorm and organize work in ZEG. There will be issues marked as good first issue or drafts for larger ideas that need scoping/breaking ground on. More words on contribution and development on MicroZig are further down below. Introduction This repo contains the infrastructure for getting started in an embedded Zig project; it \"gets you to main()\". Specifically, it offers: a single easy-to-use builder function that: generates your linker script sets up packages and startup code generalized interfaces for common devices, such as UART. device drivers for interacting with external hardware an uncomplicated method to define xref:interrupts[interrupts] Design For MicroZig internals please see the Design Document. Developing Right now, the developer experience is not optimal due to 0.11 not really supporting what we're doing at all. If you want to test your changes, you gotta to the following: Step 1: Install required python packages, either systemwide or via a virtual environment: # systemwide: [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ # using virtual environments: [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 -m venv .venv [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ . .venv/bin/activate # on linux, macos [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ . .venv/Scripts/activate # on windows [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ pip3 install -r tools/requirements.txt [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ Step 2: Create a deployment for local usage: [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/bundle.py --debug preparing environment... validating packages... loaded packages: * microzig-build * examples:microchip/avr * examples:... * microzig-core * microchip/avr * ... resolving inner dependencies... creating packages... bundling microzig-build... bundling microzig-core... bundling microchip/avr... ... [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ This command yields output in ./microzig-deploy that is meant to be fetched via http://localhost:8080/. Step 3: To serve the files on this port, you can start a pre-bundled web server: [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/demo-server.py ... This way, you spawn a local HTTP server that will serve ./microzig-deploy on port 8080 on your machine, and you can then start fetching packages from this. Now you can use curl to fetch the packages, or you can just create a local development project. Step 4: Create a local test environment This is basically done by unpacking an example from the ./microzig-deploy/examples folder, and starting to test changes. As the build.zig.zon has to be updated after running ./tools/bundle.py again, there's a script that helps here: tools/patch-build-zon.py can be used to patch/upgrade your development project inplace based on what it finds in ./microzig-deploy: [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/patch-build-zon.py /tmp/dev-project/build.zig.zon Updating hash of http://localhost:8080/packages/microzig-build.tar.gz to 12200040a36bbbb2fe09809861f565fcda9a10ec3064d70357aa40ad0a61596c16fb Updating hash of http://localhost:8080/packages/microzig-core.tar.gz to 122013a37ce9ac295303f26057c203e722b9ceaefa5b4403fe5a18ab065f03079e7d Updating hash of http://localhost:8080/packages/board-support/stmicro/stm32.tar.gz to 12207c278b78c5aeb08cd7889647d7d0d9a359cb28fe68105d2e43f85dabb3865981 [user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ Both compiling the local example and updating the build.zig.zon requires running the local development server.

    "originBody": "BYRON TAU BACKCHANNELFEB 27, 2024 6:00 AM How the Pentagon Learned to Use Targeted Ads to Find Its Targets—and Vladimir Putin Meet the guy who taught US intelligence agencies how to make the most of the ad tech ecosystem, \"the largest information-gathering enterprise ever conceived by man.\" ILLUSTRATION: ZHENYA OLIINYK IN 2019, A government contractor and technologist named Mike Yeagley began making the rounds in Washington, DC. He had a blunt warning for anyone in the country’s national security establishment who would listen: The US government had a Grindr problem. A popular dating and hookup app, Grindr relied on the GPS capabilities of modern smartphones to connect potential partners in the same city, neighborhood, or even building. The app can show how far away a potential partner is in real time, down to the foot. COURTESY OF PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE Buy This Book At: Amazon Bookshop.org Target If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. In its 10 years of operation, Grindr had amassed millions of users and become a central cog in gay culture around the globe. But to Yeagley, Grindr was something else: one of the tens of thousands of carelessly designed mobile phone apps that leaked massive amounts of data into the opaque world of online advertisers. That data, Yeagley knew, was easily accessible by anyone with a little technical know-how. So Yeagley—a technology consultant then in his late forties who had worked in and around government projects nearly his entire career—made a PowerPoint presentation and went out to demonstrate precisely how that data was a serious national security risk. As he would explain in a succession of bland government conference rooms, Yeagley was able to access the geolocation data on Grindr users through a hidden but ubiquitous entry point: the digital advertising exchanges that serve up the little digital banner ads along the top of Grindr and nearly every other ad-supported mobile app and website. This was possible because of the way online ad space is sold, through near-instantaneous auctions in a process called real-time bidding. Those auctions were rife with surveillance potential. You know that ad that seems to follow you around the internet? It’s tracking you in more ways than one. In some cases, it’s making your precise location available in near-real time to both advertisers and people like Mike Yeagley, who specialized in obtaining unique data sets for government agencies. Working with Grindr data, Yeagley began drawing geofences—creating virtual boundaries in geographical data sets—around buildings belonging to government agencies that do national security work. That allowed Yeagley to see what phones were in certain buildings at certain times, and where they went afterwards. He was looking for phones belonging to Grindr users who spent their daytime hours at government office buildings. If the device spent most workdays at the Pentagon, the FBI headquarters, or the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency building at Fort Belvoir, for example, there was a good chance its owner worked for one of those agencies. Then he started looking at the movement of those phones through the Grindr data. When they weren’t at their offices, where did they go? A small number of them had lingered at highway rest stops in the DC area at the same time and in proximity to other Grindr users—sometimes during the workday and sometimes while in transit between government facilities. For other Grindr users, he could infer where they lived, see where they traveled, even guess at whom they were dating. Intelligence agencies have a long and unfortunate history of trying to root out LGBTQ Americans from their workforce, but this wasn’t Yeagley’s intent. He didn’t want anyone to get in trouble. No disciplinary actions were taken against any employee of the federal government based on Yeagley’s presentation. His aim was to show that buried in the seemingly innocuous technical data that comes off every cell phone in the world is a rich story—one that people might prefer to keep quiet. Or at the very least, not broadcast to the whole world. And that each of these intelligence and national security agencies had employees who were recklessly, if obliviously, broadcasting intimate details of their lives to anyone who knew where to look.

And it wasn’t just Grindr, but rather any app that had access to a user’s precise location—other dating apps, weather apps, games. Yeagley chose Grindr because it happened to generate a particularly rich set of data and its user base might be uniquely vulnerable. A Chinese company had obtained a majority stake in Grindr beginning in 2016—amping up fears among Yeagley and others in Washington that the data could be misused by a geopolitical foe. (Until 1995, gay men and women were banned from having security clearances owing in part to a belief among government counterintelligence agents that their identities might make them vulnerable to being leveraged by an adversary—a belief that persists today.) But Yeagley’s point in these sessions wasn’t just to argue that advertising data presented a threat to the security of the United States and the privacy of its citizens. It was to demonstrate that these sources also presented an enormous opportunity in the right hands, used for the right purpose. When speaking to a bunch of intelligence agencies, there’s no way to get their attention quite like showing them a tool capable of revealing when their agents are visiting highway rest stops. MIKE YEAGLEY SAW both the promise and the pitfalls of advertising data because he’d played a key role in bringing advertising data into government in the first place. His 2019 road show was an attempt to spread awareness across the diverse and often siloed workforces in US intelligence. But by then, a few select corners of the intel world were already very familiar with his work, and were actively making use of it. Yeagley had spent years working as a technology “scout”—looking for capabilities or data sets that existed in the private sector and helping to bring them into government. He’d helped pioneer a technique that some of its practitioners would jokingly come to call “ADINT”—a play on the intelligence community’s jargon for different sources of intelligence, like the SIGINT (signals intelligence) that became synonymous with the rise of codebreaking and tapped phone lines in the 20th century, and the OSINT (open source intelligence) of the internet era, of which ADINT was a form. More often, though, ADINT was known in government circles as adtech data. Adtech uses the basic lifeblood of digital commerce—the trail of data that comes off nearly all mobile phones—to deliver valuable intelligence information. Edward Snowden’s 2013 leaks showed that, for a time, spy agencies could get data from digital advertisers by tapping fiber-optic cables or internet choke points. But in the post-Snowden world, more and more traffic like that was being encrypted; no longer could the National Security Agency pull data from advertisers by eavesdropping. So it was a revelation—especially given the public outcry over Snowden’s leaks—that agencies could just buy some of the data they needed straight from commercial entities. One technology consultant who works on projects for the US government explained it this way to me: “The advertising technology ecosystem is the largest information-gathering enterprise ever conceived by man. And it wasn’t built by the government.” MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU Everyone who possesses an iPhone or Android phone has been given an “anonymized” advertising ID by Apple or Google. That number is used to track our real-world movement, our internet browsing behavior, the apps we put on our phone, and much more. Billions of dollars have been poured into this system by America’s largest corporations. Faced with a commercially available repository of data this rich and detailed, the world’s governments have increasingly opened up their wallets to buy up this information on everyone, rather than hacking it or getting it through secret court orders. Here’s how it works. Imagine a woman named Marcela. She has a Google Pixel phone with the Weather Channel app installed. As she heads out the door to go on a jog, she sees overcast skies. So Marcela opens the app to check if the forecast calls for rain. By clicking on the Weather Channel’s blue icon, Marcela triggers a frenzy of digital activity aimed at serving her a personalized ad. It begins with an entity called an advertising exchange, basically a massive marketplace where billions of mobile devices and computers notify a centralized server whenever they have an open ad space. In less than the blink of an eye, the Weather Channel app shares a ream of data with this ad exchange, including the IP address of Marcela’s phone, the version of Android it's running, her carrier, plus an array of technical data about how the phone is configured, down to what resolution the screen resolution is set to. Most valuable of all, the app shares the precise GPS coordinates of Marcela’s phone and the pseudonymized advertising ID number that Google has assigned to her, called an AAID.

To the layperson, an advertising ID is a string of gibberish, something like bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912. To advertisers, it’s a gold mine. They know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 owns a Google Pixel device with the Nike Run Club app. They know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 often frequents Runnersworld.com. And they know that bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 has been lusting after a pair of new Vaporfly racing shoes. They know this because Nike, Runnersworld.com, and Google are all plugged into the same advertising ecosystem, all aimed at understanding what consumers are interested in. Advertisers use that information as they shape and deploy their ads. Say both Nike and Brooks, another running shoe brand, are trying to reach female running aficionados in a certain income bracket or in certain zip codes. Based on the huge amounts of data they can pull from the ether, they might build an “audience”—essentially a huge list of ad IDs of customers known or suspected to be in the market for running shoes. Then in an instantaneous, automated, real-time auction, advertisers tell a digital ad exchange how much they’re willing to pay to reach those consumers every time they load an app or a web page. There are some limits and safeguards on all this data. Technically, a user can reset their assigned advertising ID number (though few people do so—or even know they have one). And users do have some control over what they share, via their app settings. If consumers don’t allow the app they’re using to access GPS, the ad exchange can’t pull the phone’s GPS location, for example. (Or at least they aren’t supposed to. Not all apps follow the rules, and they are sometimes not properly vetted once they are in app stores.) MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU Moreover, ad exchange bidding platforms do minimal due diligence on the hundreds or even thousands of entities that have a presence on their servers. So even the losing bidders still have access to all the consumer data that came off the phone during the bid request. An entire business model has been built on this: siphoning data off the real-time bidding networks, packaging it up, and reselling it to help businesses understand consumer behavior. Geolocation is the single most valuable piece of commercial data to come off those devices. Understanding the movement of phones is now a multibillion-dollar industry. It can be used to deliver targeted advertising based on location for, say, a restaurant chain that wants to deliver targeted ads to people nearby. It can be used to measure consumer behavior and the effectiveness of advertising. How many people saw an ad and later visited a store? And the analytics can be used for planning and investment decisions. Where is the best location to put a new store? Will there be enough foot traffic to sustain such a business? Is the number of people visiting a certain retailer going up or down this month, and what does that mean for the retailer’s stock price? But this kind of data is good for something else. It has remarkable surveillance potential. Why? Because what we do in the world with our devices cannot truly be anonymized. The fact that advertisers know Marcela as bdca712j-fb3c-33ad-2324-0794d394m912 as they’re watching her move around the online and offline worlds offers her almost no privacy protection. Taken together, her habits and routines are unique to her. Our real-world movement is highly specific and personal to all of us. For many years, I lived in a small 13-unit walk-up in Washington, DC. I was the only person waking up every morning at that address and going to The Wall Street Journal’s offices. Even if I was just an anonymized number, my behavior was as unique as a fingerprint even in a sea of hundreds of millions of others. There was no way to anonymize my identity in a data set like geolocation. Where a phone spends most of its evenings is a good proxy for where its owner lives. Advertisers know this. Governments know this too. And Yeagley was part of a team that would try to find out how they could exploit it. IN 2015, A company called PlaceIQ hired Yeagley. PlaceIQ was an early mover in the location data market. Back in the mid-2000s, its founder, Duncan McCall, had participated in an overland driving race from London to Gambia across the land-mine-strewn Western Sahara. He had eschewed the usual practice of hiring an expensive Bedouin guide to help ensure safe passage through the area. Instead, he found online a GPS route that someone else had posted from a few days earlier on a message board. McCall was able to download the route, load it into his own GPS device, and follow the same safe path. On that drive through the Western Sahara, McCall recalled dreaming up the idea for what would become PlaceIQ to capture all of the geospatial data that consumers were emitting and generate insights. At first the company used data from the photo-sharing website Flickr, but eventually PlaceIQ started tapping mobile ad exchanges. It would be the start of a new business model—one that would prove highly successful. MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU Yeagley was hired after PlaceIQ got an investment from the CIA’s venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. Just as it had poured money into numerous social media monitoring services, geospatial data had also attracted In-Q-Tel’s interest. The CIA was interested in software that could analyze and understand the geographic movement of people and things. It wanted to be able to decipher when, say, two people were trying to conceal that they were traveling together. The CIA had planned to use the software with its own proprietary data, but government agencies of all kinds eventually became interested in the kind of raw data that commercial entities like PlaceIQ had—it was available through a straightforward commercial transaction and came with fewer restrictions on use inside government than secret intercepts. After acquiring a data set on Russia, the team realized they could track phones in the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s entourage. The phones moved everywhere that Putin did. While working there, Yeagley realized that the data itself might be valuable to the government, too. PlaceIQ was fine selling software to the government but was not prepared to sell its data to the feds. So Yeagley approached a different company called PlanetRisk—one of the hundreds and hundreds of tiny startups with ties to the US government dotted around office parks in Northern Virginia. In theory, a government defense contractor offered a more secure environment than a civilian company like PlaceIQ to do the kind of work he had in mind. PlanetRisk straddled the corporate world and the government contracting space—building products that were aimed at helping customers understand the relative dangers of various spots around the world. For example, a company that wanted to establish a store or an office somewhere in the world might turn to PlanetRisk to analyze data on crime, civil unrest, and extreme weather as they vary geographically. PlanetRisk hired Yeagley in 2016 as vice president of global defense—essentially a sales and business development job. The aim was for him to develop his adtech technology inside the contractor, which might try to sell it to various government agencies. Yeagley brought with him some government funding from his relationships around town in the defense and intelligence research communities. PlanetRisk’s earliest sales demo was about Syria: quantifying the crush of refugees flowing out of Syria after years of civil war and the advancing ISIS forces. From a commercial data broker called UberMedia, PlanetRisk had obtained location data on Aleppo—the besieged Syrian city that had been at the center of some of the fiercest fighting between government forces and US-backed rebels. It was an experiment in understanding what was possible. Could you even obtain location information on mobile phones in Syria? Surely a war zone was no hot spot for mobile advertising. But to the company’s surprise, the answer was yes. There were 168,786 mobile devices present in the city of Aleppo in UberMedia’s data set, which measured mobile phone movements during the month of December 2015. And from that data, they could see the movement of refugees around the world. The discovery that there was extensive data in Syria was a watershed. No longer was advertising merely a way to sell products; it was a way to peer into the habits and routines of billions. “Mobile devices are the lifeline for everyone, even refugees,” Yeagley said. PlanetRisk had sampled data from a range of location brokers—Cuebiq, X-Mode, SafeGraph, PlaceIQ, and Gravy Analytics—before settling on UberMedia. (The company has no relation to the rideshare app Uber.) UberMedia was started by the veteran advertising and technology executive Bill Gross, who had helped invent keyword-targeted ads—the kinds of ads that appear on Google when you search a specific term. UberMedia had started out as an advertising company that helped brands reach customers on Twitter. But over time, like many other companies in this space, UberMedia realized that it could do more than just target consumers with advertising. With access to several ad exchanges, it could save bid requests that contained geolocation information, and then it could sell that data. Now, this was technically against the rules of most ad exchanges, but there was little way to police the practice. At its peak, UberMedia was collecting about 200,000 bid requests per second on mobile devices around the world. MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU Just as UberMedia was operating in a bit of a gray zone, PlanetRisk had likewise not been entirely forthright with UberMedia. To get the Aleppo data, Yeagley told UberMedia that he needed the data as part of PlanetRisk’s work with a humanitarian organization—when in fact the client was a defense contractor doing research work funded by the Pentagon. (UberMedia’s CEO would later learn the truth about what Mike Yeagley wanted the data for. And others in the company had their own suspicions. “Humanitarian purposes” was a line met with a wink and nod around the company among employees who knew or suspected what was going on with Yeagley’s data contracts.) Either way, UberMedia wasn’t vetting its customers closely. It appeared to be more eager to make a sale than it was concerned about the privacy implications of selling the movement patterns of millions of people. When it came time to produce a demo of PlanetRisk’s commercial phone-tracking product, Yeagley’s 10-year-old daughter helped him come up with a name. They called the program Locomotive—a portmanteau of location and motive. The total cost to build out a small demo was about $600,000, put up entirely by a couple of Pentagon research funding arms. As the PlanetRisk team put Locomotive through the paces and dug into the data, they found one interesting story after another. In one instance they could see a device moving back and forth between Syria and the West—a potential concern given ISIS’s interest in recruiting Westerners, training them, and sending them back to carry out terrorist attacks. But as the PlanetRisk team took a closer look, the pattern of the device’s behavior indicated that it likely belonged to a humanitarian aid worker. They could track that person’s device to UN facilities and a refugee camp, unlikely locales for Islamic State fighters to hang out. They realized they could track world leaders through Locomotive, too. After acquiring a data set on Russia, the team realized they could track phones in the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s entourage. The phones moved everywhere that Putin did. They concluded the devices in question did not actually belong to Putin himself; Russian state security and counterintelligence were better than that. Instead, they believed the devices belonged to the drivers, the security personnel, the political aides, and other support staff around the Russian president; those people’s phones were trackable in the advertising data. As a result, PlanetRisk knew where Putin was going and who was in his entourage. There were other oddities. In one data set, they found one phone kept transiting between the United States and North Korea. The device would attend a Korean church in the United States on Sundays. Its owner appeared to work at a GE factory, a prominent American corporation with significant intellectual property and technology that a regime like Pyongyang would be interested in. Why was it traveling back and forth between the United States and North Korea, not exactly known as a tourist destination? PlanetRisk considered raising the issue with either the US intelligence agencies or the company but ultimately decided there wasn’t much they could do. And they didn’t necessarily want their phone-tracking tool to be widely known. They never got to the bottom of it. MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU Most alarmingly, PlanetRisk began seeing evidence of the US military’s own missions in the Locomotive data. Phones would appear at American military installations such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina and MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida—home of some of the most skilled US special operators with the Joint Special Operations Command and other US Special Operations Command units. They would then transit through third-party countries like Turkey and Canada before eventually arriving in northern Syria, where they were clustering at the abandoned Lafarge cement factory outside the town of Kobane. It dawned on the PlanetRisk team that these were US special operators converging at an unannounced military facility. Months later, their suspicions would be publicly confirmed; eventually the US government would acknowledge the facility was a forward operating base for personnel deployed in the anti-ISIS campaign. Even worse, through Locomotive, they were getting data in pretty close to real time. UberMedia’s data was usually updated every 24 hours or so. But sometimes, they saw movement that had occurred as recently as 15 or 30 minutes earlier. Here were some of the best-trained special operations units in the world, operating at an unannounced base. Yet their precise, shifting coordinates were showing up in UberMedia’s advertising data. While Locomotive was a closely held project meant for government use, UberMedia’s data was available for purchase by anyone who could come up with a plausible excuse. It wouldn’t be difficult for the Chinese or Russian government to get this kind of data by setting up a shell company with a cover story, just as Mike Yeagley had done. If you ever granted a weather app permission to know where you are, there is a good chance a log of your precise movements has been saved in some data bank that tens of thousands of total strangers have access to. That includes intelligence agencies. Initially, PlanetRisk was sampling data country by country, but it didn’t take long for the team to wonder what it would cost to buy the entire world. The sales rep at UberMedia provided the answer: For a few hundred thousand dollars a month, the company would provide a global feed of every phone on earth that the company could collect on. The economics were impressive. For the military and intelligence community, a few hundred thousand a month was essentially a rounding error—in 2020, the intelligence budget was $62.7 billion. Here was a powerful intelligence tool for peanuts. Locomotive, the first version of which was coded in 2016, blew away Pentagon brass. One government official demanded midway through the demo that the rest of it be conducted inside a SCIF, a secure government facility where classified information could be discussed. The official didn’t understand how or what PlanetRisk was doing but assumed it must be a secret. A PlanetRisk employee at the briefing was mystified. “We were like, well, this is just stuff we’ve seen commercially,” they recall. “We just licensed the data.” After all, how could marketing data be classified? Government officials were so enthralled by the capability that PlanetRisk was asked to keep Locomotive quiet. It wouldn’t be classified, but the company would be asked to tightly control word of the capability to give the military time to take advantage of public ignorance of this kind of data and turn it into an operational surveillance program. And the same executive remembered leaving another meeting with a different government official. They were on the elevator together when one official asked, could you figure out who is cheating on their spouse? Yeah, I guess you could, the PlanetRisk executive answered. BUT MIKE YEAGLEY wouldn’t last at PlanetRisk. As the company looked to turn Locomotive from a demo into a live product, Yeagley started to believe that his employer was taking the wrong approach. It was looking to build a data visualization platform for the government. Yet again, Yeagley thought it would be better to provide the raw data to the government and let them visualize it in any way they choose. Rather than make money off of the number of users inside government that buy a software license, Mike Yeagley wanted to just sell the government the data for a flat fee. MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU So Yeagley and PlanetRisk parted ways. He took his business relationship with UberMedia with him. PlanetRisk moved on to other lines of work and was eventually sold off in pieces to other defense contractors. Yeagley would land at a company called Aelius Exploitation Technologies, where he would go about trying to turn Locomotive into an actual government program for the Joint Special Operations Command—the terrorist-hunting elite special operations force that killed Osama bin Laden and Ayman Al Zarqawi and spent the past few years dismantling ISIS. Locomotive was renamed VISR, which stood for Virtual Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. It would be used as part of an interagency program and would be shared widely inside the US intelligence community as a tool to generate leads. By the time Yeagley went out to warn various security agencies about Grindr in 2019, VISR had been used domestically, too—at least for a short period of time when the FBI wanted to test its usefulness in domestic criminal cases. (In 2018, the FBI backed out of the program.) The Defense Intelligence Agency, another agency that had access to the VISR data, has also acknowledged that it used the tool on five separate occasions to look inside the United States as part of intelligence-related investigations. But VISR, by now, is only one product among others that sell adtech data to intelligence agencies. The Department of Homeland Security has been a particularly enthusiastic adopter of this kind of data. Three of its components—US Customs and Border Protection, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the US Secret Service —have bought more than 200 licenses from commercial ad tech vendors since 2019. They would use this data for finding border tunnels, tracking down unauthorized immigrants, and trying to solve domestic crimes. In 2023, a government inspector general chastised DHS over the use of adtech, saying that the department did not have adequate privacy safeguards in place and recommending that the data stop being used until policies were drawn. The DHS told the inspector general that they would continue to use the data. Adtech “is an important mission contributor to the ICE investigative process as, in combination with other information and investigative methods, it can fill knowledge gaps and produce investigative leads that might otherwise remain hidden,” the agency wrote in response. Other governments’ intelligence agencies have access to this data as well. Several Israeli companies—Insanet, Patternz, and Rayzone—have built similar tools to VISR and sell it to national security and public safety entities around the world, according to reports. Rayzone has even developed the capability to deliver malware through targeted ads, according to Haaretz. Which is to say, none of this is an abstract concern—even if you’re just a private citizen. I’m here to tell you if you’ve ever been on a dating app that wanted your location or if you ever granted a weather app permission to know where you are 24/7, there is a good chance a detailed log of your precise movement patterns has been vacuumed up and saved in some data bank somewhere that tens of thousands of total strangers have access to. That includes intelligence agencies. It includes foreign governments. It includes private investigators. It even includes nosy journalists. (In 2021, a small conservative Catholic blog named The Pillar reported that Jeffrey Burrill, the secretary general of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, was a regular user of Grindr. The publication reported that Burrill “visited gay bars and private residences while using a location-based hookup app” and described its source as “commercially available records of app signal data obtained by The Pillar.”) MOST POPULAR GEAR RIP Apple Car. This Is Why It Died AARIAN MARSHALL GEAR The Weird, Wacky Gizmos and Gadgets We Saw at MWC 2024 SIMON HILL BACKCHANNEL Nvidia Hardware Is Eating the World LAUREN GOODE GEAR All the Top New Gadgets at MWC 2024 JULIAN CHOKKATTU If you cheated on your spouse in the past few years and you were careless about your location data settings, there is a good chance there is evidence of that in data that is available for purchase. If you checked yourself into an inpatient drug rehab, that data is probably sitting in a data bank somewhere. If you told your boss you took a sick day and interviewed at a rival company, that could be in there. If you threw a brick through a storefront window during the George Floyd protests, well, your cell phone might link you to that bit of vandalism. And if you once had a few pints before causing a car crash and drove off without calling the police, data telling that story likely still exists somewhere. We all have a vague sense that our cell phone carriers have this data about us. But law enforcement generally needs to go get a court order to get that. And it takes evidence of a crime to get such an order. This is a different kind of privacy nightmare. I once met a disgruntled former employee of a company that competed against UberMedia and PlaceIQ. He had absconded with several gigabytes of data from his former company. It was only a small sampling of data, but it represented the comprehensive movements of tens of thousands of people for a few weeks. Lots of those people could be traced back to a residential address with a great deal of confidence. He offered me the data so I could see how invasive and powerful it was. What can I do with this—hypothetically? I asked. In theory, could you help me draw geofences around mental hospitals? Abortion clinics? Could you look at phones that checked into a motel midday and stayed for less than two hours? Easily, he answered. I never went down that road.

Are you seriously telling me that government phones of national security employees allow for the installation of apps that track your location and/or these employees are allowed to bring personal cell phones into these buildings? reply Jtsummers 14 hours agoparentEmployees are generally allowed to bring phones into federal buildings. There are areas within the buildings they may not be able to take them to, and there are some buildings with a total ban. In that case, though, the phones would still be left somewhere nearby, like the parking lot. reply schaefer 14 hours agoparentprevThere are buildings that do not allow cell phones. For these buildings, it's common to leave your phone in your car. So... still close enough? reply AndrewKemendo 4 hours agorootparentYes, close enough. reply mandevil 13 hours agoparentprevWhen we had to go into SCIFs, generally phones went into lockers. At some locations, phones stayed in cars. But that doesn't make it any harder to figure out. But this isn't the first time people are encountering this problem. Strava has given away plenty of US military bases: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracki... Russia has the same problem, VKontakte has given away plenty of secret Russian military bases and troop positions over the past few decades. I've never read of this on Weibo or WeChat, but my guess is they have the same problem, just English language open source accounts are keeping it more discrete for now. The WashPost about a week ago had an article about how at a recent NTC rotation out at Fort Irwin the OPFOR was trying to figure out how an Apache had gotten past their air defenses, so they looked up commercial cell phone tracking data and were able to spot how a phone had gone across the desert at 120 mph and plug the hole in their air defenses.[1] Adtech on the cell phone we all carry in our pocket is better at surveillance than the best tools a military has. And it's one of those things where not being part of the surveillance can make you stand out too. Think about a spy operating under a real cover, how long is their Facebook (or Weibo or VK or TikTok or whatever is appropriate for the person they are trying to be) account history? If you found someone claiming to be a 45 year old woman living in an American suburb and she had a Facebook account that was three months old, wouldn't you investigate further? 1: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/02/22/... reply ok_dad 13 hours agorootparentWhen I was in the military cell phones were extremely new, but I honestly don't see why most commands don't say \"leave phones and other electronics at home when coming to base\" and then you just tell anyone who needs to contact you to call the command quarterdeck or whatever. Examples you just gave are good reasons to do this, much like how in the 90's during Desert Storm several people figured out (post-hoc, but still) that there were a buttload more pizza orders from government offices relating to the invasion of Iraq. I'm a former shithead officer, though, so it's easy for me to just say \"ban the phones!\" instead of trying to figure out a smarter solution. Maybe beepers will make a comeback, since you can't track a multicast, receive-only client? reply mandevil 10 hours agorootparentBecause the 18 year old who really misses his girlfriend needs to have his phone on him? The operator's wife back at Bragg (excuse me, Fort Liberty now) wants to know that he's safe, to use the example from the original article about watching phones go from North Carolina to Syria and back. The article I linked to in WP talked about how difficult the Ukrainian army is finding cellphone discipline, at the beginning of their third year of high intensity war (and a decade of low-intensity combat operations). Because even in a real shooting war zone this sort of stuff is hard to police. reply kjellsbells 6 hours agorootparentThe Ukrainian situation is especially interesting because to my mind it is the first cellphone war. We've gone from cellphones being used as passive electronic switches (as in, detonation systems for roadside bombs) to it being the control interface for innovative weaponry and tactics such as drones against infantry. I dont know that irregular or inexperienced troops will ever give up this level of capability, and I'm not sure that wealthier militaries have figured out how to mutate consumer cellphones into equally powerful portable tools without essentially dumbing them down back to tetra radios. reply acdha 7 hours agorootparentprevI think your instinct is well founded but at odds with the massive tech industry pushing the other way. This is the classic imbalance between offense and defense: for something like a building’s location, the defender has to do the right thing every time. You put out that order and most people follow it but over time someone’s going to make a mistake - they’ll forget their LTE AppleWatch counts as a phone, their spouse or kid will leave their phone in the car and Facebook will helpfully share that location belongs to people who like military pages, their cell provider helpfully links their vehicle’s integrated cellular device with the other devices on the account when selling data, etc. It feels like the solution might need to start with a significant data protection law making some of that data collection impossible and all of it requiring notification so someone could at least have the chance to know where they’d be breaking policy. reply mschuster91 11 hours agorootparentprev> When I was in the military cell phones were extremely new, but I honestly don't see why most commands don't say \"leave phones and other electronics at home when coming to base\" and then you just tell anyone who needs to contact you to call the command quarterdeck or whatever.

And you can check if people have smartphones with them without searching them - quite easy, how they do it in airplanes, emf meters. They are quite cheap. Also you don't have to ban them everywhere. But everywhere critial, yes. A ordinary mobile phone is basically a spying device in terms of security. I would not ask who maybe has access, but who has not. \"The solution to this problem is to kill off the targeted ads market in its entirety. Maybe national security is the only way to actually make that go through.\" So I am sorry, but national security won't help get us rid of targeted ads, you probably also missed the part, where national security of course happily uses that data for themself.

Bringing your personal phone to Langley and leaving it in your car doesn't do much. reply voxic11 14 hours agoparentprevEven if not allowed in the building people will still want to carry a personal phone so it likely just stays in their car right outside the building in the parking lot. reply XorNot 11 hours agoparentprevWhether they take it into the building or not is irrelevant. If they drive nearby and leave it in the car, you can find them. If they drive nearby and turn it off then, you can find them (improve it by bracketing by the average 9-5 workday, add correlation of world events to late-night anomalies - i.e. the Washington pizza index[1]). If they leave their phone at home and switch it off, then you can still find them by that data. If they leave their phone at home, switched on, then this also applies - you filter by public holidays. The key is that the \"phone policy\" is effectively public information - so you don't have to guess, you can just go find out what it is to set your search parameters. [1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clint... reply kyboren 3 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. Here's my proposal: - Prohibit all Federal employees from bringing a personal cellular radio to work. - Build many parking structures for DC Federal employees across the region. - Assign each employee a particular parking structure, ideally selected at random. - Ensure each parking structure is served by public transportation infrastructure, dedicated shuttles, and a USGOV-run black car service to bring people to their workplace, potentially via an extra obfuscating hop to a different parking structure. In an ideal world, all Federal employees would behave indistinguishably. That's impractical, but we can do a lot better than the status quo. reply XorNot 2 hours agorootparentThese would be the only people with movement patterns like that. They wouldn't blend at all: they'd stick out like a sore thumb on any type of large scale statistical analysis as anomalies. \"being really secret\" doesn't work because the attempt to do so means you're doing a whole lot of stuff that no ordinary person does. That's a statistical anomaly - that's easy to find. And again: all this information is public. It would be widely and well known that this is what is done, so what to look for would be well advertised. The locations of these buildings would then be well known. And since you've now added multiple intervening steps, nailing down who's going where is also easier - i.e. if someone drives into a known parking structure at time X, then you can draw a circle around that which is the mean transport time to get to any interesting federal buildings in the area before the work day starts. Map this across a few months and you'll pin down exactly which one they work at (I mean, you wouldn't bother if you were a foreign government though - a couple days worth of casual surveillance work would also grab every number plate and face you can see).

Anyone who actually knows and has access to sensitive sources and methods is under an obligation not to disclose them. Further nobody in the know wants to burn these sources - because it makes their job harder. The general advice I can give is use an iPhone (turn on Lock Down mode if you believe you might be the target of well resourced attackers), use Google suite for your personal data (and turn on Advanced Protection), don't use commercially available VPNs (set up your own or just don't connect to wifi in untrusted places), and periodically delete third party apps you don't use (especially any that use location services). reply cryptonector 4 hours agorootparentYou can do your own analysis on what various players can see based on the OS, the OS vendor, the apps, etc. Basically they get a ton of information. reply jstarfish 11 hours agoparentprevI don't know of any carrier hypervisory capability, but there has been a lot of discussion about OnePlus phones and the data they exfiltrate. There's a bunch of vendor bloatware even on my factory-reset phones so it's not out of the question that a carrier-locked phone might have snuck something else in there. Intelligence can be inferred at the carrier level even with paranoid privacy settings and all apps using HTTPS. CDNs in particular frequently serve content over regular HTTP, and there aren't too many reasons why you'd be communicating with Grindr's CDN. All of this is visible over the wire. DNS requests betray a lot about you. VPNs are notoriously leaky when it comes to DNS as well. I'd expect that even with a VPN running you're not stopping anything, just changing the exfiltration route for some of your traffic. reply nebula8804 6 hours agoparentprevI am not sure if this is exactly what you are asking. Are you looking for aggregated data on yourself or methods to discover what is being transferred? For the latter: One thing you can do is install a man in the middle and \"sniff\" what is being transferred by your phone (at least on wifi). I use a tool called Proxyman, it allows me to install a self signed certificate on my phone and this allows the decryption of SSL traffic by Proxyman. From there its kinda like Wireshark (If you have used that). It basically shows you all the data going in and out of the device. So with the pieces set up you then start a new sniffing session and then open up an app on your phone and use it. This will show you all the data that is being transferred. A lot of apps are transferring all sorts of data. For myself its become so burdensome that I am trying to find a way to automate this analysis for all my apps so I can build a personal \"web\" of what data has left what app and keep a record of it. Not all data is horrendous, for example every app I have tested transfers some sort of data on analytics for QA and app quality improvements. Things like app crash reports or other things of that nature. Thats not so bad compared to other data. You can also try decompiling an app and seeing what libraries are used.

    "originBody": "PC Components CPUs Intel puts 1nm process (10A) on the roadmap for 2027 — also plans for fully AI-automated factories with 'Cobots' News By Paul Alcorn published 27 February 2024 1nm chips to arrive in late 2027. Comments (25) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) We've already covered the first major announcements from the Intel Foundry Direct Connect event, but it turns out that Intel miscommunicated about a presentation that was thought to be under NDA — now Intel says the presentation is open to be reported to the public, so we have some more news to share: Intel's previously-unannounced Intel 10A (analogous to 1nm) will enter production/development in late 2027, marking the arrival of the company's first 1nm node, and its 14A (1.4nm) node will enter production in 2026. [Edit: to be clear, this means 10A is beginning development, not entering high volume manufacturing, in 2027] The company is also working to create fully autonomous AI-powered fabs in the future. Intel's Keyvan Esfarjani, the company's EVP and GM and Foundry Manufacturing and Supply, held a very insightful session that covered the company's latest developments and showed how the roadmap unfolds over the coming years. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Here, we can see two charts, with the first outlining the company's K-WSPW (thousands of wafer starts per week) capacity for Intel's various process nodes. Notably, capacity typically indicates how many wafers can be started, but not the total output — output varies based on yields. You'll notice there isn't a label for the Y-axis, which would give us a direct read on Intel's production volumes. However, this does give us a solid idea of the proportionality of Intel's planned node production over the next several years. Intel did not specify the arrival date of its coming 14A node in its previous announcements, but here, the company indicates it will begin production of the Intel 14A node in 2026. Even more importantly, Intel will begin production/development of its as-yet-unannounced 10A node in late 2027, filling out its roster of nodes produced with EUV technology. Intel's 'A' suffix in its node naming convention represents Angstroms, and 10 Angstroms converts to 1nm, meaning this is the company's first 1nm-class node. Intel hasn't shared any details about the 10A/1nm node but has told us that it classifies a new node as at least having a double-digit power/performance improvement. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has told us the cutoff for a new node is around a 14% to 15% improvement, so we can expect that 10A will have at least that level of improvement over the 14A node. (For example, the difference between Intel 7 and Intel 4 was a 15% improvement.) Capacity for the Intel 4 and Intel 3 processes doesn't build as quickly as 20A/18A, but that isn't surprising — the majority of the company's wins for its third-party foundry business have been with the 18A node, which Intel says is according to plan. As shown, Intel will also steadily draw down its overall production of its 14nm, 10nm, Intel 7, and 12nm nodes as it transitions to the EUV-enabled nodes. Notably, Intel's slide has a footnote that says, \"*roadmap: Final Scale, Pace and Processes dependent on business conditions and incentives,\" mirroring the company's ongoing statements that funding from the CHIPS Act will impact its ability to scale production. Intel's 18A and 20A nodes have been in at least some form of production since 2023, which isn't too surprising — the company won a RAMP-C contract for 18A with the US government back in 2021, and companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Nvidia have been working on generating test chips since (Understandably, Intel will not share details with the public, but it has won a $1 billion award from the US Government for the program). Additionally, Intel's 20A finds the company integrating two new technologies at once - backside power (PowerVIA) and GAA transistors (RibbonFET). To de-risk the process and avoid stumbles like it saw with 10nm, Intel announced in April of 2022 that it had run a different flavor of 20A through its fabs, an internal test node with only backside power paired with standard FinFETs, to ensure backside power worked separately before being integrated into the final 20A node. As such, we can expect that 20A wafers have been flowing through an Intel fab for quite some time. As shown on the right, Intel will also aggressively ramp up its advanced packaging production capacity for Foveros, EMIB, SIP (silicon photonics), and HBI (hybrid bond interconnect). Advanced packaging capacity has been a key choke point for the current shortages of AI accelerators. This increased capacity will ensure a steady supply of advanced processors with complex packaging, including HBM. Intel's ramp of advanced packaging capacity is explosive — the company had very little production capacity for these interconnects in 2023. As an aside, Intel recently wrapped up all of its internal packaging efforts using standard packaging; it is now all-in on advanced packaging and will use OSATs (outsourced assembly and test companies) for standard packaging tasks. The second slide in the above album visualizes how Intel's move to operating as an external foundry will allow it to increase both the amount of production for each of its nodes and the length of time that each node is in production, thus maximizing profit from its fab and equipment expenditures as it serves its customer orders over longer periods. Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) Esfarjani also shared details about Intel's globe-spanning operations. In addition to its existing facilities, the company plans to invest $100 billion over the next five years on expansions and new production sites. The slides above outline the various locations of node production, with 18A occurring in Fab 52 and 62 in Arizona. In contrast, the advanced packaging and 65nm foundry operations for Tower will occur in Fab 9 and 11X in New Mexico. Intel didn't share where it plans to produce its 10A node, and it also has ongoing expansions in Ohio, Israel, Germany, Malaysia, and Poland. This geographically distributed production capacity, spanning both chipmaking and packaging, allows Intel to have global redundancy in its operations while also offering its foundry customers the option of leveraging a supply chain entirely located in America. Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) As we illustrated in our coverage of our tour of Intel's Penang, Malaysia facilities, the company leans heavily on automation in its foundries. Intel now plans to use AI in all segments of its production flows, from capacity planning and forecasting to yield improvements and actual floor-level production operations, in a '10X moonshot' effort. Esfarjani didn't provide a timeline for the company's moonshot effort but said it will impact every aspect of its operations in the future. That includes the introduction of AI \"Cobots,\" which are collaborative robots that can work along with humans, and extensive robotic automation in the manufacturing process. In the meantime, Intel will continue to aggressively pursue any and all potential customers for its operations.

And of course they need to have packaging follow similar (ideally better) scale and cost curves as the chip(lets), or risk not being able to sell after they've produced 'their' parts. And again, the reason these packaging jobs are in lowest-cost locations to day is that they are far too manual to be affordable next to the foundries today, so without robotics and automation they'd run into endless trouble. Just too bad, that all these people currently doing these jobs, will soon no longer be able to afford Intel products, nor those from Apple or other chip giants...

    "originBody": "View image in fullscreen Paul Edmonds (center) with Jana Dickter (left) and Monzer M Al Malki. Photograph: City of Hope US news Man in remission from blood cancer and HIV after remarkable treatment Paul Edmonds of California is fifth-known person in world confirmed to be in remission from both, says cancer institute Ramon Antonio Vargas Wed 28 Feb 2024 07.00 EST Share Doctors say a man in California who contracted blood cancer while living with HIV is in remission from both potentially fatal illnesses thanks to a treatment they are hailing as remarkable and encouraging. Paul Edmonds is only the fifth-known person in the world confirmed to be in remission for both acute myelogenous leukemia and HIV, according to a recent news release from City of Hope, the national cancer institute that provided his medical care. ‘Not a disease you want to relive’: why is the US seeing outbreaks of measles? Read more Edmonds, of Desert Hot Springs, California, underwent a treatment in which he received stem cells with a rare genetic mutation that makes people who have it resistant to acquiring HIV. The stem cell transplant came from a donor with the rare homozygous CCR5 delta mutation. At 68, Edmonds became the oldest person to overcome blood cancer before then also achieving HIV remission, City of Hope said. City of Hope also said that of the five known people who overcame both illnesses, Edmonds had had HIV the longest, about 31 years. The findings on Edmonds were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. City of Hope said his case demonstrates how older adults with blood cancers who undergo reduced-intensity chemotherapy, then get a stem cell transplant with HIV-resistant donor cells, may be rid of HIV. “It is possible to achieve remission from HIV even at an older age and after living with HIV for many years,” said Jana Dickter, a clinical professor in City of Hope’s infectious diseases division. “As people with HIV continue to live longer, there will be more opportunities for personalized treatments for their blood cancers.” In a YouTube video, Edmonds said he hopes his experience “gives hope to people with HIV”, adding: “I want to remember all those we lost.” He had previously told City of Hope that he felt as if he had been given a death sentence when diagnosed with HIV and Aids in 1988. He underwent HIV antiretroviral therapy, which brought levels of the virus down to undetectable levels, but it stopped short of curing him of the disease. That began to change for Edmonds when he happened to also develop acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML. Part of his treatment for that blood cancer involved receiving donated stem cells, which had the extra benefit of carrying a genetic mutation linked to HIV resistance. No more than 2% of people have the mutation, according to ScienceAlert. But one of those people was a donor match for Edmonds. City of Hope connected Edmonds to that person through its blood stem cell and bone marrow transplant program. Edmonds received bone marrow and blood stem cells from the donor in 2019. The process left his bone marrow and blood stem cells completely replaced by those of his donor. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They consider him cured of leukemia because his last cancer treatment – the transplant itself – was more than five years ago. He also has not taken antiretroviral therapy for HIV in nearly three years, leaving two years to go before doctors would consider him cured of HIV as well. A key reason why Edmonds may have tolerated the transplant so well is that, beforehand, he underwent chemotherapy treatments of reduced intensity. That strategy was aimed at lowering his chances of complications after the transplant, his doctors said. Edmonds said he was “extremely grateful” for his treatment at City of Hope’s clinical research hospital in Duarte, California. Duarte is located about two hours from Desert Hot Springs, requiring that he and his husband live in a hotel intermittently and rely on the help of longtime friends. “Many … doctors, scientists, nurses, supportive care professionals and others made it possible for me to be cured of leukemia and in remission for HIV,” Edmonds said. “I can’t thank them enough.” Explore more on these topics US news Infectious diseases Medical research Aids and HIV Cancer research California Cancer news Share Reuse this content",

    "originBody": "linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org archive mirror help / color / mirror / Atom feed From: Daniel AlmeidaTo: wedsonaf@gmail.com, ojeda@kernel.org, mchehab@kernel.org,hverkuil@xs4all.nl Cc: Daniel Almeida ,rust-for-linux@vger.kernel.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org,linux-media@vger.kernel.org, kernel@collabora.com Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/1] Rewrite the VP9 codec library in Rust Date: Tue, 27 Feb 2024 18:51:44 -0300 [thread overview] Message-ID:(raw) Hi everyone, This patch ports the VP9 library written by Andrzej into Rust as a proof-of-concept. This is so that we can evaluate the Rust in V4L2 initiative with source code in hand. It converts rkvdec and hantro to use the Rust version of the library. These two were chosen merely because that's the hardware I currently own. Fluster scores remain the same when using either the Rust or C version. Please test this. Much has been spoken at various occasions about drivers and I feel that the consensus is to wait for now. This is why I am proposing a different approach: porting our codec libraries to Rust. IMHO, these components can benefit greatly from Rust, as they implement complicated algorithms that also happen to process data received from userspace through V4L2 controls. These algorithms use the data received from userspace in order to index into a lot of arrays and thus benefit from Rust's memory safety. The first thing about the code is that it does not include any layer of bindings. This was pointed out as a blocker several times due to the need of keeping them in sync with the C code. The Rust code here also offers a C API for C drivers.This C API is automatically generated by cbindgen and I have provided instructions on how to do so. We can even use functions from both the C and Rust libraries at the same time since the ABI is the same. The above can come in handy because it means that we can convert a given codebase piece by piece if need be. C drivers will work as usual through the C API and any new Rust driver will get to benefit from a native Rust interface. Please take note that most of the code is *not* in the media tree, so I do not see how this can further stress our subsystem. I take responsibility for maintaining stuff in rust/kernel/media and honestly, this library will not need any further updates for the same reason we have never touched its C counterpart. I hope to convince the community that this is a feasible way to slowly experiment with Rust code without tying us up too much to it. Lastly, please note that this code is just a proof of concept, we can settle on a proper patch - with all that entails - if it is well received. Those with hardware can follow the steps below to test this patch: a) enable Rust (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/rust/quick-start.html). Make sure CONFIG_RUST=y. b) enable one of the converted drivers (CONFIG_VIDEO_HANTRO or CONFIG_VIDEO_ROCKCHIP_VDEC). This will select V4L2_VP9_RS. c) download the Fluster tool (https://github.com/fluendo/fluster) d) download the VP9 test suite from libvpx (fluster.py download VP9-TEST-VECTORS) e) make sure you have a recent version of GStreamer (`gst-inspect-1.0 v4l2codecs` must not be empty) f) run the test suite (fluster.py run -d GStreamer-VP9-V4L2SL-Gst1.0 -ts VP9-TEST-VECTORS) g) results should be the same both with and without this patch -- Daniel Applies on top of: commit d9c1fae3e5b225f2e45e0bca519f9a2967cd1062 Author: Alice RyhlDate: Fri Feb 9 11:18:22 2024 +0000 rust: file: add abstraction for `poll_table` For those looking for a branch instead: https://gitlab.collabora.com/dwlsalmeida/for-upstream/-/tree/vp9-rs?ref_type=heads Daniel Almeida (1): v4l2-core: rewrite the VP9 library in Rust drivers/media/platform/verisilicon/Kconfig2 +- .../platform/verisilicon/hantro_g2_vp9_dec.c38 +- .../media/platform/verisilicon/hantro_hw.h8 +- drivers/media/v4l2-core/Kconfig4 + drivers/staging/media/rkvdec/Kconfig2 +- drivers/staging/media/rkvdec/rkvdec-vp9.c52 +- include/media/v4l2-vp9-rs.h97 + rust/bindings/bindings_helper.h1 + rust/kernel/lib.rs2 + rust/kernel/media.rs5 + rust/kernel/media/v4l2_core.rs6 + rust/kernel/media/v4l2_core/cbindgen.toml26 + rust/kernel/media/v4l2_core/vp9.rs1999 +++++++++++++++++ 13 files changed, 2192 insertions(+), 50 deletions(-) create mode 100644 include/media/v4l2-vp9-rs.h create mode 100644 rust/kernel/media.rs create mode 100644 rust/kernel/media/v4l2_core.rs create mode 100644 rust/kernel/media/v4l2_core/cbindgen.toml create mode 100644 rust/kernel/media/v4l2_core/vp9.rs -- 2.43.0 next reply other threads:[~2024-02-27 21:55 UTC|newest] Thread overview: 4+ messages / expand[flat|nested] mbox.gz Atom feed top 2024-02-27 21:51 Daniel Almeida [this message] 2024-02-27 21:51 ` [RFC PATCH 1/1] v4l2-core: rewrite the VP9 library in Rust Daniel Almeida 2024-02-28 14:13 ` Alice Ryhl 2024-02-28 17:59 ` Daniel Almeida Reply instructions: You may reply publicly to this message via plain-text email using any one of the following methods: * Save the following mbox file, import it into your mail client, and reply-to-all from there: mbox Avoid top-posting and favor interleaved quoting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Interleaved_style * Reply using the --to, --cc, and --in-reply-to switches of git-send-email(1): git send-email \\ --in-reply-to=20240227215146.46487-1-daniel.almeida@collabora.com \\ --to=daniel.almeida@collabora.com \\ --cc=hverkuil@xs4all.nl \\ --cc=kernel@collabora.com \\ --cc=linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org \\ --cc=linux-media@vger.kernel.org \\ --cc=mchehab@kernel.org \\ --cc=ojeda@kernel.org \\ --cc=rust-for-linux@vger.kernel.org \\ --cc=wedsonaf@gmail.com \\ /path/to/YOUR_REPLY https://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-send-email.html * If your mail client supports setting the In-Reply-To header via mailto: links, try the mailto: link Be sure your reply has a Subject: header at the top and a blank line before the message body.

As long as I was flying out to Vancouver, I wanted to meet Professor Mariana Brussoni, who had been writing important work on the value of outdoor risky play. Our hour-long meeting expanded my thinking about risk and play, and helped me write Chapters 2 and 3 of The Anxious Generation. Mariana quickly joined my pantheon of experts on play, along with Lenore Skenazy and Peter Gray. With articles such as Play Worth Remembering: Are Playgrounds Too Safe? and Risky Play and Children’s Safety: Balancing Priorities for Optimal Child Development, Mariana makes the case that we harm children’s social, physical, and even immune development when we remove all risk from their lives. I liked Mariana and her work so much that I gave her an open-ended invitation to write whatever she wanted at After Babel. Here is her essay, laying out her findings in a format that parents and schools can use. A concise summary of her work is this simple sentence, which she said to me during our meeting: “Children should be kept as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible.” — Jon We parents are caught in a paradox. We desperately want to keep our children safe and ensure their success. We are also often terrified that they will get hurt and that they will fail—so we do everything we can to prevent that from happening. Yet many of those very efforts to manage our fears have paradoxically reduced our children’s safety and their odds of success. For over two decades, I have researched children’s development, injury prevention, and outdoor risky play. I have learned that when we prioritize children’s play (especially the kind of play that involves some risk and lack of supervision) and the freedom to play how they choose, we help create environments where children and youth thrive.1 When we don’t, the consequences can be dire. Share Think back to your favorite childhood play memory. Where were you? What were you doing? Was there an adult supervising you? Adults in many Western nations, particularly those born before the 1990s, recall playing with friends in their neighborhoods, local parks, and abandoned places, making up the rules as they went along, without adult supervision. They often recall a sense of joy, fun, and freedom as they would run, jump, and move their bodies in ways that weren’t allowed indoors. They felt independent, taking risks and figuring things out for themselves. And this is the kind of childhood that has been common for nearly all of human history. Children, like all young mammals, play. Today, this kind of childhood is rare. Every successive generation of children since the 1970s has seen their outdoor play and freedom shrink. Time use data show that children’s leisure time has gone down, particularly time spent in unstructured outdoor play, while time spent in academic and screen-based activities has increased. Between 1975 and 2015, outdoor play among UK children decreased by 29.4%, while screen-based activities increased by 22.4%. In the U.S., only 16% of children in 1997 played outdoors every day. By 2003—just six years later—that dropped even further to 10%. Figure 1. Changes in UK children’s daily time use, based on Mullan (2019). Thanks to Nick Desbarats for making this figure. Just ask a young person (born after 1990) about their favorite childhood play memories. Then ask their parents the same question and you will see how this generational shift has played out. The parents will likely tell you stories of neighborhood adventures with friends. The child will likely talk about structured activities, such as sports—as they were under the watchful eyes of adults. What Is Risky Play and Why Does It Matter? When children have the time, space, and freedom to play the way they choose, it’s not long before they start taking risks in their play, such as climbing higher than they usually do, building secret dens, or racing on their bikes. This is no accident. Children are wired for risky play, in which they take physical risks, seek excitement, and satisfy curiosity. Photo by Mariana Brussoni Examples of risky play will be familiar to most of us: playing with heights (e.g., climbing), with speed (e.g., sledding), using tools (e.g., hammers, knives), playing near elements such as fire or bodies of water, rough-and-tumble play, play where children can wander independently (e.g., playing in their neighborhood with no adult supervision), and play with impact (e.g., jumping into a lake). This kind of play involves children pushing themselves beyond their previous limits and not knowing how things will turn out. As a result, they simultaneously experience thrill and fright. All children need risky play, but it may look different depending on the child. Photo by Mariana Brussoni Risky play, as the name implies, means that kids can get hurt, and that their chances of getting hurt are higher than if they’re more sedentary and playing quietly. On the surface, it’s not clear why a need for risky play would evolve across species, if it increases the chances that something bad will happen to those who partake in it. But when we dig a little deeper, its benefits become obvious. Risky play provides children with low-cost opportunities to develop the physical and cognitive skills to master the challenges that they will face as they grow older. So, those who engaged in it had a major evolutionary advantage over those who did not. Physically, risky play allows children to explore more diverse movements and gain physical movement skills. Cognitively, it helps them overcome their fears, build their critical thinking skills, and become accustomed to coping independently with difficult situations. Risky play can even help children overcome anxiety disorders and the cognitive distortions that go along with them. Anxious children have difficulty tolerating uncertainty, tend to interpret ambiguity negatively and underestimate their ability to cope in uncertain situations. Through risky play, children practice dealing with strong ambiguous emotions (thrill and excitement could also be interpreted as fear and terror) and situations that abound with uncertainty. It can also show them that they are resilient and capable of coping when things go wrong. Research shows that children with more opportunities for risky play have lower internalizing symptoms that are characteristic of anxiety disorders. In fact, the Canadian Paediatric Society sees risky play as so important, and as a way to address many of the challenges that their patients face, that they recently released a statement encouraging pediatricians to support it in patients’ lives. With all of these benefits… and the evolutionary impulse for it… why has risky play been disappearing so rapidly? Why is risky play disappearing from children’s lives? Among the most important factors driving the loss of risky play and childhood freedom is the move toward intensive parenting that began in the 1980s.2 Parents, particularly mothers, have been encouraged to micro-manage their children’s lives, curate their experiences, remove any barriers, and enroll them in diverse structured activities with the intention of enhancing their development and giving them an edge in the race to succeed. This approach to parenting has become like the air we breathe—widely accepted in North America—with parents of all backgrounds held to its unrealistic standard regardless of whether they can afford the necessary time, money, and energy. This costly parenting strategy has negligible benefits at best, and can even be harmful. Research shows that enrollment in structured activities is not associated with improved developmental outcomes, and the loss of free time can be detrimental to developing basic executive function skills. When positive effects of intensive parenting have been shown, they’ve been modest and insufficient to offset the substantial costs to parents.3 So why does this parenting approach persist even though it is exhausting, parents wouldn’t have wanted it for themselves, and the research does not show benefits? The answer lies in expectations. Parents today receive constant messaging that in order to be “good parents”, they must always keep their children safe. And it is widely believed that the world is no longer a safe place for children to play in. Yet statistics show that it has never been a safer time to be a child. Injury-related deaths are at an all-time low in most Western nations. In the US, deaths from unintentional injuries fell by 73% for boys and 85% for girls between 1973 and 2010. This misperception of risk creates the parental paradox. What kids are dying from today are mainly car crashes and suicides, not playing outside unsupervised with friends. Parents are worrying about the wrong causes of injuries and harm. In fact, the very strategies that parents use to try to keep their children safe – driving them around, maximizing supervision, and minimizing freedom – are unintentionally increasing the likelihood of injuries and even death. Three ingredients to bring back risky play and childhood freedom The problem lies not with our intentions. We all want children to thrive. The problem is in the decisions we’ve made to support this noble goal. We’ve prioritized safety over freedom, achievement over play, and screen time over outdoor time. The results are predictable: compromised mental and physical health, cognitive development, and emotional competence. The solutions are both simple and hard. We know what children need to thrive. The three key ingredients necessary for thriving play environments are Time, Space, and Freedom. Time: Make daily outdoor playtime a priority. That can mean adding it to the schedule, much like we already do for sports or other extra-curricular activities. But schools should also take steps to prioritize outdoor instruction and recess. This can be particularly important for children from disadvantaged families without ready access to safe and stimulating outdoor environments. Parents and educators can use the U.S. Play Coalition’s position paper on recess to advocate for more recess in schools. My research lab also developed a free teacher tool to help encourage outdoor learning, which includes short how-to videos to help overcome common barriers that teachers face. Space: Children need easy access to stimulating spaces for play; flexible spaces where they can use their imagination and explore risks, rather than spaces dominated by boring play structures and strict rules. Unfortunately, these kinds of spaces are harder and harder to come by as more parking lots and highways are built to accommodate a growing number of cars. At a legislative level, we need to move away from municipal planning that prioritizes cars over people–an important step that a number of North American cities have already taken. Outside of legislation, there is much that individuals can do, even with the little space that is available. For example, “loose parts” (e.g., sticks, lumber, rocks, boxes, and tarps) can turn boring and barren play spaces into places of joy and wonder.While these may look like junk to adults, children love them. Scotland developed a loose parts toolkit for anyone who wants to get started. Some cities also have adventure playgrounds—child-centered, child-directed play spaces that are rich in loose parts. (Such playgrounds always have adult staff on hand, but the staff stays in the background unless serious safety risks arise.). See New York’s play:groundnyc as one example. Image. Adventure Playground in New York City. Credit: Jon Haidt. Freedom: Children need freedom to be able to play the way they choose. The biggest barrier to children’s freedom is us—the adults in their lives—and our need to manage our own fears. Getting over these fears can be difficult, but it is much easier when you work together with other parents. Peter Gray suggests that building tighter relationships with neighbors can help parents feel more confident about letting their kids out to play. The U.S. organization Let Grow works with parents and schools to help support an independent childhood. For parents working to manage their fears and change their approach to play, our lab developed the OutsidePlay.org parent tool to help them work through their challenges, figure out what works best for them and develop a plan for change. We’ve tested it rigorously and it works. Creating environments for children to thrive doesn’t have to feel overwhelming or unattainable. Every change begins with one small and manageable step. We each have to choose what this looks like for us. We owe it to our children to prioritize play and freedom in their lives and everyday realities. We’ve already seen what happens when we don’t. Let’s break out of the paradox, and give children the freedom they need to thrive.

We often neglect the play needs of older children and youth, and while they are different from those of younger children, they are no less important. 2 Any conversation about the decline in outdoor play must also look at the impact of screens. In 2000, UK kids spent 3 hours per day on screens, and this was before the proliferation of smartphones. By 2015, this rose to 4 hours 45 minutes. Other estimates range upwards of 480 minutes per day (8hrs). Some kids spend more time on their devices than they do at school. All of this time spent on screens must come from somewhere, and it has mostly been displacing sleep and outdoor play time. 3 A longitudinal study in the UK found modest positive effects on children’s physical health, but detrimental impacts on their mental health. Other studies show negative effects on mental health as children grow into young adulthood, including increased rates of anxiety and depression and impaired independence.

At some point they put rubber shavings under it as a safety thing. Several years later, they cut it down to one story. Later they removed the whole thing. I know exactly what they mean by fear, excitement and risk. It was fun while it was dangerous yet it was extremely rare for a kid to fall off and be hurt.

We also had swings with 15’ or more of chain. I remember regularly getting nearly parallel to the top bar of that during recess and bailing out and even doing backflips off of it. There was a particularly dangerous piece of playground equipment that the kids called the “witch’s hat,” which was a 15’ or so tall round central metal pipe maybe 3-4” in diameter, which had a cap on the top that could freely spin. Attached to the cap were maybe 12 10’ chains attached, which linked to a giant octagon or decagon made out of 1-2” or so straight pipe sections which were fitted together in angle brackets. It was essentially an inverted merry go round which you would need a few kids on opposing sides to operate, all running in the same direction. It would cause a kind of wave as the weight distribution shifted as kids were lifted off the round while hanging on, and then your side would come back down and you would hit the ground running while hanging on for dear life. Some kid flew off and broke their collarbone and they ended up soft-banning it except when the teachers weren’t looking, and eventually they decommissioned it. It was a sad day on the playground when that happened. reply vasco 2 hours agoparentprevIt's funny because my grandpa called us pussies for playing in man made safe playgrounds instead of in the woods.

But perhaps once these practices begin to be reversed, people will feel that it's terrifying that the children are suddenly independent and not incredibly passive and cowardly. reply Tade0 1 hour agorootparentIt's happening already.

When I was a child, there was a super fun steel monkey bars in a park near my home. I used to play a lot on it. Fear was surely one of the fun factors. Then they removed it, because the local council was afraid some kid might get hurt. It's sad. reply lp4vn 24 minutes agoprevI arrived to the conclusion that this \"risk-aversion\" in child rearing is basically the result of smaller families. This may sound callous but I think parents are much more OK with their oldest son/dqughter taking bigger risks if there are other 4 ones at home than if that's your only child and losing him/her is the end of your lineage. Not saying that more kids work as a genetic backup, but I think that for sure that creates a subconscious effect in the parents' risk assessment. I read somewhere that propensity to war is proportional to the average age of a society. I think the same phenomenon applies to acceptance of risk in child behaviour but now related to fertility rate. reply aylmao 8 minutes agoparentAdding two notes onto this hypothesis: - I can only assume that if a kid doesn't have an older sibling \"to keep an eye on them\" the parents take this role, and parents tend to be more risk-adverse and responsible caretakers than siblings. - I've never lived in the American suburbs, but they don't seem very dense. I know that, growing up in Mexico, the kid density was great. Some of it probably has to do with the fact everyone had siblings. Matching ages with nearby neighbors is more likely when there's more kids too. We were outside all the time, older siblings introduced younger ones to the crowd. Friendships were made, broken and fixed. Adventures were had. More than once we got into situations that I knew my mom wouldn't be happy about too. reply Animats 3 hours agoprevAnd a pony. I've been around horse barns for many years. Rode today. It's not a kids thing any more. Most of the riders are not only adults, but older adults. Few kids take riding lessons. The old ponies are under-used. Fifteen years ago, the ponies were usually being ridden or groomed by girls in their early teens. We used to see groups of kids go out on the trails unsupervised. That was normal. The kids would go out for an hour or so. Nobody does that any more. Now, if there's a kid around, it's usually because the parent is a horse person. Barns that teach kids are very organized. Kids are never out of sight of an adult. Usually the parents sit there and watch. It's sad. Kids that grow up around horses tend not to have trouble with bullies. After you're used to dealing with half-ton, somewhat pushy animals with huge teeth and steel-shod hooves, big guys just don't look that big. reply yourusername 33 minutes agoparentMaybe your view is a bit coloured by your own experience? In my view riding ponies or horses as a hobby is something that was always financially out of reach for 95% of the population. It's not as normal hobby any more than racing carts is. reply sersi 20 minutes agorootparentIt depends on the region you were born in. I was born in the country side of normandy where there's plenty of horse breeders. Some primary schools there will bring the kids once a week to do horse riding and seeing horses is somewhat common (plus there was always at least one kid whose parent bred horse in the class who'd invite his classmates to see the horses).

It’s good to let your thirteen year old play in the neighborhood with their friends. But what about everything in between? At what age should you let your kid play in the pool without you even watching? When can they be trusted to use a band saw unsupervised? How young is too young to have unrestricted access to razor sharp eight inch kitchen knives? This is mostly rhetorical; the point is the constant (necessary) risk calculus is draining, and parents are rational to err on the side of caution. It has been observed that most public spaces in America are default adult spaces where children are only tolerated. It follows most public spaces will tend to have adult levels of hazard and risk. reply josefx 26 minutes agoparent> It’s not ok to let your five year old play with a soccer ball on a busy neighborhood street unsupervised. When I grew up the road by my grandparents house was wide and empty and you could see anything coming a mile away and drivers could see the kids playing just as well. Now it has been redesigned to be a cluttered mess to \"discourage speeding\" even adding parking spots to reduce the width of the road. You could drive through it at walking speed and still wouldn't see a kid trying to cross the road before it popped out from behind a car right in front of you. reply RoyalHenOil 30 minutes agoparentprevIt depends a lot on the activity and the individual. I am almost 40, and I still won't use our bandsaw unsupervised. I don't think there is any age that I will trust myself with that because I am clumsy. When my sister and I were growing up, we were given our independence in different areas at different ages: it was a matter of when we felt confident doing those things unsupervised and when we earned our parents' trust. As a general rule, I got to do responsibility-based tasks (like stay home alone, pick my own bedtime, and set my own homework schedule) at an earlier age than my sister, but she got to do physically risky tasks (like use knives, use the stove, and play high-risk sports) at an earlier age than me. In all cases, it was a gradual process: they guided us, then they let us try while they watched, then they let us try while they were on hand if we called out for help, then they let us do it alone. Each step took as long as they (or we) felt was needed. My parents are both highly anxious/cautious people, so I know it wasn't easy for them to give us these freedoms, but they understood intellectually that it was vital that we practice for adulthood well before we were suddenly on our own. They knew they only had a few short years to teach us how to survive independently of them. It must have been a lot of work for them, but we were planned children (not accidents) and they put a lot of thought into how they wanted to raise us. reply obscurette 2 hours agoparentprevIt's not about children actually. The problem in general is how patronizing our society have become in last decades. reply mschuster91 33 minutes agorootparentThat's mostly a factor of lower childbirth rates. Put plain and simple: people used to have 3+ kids (or more, if you counted those who died before age 6), so if one or two died, got severely injured, turned mad, criminal or celibate-religious there would be still at least one or two other kids to inherit whatever wealth the family had (i.e. usually the farm or trade shop) and pass on the family name. Nowadays middle-class people tend to have just one or two children, they literally cannot afford the space or childrearing costs for more - for lower classes eligible for government assistance such as the un(der)employed the situation does look different as society picks up large parts of the tab. Additionally, ever rising requirements in employment criteria make it necessary to invest more and more into their education: up until maybe 2-3 decades ago, even a school dropout could work in construction, a factory, retail, farm or mine and make a relatively decent living. But these jobs have largely gone away to China/India or to automation, so the few employment options for \"undereducated\" people are highly contested. And so, the kid must turn out perfect: there is no room for the kid to make mistakes, especially not ones that endanger their career prospects, and hence all the helicopter parenting. On top of all of that come decades of media/politician \"fear brainwashings\" (aka, the \"pedo child-snatcher van\" myth), as well as the legitimate collapse of a high-trust society (homeless, drunk and mentally ill people literally everywhere in major cities; police simply not enforcing laws any more). reply hyperthesis 8 minutes agorootparentDo upper-class people have more children? reply makeitdouble 19 minutes agoparentprevThis reminds of the \"no kids zone\" concept in Korea [0].

Rearing young is pretty deep and ancient behavior in our species, yet when we think of examples of prior generations or suppose cases from the historical record, the trend always seemed to be free range parenting. Only within the last generation or two perhaps has childhood changed from one of exploration and freedom to one of restriction and days scheduled to the minute. Do the kids benefit from this unique way of being reared? Maybe, maybe not, we know mental health issues are on the rise among children. But, on the other hand, there is a profit to be made selling tools to monitor and restrict and activities and services to fill up an otherwise idle day, so there is some degree of incentive to keep this behavior around in our culture now that it has emerged for better or worse. reply m_fayer 55 minutes agorootparentHaving children has become way more exhausting: the need for advanced degrees and career climbing before reproduction means we do it later in life when we have less energy. The same factors plus mobility means grandparents are unavailable or worse, in need of care themselves. When both parents have full time jobs, the crunch is even worse. This all has 2 psychological effects: when parents feel like they’re just barely keeping this teetering lifestyle from falling over, they become very controlling. Tight control becomes the name of the game: it’s how everything’s done and anyway no one has the time or energy for the unexpected. Also, when the child represents a gargantuan investment, people become realty protective over their fragile prize.

I'd tell my parent where I was heading and then I'd go. I was 6 when I received my first Victorinox swiss army knife and learned how to sharpen it to a razor's edge. I was 7 when I started going to a local swim club by myself, saving up a week's allowance for a day at the pool and some candy. I was 8 when my very best friend moved away.

I was 9 when I was travelling to the end of the neighborhood, parking my bike by a friends' house, then hiking a quarter mile to go fishing in a river pond. Parents these days aren't rational at all. They worry about protecting the physical nature of the child and leave their development and ability to accurately assess risk on their own as an afterthought.

So instead of physically separating her from a hot kettle they just go \"it's very hot!\" and demonstrate by touching it carefully and then pulling their hand away. They let her play with matches. She could pick up on these cues long before she could understand words. But it does look exhausting. And there have been some moments (once she was trotting around holding scissors pointing up in the air) where I've thought \"no that's too risky and no amount of careful supervision can prevent injury here\". She has also burned herself, but only once. So overall I am pretty impressed, at least in principle, and if I have kids I'll definitely endeavour to try and curb my overprotective instincts. reply cpursley 36 minutes agoparentThis is exactly what we do with our toddler (tell her it’s hot, sharp, etc - mimic a painful reaction). It’s worked really well. She’s only two and will even tell us to “be careful papa, it’s hot” etc). Kids are smart, if you treat them like little adults instead of little helpless goo goo ga ga babies - they will generally pick up on things. Which actually makes it easier on the parents. reply lm2s 28 minutes agoparentprevAnother way to teach them about hot things is to have something that is uncomfortably hot but won't burn if you touch it for a few seconds*, warn them that it's hot and remove the fingers quickly but let them touch it anyway. They won't burn themselves but will understand what is hot and will understand when you tell them that it's hot. The side effect of this, is that then they might be scared of things that are only slightly hot. But that's something easier and less risky to deal with IMO and they'll eventually understand that there's different levels. *babies/toddlers have a skin that is a lot more sensitive, so this should be taken into consideration. reply stephc_int13 4 hours agoprevIt turns out this is a tradeoff, the cost of this extra safety is mental health issues later in life. reply WarOnPrivacy 3 hours agoparent> the cost of this extra safety is mental health issues later in life.

Where were you? What were you doing? Was there an adult supervising you? I have two memories 1) I was playing in my grandfather’s pipe yard with my cousins. Lots of heavy equipment and stuff that was precariously stacked. Very easily could have ended up in a situation were something fell on me and killed me. Instead, I just ran headlong into a rusty pipe and nearly broke my nose. 2) I was in my early teens riding a 3 wheeled ATV. I was going too fast and went into a wash and flipped the machine over me. I didn’t kill myself. Didn’t even get seriously hurt, but easily could have. I was incredibly lucky to come out of both of those experiences relatively unscathed. It’s not really a tough calculus thinking “well, my daughter doesn’t have an eye anymore, but at least she was having fun!” I instead encourage my kids to have fun in activities that _feel_ risky but where the chance of life altering injury is low. Like walking on a high brick fence or jumping from a high point into a big deep body of water. Anyway, as a parent I’m so fucking tired of people trying to tell me how to raise a kid. reply calvinmorrison 1 hour agoparentClimbing at the top of very tall trees. At age 5 or 6. Looks like the tree is still there on Google maps 60 S Church St https://maps.app.goo.gl/niB4443VK65M8LPB6 reply watwut 2 hours agoprevMy big problem with these articles is that they invariably list activities that are NOT risky or dangerous. And what they end up doing is just ramping up sense of danger about non dangerous behavior. If you frame reasonable and safe activities as risk taking, then well, people will conclude those activities are risky. And second issue is that they do NOT engage with other host of issues that limit outside play. For example, unsupervised playing kids are annoying to many unrelated adults - and adults who strongly dislike kids and want to exclude them from everywhere are very common. Or, simple fact that just meeting friends often requires in advance agreed upon play date and a drive by car. Or, simple fact that before you was bored in your room and outside had things to do, nowdays you have fun stuff at home (computer, tablet, phone) and outside has not much to do above the age of 7. Half of this feels like fighting fear by adding new dangers and threats to the equation. Hey, not only you need to add risk, if you dont your kid will have serious mental health issues. Hey, lets worry simultaneously about risk taking while doing safe activities while also worrying they dont take enough risk. reply ChiMan 3 hours agoprevSounds like sports are good for kids, and contact sports are good for boys. Who knew? reply scraplab 3 hours agoparentDid you read the article? It specially argues for unstructured play and freedom, and against structured play, such as organised sports. reply AlbertCory 3 hours agorootparent\"sports\" does not imply \"organization, with adults.\" I never played any organized football, but I played a ton of informal touch football, and very occasionally tackle. Same with most baseball: a bunch of us kids got together and played. In most of the world, it's football (\"soccer\" as Americans call it). reply MisterBastahrd 2 hours agorootparentprevWell, I'm glad I didn't read it, because a child should have both unstructured play, fully free of adult supervision AND structured play to learn the ins and outs of working in structured rule-based groups while pursuing something they enjoy. reply RoyalHenOil 6 minutes agorootparentIt depends on the kid. When I was a kid, I hated structured play to the extent that I would rather not play at all. That even applied to video games; I wanted them to be an open and free as possible, with many ways for me to solve problems (and equally many ways to fail to solve problems). Most games were unplayable to me. I think this is because I was (and still am) very diligent by nature. I was extremely dutiful and obedient, always did schoolwork to the best of my ability, etc. Playtime was my desperately needed creative outlet, where I could just try things unplanned and discover what I was capable of. My parents did try to introduce me to some structured activities, but when I didn't click with any of them, they stopped pushing them. Looking back as an adult, I think that was 100% the right call. Even better, they did not assume my little sister would be like me. They introduced her to structured activities even after I had long left them behind, and she took to them in a way I never did. She was naturally disorganized, basically my opposite, and I think these activities gave her some much-needed balance (in much the same way that unstructured play did for me). reply achenet 1 hour agorootparentprevwhat about Calvinball?

Probably 10 years ago my kid and two friends played in each other’s yards mostly unsupervised. Only led to one ER visit with a scratched cornea (my kid).

Ok, when was the last time you saw a collection of kid-sized bicycles outside the local grocery store, convenience store, or local blue plate joint, with a gaggle of obviously unsupervised kids inside?

I can't speak to your 11 year old, but I'm happy leaving my grandkids with money .. typically I've let them (and my kids when younger, nieces, nephews, et al) pull molten glass from a furnace from 5 onwards (with half an eye watching from not too far away), relatively unsupervised after they've left primary school. First year high school is typically 12 or so (IIRC).

For some reason, here in Phoenix, we had a constant gossipy murmur about kids getting stolen out of Target parking lots right out if their parents carts or even cars. No news stories, but you’d always hear some (white) woman claim someone “almost” kidnapped their friend’s kid just the other day. When you dig even slightly deeper, it sounds more like someone of color just happened to be walking by as they loaded up their kid in their car. The kidnapping thing doesn’t happen like that. Not in the US. It happens to vulnerable families at the border who pay unscrupulous coyotes to bring them over. reply raverbashing 2 hours agorootparentMight ask how much of these \"almost kidnappings\" are just another Karen with main character syndrome mindless thinking any kid around them are their kid reply chomp 10 hours agoprevI don’t disagree that children need to engage in risky behavior, but the claim that it needs to be unsupervised and then viewing it through the lens of yesteryear is a combination of survivor bias and nostalgia. Children pre-1990s were also a lot more likely to have less present parents across the board, and there’s a lot of strings attached to the unsupervised play those children got. I agree unsupervised play is important, I let our kids play by themselves all the time, it’s very important for learning conflict resolution. But make room in your argument also for having a strong and engaged presence in their lives. reply rightbyte 27 minutes agoparentYe I agree. I think \"safe playgrounds\" is just a scapegoat and a straw man. You don't learn much from accidents. Anything that is climbable is dangerous enought.

When my mother grew up there was always an adult at home - her mom. Same with her parents. Same with my mother-in-law. You also don't have to go too far back, just 150 years, to when children were largely used for labor. Childhood itself is a relatively new invention. The idea that kids sat around doing nothing but getting in trouble with other kids all day is just wrong. reply 15457345234 4 hours agoparentprev> survivor bias Using that phrase is... 80s childhoods weren't some sort of trial by fire threshing machine, dude. By and large everybody survived. Children being lost to quicksand or stumbling across gangs of counterfeiters holed up in abandoned mills who black-bagged them is a thing that happened in Scooby Doo and The Hardy Boys, not real life. This elides the main issue; children need to be left to play unsupervised as the machiavellian instigator types only reveal themselves when nobody's watching. It isn't so much about letting the children take risks as it is about figuring out who's always present when something odd and painful happens to somebody else. reply WarOnPrivacy 4 hours agoparentprev> viewing it through the lens of yesteryear Given that those critical adult-free hours were the norm ~throughout human history, I think the year part of yesteryear sells it short. How about Yesterever? reply MisterBastahrd 2 hours agoparentprevDepends on what you mean. If you are within earshot of your children, you are not \"letting them play by themselves.\" You are supervising their play from a distance. They are not the same. Know why bullies have it so easy nowadays? Because once upon a time, a bully was usually a kid who came from an abusive household and they were just demonstrating what they learned at home. Eventually, they'd end up getting their asses kicked by a kid who had the means and background to defend himself, and they'd learn something from it. Today, the world is full of little Eric Cartman wannabes: little asshole kids whose parents hover around them and will defend them to the ends of the Earth. It's screwed up child socialization and it's ruined childhood education because teachers with three degrees would rather do anything than take abuse from those bad kids and their pathetic, enabling parents. reply rightbyte 39 minutes agorootparentEric Cartman's mother does not defend just him though.

To a normal person this is proof helicopter parenting is working. Two practical choices 1. Have more kids again so they are more disposable. This is a big part of the change. This will happen with UBI. If UBI is a while away, weak kids are here to stay. 2. They don't normally talk about pretense of risk and independence. They mention heights. This can be done safely. I'm really scared to climb the trees I used to as a kid, part is fear of heights growing with age the other is common sense. But why not have 'safe' climbing frame that go to 50+ meters? This is really hard for most things... How do you blow up gas cylinders with a thrill and be safe? Mixing explosive material that's a thrill, again hard to do safely. The fun is not being supervised and in a lab. Blowing off fingers.... not the end of the world. Maybe when eyesight and hearing is restorable it'd be fine again. Killing animals is another one no one openly talks about but is important, it's why biology is failing they are all imposers who want to cuddle a lion, not cut a frog open to see how it works. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
