    "originBody": "Hardest Problem in Computer Science: Centering Things This is my claim: we, as a civilization, forgot how to center things. I mean, we know how to do it. It has never been simpler: display: flex; justify-content: center; /* Horizontal centering */ align-items: center; /* Vertical centering */ (don’t ask why you need to remember four words instead of just horizontal/vertical, it’s still better than before) Or you can use grids if you want: display: grid; justify-items: center; /* Horizontal centering */ align-items: center; /* Vertical centering */ (also don’t ask why justify-content became justify-items) If you feel like school today, we can deduce it from the first principles: Hey, even ChatGPT knows how to center things: Okay, maybe not right away, but eventually it gets there. What I’m saying is: everybody knows how to center things. It’s trivial. And if you are lost, the knowledge is right there. Yet, when we look at actual applications, we see that these methods are not used. We see this: or this: or even this: So something is clearly getting lost between know-how and applying that knowledge. In theory, there’s no difference between theory and practice. Unfortunately, we live in practice. So what’s happening? Let’s find out. Fonts Fonts are one of the biggest offenders. You can see poorly aligned text everywhere. Let me showcase. Apple can’t do it: Microsoft can’t do it: GitHub can’t do it: Valve can’t do it: Slack can’t do it: Telegram can’t do it: Google Maps can’t do it: Honestly, I can provide an endless supply of poorly-aligned buttons without even having to look for them: I think you get the idea. Myriad companies big and small, native or web, and none are safe from text-centering problems. Line height If font metrics are not enough, the next problem on our way to perfect centering is line-height. Line height is... complicated. A canonical article to learn about it is Vincent De Oliveira’s Deep dive CSS: font metrics, line-height and vertical-align. This is how it looks applied in practice. Slack: Notion: Airbnb: YouTube: Aligning two things in different containers is almost impossible: Although many have tried: Not many have succeeded: CSS might get in the way (different controls having different defaults which you have to undo before even starting trying to align): No easy solution here, just roll up your sleeves and delve into specifications. Icons Icons are like small rectangles put in line with text. Therefore all problems caused by text AND line height apply here. Aligning icons next to text is a notoriously hard task. Atom: Platform formerly known as Twitter: iOS: Mozilla: YouTube: Sometimes icon wins over text: Sometimes text wins over icon: Sometimes both lose: Some icons are just plain old HTML form controls: Some are stylized: Thanks @bee for the picture Sometimes people will get creative to achieve perfect alignment: But overall it’s a pretty hopeless game: The problem is, CSS doesn’t help us either. There are 13 possible values for the vertical-align property, but none would align the icon in a meaningful way: text-align: middle comes closest, but it aligns by x-height, not cap-height, which still looks unbalanced: That’s exactly why people love web programming so much. There’s always a challenge. Icon fonts Aligning rectangles is relatively easy. Aligning text is hard. Icons are rectangles. So what if we put icons into a font file? Now we can’t align anything: Neither can we set icon size! In the example above, all icons were set to the same font size and line height. As you can see, all of them come out different sizes, with different paddings, and none were properly aligned. Despite many shortcomings and almost no upsides, companies rushed to add icon fonts everywhere. The result is this: macOS 10.14 → macOS 10.15 Notice how operators are not vertically aligned anymore and are also blurry. All because of switching to icon font. Apple was so committed to icon fonts they even ruined the QuickTime record button: Just look at it: Yes, it actually looks like this to this day. As does the calculator. But they are far from being the only ones. One: Two: Three: Four: Five: Six: Seven: Same as with text alignment, there’s an endless supply of poorly aligned icons. Skill issue Not only programmers fail to center things. Designers do it, too: Current version / my fix The problem with icons is that sometimes you have to take their shape into account for things to look good: Bad centering / good centering Triangle is notably tricky: Sometimes it is too far to the left: Sometimes it’s too far to the right: It can even be too high up (line-height strikes again): Horizontal centering You might think that only centering things vertically is hard. Not only! Horizontal might be hard, too: I don’t think there’s a deep reason for these, except for people just being sloppy: Just, come on! Can this be a deliberate decision? I don’t know. Icons can suffer from it, too: As can text: What can be done: designers So what is the problem? It all starts with the font. Right now, the bounding box of a text block looks like this: The problem is, it can also look like this: or this: Now, what will happen if you try to center text by centering its bounding box? The text will be off! Even though rectangles are perfectly centered. But even if font can have its metrics unbalanced, it doesn’t mean it does. What happens in reality? In reality, most of the popular fonts have metrics slightly off. Many have it significantly off: Percentages are of cap-height 10% is not a small number. It’s a whole pixel in font size 13! Two, if you have 2× scaling! It’s easily noticeable. Basically, Segoe UI is the reason why Github on Windows looks like this: The solution is simple: make tight bounding boxes and centering will become trivial: If you use Figma, it already can do this (although it’s not the default): What can be done: font designers If you are a font designer, make life easier for everybody by setting your metrics so that ascender − cap-height = descender: Or the same idea, visually: Important! You don’t have to actually extend your ascenders/descenders to these boundaries. As you can see in the picture, my ascender space, for example, is way underutilized. Just make the numbers match. For both web and native, to avoid headaches, choose a font that already follows this rule. SF Pro Text, Inter, and Martian Mono seem to do this already, so they will center perfectly with no extra effort. See Font size is useless; let’s fix it for more information. What can be done: web developers From the developer side, it’s a bit more tricky. The first thing to understand, you need to know which font you’ll be using. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work if you plan to substitute fonts. We’ll use IBM Plex Sans, a font used on this very page. IBM Plex Sans has the following metrics: When you set font-size, what you set is UPM (this will also be equal to 1em). However, the actual space occupied by the text block is the space between the ascender and descender. With a few simple calculations, we get that extra padding-bottom: 0.052em should do the trick: Should work like this: Or in actual CSS (select text to see default text bounding box): Andy You can get the required font metrics for your font from opentype.js.org/font-inspector.html (ascender, descender, sCapHeight). Now that we have that sorted, aligning icons is not that hard too. You set vertical-align: baseline and then move them down by (iconHeight - capHeight) / 2: This, unfortunately, requires you to know both font metrics and icon size. But hey, at least it works: Andy Again, select the text above to see how different the browser’s bounding box is from the correct position. What can be done: icons fonts STOP. USING. FONTS. FOR. ICONS. Use normal image format. The one with dimensions, you know? Width and height? Here, I drew a diagram for you, to help you make a decision: Just look at how hard Apple tries to put the checkmark inside the rectangle, and the rectangle next to the text label: And they still fail! Nothing is easier than aligning two rectangles. Nothing is harder than trying to align text that has an arbitrary amount of empty space around it. This is a game that can’t be won. What can be done: optical compensations We, developers, can only mathematically align perfect rectangles. So for anything that requires manual compensation, please wrap it in a big enough rectangle and visually balance your icon inside: What can be done: everyone Please pay attention. Please care. Bad centering can ruin otherwise decent UI: But a properly aligned text can make your UI sing: Even if it’s hard. Even if tools make it inconvenient. Even if you have to search for solutions. Together, I trust, we can find our way back to putting one rectangle inside another rectangle without messing it up. I, for one, want to live in a world of beautiful well-balanced UIs. I trust that you do, too. It’s all worth it in the end. Honorable mention Our article would be incomplete without this guy: Take care! April 16, 2024",

Once you start seeing it, you can't stop seeing it, and it will drive you crazy forever. It is the same for noticing misalignment, recognizing color oversaturation, high quality speakers/headphones, etc. (It is a good article!) reply Maxion 4 hours agoparentThe same happens when you: - Install flooring - Install trim in your own home - Build / install cabinets You will now see: - Odd flooring patterns and uneven floors - Know what it looks like when trim isn't coped - Uneven gaps between doors reply devjab 3 hours agorootparentI’m not entirely sure I agree with you on this. It’s hard for me to say because I really like the imperfections in things I build, for the most part. Like I’ll full spartle a wall (not entirely sure if this is the correct English description) and I’ll intentionally leave the finish less than “perfect” because I think it adds a little soul to it that will make me happy down the years. Then you have things like flooring, installing windows, and anything on outside, however, where I’ll absolutely make sure it’s perfectly everything. Basically so my floors have none of the issues you describe as an example. Part of the success behind this is to hide the imperfections. You’re not going to ever build a perfect floor if you build it all the way to the wall. So what you do is that you leave a gap between the wall and the floor and you cover that gap up with wooden “footlists” (again not sure if that’s the correct English description). This gives you a “perfect” floor which aligns with everything in the room. The more crooked a room is, the more you have to cheat, but if you put in the effort it’s almost always achievable.I would like the small imperfections in these things as well. Ok, maybe not on the outside unless I was very sure it wouldn’t have an impact on the integrity of weather protection, but I wouldn’t mind crooked floors. The reason I strive to make them perfect is that other people won’t, which will make a property much harder to sell. Because unlike imperfect ”walling”, a floor correction/replacement will absolutely impact the value of a property. But then there is the part where you will absolutely notice it when it’s not installed correctly. Which is what I guess you’re getting at, and I agree with you. The thing with buildings, however, is that you have to cheat. Buildings are imperfect and they can even more around a bit as weather conditions change. So with buildings you have to cheat. Which is different than with aligning things on the web, or at least it should be. So this is the part I disagree with a little. As a side note people shouldn’t accept crooked floors and so on, especially not when you’ve hired professionals. They should know how to cheat. reply drikerf 1 hour agorootparentAFAIK you should always leave space between floor and walls. As the material may grow/shrink with temperature etc. Very noticable in Sweden. reply Stratoscope 2 hours agorootparentprev> You’re not going to ever build a perfect floor if you build it all the way to the wall. So what you do is that you leave a gap between the wall and the floor and you cover that gap up with wooden “footlists” (again not sure if that’s the correct English description). This gives you a “perfect” floor which aligns with everything in the room. Here in the US, it's called “baseboard”: https://www.google.com/images?q=baseboard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseboard “[Baseboard's] purpose is to cover the joint between the wall surface and the floor. It covers the uneven edge of flooring next to the wall; protects the wall from kicks, abrasion, and furniture; and can serve as a decorative molding.” reply lostlogin 1 hour agorootparentIt’s ‘skirting’ here in NZ. reply defrost 1 hour agorootparentDitto here in NZ's West Island (Australia). reply kqr 2 hours agorootparentprev> I think it adds a little soul to it that will make me happy down the years.

I’ve seen that there are constructors in India that are very much capable of recognizing and correctly implementing the alignments, but you pay so so much more than the average constructors- and then you are often in a conundrum where you have to choose between paying market rate and getting equivalent precision, or to pay 5x market rate to get a very good standard. reply BuyMyBitcoins 4 hours agorootparentprevI’ve noticed these things all my life. Even as a young child I would point such things out and others would have trouble seeing it. Once I was diagnosed with autism, this tendency of mine made a lot more sense. I’m curious if other people detect interrupted or irregular patterns so readily. It’s like there’s a part of my brain just looking for anomalies and I can’t turn it off. reply rogual 1 hour agorootparentI have this with grammar. When I read modern websites, articles, papers, emails from HR, etc. with their sloppy English and comma-splices everywhere, it annoys me way too much and it's a real challenge to push on through and keep reading. It feels like walking through a maze, with an uneven floor and bad lighting, full of dead-ends, compared to walking down a pleasant, well-lit corridor. reply bluenose69 6 minutes agorootparentThis is spot-on. HR is bad, but at least writing is not their main job, so I'm willing to cut them some slack. My main concern is the writing I see coming out of the Public Relations and Communications departments. Writing is not exactly tangential to those fields. It wasn't always this way. What has happened? reply Akronymus 1 hour agorootparentprevI used to write some of the worst English out there. Then I became part in a streamers community, where proper English grammar was encouraged/enforced. (Well, more like having to at least try to write proper English, there was quite a bit of leeway) Ever since then, I get incredibly annoyed at people just writing \"liek this and not giving an crap about proper grammar or punctuation this makes text harder to read then necessary\" reply TeMPOraL 46 minutes agorootparentSame. Also I get annoyed when pointing out (in good manner) misspellings, bad grammar, or technical inaccuracies gets called out as pedantry or policing, especially here on HN. Sure, it's not the end of the world - but the reason we have a nice place here is, in big part, because enough people care to set certain quality expectations.

The possessive plural is a disaster in American English reply Nevermark 58 minutes agorootparentWell, it is \"a baker's dozen\", right? Not \"all the bakers' dozens\". Since the phrase incorporates a reference to a single individual, as a representative concept for all bakers. So \"the grocer's apostrophe\" makes sense as a phrase referring to a typical individual grocer with a typical atypical apostrophe, standing in as a representative for all grocers and all their darned grocers' apostrophes. reply StefanBatory 2 hours agorootparentprevIs that autism thing? My therapist suspect I'm autistic, and I have always noticed things like this - or trying to align everything in my mind when I look at things, or trying to split the into two halves of equal volume. reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparentIt's related to improved pattern recognition in asd and adhd.

But as soon as you start forcing narrower columns for better readability, you start to run into positioning and precision problems again. Literally cannot win. reply Animats 6 hours agoprevThat's because CSS layout was designed by people who thought \"float\" and \"clear\" were a good idea, tables were bad, and, when in doubt, make it Turing-complete and dump the problem on someone else. 2D and 3D tools get this right. CAD programs, game engines, and animation programs are all far better at positioning things. They have far better layout engines and constraint systems. This is really a constraint problem. Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360 have good 2D constraint solvers, ones that can put something on a centerline, or parallel, or whatever, including curve tools. Webland never got that far. reply bazoom42 4 hours agoparentIt is a weird myth that CSS somehow discourages tables. CSS have supported styling html tables and ‘display:table’ (allowing a table-like layout without html-tables) for 25 years. Float and clear was grandfathered into CSS since they were added to HTML by Netscape. They are fine for their intended purpose: placing images in a text and have the text flow around. Other positioning systems you mention does not solve the same problem as CSS. CSS has to support viewports of any size and dimensions and allow text to scale independently of the viewport size and still remain readable. reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparent>It is a weird myth that CSS somehow discourages tables. CSS have supported styling html tables and ‘display:table’ (allowing a table-like layout without html-tables) for 25 years. Not a myth in any way shape or form. Tables for layout (not tables in general) were discouraged with various arguments in favor of \"float/clear\", even decades before a sane substitute (grid/flex) was available. >Other positioning systems you mention does not solve the same problem as CSS. CSS has to support viewports of any size and dimensions and allow text to scale independently of the viewport size and still remain readable. None of those requirements is unique to CSS, and none of those requirements necessitates the stupid float/clear mechanisms that were shoved into people's throats for 15 years. We're talking about the style language that had layout shoe-horned into it, and which tool decades to develop the most basic layout mechanisms available in GUIs for decades, grid layout and flex layout. And even when it did, it didn't it badly. reply outop 4 hours agorootparentprevBefore CSS people used to use tables, often nested, for all kinds of layout. Eg if your page had a header, a sidebar and a main text area, you would create a table with cells of the right relative widths, with invisible borders, and put each layout element in one possibly merged cell. This was essentially standard practice for a while. CSS allowed layouts like this to be done without tables. It still supported tables, but for the case when you actually want to show tabular data which would appear like a table on the page. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentAnd then it took some 20-ish years for CSS to finally realize that aligning to a grid is a good idea and, through a long, painful, incremental process, eventually reinvent tables for layout. reply yurishimo 2 hours agorootparentI mean, semantics are also good! Yes, CSS grids are a lot like tables in some ways, but not having to add 25% more DOM elements to fake a table layout (display: table/table-row/table-cell; that's 3 divs for one row!) is also a thing to be celebrated. Plus, in practice, grid is a lot more powerful than doing a few common layouts. Grid took so long precisely because they were trying to think a little further ahead rather than just pushing something out into the world and hoping it works out. Thankfully web standards have matured and are more careful not to repeat mistakes like the debacle that was CSS property prefixes. reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparent>I mean, semantics are also good! Yes, CSS grids are a lot like tables in some ways, but not having to add 25% more DOM elements to fake a table layout (display: table/table-row/table-cell; that's 3 divs for one row!) is also a thing to be celebrated. Semantics in the context of CSS is a stupid idea web designers came up with. The semantics is not the job for HTML, for it needing to be semantically clean and \"parsable/reusable\" (to do what? webscrap it? For screen-readers there are metadata annotations). The semantics belong to whatever backend and metadata you have your content in, before it gets rendered as HTML. And if you need to also give it to users in parsable/reusable form, allow them to query a JSON (or structured) version. reply ttepasse 1 hour agorootparentprev> but not having to add 25% more DOM elements to fake a table layout I'm not the most current, but as I remember in CSS tables those table-internal elements generate the needed anonymous boxes of rows, tbodys and such, when those arent't specified: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#example-d11b97c3 reply mike_hearn 1 hour agorootparentprevNah, semantics are worthless. The whole semantic web idea never took off for good reasons, HTML5 semantic tags don't have any meaningful semantics and you can't even reliably remove boilerplate from HTML without ML pipelines (a basic use case you'd expect any \"semantic\" document format to nail easily). Then the invention of LLMs killed it twice over. HTML is a graphics rendering language in denial about its true nature. Grid took a long time because everything takes a long time when you have to align mutually competing organizations and there's no profit motive involved with the actual work itself. There's no real technical benefits to CSS layout over table tags. A table tag isn't a heavy object. CSS cascade calculations on the other hand ... reply PetitPrince 1 hour agorootparentI suggest you spend some time with a screen reader or have a look at the accessibility tab of you browser to get a feel of the worth of semantic web. It's true you won't ever have a perfect semantic representation of a page (and I have no idea how blind people manage those infinite scroller), but in my mind havingorinstead ofstill helps a lot on that aspect. reply Akronymus 1 hour agorootparentprevCSS tables can have grid-auto-flow as dense, which is quite helpful at rare times. You obviously could do that wit tables + js, but it's nice to not have to worry about the implementation details. reply bandrami 1 hour agorootparentprevI absolutely remember a ton of pieces about how we all needed to stop using tables (and 1x1 transparent gifs, too) for page layout because CSS was The Right Way reply dspillett 36 minutes agorootparentThe issue is people taking “tables are bad for non-tabular layout” and just remembering the first three words. People like stark binary yes/no rules, so “tables are bad” was born and spread widely. If your layout is intended to be a table, then a table (styled with CSS) is the way to go, otherwise use semantic HTML (styled with CSS) and you will (in theory) have an easier time making the design work well at different sizes/resolutions and in alternate UAs like screen readers. reply bazoom42 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is always a lot of confusion about this because “tables” can mean different things - it is both a set of structual elements in HTML and a layout model in CSS. CSS is “the right way” to control styling and layout, but that does not mean you can’t use tables. In the early days of the web people used the BLOCKQUOTE element to create margins since this was the only way. When CSS arrived, it became “the right way” to create margins - but that does not mean you can’t use blockquotes! You just need to distinguish beteen the semantics of a quote and the layou effect of margins. But I’m sure someone understod this to mean that quoting things were bad. reply TeMPOraL 27 minutes agorootparentBut that is the point. CSS arrived, and people started saying you \"just need to distinguish beteen the semantics of\" a table \"and the layout effect\". Back then, the chant of the day was, \"blood for the blood god, tabular data for thegod, layout for the CSS god\". And then it spiraled into general \"separation of content and presentation\" nonsense that, like in any good cult, people believed with their whole hearts, preached to make new converts, then did the opposite because reality demanded it, and couldn't see the problem. CSS Zen Garden notwithstanding, we ended up with div soups (later, semantic div-equivalent soups) inseparable from complex CSS, because form is function; your content is always designed with a particular form in mind. reply Moru 4 hours agorootparentprevWhen people say not to use tables they mean for layout of the entire page reply coldtea 1 hour agorootparentThey should not have advised against that either. It was a much saner, simpler, and more efficient mechanism that the clear/float monstrocities imposed upon people in the period before grid, which reinvented the same thing (table layout) just without the actual tags. reply justsomehnguy 3 hours agorootparentprev> they mean They shouldn't had mean, they should had said that.

Significantly more sane layout model (by virtue of having more than a mote of sanity at all). It did handle a very wide gamut of clients during its time. Why? Because it was designed for creating apps, not documents. HTML is great for creating documents, most of the examples in the post are not documents. reply ozim 4 hours agoparentprevI don’t think it was that tables were bad. They were too formulaic and too strict and it was hard to do something that would stand out. With CSS it wasn’t dumping problem on the others, it was giving the freedom. Problem with freedom is that it is never free and you also have to fix additional problems that come with it. reply atoav 2 hours agorootparentThe problem I see with using tables for layout is that it fucks up the semantic meaning of the html file. But that was an issue of philosophy that got trumped by practical needs. However, nowadays we have css grids with template areas. So we can just write our HTML semantically correct as if it was more or less just about the content (as it should be IMHO) and still move things around using CSS depending on the type of device, size of screen, media used. So the holy grail in my opinion is to write HTML that contains only content and metadata and next to no elements or attributes that are needed purely for semantically irrelevant layout and styling purposes — and then do all the layout and styling in CSS. Styling tags likeor the occasionalare okay, one should never be too strict with such ideals. The advantage here is that this provides the maximum decoupling between the content and the layout/styling which not only helps with future layout updates, but improves the accessability of the page. reply AlecSchueler 1 hour agorootparent> But that was an issue of philosophy that got trumped by practical needs Also very real issues like accessibility. reply matsemann 53 minutes agorootparentOne thing I also seem to remember from the very old days, was that browsers wouldn't render the table until it was completely downloaded.

In the same way that one would float a figure to the left or right of lines of a paragraph, `float: left;` and `float: right;` allowed you to do the same. Open a textbook and look at lines of a paragraph flowing (where content \"flow\" layout comes from) around a figure, such as an image or a diagram. The World Wide Web was documents. In this context, `float` was a genius idea. There's literally no other way in CSS to do this without a bunch of hacks. reply TeMPOraL 20 minutes agorootparentHonestly, that itself sounds bad too. The concept of floating sounds like something invented back during manual typesetting or earlier. I think anyone ever trying to write a paper or book with images in it using tools like LaTeX knows how bad it is to let the tool position images for you. It's always wrong, and one of the first things you learn is how to pin the image in between the text lines/paragraphs you wanted it to be between. Text-to-diagram tools like PlantUML (and arguably even Graphviz) make this mistake too. The moment you put more than a couple things in your diagram, you discover that auto-layout can't ever make the result readable, and you look for ways to pin parts of the diagram relative to other parts; something these tools don't let you do either. And then all three classes of tools here - HTML, typesetting, diagramming - violate the principle of least surprise in the nastiest of way: make one little change, add a letter or word somewhere, suddenly the result looks nothing like it was before, as the auto-layouting flips everything around. reply IshKebab 2 hours agorootparentprevEveryone realises that. They just understand that it is a big problem with CSS. People wanted app-like layouts since before CSS was a thing. The problem is the people who designed CSS had an ideological axe to grind.

Use precise measurements for your margins? Someone will say that perceptually it’s not symmetrical, and rightfully point out that perceived symmetry is the only one that matters. Adjust visually for your hanging punctuation, ascenders and descenders? Someone will draw a bunch of red lines and complain it’s not perfectly aligned with baseline, x-height, or whatever they prefer. GUIs around us are rich with obviously broken examples where spinners spin out of their centers, text in boxes is misaligned, etc. However, as articles like this one show, even if every one of those is dealt with, us designers will still have everything to complain about.

Somw people like to think centering things is taking the bounding box of the visible pixel and centering the center of the bounding box. But some letters have more pixels in one half or the other, so that would leave you with more whitespace one one or the other side. That means despite being metrically centered it still doesn't look optically centered. I guess one could devise algorithms for that, but I haven't seen one that does a better job than my brain and my eyes. reply strogonoff 3 hours agorootparent> Somw people like to think centering things is taking the bounding box of the visible pixel and centering the center of the bounding box. That was my naive understanding for probably my first year at the uni. It got cleared up fairly quickly. I imagine there can be typesetting/layout styles where this holds, but I would classify them as niche (maybe brutalism or something like that). Funnily enough, in the very first example under Fonts I thought the author didn’t like “Manage…” because it could be pushed slightly to the right (due to ellipsis), but it turns out to be about vertical alignment which I didn’t see anything obviously wrong about in that particular case. Once you deal with the obvious cases of lopsidedness in your design, the important quality becomes simply: stay consistent. Here, no self-respecting designer would pull one random example and say it’s wrong—you have to assess in context of design model as a whole, where you can either 1) show how one particular button breaks the model, or 2) argue that the model is wrong (which can be done, but good luck). reply dsego 1 hour agorootparentThis vertical centering of text in buttons is more noticeable when there is an icon next to it. But it drives me crazy that the default is not to center around the cap and baseline. This is what I usually see in figma designs and it looks the best, but it's not simple to apply in html & css. reply crazygringo 10 hours agoprevThis is an excellent piece, about how virtually impossible it is to center things accurately mostly because of how fonts are displayed. But I'll add two more wrinkles that the author doesn't mention: First, that font rendering isn't just about metrics but varies across operating systems and browsers. So even if you center perfectly on Chrome on your Mac, it may very well be off on Firefox on Windows. And second, that the author's proposed solutions only work for Western-style fonts that have ascenders and descenders.

Everyone I called over to do said work said easy peasy, measure wall to wall, divide by 3, done and done. I tried to explain this centers the bases, but then the fans will be closer to each other than the walls, but they'd either argue or just roll their eyes. I finally just marked the ceiling myself, and found a person to do the work without asking why or arguing. Ah, perfectly spaced fans at last. reply PennRobotics 2 hours agorootparentTo better understand how people might get confused... Imagine a room 9 feetlong and fans 2 feet in diameter. If you put them with bases equally spaced—3 feet apart—you get a gap 2 feet between the wall and fans… but 1 foot spaced apart in the middle. Naively, you move each fan a half foot closer to the wall. This makes the gap 1.5 feet to the wall but now 2 feet between each other. (You might find ways to argue that this looks better visually than the true answer below, and that depends on a lot of perception-altering factors including how low the fan hangs from the ceiling, amount/ratio of space available, the distance from the non-perpendicular walls, and light sources as they might cast shadows with different sized gaps on the ceiling.) You need to take the total room length and subtract the fan diameters, then divide that by 3. (So, 5 / 3 = 1.667 or 1'8\" from wall to blade tip.) Thus, each base should be 2.667 feet from its nearest wall. This makes a gap 1'8\" between each blade tip: 20\" space, 24\" blades, 20\" space, 24\" blades, 20\" space = 108\" (9 ft) room length Bringing this around to the theme of web design, this is akin to space-between, space-around, and space-evenly in justify-content[1] (except there isn't a \"space the center of each element evenly\" selection, except maybe stretch or nesting everything in another flexbox) [1] https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-j... reply mmis1000 2 hours agoprevIt don't even talk about CJK though.

The problem is that things that are lined up look nice from far away, and very close up, but not always when reading text. The Apple \"Manage\" button is the simplest to illustrate. You might think that just having equal vertical space above the M and below the g is the best, but when you read text you're also used to seeing letters stick out of the bottom of the line. So having the g not protrude might look odd. Or if you have two buttons next to each other, one \"Manage\" and one \"Add\" - what should you do? Should you centre Manage, and put the text for both on the same imaginary horizontal line? That will make \"Add\" look odd when viewed in isolation. Or should you centre Add? Then Manage will look odd when screenshotted by itself. Or should you let each have their own vertical centre? Then they will be mismatched.

Obviously, we compromised in practice :) reply jrmg 10 hours agoparentThat’s actually arguably the source of the problem in a lot of these examples. In some of them, the bad alignment would look good if the text next to it contained more descenders. This could be compensated for, of course. For e.g. a single checkbox and text, move the text a bit lower if there are no descenders in it. But that doesn’t work if the text is user input, or if there are multiple text boxes in a list: it’s noticeable (and unpleasant) if the baselines of the text are in different places next to their individual checkboxes if - even if they’d all individually look best in that alignment viewed alone. And if the text is editable, it’s even worse. No-one wants their text to be jumping up and down while editing to maintain optical alignment. The problem gets even worse if you have mixed language support, and the text might be in languages with ‘tall’ characters (Thai, Arabic, sometimes Vietnamese - and a long list of others) or a different idea of ‘line height’. Compromises must be made, unfortunately. Of course, that doesn’t excuse a lot of the examples here, which are of specific designs - but it does mean that a lot more ‘design’ time is required, especially if there are multiple localisations, than feels at-all intuitive to anyone who has not done this. reply bee_rider 6 hours agorootparent> And if the text is editable, it’s even worse.

The iOS upper right tray stuff looks right how it is, I don't think they were trying to center them vertically with each other. It's treated more like a line of text, with some parts of the icons (outer border of the battery, rounded corners of the LTE bars) dropping below baseline like descenders. And the Business login screen pushes the centering around because it assigns different visual weight to the UI element versus its label. When the label is on the left (text fields) the centerline shifts right, and when the label is on the right (checkbox) the centerline shifts left. The elements that stand alone (building circle, Business text, Sign In button, Need help signing in text) all keep a consistent line.

So if you use icon fonts, it will look like garbage on terminal browsers, but with images there is a chance that it will work. Sure, who cares, nobody targets w3m in 2024. But the problem can surface for people using modern browsers too, if they explicitly override your font for accessibility reasons. (For example, there exist fonts designed to aid dyslexic readers.) Then on (relatively) well-behaved sites they will see only a text description; on others they will just see some empty squares. reply low_tech_punk 3 hours agoprevThe upvote triangle seems a little off too. reply xnx 10 hours agoprevThe page doesn't even mention the brand new align-content property: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40064762 reply CharlesW 7 hours agoparentThis is nice, but if you change the `` height to 30px, you'll see that the text is not optically centered. reply marcell 10 hours agoprev> don’t ask why you need to remember four words instead of just horizontal/vertical, it’s still better than before The reason is \"display: flex\" can be a column or row. The \"align-items\" property describes alignment along the axis, so vertical for column and horizontal for row. The \"justify-content\" property is the other direction. reply cdrini 7 hours agoparentI wonder if something like this would've worked. I always mentally think of flex box as having a primary axis that's like a rope that runs through the container, and the children are stuck onto this rope. ``` display: flex; // The flex axis is the axis where items get added. So horizontal would add things to the right, vertical to the bottom flex-axis: horizontal; flex-axis-align: center; // Normal as used in math to mean perpendicular to the curve flex-normal-align: center; ``` Or `flex-align: center;` for short. This would give a decently simpler mental model with only three terms: the flex axis, the flex normal, and the alignment. And actually it would allow some interesting natural extensions! You could do `flex-axis: path(...)` to specify an arbitrary curve to position your elements on. Any edge cases I'm missing as to why this wouldn't work? reply Inviz 4 hours agorootparentCSS goes away from left/right in general. See inline-* and block-* family of properties. This is to support RTL and vertical writing modes easier. reply naasking 5 hours agoparentprevArguably, \"align\" and \"cross-align\" are more direct and descriptive. reply Rumudiez 9 hours agoparentprevThe other CSS terms for this are block and inline, as in padding-inline-start and padding-block-end.

Should I really fork over hard-earned money for the premium version if they can't even get basic shit right? reply watwut 2 hours agorootparentI dunno. I found out that people who do care about how things look like, tend not to care about how they work and whether they are practical. And the other way round too. The slightly misaligned button is not \"basic shit\". It is useless shit. And this works on company level too. The groups that spend a lot of time caring about visuals tend not to give a damm about much else. reply GuB-42 39 minutes agorootparentI can see the difference between practical design and bad design. A misaligned button is usually the latter. Those who just want the thing to work without much regard for the looks of it will tend to use whatever default their UI package comes with, with minimal styling, if at all. It is often not bad in terms of correctness. Defaults may not look great, but they are usually well designed and consistent. If you have alignment problems, it is often because you tried to do something to the looks, but did it poorly. reply watwut 2 minutes agorootparentI did not mean it as in difference between \"practical design and bad design\". I do agree there is usually tension between the two. Simply, people who care about function wont notice misaligned button. And people who are notice misaligned button usually prioritize visual stuff over everything. That extends to managers and whole companies. Pretty much no UI package will have everything aligned out of the box, it is not even possible. When you use them out of the box without tweaking, you either get misaligned things.

You just had to notice it was busted in the first place, and then go in and fix it. It's not a technological problem, or at least not a non-trivial one. The problem is that, if it's off by a couple pixels, the front-end engineer may not notice it, and the designer may not even look at it. Or, if they do notice it, they think \"do I want to file a bug report right now, or do I want to work on my own ticket right now?\" Having worked in both roles, this is my experience anyway. I agree that there's no consistent way to center things that always works, no matter what, without anybody thinking about it or paying really careful attention. I think we prioritize solutions with those performance characteristics, which is a separate problem of even greater magnitude. reply crazygringo 10 hours agoparentNo, this was never possible, not in web development. You could do it in one browser on one OS, but then they could be off on another browser on another OS. It's absolutely a technological problem because pixel-perfect rendering and alignment is not part of the HTML/CSS specs, when it comes to how fonts get drawn. The only way to actually get it perfect is to do browser and OS detection and then hand-code a bunch of manual offsets that you keep up to date. And obviously that would be insane. reply saurik 10 hours agorootparentI don't think you have to have a \"pixel-perfect\" rendering system to support centering things correctly? reply anonymoushn 6 hours agorootparentIf you don't, you'll be off by 1px? reply saurik 5 hours agorootparentSo, I would use the term \"pixel-perfect\" to mean that the person making it can target some specific layout, choosing all aspects such as the sizes and fonts and exact colors and such. However, even without that, you can still say \"I want this to be monospaced red on a blue background and larger than usual\" and all of those properties can vary but hopefully something should happen that preserves at least some of that intent? The properties of vertically centering something inside of a table cell to me are not part of a pixel-perfect layout system, and yet I feel like my user agent is doing a pretty poor job if it doesn't have at least some sane strategy for this, and to the extent to which there are multiple different good ways to do it I hate that it seems to default to \"if I can't select a good way I'll just use a bad way\" in its zeal to refuse to expose multiple definitions of \"centered\" to the web developer (and again: I don't think being able to say \"try to center this in a way useful for numbers\" is part of \"pixel perfect\"). reply jibbit 3 hours agoprevI'm pretty sure you can narrow that down to \"icons. the harde..\".

When you try you pretty quickly remember why they exist reply renegade-otter 1 hour agoprev\"If you really hate someone - teach them kerning\" reply virtualritz 45 minutes agoprevTLDR; understanding the math of centering stuff doesn't mean you know how to center stuff in design. The visual/optical center is not the geometric center. It is slightly above. Graphic design basics. The author mentions the word 'optical' once and 'visual' twice. Never in the above context. I.e. they never explain this, so we must assume they don't know about it. And we actually have evidence they don't. The image below the sentence \"Apple can't do it\" is an example of visually/optically correctly centered text on the vertical axis. Slightly above geometric and giving the lowercase letters more weight in the decision. Some designers would argue the text should be moved down one pixel in the example at hand but I'd disagree. The problem here is a different one. The ellipsis (...) is very light, optically, so the horizontal center should account for that and the text moved slightly right. That is not shown or talked about at all. Go figure ... Yes, there is a problem, it's the enshittification of design everywhere. Centering not existing is part of it. As are people like the author who understand the problem but lack knowledge (sea above) to detail a correct solution. They say \"we developers\" in one sentence. Graphic design was something you studied at uni when I was young. Just as CS. Maybe I'm just old but you don't know shit about centering stuff in design if you know how to center stuff mathematically. And yeah, since I'm ranting: Don't get me started on Material design. Where to start? Tiny text only buttons that don't even have an outline and whose size depends solely on the length of the text inside.

I think the biggest problem with CSS is the same problem plaguing C++ and other older languages. Cruft. If there was proper versioning and pieces of the language were deprecated in favor of modern techniques, it would remove a lot of ambiguity. Heck, if there was a built-in linter that warned you about common errors that would be a massive upgrade! The only bad part about CSS is that there’s a dozen ways to do everything. With that said, any developer telling you they hate it probably hasn’t worked with the “state of the art” in other UI development. Go work with WPF, UWP, QT, ImGui, JavaFX, Swing, or any of the dozens of other desktop UI frameworks. Then, try to make a moderately complex style and apply it to several elements. It’s a PITA. I too hated CSS… but then I worked with WPF and JavaFX and lots of those other frameworks: and they gave me a fresh dose of perspective. I’ll gladly take the ability to do everything a dozen different ways over the inability to do anything that strays from the happy path in the framework I’m using. reply mike_hearn 1 hour agorootparentJavaFX uses a dialect of CSS so that's not necessarily a great example. It's also somewhat simplified compared to normal CSS, for example, the way layout works is more normal for GUIs (containers that implement different constraint systems). For things like theming your UI it works pretty well. I've done web CSS and JavaFX CSS and for app GUI I'd much rather use the latter. For nicely styled documents with good typography on the other hand, web CSS is going to be better. JavaFX also scores points for having a binary form of CSS that can be loaded and parsed much faster. CSS as a language is bloody awful of course. The prevalence of dialects that compile down to it is always a giveaway that the language didn't keep pace with people's needs. reply AtNightWeCode 2 hours agoprevMy experience is that frontend devs mostly wants to write js and not css.

    "commentBody": "Embeddings are a good starting point for the AI curious app developer (bawolf.substack.com)549 points by bryantwolf 16 hours agohidepastfavorite149 comments thisiszilff 16 hours agoOne straightforward way to get started is to understand embedding without any AI/deep learning magic. Just pick a vocabulary of words (say, some 50k words), pick a unique index between 0 and 49,999 for each of the words, and then produce embedding by adding +1 to the given index for a given word each time it occurs in a text. Then normalize the embedding so it adds up to one. Presto -- embeddings! And you can use cosine similarity with them and all that good stuff and the results aren't totally terrible. The rest of \"embeddings\" builds on top of this basic strategy (smaller vectors, filtering out words/tokens that occur frequently enough that they don't signify similarity, handling synonyms or words that are related to one another, etc. etc.). But stripping out the deep learning bits really does make it easier to understand. reply HarHarVeryFunny 13 hours agoparentThose would really just be identifiers. I think the key property of embeddings is that the dimensions each individually mean/measure something, and therefore the dot product of two embeddings (similarity of direction of the vectors) is a meaningful similarity measure of the things being represented. The classic example is word embeddings such as word2vec, or GloVE, where due to the embeddings being meaningful in this way, one can see vector relationships such as \"man - woman\" = \"king - queen\". reply thisiszilff 12 hours agorootparent> I think the key property of embeddings is that the dimensions each individually mean/measure something, and therefore the dot product of two embeddings (similarity of direction of the vectors) is a meaningful similarity measure of the things being represented. In this case each dimension is the presence of a word in a particular text. So when you take the dot product of two texts you are effectively counting the number of words the two texts have in common (subject to some normalization constants depending on how you normalize the embedding). Cosine similarity still works for even these super naive embeddings which makes it slightly easier to understand before getting into any mathy stuff. You are 100% right this won't give you the word embedding analogies like king - man = queen or stuff like that. This embedding has no concept of relationships between words. reply HarHarVeryFunny 12 hours agorootparentBut that doesn't seem to be what you are describing in terms of using incrementing indices and adding occurrence counts. If you want to create a bag of words text embedding then you set the number of embedding dimensions to the vocabulary size and the value of each dimension to the global count of the corresponding word. reply thisiszilff 12 hours agorootparentHeh -- my explanation isn't the clearest I realize, but yes, it is BoW. Eg fix your vocab of 50k words (or whatever) and enumerate it. Then to make an embedding for some piece of text 1. initialize an all zero vector of size 50k 2. for each word in the text, add one to the index of the corresponding word (per our enumeration). If the word isn't in the 50k words in your vocabulary, then discard it 3. (optionally), normalize the embedding to 1 (though you don't really need this and can leave it off for the toy example). initialize an embedding (for a single text) as an all zero vector of size 50k reply p1esk 10 hours agorootparentThis is not the best way to understand where modern embeddings are coming from. reply codetrotter 9 hours agorootparentTrue, but what is the best way? reply HarHarVeryFunny 8 hours agorootparentAre you talking about sentence/text chunk embeddings, or just embeddings in general? If you need high quality text embeddings (e. g to use with a vector DB for text chunk retrieval), they they are going to come from the output of a language model, either a local one or using an embeddings API. Other embeddings are normally going to be learnt in end-to-end fashion. reply IanCal 13 hours agorootparentprevThey're not, I get why you think that though. They're making a vector for a text that's the term frequencies in the document. It's one step simpler than tfidf which is a great starting point. reply HarHarVeryFunny 13 hours agorootparentOK, sounds counter-intuitive, but I'll take your word for it! It seems odd since the basis of word similarity captured in this type of way is that word meanings are associated with local context, which doesn't seem related to these global occurrence counts. Perhaps it works because two words with similar occurrence counts are more likely to often appear close to each other than two words where one has a high count, and another a small count? But this wouldn't seem to work for small counts, and anyways the counts are just being added to the base index rather than making similar-count words closer in the embedding space. Do you have any explanation for why this captures any similarity in meaning? reply IanCal 12 hours agorootparent> rather than making similar-count words closer in the embedding space. Ah I think I see the confusion here. They are describing creating an embedding of a document or piece of text. At the base, the embedding of a single word would just be a single 1. There is absolutely no help with word similarity. The problem of multiple meanings isn't solved by this approach at all, at least not directly. Talking about the \"gravity of a situation\" in a political piece makes the text a bit more similar to physics discussions about gravity. But most of the words won't match as well, so your document vector is still more similar to other political pieces than physics. Going up the scale, here's a few basic starting points that were (are?) the backbone of many production text AI/ML systems. 1. Bag of words. Here your vector has a 1 for words that are present, and 0 for ones that aren't. 2. Bag of words with a count. A little better, now we've got the information that you said \"gravity\" fifty times not once. Normalise it so text length doesn't matter and everything fits into 0-1. 3. TF-IDF. It's not very useful to know that you said a common word a lot. Most texts do, what we care about is ones that say it more than you'd expect so we take into account how often the words appear in the entire corpus. These don't help with words, but given how simple they are they are shockingly useful. They have their stupid moments, although one benefit is that it's very easy to debug why they cause a problem. reply OmarShehata 13 hours agorootparentprevAre you saying it's pure chance that operations like \"man - woman\" = \"king - queen\" (and many, many other similar relationships and analogies) work? If not please explain this comment to those of us ignorant in these matters :) reply StrangeDoctor 12 hours agorootparentIt’s not pure chance that the above calculus shakes out, but it doesn’t have to be that way. If you are embedding on a word by word level then it can happen, if it’s a little smaller or larger than word by word it’s not immediately clear what the calculation is doing. But the main difference here is you get 1 embedding for the document in question, not an embedding per word like word2vec. So it’s something more like “document about OS/2 warp” - “wiki page for ibm” + “wiki page for Microsoft” = “document on windows 3.1” reply napoleongl 4 hours agorootparentprev3Blue1Brown has some other examples in his videos about transformers, most notably I think is that hitler-Germany+italy ~ Mussolini! https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gpt reply pstorm 15 hours agoparentprevI'm trying to understand this approach. Maybe I am expecting too much out of this basic approach, but how does this create a similarity between words with indices close to each other? Wouldn't it just be a popularity contest - the more common words have higher indices and vice versa? For instance, \"king\" and \"prince\" wouldn't necessarily have similar indices, but they are semantically very similar. reply svieira 15 hours agorootparentYou are expecting too much out of this basic approach. The \"simple\" similarity search in word2vec (used in https://semantle.com/ if you haven't seen it) is based on _multiple_ embeddings like this one (it's a simple neural network not a simple embedding). reply bschmidt1 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is a simple example where it scores their frequency. If you scored every word by their frequency only you might have embeddings like this: act: [0.1] as: [0.4] at: [0.3] ... That's a very simple 1D embedding, and like you said would only give you popularity. But say you wanted other stuff like its: Vulgarity, prevalence over time, whether its slang or not, how likely it is to start or end a sentence, etc. you would need more than 1 number. In text-embedding-ada-002 there are 1536 numbers in the array (vector), so it's like: act: [0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.0001, 0.000003, 0.003, ... (1536 items)] ... The numbers don't mean anything in-and-of-themselves. The values don't represent qualities of the words, they're just numbers in relation to others in the training data. They're different numbers in different training data because all the words are scored in relation to each other, like a graph. So when you compute them you arrive at words and meanings in the training data as you would arrive at a point in a coordinate space if you subtracted one [x,y,z] from another [x,y,z] in 3D. So the rage about a vector db is that it's a database for arrays of numbers (vectors) designed for computing them against each other, optimized for that instead of say a SQL or NoSQL which are all about retrieval etc. So king vs prince etc. - When you take into account the 1536 numbers, you can imagine how compared to other words in training data they would actually be similar, always used in the same kinds of ways, and are indeed semantically similar - you'd be able to \"arrive\" at that fact, and arrive at antonyms, synonyms, their French alternatives, etc. but the system doesn't \"know\" that stuff. Throw in Burger King training data and talk about French fries a lot though, and you'd mess up the embeddings when it comes arriving at the French version of a king! You might get \"pomme de terre\". reply jncfhnb 14 hours agorootparentprevKing doesn’t need to appear commonly with prince. It just needs to appear in the same context as prince. It also leaves out the old “tf idf” normalization of considering how common a word is broadly (less interesting) vs in that particular document. Kind of like a shittier attention. Used to make a big difference. reply sdwr 15 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't even work as described for popularity - one word starts at 49,999 and one starts at 0. reply itronitron 15 hours agorootparentYeah, that is a poorly written description. I think they meant that each word gets a unique index location into an array, and the value at that word's index location is incremented whenever the word occurs. reply zachrose 15 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the idea is to order your vocabulary into some kind of “semantic rainbow”? Like a one-dimensional embedding? reply im3w1l 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's a document embedding, not a word embedding. reply mschulkind 15 hours agoparentprevAren't you just describing a bag-of-words model? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model reply thisiszilff 12 hours agorootparentYes! And the follow up that cosine similarity (for BoW) is a super simple similarity metric based on counting up the number of words the two vectors have in common. reply dekhn 15 hours agoparentprevIs that really an embedding? I normally think of an embedding as an approximate lower-dimensional matrix of coefficients that operate on a reduced set of composite variables that map the data from a nonlinear to linear space. reply thisiszilff 12 hours agorootparentYou're right that what I described isn't what people commonly think about as embeddings (given we are more advanced now the above description), but broadly an embedding is anything (in nlp at least) that maps text into a fixed length vector. When you make embedding like this, the nice thing is that cosine similarity has an easy to understand similarity meaning: count the number of words two documents have in common (subject to some normalization constant). Most fancy modern embedding strategies basically start with this and then proceed to build on top of it to reduce dimensions, represent words as vectors in their own right, pass this into some neural layer, etc. reply light_hue_1 10 hours agorootparentA lot of people here are trying to describe to you that no, this is not at all the starting point of modern embeddings. This has none of the properties of embeddings. What you're describing is an idea from the 90s that was a dead end. Bag of words representations. It has no relationship to modern methods. It's based on totally different theory (bow instead of the distributional hypothesis). There is no conceptual or practical path from what you describe to what modern embeddings are. It's horribly misleading. reply danieldk 2 hours agorootparentThere is no conceptual or practical path from what you describe to what modern embeddings are. There certainly is. At least there is a strong relation between bag of word representations and methods like word2vec. I am sure you know all of this, but I think it's worth expanding a bit on this, since the top-level comment describes things in a rather confusing way. In traditional Information Retrieval, two kinds of vectors were typically used: document vectors and term vectors. If you make a |D| x |T| matrix (where |D| is the number of documents and |T| is the number of terms that occur in all documents), we can go through a corpus and note in each |T|-length row for a particular the frequency of each term in that document (frequency here means the raw counts or something like TF-IDF). Each row is a document vector, each column a term vector. The cosine similarity between two document vectors will tell you whether two documents are similar, because similar documents are likely to have similar terms. The cosine similarity between two term vectors will tell you whether two terms are similar, because similar terms tend to occur in similar documents. The top-level comment seems to have explained document vectors in a clumsy way. Over time (we are talking 70-90s), people have found that term vectors did not really work well, because documents are often too coarse-grained as context. So, term vectors were defined as |T| x |T| matrices where if you have such a matrix C, C[i][j] contains the frequency of how often the j-th term occurs in the context of the i-th term. Since this type of matrix is not bound to documents, you can choose the context size based on the goals you have in mind. For instance, you could only count terms that are within 10 (text) distance of the occurrences of the term i. One refinement is that rather than raw frequencies, we can use some other measure. One issue with raw frequencies is that a frequent word like the will co-occur with pretty much every word, so it's frequency in the term vector is not particularly informative, but it's large frequency will have an outsized influence on e.g. dot products. So, people would typically use pointwise mutual information (PMI) instead. It's beyond the scope of a comment to explain PMI, but intuitively you can think of the PMI of two words to mean: how much more often do the words cooccur than chance? This will result in low PMIs for e.g. PMI(information, the) but a high PMI for PMI(information, retrieval). Then it's also common practice to replace negative PMI values by zero, which leads to PPMI (positive PMI). So, what do we have now? A |T|x|T| matrix with PPMI scores, where each row (or column) can be used as a word vector. However, it's a bit unwieldy, because the vectors are large (|T|) and typically somewhat sparse. So people started to apply dimensionality reduction, e.g. by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD, I'll skip the details here of how to use it for dimensionality reduction). So, suppose that we use SVD to reduce the vector dimensionality to 300, we are left with a |T|x300 matrix and we finally have dense vectors, similar to e.g. word2vec. Now, the interesting thing is that people have found that word2vec's skipgram with negative sampling (SGNS) is implicitly vectorizing a PMI-based word-context matrix [1], exactly like the IR folks were doing before. Conversely, if you matrix-multiply the word and context embedding matrices that come out of word2vec SGNS, you get an approximation of the |T|x|T| PMI matrix (or |T|x|C| if a different vocab is used for the context). Summarized, there is a strong conceptual relation between bag-of-word representations of old days and word2vec. Whether it's an interesting route didactically for understanding embeddings is up for debate. It's not like the mathematics behind word2vec are complex (understanding the dot product and the logistic function goes a long way) and understanding word2vec in terms of 'neural net building blocks' makes it easier to go from word2vec to modern architectures. But in an exhaustive course about word representations, it certainly makes sense to link word embeddings to prior work in IR. [1] https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2014/file/f... reply thisiszilff 9 hours agorootparentprevEh, I disagree. When I began working in ML everything was about word2vec and glove and the state of the art for embedding documents was adding together all the word embeddings and it made no sense to me but it worked. Learning about BoW and simple ways of convert text to fixed length vectors that can be used in ML algos clarified a whole for me, especially the fact that embeddings aren’t magic they are just a way to convert text to a fixed length vector. BoW and tf-idf vectors are still workhorses for routine text classification tasks despite their limitations, so they aren’t really a dead end. Similarity a lot of things that follow BoW make a whole lot more sense if you think of them as addressing limitations of BoW. reply light_hue_1 8 hours agorootparentWell, you've fooled yourself into thinking you understand something when you don't. I say this as someone with a PhD in the topic, who has taught many students, and published dozens of papers in the space. The operation of adding BoW vectors together has nothing to do with the operation of adding together word embeddings. Well, aside from both nominally being addition. It's like saying you understand what's happening because you can add velocity vectors and then you go on to add the binary vectors that represent two binary programs and expect the result to give you a program with the average behavior of both. Obviously that doesn't happen, you get a nonsense binary. They may both be arrays of numbers but mathematically there's no relationship between the two. Thinking that there's a relationship between them leads to countless nonsense conclusions: the idea that you can keep adding word embeddings to create document embeddings like you keep adding BoWs, the notion that average BoWs mean the same thing as average word embeddings, the notion that normalizing BoWs is the same as normalizing word embeddings and will lead to the same kind of search results, etc. The errors you get with BoWs are totally different from the errors you get with word or sentence or document embeddings. And how you fix those errors is totally different. No. Nothing at all makes sense about word embeddings from the point of BoW. Also, yes BoW is a total dead end. They have been completely supplanted. There's never any case where someone should use them. reply afro88 15 hours agoparentprevHow does this enable cosine similarity usage?

You don't. The reason vector stores are important for production use-cases are mostly latency-related for larger sets of data (100k+ records), but if you're working on a toy project just learning how to use embeddings, you can compute cosine distance with a couple lines of numpy by doing a dot product of a normalized query vectors with a matrix of normalized records. Best of all, it gives you a reason to use Python's @ operator, which with numpy matrices does a dot product. reply hereonout2 14 hours agoparent100k records is still pretty small! It feels a bit like the hype that happended with \"big data\". People ended up creating spark clusters to query a few million records. Or using Hadoop for a dataset you could process with awk.

But that day has not yet arrived. reply jerrygenser 11 hours agorootparentNumpy might not be able to handle a full o(n^2) comparison of vectors but you can use a lib with hsnw and it can have great performance on medium (and large) datasets. reply hot_gril 8 hours agorootparentIf I remember correctly, the simplest thing Numpy choked on was large sparse matrix multiplication. There are also other things like text search that Numpy won't help with and you don't want to do in Python if it's a large set. reply cornel_io 11 hours agorootparentprevRight on: I've used a single Postgres database on AWS to handle 1M+ concurrent users. If you're Google, sure, not gonna cut it, but for most people these things scale vertically a lot further than you'd expect (especially if, like me, you grew up in the pre-SSD days and couldn't get hundreds of gigs of RAM on a cloud instance). Even when you do pass that point, you can often shard to achieve horizontal scalability to at least some degree, since the real heavy lifting is usually easy to break out on a per-user basis. Some apps won't permit that (if you've got cross-user joins then it's going to be a bit of a headache), but at that point you've at least earned the right to start building up a more complex stack and complicating your queries to let things grow horizontally. Horizontal scaling is a huge headache, any way you cut it, and TBH going with something like Spanner is just as much of a headache because you have to understand its limitations extremely well if you want it to scale. It doesn't just magically make all your SQL infinitely scalable, things that are hard to shard are typically also hard to make fast on Spanner. What it's really good at is taking an app with huge traffic where a) all the hot queries would be easy to shard, but b) you don't want the complexity of adding sharding logic (+re-sharding, migration, failure handling, etc), and c) the tough to shard queries are low frequency enough that you don't really care if they're slow (I guess also d) you don't care that it's hella expensive compared to a normal Postgres or MySQL box). You still need to understand a lot more than when using a normal DB, but it can add a lot of value in those cases. reply hot_gril 9 hours agorootparentI can't even say whether or not Google benefits from Spanner, vs multiple Postgres DBs with application-level sharding. Reworking your systems to work with a horizontally-scaling DB is eerily similar to doing application-level sharding, and just because something is huge doesn't mean it's better with DB-level sharding. The unique nice thing in Spanner is TrueTime, which enables the closest semblance of a multi-master DB by making an atomic clock the ground truth (see Generals' Problem). So you essentially don't have to worry about a regional failure causing unavailability (or inconsistency if you choose it) for one DB, since those clocks are a lot more reliable than machines. But there are probably downsides. reply smahs 14 hours agorootparentprevThis sentiment is pretty common I guess.

Models make a surprising amount of difference to the quality of the results. Try the MTEB Leaderboard for ideas on which models to explore. 2. In the Information Retriever part you can try a couple of approaches: a.after you retrieve from PGVector see if you can use a reranker like Cohere to get better results https://cohere.com/blog/rerank b.You could try a \"fusion ranking\" similar to the one you do but structured such that 50% of the weight is for a plain old keyword search in the metadata and 50% is for the embedding based search Finally something more interesting to noodle on - what if the embeddings were based on the icon images and the model knew how to search for a textual descriptions in the latent space? reply voxelc4L 6 hours agoprevIt begs the question though, doesn't it...? Embeddings require a neural network or some reasonable facsimile to produce the embedding in the first place. Compression to a vector (a semantic space of some sort) still needs to happen – and that's the crux of the understanding/meaning. To just say \"embeddings are cool let's use them\" is ignoring the core problem of semantics/meaning/information-in-context etc. Knowing where an embedding came from is pretty damn important. Embeddings live a very biased existence. They are the product of a network (or some algorithm) that was trained (or built) with specific data (and/or code) and assume particular biases intrinsically (network structure/algorithm) or extrinsically (e.g., data used to train a network) which they impose on the translation of data into some n-dimensional space. Any engineered solution always lives with such limitations, but with the advent of more and more sophisticated methods for the generation of them, I feel like it's becoming more about the result than the process.

For simple things we might not need to worry about storing much, we can generate the embeddings and just cache them or send them straight to retrieval as an array or something... The storing of embeddings seems the hard part, do I need a special database or PG extension? Is there any reason I can't store them as a blobs in SQlite if I don't have THAT much data, and I don't care too much about speed? Do embeddings generated ever 'expire'? reply bryantwolf 12 hours agoparentYou'd have to update the embedding every time the data used to generate it changes. For example, if you had an embedding for user profiles and they updated their bio, you would want to make a new embedding. I don't expect to have to change the embeddings for each icon all that often, so storing them seemed like a good choice. However, you probably don't need to cache the embedding for each search query since there will be long-tail ones that don't change that much. The reason to use pgvector over blobs is if you want to use the distance functions in your queries. reply kmeisthax 13 hours agoparentprevYes, you can shove the embeddings in a BLOB, but then you can't do the kinds of query operations you expect to be able to do with embeddings. reply simonw 10 hours agorootparentYou can run similarity scores with a custom SQLite function. I use a Python one usually, but it's also possible to build a much faster one in C: https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/23/building-c-extensions-... reply crowcroft 13 hours agorootparentprevRight like you could use it sort of like cache and send the blobs to OpenAI to use their similarity API, but you couldn't really use SQL to do cosine similarity operations? My understanding of what's going on at a technical level might be a bit limited. reply kmeisthax 12 hours agorootparentYes. Although if you really wanted to, and normalized your data like a good little Edgar F. Codd devotee, you could write something like this: SELECT SUM(v.dot) / (SQRT(SUM(v.v1)) * SQRT(SUM(v.v2))) FROM (SELECT v1.dimension as dim, v1.value as v1, v2.value as v2, v1.value * v2.value as dot FROM vectors as v1 INNER JOIN vectors as v2 ON v1.dimension = v2.dimension WHERE v1.vector_id = \"?\" AND v2.vector_id = \"?\") as v; This assumes one table called \"vectors\" with columns vector_id, dimension, and value; vector_id and dimension being primary. The inner query grabs two vectors as separate columns with some self-join trickery, computes the product of each component, and then the outer query computes aggregate functions on the inner query to do the actual cosine similarity. No I have not tested this on an actual database engine, I probably screwed up the SQL somehow. And obviously it's easier to just have a database (or Postgres extension) that recognizes vector data as a distinct data type and gives you a dedicated cosine-similarity function. reply crowcroft 11 hours agorootparentThanks for the explanation! Appreciate that you took the time to give an example. Makes a lot more sense why we reach for specific tools for this. reply laborcontract 14 hours agoparentprevA KV store is both good enough and highly performant. I use Redis for storing embeddings and expire them after a while. Unless you have a highly specialized use case it’s not economical to persistently store chunk embedding. Redis also does have vector search capability as well. However, the most popular answer you’ll get here is to use Postgres (pgvectpr). reply crowcroft 14 hours agorootparentRedis sounds like a good option. I like that it’s not more infrastructure, I already have redis setup for my app so I’m not adding more to the stack. reply H1Supreme 14 hours agoparentprevVector databases are used to store embeddings. reply crowcroft 14 hours agorootparentBut why is that? I’m sure it’s the ‘best’ way to do things, but it also means more infrastructure which for simple apps isn’t worth the hassle. I should use redis for queues but often I’ll just use a table in a SQLite database. For small scale projects I find it works fine, I’m wondering what an equivalent simple option for embeddings would be. reply alexgarcia-xyz 13 hours agoparentprevRe storing vectors in BLOB columns: ya, if it's not a lot of data and it's fast enough for you, then there's no problem doing it like that. I'd even just store then in JSON/npy files first and see how long you can get away with it. Once that gets too slow, then try SQLite/redis/valkey, and when that gets too slow, look into pgvector or other vector database solutions. For SQLite specifically, very large BLOB columns might effect query performance, especially for large embeddings. For example, a 1536-dimension vector from OpenAI would take 1536 * 4 = 6144 bytes of space, if stored in a compact BLOB format. That's larger than SQLite default page size of 4096, so that extra data will overflow into overflow pages. Which again, isn't too big of a deal, but if the original table had small values before, then table scans can be slower. One solution is to move it to a separate table, ex on an original `users` table, you can make a new `CREATE TABLE users_embeddings(user_id, embedding)` table and just LEFT JOIN that when you need it. Or you can use new techniques like Matryoshka embeddings[0] or scalar/binary quantization[1] to reduce the size of individual vectors, at the cost of lower accuracy. Or you can bump the page size of your SQLite database with `PRAGMA page_size=8192`. I also have a SQLite extension for vector search[2], but there's a number of usability/ergonomic issues with it. I'm making a new one that I hope to release soon, which will hopefully be a great middle ground between \"store vectors in a .npy files\" and \"use pgvector\". Re \"do embeddings ever expire\": nope! As long as you have access to the same model, the same text input should give the same embedding output. It's not like LLMs that have temperatures/meta prompts/a million other dials that make outputs non-deterministic, most embedding models should be deterministic and should work forever.

    "originBody": "CFPB Takes Action Against Coding Boot Camp BloomTech and CEO Austen Allred for Deceiving Students and Hiding Loan Costs For-profit school made false claims about job-placement rates APR 17, 2024 Share & print WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued an order against BloomTech and its CEO, Austen Allred, for deceiving students about the cost of loans and making false claims about graduates’ hiring rates. The CFPB found that BloomTech and Allred falsely told students the school’s “income share” agreement contracts were not loans, when in fact the agreements were loans carrying an average finance charge of around $4,000. BloomTech and Allred lured prospective enrollees with inflated promises of job-placement rates as high as 86 percent, when the company’s internal metrics showed placement rates closer to 50 percent and in some cases as low as 30 percent. The order permanently bans BloomTech from all consumer-lending activities and bans Allred from any student-lending activities for ten years. The CFPB is also ordering BloomTech and Allred to cease collecting payments on income share loans for graduates who did not have a qualifying job, eliminate finance changes for certain agreements, and allow students the option to withdraw without penalty. BloomTech and Allred must also pay over $164,000 in civil penalties, which will be deposited in the CFPB’s victims relief fund. “BloomTech and its CEO sought to drive students toward income share loans that were marketed as risk-free, but in fact carried significant finance charges and many of the same risks as other credit products,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Today’s action underscores our increased focus on investigating individual executives and, when appropriate, charging them with breaking the law.” BloomTech is a for-profit vocational school that is headquartered in San Francisco and owned primarily by Allred and various Silicon Valley venture-capital funds. Allred founded the company as the Lambda School in 2017, and rebranded it as BloomTech or the Bloom Institute of Technology in 2022. BloomTech operates short-term, typically six-to-nine-month training programs in areas such as web development, data science, and backend engineering. Since 2017, BloomTech originated at least 11,000 income share loans, with most of BloomTech students funding their tuition with these loans. Under almost all these loans, students who earn more than $50,000 in a related field are required to pay BloomTech 17 percent of their pre-tax income each month until they make 24 payments or hit a “cap” of $30,000 in total payments. The CFPB found that BloomTech students were lured with false promises and deceptive marketing. BloomTech and Allred: Hid the cost and true nature of students’ debt: BloomTech falsely claimed its “income share” agreements were not loans, did not create debt, did not carry a finance charge, and were “risk free.” In fact, the agreements are loans with an average finance charge of $4,000. The loans carry substantial risk, as a single missed payment triggers a default and the remainder of the $30,000 “cap” becomes due immediately. BloomTech further hid the cost and nature of the “income share” loans by not disclosing key terms like the finance charge and annual percentage rate, as required by law. Tricked prospective students with inflated job-placement rates: BloomTech advertised on its website that 71 to 86 percent of students were placed in jobs within six months of graduation, when its non-public reporting to investors consistently showed placement rates closer to 50 percent. Allred tweeted that the school achieved a 100 percent job-placement rate in one of its cohorts, and later acknowledged in a private message that the sample size was just one student. Misrepresented their financial interests by selling loans to investors: BloomTech’s marketing represented that its own interests were aligned with students, through claims such as “We don’t get paid until you do,” and “Because we invest in you, instead of the other way around, we only make money when you do.” In fact, the company was selling many “income share” loans to investors and thus often got paid long before a student finished the program and started earning a salary. Engaged in illegal contract practices: BloomTech violated a federal consumer protection known as the Holder Rule, by failing to include a required provision making any owner of the loan subject to the legal claims and defenses that students could assert against BloomTech. Students were therefore deprived of rights they should have had when their “income share” loan was sold to an investor. Enforcement Action Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial laws, including engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB found that BloomTech and Allred used deceptive statements and took unreasonable advantage of consumers’ reasonable reliance on BloomTech to act in their interests. Under the CFPB’s order, BloomTech and Allred must: Cease collecting payments on certain graduates: BloomTech must not collect any additional payments on “income share” loans for graduates who did not have a qualifying job in the past year. Amends “income share” loan contracts: The order reforms “income share” loan terms to eliminate the finance charge for consumers who graduated the program more than 18 months ago and obtained a qualifying job making $70,000 or less. Allow students to withdraw without penalty: Current students will have the option to withdraw from the program and cancel their “income share” loans or continue in the program with a third-party loan. Pay over $164,000 in penalties: BloomTech will pay over $64,000 and Allred will pay $100,000 in penalties to the CFPB’s victims relief fund. Read today’s order. Consumers can also submit complaints about financial products or services by visiting the CFPB’s website or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). Employees of companies who they believe their company has violated federal consumer financial laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov.

I think I was in the third or fourth cohort. At the time, the sell was that you didn't have to pay anything unless you got a job using the skills you learned from them. I was pretty naïve, I guess. Things seemed fine in the beginning. The instructors were good, and I liked that there were actual live classes. Things degraded very quickly. They kept changing the format and the curriculum (\"iterating\"). They doubled the length of the program that I was in, which made it impossible for me to even finish it. I was working in a tech support job where we had to do shift bids and no shift was guaranteed. I enrolled in a plan that fit the shift I was working, and the expected end date, and when they changed the program length and format, I couldn't complete it. They promised career guidance, including having a career councilor, but I never got one. They kept telling my cohort we would get our councilors after this or that milestone, but when we got there they would move the goalpost again. The closest we got was a resume course that was not relevant to tech at all and a resume review by another student. When I had to drop out of the program, I tried to get them to cancel the ISA or reduce it, but they said I had completed \"most\" of the curriculum and thus was on the hook for all of the ISA. They then started billing me for it because I was working in tech, in the job I had for 6 years before I ever even started their program. I went to a lawyer and was told it wasn't worth suing, because they required arbitration in NYC, which would cost more than I would save. reply abnercoimbre 8 hours agoparentPlease contact the CFPB, it is worth your trouble.

I disagree. You can't expect 100% of students to have a good time, and it's not obvious what an \"ethical\" success bar should be. > \"It's better than a typical USA student loan\" is a very low bar. And yet, that IS the bar.... I'm grateful that someone is attempting to take a crack at this problem, because a huge number of US colleges are bureaucratic scams. You pay exorbitant tuition whether you get a job in your field or not, and you can't even bankrupt out of it, much less have it disappear in a year if you fail to get a job.

Doing fraud and saying 'but the majority of the people we defrauded still had an overall positive experience' is not a defense. Jail time for consumer credit fraud is a perfectly normal outcome.

I fail to understand how you can mess up basic things like having a predecided curriculum, good teachers, a fixed schedule, or providing quality outside class support. We do all of this on a shoestring budget. The stories I have heard about Lambda/BloomTech seem to show almost a willful attempt to not get the basics right. I understand the financial component might have been difficult, but the education is straightforward. To fail it with millions of dollars of funding is outstanding. reply japhyr 7 hours agorootparentI think if your focus is on actually educating people, and you're willing to invest your resources in those people, you can do quite well. If your focus is on scaling and creating an appealing image to investors, the education part isn't so easy. There's probably something to who you're attracting as well. If your pitch is \"come work hard with us and we'll help you learn\", you draw people who are ready to learn. If your pitch is \"come take out a [loan we won't call a loan] with us and we'll make you a bunch of money\", you draw a different set of people. That's not even saying anything against the students of Lambda school. I believe one issue has been people joining to improve their economic outlook, while working a different job to continue paying bills. You have to be pretty thoughtful about how you work with people who have a tight schedule. You can't just throw your curriculum and your expectations up in the air any time you want, and expect all those people to \"pivot\" with you. But the focus always seemed to be more on the \"success\" of Lambda school than on the actual success of every student. From all the stories that come out of Lambda school, it really feels like the classic predatory view of students.

Finally, the success of the actual smart people in Tech (Google, Apple, Amazon, FB) who are largely pre-iPhone companies, meant that there was a lot of venture money flowing around, when the VCs discovered the Uber model.

The closest we have to a death penalty is license revocation, e.g. Arthur Anderson [1]. Victims got screwed. Taking it further and the death penalty analogy seems appropriate--death penalties aren't about restitution. They’re an instrument of retribution. > Bankruptcy doesn't prevent people from starting another company, or board members who failed at oversight to join another board Neither does a corporate death penalty. That’s what bans are for. Corporate death penalty is a gift to corporate America. It sets activists running in circles over a stupid idea that represents simpler, precedents punishments with the ambiguous baggage of extra steps.

Allred would be unpunished. Everything would go back to shareholders who were presumably fine with the status quo, and would be fine putting them into a new entity that Allred could manage. This is wrong for a variety of reasons: (1) The corporate death penalty is proposed as an additional remedy, not an alternative remedy, to personal liability for officers, etc. (in fact, many corporate death penalty proposals would make additional personal penalties for corporate officers available as a part of that on top of any that would be available independently of the corporate death penalty for their actions, e.g., in one proposal for a federal charter revocation law, “The statute should specify that, for a period of five to ten years, the directors of the condemned corporation could serve on the same corporate board together only when they are a minority, ensuring that that set of directors would not form a majority of the board of another corporation. Similarly, key senior officers should be prohibited from working together for five to ten years. In addition, no director or officer could serve on the board or work for any corporation affiliated with the parent corporation of the convicted corporation. Courts must be empowered to issue injunctions to enforce these rules, preventing reconstitution of substantially the same corporation under another name.” [0]) (2) Corporate death penalty proposals tend to include proposals for how dissolved corporations are to be wound down that address the concerns you address (like a bankruptcy, these would be generally be administered by courts, probably most normally the court issuing the penalty.) From the same proposal, “The dissolution of the corporation should impose the harshest penalty on the corporate entity itself, directors, and officers, while only damaging shareholders-who have less control over corporate misconduct-to the extent necessary to incentivize them to take an interest in the corporation’s criminal misconduct. […] the penalty should dissolve the corporation with as little impact on innocent parties–employees, consumers, suppliers, and the larger economy-as possible.” [1] The proposal goes on to propose that an corporation subject to the corporate death penalty should have a court appointed “czar” take over management of its assets (similar, in a way, to a bankruptcy trustee), operating them and preparing and organizing them for sale (by default, by auction, but by other means where appropriate), with a specified distribution of the proceeds: “The statute should specify that revenues from the sale of the corporation’s assets first pay court costs and the costs of the czar’s operation during dissolution. Next, nonmanagement employees of the corporation that have clearly suffered harm due to the dissolution, such as being rendered unemployed, should be compensated through a one-time stipend. Finally, the balance should be distributed among the shareholders. In this way, the affairs of the corporation could be wrapped up in an orderly and just way that would protect innocent parties while only causing minimal harm to shareholders.” [2] (3) As with personal sanctions, the corporate death penalty is proposed in addition to, not in replacement for, criminal fines and restitution, and civil damages that may be available. The key difference between corporate death penalty and bankruptcy is that the corporate death penalty can punish directors and officers, and it de-institutionalizes the firm in much the same way as bankruptcy, but it does so even if the amount of the monetary penalties would not render the corporation insolvent.

They often get many strongly worded letters and many chances to correct their bad behavior before regulatory action happens, and then when it does happen, it's slow and the corporation usually continues to operate, and then when penalty comes, it's some ridiculously small fraction of the gains that came from the bad behavior, which the corporation usually appeals and gets reduced or thrown out. There are almost never company-killing fines. There are almost never consent decrees with stipulations that change the company's behavior. There are almost never instances of piercing the corporate veil and going after executives or shareholders. It's a total joke. reply wslack 5 hours agorootparentThere's an incentive problem here because litigation is so expensive. If the fine is large enough, it becomes more and more worth it for the company to fight it in court - and therefore more expensive to the regulatory agency's legal budget. The only folks who benefit from it going to court are private lawyers. Whereas, settling meets the company's incentives (eliminating uncertainty), meets the regulator's incentives (bad behavior is stopped locally). The moral hazard created by making fraud seem less risky (because the punishments aren't that bad) is born by the public. The solution here would be to limit the possible legal shenanigans that companies can use to increase the cost of taking a case to trial. reply dragonwriter 7 hours agoparentprev> Am I crazy, or do fines never come close to matching damages? Fines aren’t intended to replace damages. If they are criminal fines, criminal restitution is also available through the same process. Even where criminal restitution isn’t available or, for whatever reason, pursued, or where the fines are civil, civil damages for those harmed are not precluded by the fines, they are on top of the fines. Fines are punishment, not compensation. reply openasocket 11 hours agoparentprevThose articles you are reading are just poorly worded. For any criminal case, it is a matter of fines AND jail time.

Colleges have worked in the past because the outcomes were more or less guaranteed (i.e. if you got good grades and graduated, you would very likely land a job), but even that is no longer valid (outside of regulated domains like medicine, law, etc.). I predict we will see many, many more pay-to-learn companies, institutions fall in the coming years. (\"fall\" could also mean become irrelevant, and catering only to those that don't understand how the world has changed and still incorrectly think that such programs will prepare them well). BloomTech, in order to survive, had no choice but to try and play the games they did, and mislead. It's a byproduct of not having a business that is viable. reply paulddraper 5 hours agoparent [–] That, plus there is an extremely strong negative select for coding bootcamps. Your local community college could have the best program ever, but they won't beat Ivy League grads, purely because of the inputs. reply ji_zai 3 hours agorootparent [–] Absolutely. Higher quality inputs actually reduces the forcing function for the education to be high quality - since you'll get good outcomes anyway. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Update: mixtral:8x22b now points to the instruct model: ollama pull mixtral:8x22b ollama run mixtral:8x22b reply Zuiii 6 hours agorootparentWait. Isn't it a breaking change to change the underlying model like this? Wouldn't people start running into consistency issues in production? (given ollama appears to be oriented towards backend use) reply orra 1 hour agorootparentSure, in theory. But if you move so fast that you already are running the base 8x22B model from last week, you can easily fix this. I've long thought that if you want reproducibility and reliability, you need to pin your deps. So, IMO, the change is very much worth it to reduce confusion going forward. reply orost 18 hours agoparentprevThat's not the model this post is about. You used the base model, not trained for tasks. (The instruct model is probably not on ollama yet.) reply mysteria 17 hours agorootparentYeah this is exactly what happens when you ask a base model a question. It'll just attempt to continue what you already wrote based off its training set, so if you say have it continue a story you've written it may wrap up the story and then ask you to subscribe for part 2, followed by a bunch of social media comments with reviews. reply byteknight 18 hours agorootparentprevI absolutely did not: ollama run mixtral:8x22b EDIT: I like how you ninja-editted your comment ;) reply orost 18 hours agorootparentConsidering \"mixtral:8x22b\" on ollama was last updated yesterday, and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 (the topic of this post) was released about 2 hours ago, they are not the same model. reply byteknight 18 hours agorootparentAre we looking at the same page? https://imgur.com/a/y6XfpBl And even the direct tag page: https://ollama.com/library/mixtral:8x22b shows 40-something minutes ago: https://imgur.com/a/WNhv70B reply orost 18 hours agorootparentLet me clarify. Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1 was released a couple days ago. The \"mixtral:8x22b\" tag on ollama currently refers to it, so it's what you got when you did \"ollama run mixtral:8x22b\". It's a base model only capable of text completion, not any other tasks, which is why you got a terrible result when you gave it instructions. Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 is an instruction-following model based on Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1. It was released two hours ago and it's what this post is about. (The last updated 44 minutes ago refers to the entire \"mixtral\" collection.) reply gliptic 18 hours agorootparentprevAnd where does it say that's the instruct model? reply belter 18 hours agorootparentprevI get: ollama run mixtral:8x22b Error: exception create_tensor: tensor 'blk.0.ffn_gate.0.weight' not found reply Me1000 17 hours agorootparentYou need to update ollama to 0.1.32. reply belter 17 hours agorootparentThanks. That did it. reply renewiltord 17 hours agoparentprevNot instruct tuned. You're (actually) \"holding it wrong\". reply woadwarrior01 18 hours agoparentprevLooks like an issue with the quantization that ollama (i.e llama.cpp) uses and not the model itself. It's common knowledge from Mixtral 8x7B that quantizing the MoE gates is pernicious to model perplexity. And yet they continue to do it. :) reply cjbprime 17 hours agorootparentNo, it's unrelated to quantization, they just weren't using the instruct model. reply jjice 18 hours agoprevDoes anyone have a good layman's explanation of the \"Mixture-of-Experts\" concept? I think I understand the idea of having \"sub-experts\", but how do you decide what each specialization is during training? Or is that not how it works at all? reply huevosabio 18 hours agoparentIgnore the \"experts\" part, it misleads a lot of people [0]. There is no explicit specialization in the most popular setups, it is achieved implicitly through training. In short: MoEs add multiple MLP sublayers and a routing mechanism after each attention sublayer and let the training procedure learn the MLP parameters and the routing parameters. In a longer, but still rough, form... How these transformers work is roughly: ``` x_{l+1} = mlp_l(attention_l(x_l)) ``` where `x_l` is the hidden representation at layer l, `attention_l` is the attention sublayer at layer l, and `mlp_l` is the multilayer perceptron at sublayer l. This MLP layer is very expensive because it is fully connected (i.e. every input has a weight to every output). So! MoEs instead of creating an even bigger, more expensive MLP to get more capability, they create K MLP sublayers (the \"experts\") and a router that decides which MLP sublayers to use. This router spits out an importance score for each MLP \"expert\" and then you choose the top T MLPs and do an average weighed on importance, so roughly: ``` x_{l+1} = \\sum_e mlp_{l,e}(attention_l(x_l)) * importance_score_{l, e} ``` where the `importance_score_{l, e}` is the score computed by the router at layer l for \"expert\" e. That is, `importance_score_{l} = attention_l(x_l)`. Note that here we are adding all experts, but in reality we choose the top T, often 2, and use that. [0] some architectures do, in fact, combine domain experts to make a greater whole, but not the currently popular flavor reply Quarrel 16 hours agorootparentSo it is somewhat like a classic random forest or maybe bagging, where you're trying to stop overfitting, but you're also trying to train that top layer to know who could be the \"experts\" given the current inputs so that you're minimising the number of multiple MLP sublayers called during inference? reply huevosabio 14 hours agorootparentYea, it's very much bagging + top layer (router) for the importance score! reply DougBTX 14 hours agorootparentprevWould this be a reasonable explanation? > MLPs are universal function approximators, but these models are big enough that it is better to train many small functions rather than a single unified function. MoE is a mechanism to force different parts of the model to learn distinct functions. reply samus 14 hours agorootparentIt misses the crucial detail that every transformer layer chooses the experts independently from the others. Of course they still indirectly influence each other since each layer processes the output of the previous one. reply hlfshell 18 hours agoparentprevThis is a bit of a misnomer. Each expert is a sub network that specializes in sub understanding we can't possibly track. During training a routing network is punished if it does not evenly distribute training tokens to the correct experts. This prevents any one or two networks from becoming the primary networks. The result of this is that each token has essentially even probability of being routed to one of the sub models, with the underlying logic of why that model is an expert for that token being beyond our understanding or description. reply andai 18 hours agorootparentI heard MoE reduces inference costs. Is that true? Don't all the sub networks need to be kept in RAM the whole time? Or is the idea that it only needs to run compute on a small part of the total network, so it runs faster? (So you complete more requests per minute on same hardware.) Edit: Apparently each part of the network is on a separate device. Fascinating! That would also explain why the routing network is trained to choose equally between experts. I imagine that may reduce quality somewhat though? By forcing it to distribute problems equally across all of them, whereas in reality you'd expect task type to conform to the pareto distribution. reply MPSimmons 16 hours agorootparent>I heard MoE reduces inference costs Computational costs, yes. You still take the same amount of time for processing the prompt, but each token created through inference costs less computationally than if you were running it through _all_ layers. reply samus 16 hours agorootparentprevIt should increase quality since those layers can specialize on subsets of the training data. This means that getting better in one domain won't make the model worse in all the others anymore. We can't really tell what the router does. There have been experiments where the router in the early blocks was compromised, and quality only suffered moderately. In later layers, as the embeddings pick up more semantic information, it matters more and might approach our naive understanding of the term \"expert\". reply Filligree 18 hours agorootparentprevThe latter. Yes, it all needs to stay in memory. reply fire_lake 18 hours agorootparentprevWhy do we expect this to perform better? Couldn’t a regular network converge on this structure anyways? reply og_kalu 18 hours agorootparentIt doesn't perform better and until recently, MoE models actually underperformed their dense counterparts. The real gain is sparsity. You have this huge x parameter model that is performing like an x parameter model but you don't have to use all those parameters at once every time so you save a lot on compute, both in training and inference. reply imjonse 18 hours agorootparentprevIt is a type of ensemble model. A regular network could do it, but a MoE will select a subset to do the task faster than the whole model would. reply rgbrgb 18 hours agorootparentprevHere's my naive intuition: in general bigger models can store more knowledge but take longer to do inference. MoE provides a way to blend the advantages of having a bigger model (more storage) with the advantages of having smaller models at inference time (faster, less memory required). When you do inference, tokens hit a small layer that is load balancing the experts then activate 1 or 2 experts. So you're storing roughly 8 x 22B \"worth\" of knowledge without having to run a model that big. Maybe a real expert can confirm if this is correct :) reply nialv7 17 hours agorootparentSounds like the \"you only use 10% of your brain\" myth, but actually real this time. reply samus 16 hours agorootparentprevAlmost :) the model chooses experts in every block. For a typical 7B with 8 experts there will be 8^32=2^96 paths through the whole model. reply cjbprime 17 hours agorootparentprevNot quite, you don't save memory, only compute. reply andai 18 hours agorootparentprevHas anyone tried MoE at smaller scales? e.g. a 7B model that's made of a bunch of smaller ones? I guess that would be 8x1B. Or would that make each expert too small to be useful? TinyLlama is 1B and it's almost useful! I guess 8x1B would be Mixture of TinyLLaMAs... reply jasonjmcghee 18 hours agorootparentYes there are many fine tunes on huggingface. Search \"8x1B huggingface\" reply auspiv 18 hours agorootparentprevThe previous mixtral is 8x7B reply samus 14 hours agorootparentprevThere is Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, which was made by upcycling the weights of Qwen1.5-1.8B, splitting it and finetuning it. reply wenc 18 hours agorootparentprevWould it be analogous to say instead of having a single Von Neumann who is a polymath, we’re posing the question to a pool of people who are good at their own thing, and one of them gets picked to answer? reply Filligree 18 hours agorootparentNot really. The “expert” term is a misnomer; it would be better put as “brain region”. Human brains seem to do something similar, inasmuch as blood flow (and hence energy use) per region varies depending on the current problem. reply andai 18 hours agorootparentprevAny idea why everyone seems to be using 8 experts? (Or was GPT-4 using 16?) Did we just try different numbers and found 8 was the optimum? reply wongarsu 18 hours agorootparentProbably because 8 GPUs is a common setup, and with 8 experts you can put each expert on a different GPU reply api 18 hours agorootparentprevA decent loose analogy might be database sharding. Basically you're sharding the neural network by \"something\" that is itself tuned during the learning process. reply londons_explore 18 hours agoparentprevNobody decides. The network itself determines which expert(s) to activate based on the context. It uses a small neural network for the task. It typically won't behave like human experts - you might find one of the networks is an expert in determining where to place capital letters or full stops for example. MoE's do not really improve accuracy - instead they are to reduce the amount of compute required. And, assuming you have a fixed compute budget, that in turn might mean you can make the model bigger to get better accuracy. reply vineyardmike 18 hours agoparentprevIt’s not “experts” in the typical sense of the word. There is no discrete training to learn a particular skill in one expert. It’s more closely modeled as a bunch of smaller models grafted together. These models are actually a collection of weights for different parts of the system. It’s not “one” neural network. Transformers are composed of layers of transformations to the input, and each step can have its own set of weights. There was a recent video on the front page that had a good introduction to this. There is the MLP, there are the attention heads, etc. With that in mind, a MoE model is basically where one of those layers has X different versions of the weights, and then an added layer (another neural network with its own weights) that picks the version of “expert” weights to use. reply woadwarrior01 18 hours agoparentprevNot quite a layman's explanation, but if you're familiar with the implementation(s) of vanilla decoder only transformers, mixture-of-experts is just a small extension. During inference, instead of a single MLP in each transformer layer, MoEs have `n` MLPs and a single layer \"gate\" in each transformer layer. In the forward pass, softmax of the gate's output is used to pick the top `k` (where k isIt's as if your product automatically becomes cheaper, more reliable, and more scalable with each new major model release. and so do your competitor's products. reply samus 12 hours agorootparentAny business idea built almost exclusively on AI, without adding much value, is doomed from the start. AI is not good enough to make humans obsolete yet. But a well finetuned model can for sure augment what individual humans can do. reply milansuk 18 hours agoparentprevThe progress is insane. A few days ago I started being very impressed with LLM coding skills. I wanted Golang code, instead of Python, which you can see in many demos. The prompt was: Write a Golang func, which accepts the path into a .gpx file and outputs a JSON string with points(x=tolal distance in km, y=elevation). Don't use any library. reply sleepingreset 18 hours agoparentprevIf you don't mind, I'm trying to experiment w/ local models more. Just now getting into messing w/ these but I'm struggling to come up w/ good use cases. Would you happen to know of any cool OSS model projects that might be good inspiration for a side project? Wondering what most people use these local models for reply ajcp 10 hours agorootparentI've got a couple I've done and it's been really enjoyable. I think the real value in using local models is exposing them to personal/unique information that only you have, thus getting novel and unique outcomes that no public model could provide. 1. Project 1 - Self Knowledge - Download/extract all of my emails and populate into a vector database, like Chroma[0] - For each prompt do a search of the vector store and return N number of matches - Provide both prompt and search result to LLM, instructing it to use the search result as context or in the answer itself. 2. Project 2 - Chat with a Friend - I exported the chat and text history between me and a good friend that passed away - I created a vector store of our chat history in chunks, each consisting of 6 back-and-forth interactions - When I \"chat\" with the LLM the a search is first conducted for matching chunks from the vector store and then using those as \"style\" and knowledge context for a response. Optional: You can use SillyTavern[1] for a more \"rich\" chat experience The above lets me chat, at least superficially, with my friend. It's nice for simple interactions and banter; I've found it to be a positive and reflective experience. 0. https://www.trychroma.com/ 1. https://sillytavernai.com/ reply sosuke 18 hours agorootparentprevNo ideas about side projects or anything \"productive\" but for a concrete example look at SillyTavern.

No good use cases for profit but plenty right now for exploration and fun. reply wing-_-nuts 17 hours agorootparentprevOne idea that I've been mulling over; Given how controllable linux is from the command line, I think it would be somewhat easy to set up a voice to text to a local LLM that could control pretty much everything on command. It would flat out embarass alexa. Imagine 'Hal play a movie', or 'Hal play some music' and it's all running locally, with your content. reply mikegreenberg 13 hours agorootparentThere are a few projects doing this.

I ask it all sorts of technical questions, learn about common tools, libraries, and idioms in an ecosystem I'm not familiar with, and then I can go to official documentation and dig in. It has been a huge force multiplier for me and most importantly of all, it removes the dread of not knowing where to start and the dread of sending your inner monologue to someone's stupid cloud. If you're curious: https://github.com/noman-land/transcript.fish/ though this doesn't include any Mixtral stuff because I don't use it programmatically (yet).

So the LLM just points me in the right direction. I also miss Google offline, so I'm working on a search engine. I thought I could skip crawling by just downloading common crawl, but unfortnately it's enormous and mostly junk or unsuitable for my needs.

If you compare LLMs by asking them to tell you how to catch dragonflies - the free text chat answer you get will be impossible to objectively evaluate. Whereas if you propose four ways to catch dragonflies and ask each model to choose option A, B, C or D (or check the relative probability the model assigns to those four output logits) the result is easy to objectively evaluate - you just check if it chose the one right answer. Hence a lot of the most famous benchmarks are multiple-choice questions - even though 99.9% of LLM usage doesn't involve answering multiple-choice questions. reply htrp 19 hours agoparentprevgotta cherry pick your benchmarks as much as possible reply squirrel23 19 hours agoparentprevWhat do you mean? reply apetresc 19 hours agorootparentVirtually every announcement of a new model release has some sort of table or graph matching it up against a bunch of other models on various benchmarks, and they're always selected in such a way that the newly-released model dominates along several axes.

Just as we've seen rising fuel efficiency, safety, dependability, etc. over the lifecycle of a particular car model. The different teams are learning from each other and pushing boundaries; there's virtually no reason for any of the teams to release a model or product that is somehow inferior to a prior one (unless it had some secondary attribute such as requiring lower end hardware). We're simply not seeing the ones that came up short; we don't even see the ones where it fell short of current benchmarks because they're not worth releasing to the public. reply andai 18 hours agorootparentSibling comment made a good point about benchmarks not being a great indiactor of real world quality. Every time something scores near GPT-4 on benchmarks, I try it out and it ends up being less reliable than GPT-3 within a few minutes of usage. reply CharlieDigital 18 hours agorootparentThat's totally fine, but benchmarks are like standardized tests like the SAT. They measure something and it totally makes sense that each release bests the prior in the context of these benchmarks. It may even be the case that in measuring against the benchmarks, these product teams sacrifice some real world performance (just as a student that only studies for the SAT might sacrifice some real world skills). reply apetresc 18 hours agorootparentprevThat's a valid theory, a priori, but if you actually follow up you'll find that the vast majority of these benchmark results don't end up matching anyone's subjective experience with the models. The churn at the top is not nearly as fast as the press releases make it out to be. reply tensor 16 hours agorootparentSubjective experience is not a benchmark that you can measure success against.

    "originBody": "How many bathrooms have Neanderthals in the tile? A Reddit poster finds an ancient jaw in his parents' new travertine. It may be more common than most people imagine. 16 APR 2024 — 7 MIN READ Two of the fragments of the skull from Kocabaş, Turkey, both bearing slice marks from the travertine quarry where they were found. Photo: Amélie Vialet and coworkers (Wikimedia Commons) Gretchen shared with me an absolutely fascinating post on Reddit today: “Found a mandible in the travertin floor at my parents house”. The poster is a dentist and visited his parents house to see the new travertine they installed. It's no surprise that he recognized something right away: This travertine would get the notice of any anthropologist. Photo: Reddit user Kidipadeli75 A section cut at a slight angle through a very humanlike jaw! I'm working in South Africa currently and I showed the image to some of our fossil preparation specialists today. Everybody agreed it is pretty cool! The Reddit user who posted the story (Kidipadeli75) has followed up with some updates over the course of the day. The travertine was sourced in Turkey, and a close search of some of the other installed panels revealed some other interesting possible fossils, although none are as strikingly identifiable as the mandible. A number of professionals have reached out to offer assistance and I have no doubt that they will be able to learn a lot about the ancient person whose jaw ended up in this rock. This naturally raises a broader question: How many other people have installed travertine with hominin fossils inside? Travertine is a limestone that forms near natural springs. Spring water that emerges from lime-rich bedrock often carries a high concentration of dissolved calcium carbonate. When the water evaporates or cools—especially near hot springs—this calcium carbonate precipitates as rock and may form very large deposits around the spring. Travertine has an interesting internal texture when polished, and often has color bands and inclusions of calcite crystals, which make it an appealing choice for decorative flooring or wall covering. Travertine also commonly includes fossils. Many are fossil inclusions of algae, plants, and small animals—especially molluscs and crustaceans—that live within the spring water. Much larger animals may be found and humans are no exceptions: Several well-known hominin fossil discoveries are from travertine deposits. Most of these discoveries have happened because of quarrying of the travertine deposits for use in construction. For example, the Steinrinne site is on a terrace of the Wipper River near Bilzingsleben, Germany. The site was quarried from the Middle Ages onward into the twentieth century. Naturalists took notice of the fossils there in the nineteenth century, and straight-tusked elephants, woolly rhinos, and macaques all occur in great numbers, dating to an interglacial period sometime between 470,000 and 280,000 years ago. Many of the archaeological discoveries at the site were made by Dietrich Mania starting in 1969. Excavations since then have identified stone tools and many animal bones with cutmarks from ancient humans who butchered them—even stone handaxes made from elephant bone. Bilzingsleben cranial reconstructions by Vlček. Photo from Landesmuseum fur Vorgeschichte Halle (Saale), Germany Parts of at least two hominin skulls and a mandible were uncovered in the travertine during Mania's excavations. The remains were first studied by Emanuel Vlček, who created reconstructions of the two skulls. They have many similarities with Homo erectus, as Vlček emphasized, including the thick cranial bone, thick and pronounced browridges, and highly angled occipital bone at the back of the skull. Today's scientists, while recognizing these aspects, more often consider the skulls as representatives of an early Neandertal or related population, which sometimes is known as Homo heidelbergensis. Another fossil human was discovered in an even more dramatic way. In 2002, Mehmet Cihat Alcicek was examining fossils recovered from travertine quarries of the Denizli Basin of southwestern Turkey when he identified a cross-section of a hominin cranium. The upper and lower surfaces where the fossil was cut are well preserved, suggesting that more of the skull had likely been present but no more was found. Dating of the travertine by Anne-Marie Lebatard and collaborators in 2014 suggests that the individual lived sometime between 1.6 million and 1.2 million years ago. The quarry that produced the fossil is near the village of Kocabaş, and that is the name by which the fossil has been designated. “Given the nature of its discovery in a factory workshop, the hominin was unfortunately reduced to a standard rough-cut tile thickness of about 35 mm…” —John Kappelman and coworkers The shape of this portion of the Kocabaş skull and its thick supraorbital torus have led most researchers to identify it as a Homo erectus individual. The endocranial surface of the frontal bone has granular impressions that were initially suggested as possible evidence of tuberculosis infection. While this is still possible, later work suggested that these impressions may rather reflect a common condition in which the cranial bone remodels due to arachnoid cell growth. The Kocabaş skull points to the most obvious question that Reddit posters shared: Why didn't anybody notice a human jaw in the travertine before it was installed in someone's house? This question isn't so hard to answer. Quarries rough-cut travertine and other decorative stone into large panels, doing basic quality checks for gaps and large defects on the rough stone before polishing. Small defects and inclusions are the reason why people want travertine in the first place, so they don't merit special attention. Consumers who buy travertine usually browse samples in a showroom to choose the type of rock, and they don't see the actual panels or tile until installation. Tile or panels that are polished by machine and stacked in a workshop or factory for shipping are handled pretty quickly. What this means is that there may be lots more hominin bones in people's floors and showers. Most will be hard to recognize. Random cross-sections of hominin bones are tough to make out from other kinds of fossils without a lot of training. Noticing a fossil is not so hard, but I have to say that I've often been surprised at what the rest of a fossil looks like after skilled preparators painstakingly extract it from the surrounding rock. The ways that either nature or a masonry saw may slice a fossil don't correspond to an anatomy book, and a cross-section through part of a bone doesn't usually resemble an X-ray image of a whole bone. Believe me, anthropologists don't want to hear about every blob of bone in your tile. Bones from other kinds of animals massively outnumber hominin bones in large travertine deposits. Most tile and panels are cut thin enough that if a fossil not clearly identifiable from its exposed surface, the thin portion beneath the surface is not likely to identify it either. Nobody wants to drill into your shower wall on a wild goose chase. But certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible from the Reddit post, and more pieces of the Kocabaş individual are probably installed in hotel bathrooms all across Europe. If you take another look at your shower wall and suspect an ancient human is looking back at you, it might actually be one. The broader point is that a lot of the archaeological and fossil record has emerged as a result of industrial processes and construction. Paleontologists are in an uneasy symbiosis with quarries. The work of the rockcutters exposes underground sections that scientists would never know for centuries, yet at the same time it destroys evidence that might be recovered with enough paleontological labor. It helps for workers to have some training to notice potentially interesting finds as they encounter them, and for paleontologists and archaeologists to be engaged with the industries and construction projects that often encounter ancient remains. And if you do happen find a jawbone in your bathroom, my suggestion is first to contact the local authorities. Sure, a fossil in travertine likely comes from hundreds of thousands of years ago. It isn't a crime scene. But depending on your state or nation of residence, laws governing discovery of human remains on your property may be complicated and having the paperwork in order with the police, sheriff, or coroner is the first step for most investigations. For myself, I'll be following the Reddit story with interest—I expect there will be many twists and turns in the story of this jawbone. With some teeth preserved and abundant surrounding rock, I expect that specialists will be able to learn a great deal about the life of this individual and when he or she lived. Assuming, that is, the parents wouldn't rather keep it where it is installed now. Notes: I've included some references for the Kocabaş and Bilzingsleben discoveries below. There is much more to say about both of them. Investigation of Middle Pleistocene and earlier travertine deposits is one of the most promising avenues to understand ancient environments in which human ancestors and relatives lived.

The site itself is just a quarry, but they have built a museum right above the place where they found fossils of thousands of creatures. You can then stand over a control table like in the spaceship Enterprise and trigger 3D animations of those animals and humans in their natural environment on a large screen on the wall on other side over an excavation ditch. But the best thing was getting to know to the curator of the site. He himself took part in the excavation, published scientific articles about it and seems to know everything about the site, its excavation history and palaeological topics related to it. I was able to talk with him for more than an hour. The excavation site is located about 20km north of Erfurt (Thuringia, Germany). In the summer it is open Weddensday to Sunday and on holidays from 10:00 to 17:00. For those with a camper-van: it is no problem to stay in their very quite car park for the night for free. Its Web-site can be found at http://www.steinrinne-bilzingsleben.com/ (in German). reply treprinum 14 hours agoparentHow about Grube Messel? Is it similar to Bilzingsleben? reply Archelaos 14 hours agorootparentGrube Messel is still on my agenda. (It is literally like this: I have bookmarked the location in my navigator app.) However, from what I heared, both must be quite different. In contrast to Messel, there are no spectacular finds on display in Bilzingsleben. What is associated with Homo Erectus is on display in the Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte in Halle.[1] The scientific worth of Bilzingsleben is that it is sort of a Homo Erectus version of Pompeji (of a much, much smaller size, though): the place was covered with mud at a certain time during a flood disaster, which hindered decomposition and later errosion. It is now more or less completely excavated. So the site itself is just a big ditch. As I said, the best thing about my visit was the opportunity to talk with a real expert curator. I have hardly ever met a museum guide who knew so much about his subject matter. I hope he is still there.

Fast forward 35 years or so, I live 2 km from the place I was born after travelling the world and I went there with my own child to \"discover\" the steps again, together with the story about fossiles.

Like, if I want to put in new stone counters, in general I'm picking a kind of stone I like, and the firm measures or makes a template of my use, and cuts from a slab, right? If I have a really small job, perhaps it's possible to get a deal from the offcuts of some prior installation. I don't think it's generally an available option to e.g. get measurements and then peruse a list of countertops removed from recent local renovations where the dimensions are strictly larger than mine, and have my counter cut by trimming their 11' linear counter to my 10' space.

If there's an architectural design up front then there's a need to source materials that fit the plan, as you describe. The opposite approach was taken by a friend of mine who was, for a decade, a prolific builder here in Australia .. he continuously had two or three houses on the go in staggered completion (clean builds and|or significant rennovation) that all sold well for their design, uniqueness and craftsmanship. His starting point was salvage yards, looking for cheap big statement pieces; bay windows, big wall cabinets, doors, window sets, impressive looking ketchen sets, big counter tops, etc. The next step would be to design a house plan that fitted around quality salvage and well suited the site for views, access, etc. His arc in life was art school in Victoria followed byinterleaved with a salvage job that dismantled entire (small) towns ahead of dams, flooding, other projects - they prepped wooden houses for moving elsewhere, disassembled structures to \"flats\", reclaimed historic bridges, etc. Then came the building that built up his cash reserves, then a big rural property with sheds, glassblowing studios, metal work, etc. reply 48864w6ui 2 hours agorootparentIt's unclear if William Morris would've approved of this approach to an Arts & Crafts career, but I certainly do. reply defrost 1 hour agorootparentThe running joke in the arts & crafts circles I was tangential to concerned the difference between an artist and a craftsperson; Craft people have to pay their bills ... :-) reply danans 14 hours agorootparentprevSeems like there are lots of companies willing to sell you reclaimed marble slabs: https://www.google.com/search?q=reclaimed+marble+slabs&oq=re...

Is the market for marble good or bad in this case? Is it producing an efficient outcome? Can it be made to do so? What are the non market solutions? You fault something just because it exist but give no alternative. Species like Dodo are expected to go extinct as humans flourish and move other things out of our way. All species eventually go extinct. We only exist because we out competed what came before us, which out competed what came before it. You can mourn the loss of the Dodo not existing in a zoo for you to gawk at but I find that to be on the level of complaining about a TV show being cancelled. If it filled such an essential biological niche that its loss is noticed (it obviously wasn't - hundreds of years went by before anyone noticed it was gone) - if it were noticed, and was such a heavy loss, that's the first niche that will be filled by something else. You can't have Darwinian evolution without this. The Galapagos Giant Tortoise will never go extinct because the market for protecting and investigating and gawking at them is too strong. If that interest ever wanes the animal will no longer occupy a useful niche and will cease to exist, unless it adapts. reply cultofmetatron 15 hours agorootparentprev> or dodo omelettes we should definitely not let it get that far.... reply Joker_vD 16 hours agorootparentprevOr consider iron.

    "originBody": "Press release #ChatControl: EU ministers want to exempt themselves April 15, 2024 Comments 0 According to the latest draft text of the controversial EU Child Sexual Abuse Regulation proposal leaked by the French news organization Contexte, which the EU member states discussed, the EU interior ministers want to exempt professional accounts of staff of intelligence agencies, police and military from the envisaged scanning of chats and messages (Article 1 (2a)). The regulation should also not apply to “confidential information” such as professional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea that the new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention of child sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives (Article 43(8)). “The fact that the EU interior ministers want to exempt police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning proves that they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping algorithms are that they want to unleash on us citizens,” commented Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer. “They seem to fear that even military secrets without any link to child sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The confidentiality of government communications is certainly important, but the same must apply to the protection of business and of course citizens communications, including the spaces that victims of abuse themselves need for secure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of the chats leaked by today’s voluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance to the police, for example family photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous that the EU interior ministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences of the destruction of digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption that they are imposing on us.” “The promise that professional secrets should not be affected by chat control is a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or determine whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers, defence lawyers, etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control inevitably threatens to leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and trial documents sent for defending abuse victims.” “It makes a mockery of the official goal of child protection that the EU interior ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing child sexual abuse. It couldn’t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-style mass surveillance and not better protecting our children. Real child protection would require a systematic scientific evaluation and implementation of multidisciplinary prevention programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards and guidelines for criminal investigations into child abuse, including the identification of victims and the necessary technical means. None of this is planned by the EU interior ministers.” The EU governments want to adopt the chat control bill by the beginning of June.

Enforce equitably, and enforce equally: the same misery everyone else already knows. If ministers worry about their private communications being read by strangers—if that makes them feel fearful, paranoid, violated—then let them feel fearful, paranoid, violated, just like the hundreds of millions of other people they would enforce those feelings on. \"Laws are to govern all alike — those opposed as well as those who favor them. I know no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution.\" –Ulysses S.

A real leader that truly believed in this would volunteer to be first in line to have it implemented on them, and be transparent about their experience (how many times did an alert fire? How did the police handle the response? etc). This is a dog and pony show by people who think they're better than the people they represent, and they must think very lowly of the people they represent indeed if they think no one will notice their shenanigans. Besides that, there have been a number of stories of politicians abusing children or possessing CSAM. If I were going to order the list of whose PC's get checked for CSAM first, politicians would be pretty high up there. Probably right after Hollywood, and right before the uber-rich. reply repelsteeltje 20 hours agorootparentprevSpot on. The silver lining about them clearly trying to exempt themselves is that they at least seem to be aware of the negative consequences of their proposal. So: not the right solution, but at least something that looks like a transition from blissfully ignorant -> aware of problems. Cogs are in motion, learning is happening. reply redeeman 19 hours agorootparentare you crazy? it means they are aware, and WANT that for the population, but not themselves. cogs are NOT in motion to fix this for the people, they are in motion to DO this to the people. reply miohtama 19 hours agorootparentThis makes harder to lie about the fact that this is a mass surveillance bill. reply account42 2 hours agorootparentI don't think this stopped anyone before.

At least on paper, Europeans wield power over themselves. It's good to be wary and have a healthy dose of skepticism, but let's not get nihilistic. I'd rather be naive and trust myself and the democratic system I live in, assume good intentions from anonymous strangers and even politicians. Because what is the alternative? How would you organize society if everyone but personal friends or [..] individuals you have a one on one relationship with deserves distrust? reply redeeman 9 hours agorootparentprevso lets look at this from above.. 1: a law is proposed, to solve some problem (real or otherwise is irellevant). 2: wait shiiiieet, this law kindof sucks, it could really hurt people. 3: I KNOW! lets fix it by making it not hurt us, only those we govern! you do not get to claim incompetence to get you out of what you did in step 3. (and no, not you personally, obviously) reply repelsteeltje 2 hours agorootparentThe incompetence will generally get you stuck in step 1, ignorance: law looks great because designers don't see deficiencies. Step 2 is progress: now you're wittingly incompetent. Step 3 is a misguided solution to 2 but the incompetence is that designers still deeply believe that step 1 was essentially a great plan. Shielding yourself is a naive, human reaction. It isn't intrinsically malicious. This is where they slowly start realizing their good intentions result in a weapon of mass surveillance. I'm hoping for step 4 where they find a way to mitigate 2 for all people. One way would be: retract 1 altogether. reply javajosh 16 hours agorootparentprev>Cogs are in motion, learning is happening.

Reality is that the EU is largely formed by members of local political parties sent to EU-institutions. They just send people there which they deem not useful for local campaigning or prefer to become \"invisible\" to local politics. Citizens should not accept this narrative, and instead demand more transparency on the activities of the local politicians sent to EU, holding the party accountable for their actions (or non-action) within the EU. reply michaelt 20 hours agorootparentEh, partly. But it's also inherent in running an organisation with 24 official languages. Let's say you had really strong opinions on this, and you wanted to rally voters for a letter-writing campaign. Good luck coordinating the Spanish-speakers, the German-speakers and the Polish-speakers and so on. All of whom also have different TV networks, different newspapers, different radio, presumably different social media and so on. And politicians have the same problem - maybe you're an amazing public speaker. Maybe you've got the farming subsidy policy equivalent of the Gettysburg Address. Clear, succinct, witty, persuasive, honest, passionate - everyone who hears it will be fired up to support your vision. But if you can only deliver that speech in Portuguese? Good luck with that. Hell, look at this very discussion: I know first-hand about the complex relationship between the EU with the British parliament, press and electorate. But I have no idea what the equivalent situation is in the Czech Republic. reply rickdeckard 19 hours agorootparentThat's all a symptom of the current state of affairs. If citizens would hold their government accountable for their actions on EU-level, the ruling political parties wouldn't send people to the EU who are ill-equipped to communicate/execute. But it's also an inherent problem of the EU. In retrospect, they shouldn't have left communication with citizens to the EU-members, expecting that they would communicate based on common interest. As it turns out, the local governments are much more comfortable to celebrate themselves for everything positive, and blame everything negative on these \"EU overlords\". The EU charter should have included the means for the Union to communicate directly with citizens, i.e. the basis to have their own local news-channels. I can see improvements in communication nowadays, with EU press-releases and announcement carrying over into local (online) news at least. The fact that none of those messages are already carried by the local government speaks volumes... reply raxxorraxor 2 hours agorootparentYou would need a common official language to do that. And even with that, you cannot really build something democratic if a large part of the population has no idea what you are saying. reply michaelt 17 hours agorootparentprev> That's all a symptom of the current state of affairs. If citizens would hold their government accountable for their actions on EU-level, the ruling political parties wouldn't send people to the EU who are ill-equipped to communicate/execute. What I'm saying is that everyone is ill-equipped to communicate, when communications are conducted in 24 languages. Imagine a Greek newspaper decided to send a team of dedicated EU reporters to Brussels - how are they supposed to talk to the delegates from Sweden and Slovenia and Spain? (and if you're thinking \"they'll just communicate in english\" let me remind you that less than 2% of the EU population lives in a country where english is an official language) > As it turns out, the local governments are much more comfortable to celebrate themselves for everything positive, and blame everything negative on these \"EU overlords\". Truth. But IMO pre-Brexit a big reason the British government had a lot of influence over the British press (and vice-versa) while the EU government didn't was the simple issue of speaking the same language and being in the same city. reply rickdeckard 16 hours agorootparentI get what you're saying but that's a non-issue. At plenary meeting and conferences every country is in the same situation, they communicate via an Armada of interpreters, just like they do at the UN, at the WTO, the WHO, the NATO, and so on. Outside of those they communicate in English and/or French. If a Greek newspaper is sending a journalist who can't speak English or French they sent the wrong person. If a local government sends a politician into the EU who can't communicate in English or French they sent the wrong person. Also, it would already be sufficient for the cause if Greek newspapers would put the spotlight on GREEK politicians in Brussels. So far not even THAT is happening in a sufficient manner... > But IMO pre-Brexit a big reason the British government had a lot of influence over the British press (and vice-versa) while the EU government didn't was the simple issue of speaking the same language and being in the same city. Every single press-Release of the EU is done in English language. Granted, the EU doesn't invite to press-conferences in London to talk to the local press, that's the job of the local government. Pre-Brexit it would have been the job of the British government to promote the spirit of \"We are European\", but as everywhere it is more useful to their narrative to promote \"We are Nationalists!\" reply michaelt 14 hours agorootparent> they communicate via an Armada of interpreters [...] Outside of those they communicate in English and/or French. > If a Greek newspaper is sending a journalist who can't speak English or French they sent the wrong person. Right - so from the perspective of a Greek person, EU lawmakers are speaking a completely different language. Seems like a pretty big communication problem to me. > Also, it would already be sufficient for the cause if Greek newspapers would put the spotlight on GREEK politicians in Brussels. But the Greek politicians in Brussels already agree with the Greek government. If the German faction in Brussels wants to do something that'll be unpopular with Greece, they've got no way to make their case to the Greek people directly. > Pre-Brexit it would have been the job of the British government to promote the spirit of \"We are European\" Did the British government ever agree that was their job? I mean, in the United States I don't see Biden expecting the Texan government to convince Texans of anything. Luckily for Biden, he can speak to Texans himself. Because they share a language. reply rickdeckard 4 hours agorootparent> Right - so from the perspective of a Greek person, EU lawmakers are speaking a completely different language. Seems like a pretty big communication problem to me. It appears you've never checked the publications of the EU. They are published in ALL OFFICIAL LANGUAGES of the member countries, including Greek! [1] > But the Greek politicians in Brussels already agree with the Greek government. Sorry, I'm not following. I am talking about local citizens and media surfacing and challenging the actions/non-actions of the politicians that were sent to the EU, by holding their local government accountable for the performance of their representatives in the EU. > If the German faction in Brussels wants to do something that'll be unpopular with Greece, they've got no way to make their case to the Greek people directly. They shouldn't. They should make their case towards the designated representatives of Greece in the EU. It is their job to facilitate communication with the Greek government, whose job it should be to communicate with its citizens. This chain is intentionally broken, for the local party to either claim positive outcomes only on themselves or blame negative outcomes to some overlords outside of their control.

ISO 31-0 prescribes the use of small spaces, and so do various other American and international standards organizations.

There are EU elections this year FYI. reply Al-Khwarizmi 21 hours agorootparentI'm not anti-EU, on the contrary, but honestly the claim is true in practice. I'm not going to give you any hard data, but I think it's just obvious in plain sight. At least in my country, almost all the debate in news outlets is about national or local issues. EU regulations do come up, but they are always depicted as something that comes \"from above\" and not tied to specific parties or people. If there is controversy about a national law, the media will blame things on the government or on the opposition (depending on their bias). If there is controversy about an European law, the media will blame an abstract \"Brussels\"... or directly the government or the opposition anyway, as they're the ones who implement it. In the EU elections, most (euphemism for all) people I know just vote to the party they prefer in terms of national or regional politics. Almost no one votes because they want a given European directive to be implemented. Sometimes I have actually made some effort to find out what each of my country's parties voted in some EU decision, and most of the times I failed. It's not clear what decisions come from the Commission or from Parliament (many come from the Commission which is not even directly elected but elected by local governments, by the way). And even for those from Parliament, it's not clear how to find detailed results of Parliament votes. Mind you, I'm not saying there is no way - probably there is one, if you are very well informed or have a lot of time, but there is definitely no way that I could find in 20 minutes of Googling, and most people won't make a greater investment than that. Not sure if it's the same in all countries, and not sure how to fix it... but yes, I do have the perception that EU institutions are detached from citizens. That said, this has its pros. If citizens had more of a say, we'd probably have no low-emmission zones, no or almost no pollution regulations, etc. Many environmental policies that are, IMO, unquestionably good, are pushed to reluctant citizens using the \"hey, don't blame me, it comes from Brussels\" wildcard, and we are better for it (again, IMO). Sad, but true. reply AlecSchueler 21 hours agorootparent> I'm not anti-EU, on the contrary, but honestly the claim is true in practice I agree that it's under reported but I don't think it's because the EU is far away or detached from the people.

Except for Britain, European nations simply do not have a strong tradition of news publishing and free debate like the United States.

That's why it was so important that people had to go to church each Sunday: not to listen to the word of God, but to be told the latest decisions of the king directly from the preacher's pulpit. Later on, non-government affiliated media has mainly been partisan affairs, directly or indirectly controlled by political parties.

As a result, these elections define part of the EU and the elections in every country defines the rest. In EU countries keep having strong sovereignty, it’s not like the USA.

If we had pan-European parties with their own pan-European agendas, people would know what they are voting for, and would be much more involved.

If you really wanted to be tactical about it, one should vote for a disjoint set of parties in the EU vs the national elections, as this would be more likely to lead to effective supervision and assessment of decisions. reply SiempreViernes 21 hours agorootparentprevSure, but the commission is proposed by nationally elected representatives (namely the heads of state) and then approved by the elected European Parliament, so the overall process is not too undemocratic. Of course, direct election of the commission would be more democratic formally, but the fact is there's not really a truly European polity in the first place so its not clear the outcome would be much better in regards to the problem of the commission being composed of random politicians you never heard of. reply disgruntledphd2 19 hours agorootparentIf you were gonna elect Commissioners/President etc directly, you'd probably end up with something like the US electoral college system.

Then the Commission sits down with MEPs and national ministers to bang something into shape. It very rarely comes up with original policy suggestions, and when it happens it tends to be big news - like with the daylight savings stuff, which eventually wasn't carried through because the EU Council (i.e. governments) wasn't particularly interested.

Its pretty scary when you start seeing politicians attacking courts, judges etc. Every country that went ahead with steamrolling courts has become a dumpster fire.

He also changed the (otherwise unfair) constitution that prohibited him from going for reelection, although at that point I believe a referendum would have been a much better solution.

As everything in live, just because it says X on the label doesn't mean it has X in it. Same with democracy. To have a functioning democracy, you not only need to have separation of power, you also always have to make sure it is maintained, and a society has to constantly re-educate itself on why that is so important.

You say so, but is it true? If it were obvious, it'd be faster to say the explanation of why it were obvious than to describe as you have. You'd instead be able to say something like 'we have the first amendment, and there aren't any exception-- we don't do anything like that fire in a crowded theater stuff from WWI', and then you'd be done, and you'd have done it in a way that's certain.

The South Korean economy is dominated by a small number of \"chaebols\", which are massive corporate conglomerates that tend to be owned and controlled by an oligarchic family. Samsung, for instance, is owned by the Lee family. These families also tend to have a ton of political influence. The government has, for decades, embraced an explicit policy of developing the chaebols via industrial policy. So, as you can imagine, you end up with a situation where the chaebols and their owners have lots of political power. Not exactly the kind of free market capitalism that someone like Milton Friedman would endorse, but it seems to be effective in its own way. There's a flip side to South Korea's chaebol-centric economy, however. South Korea's national security situation is extremely dangerous, so in fact one of the reasons for the industrial policy has been to maintain a domestic defense industrial base so that they aren't dependent on arms imports from Western countries. Accordingly, most of the South Korean chaebols have a significant presence in the arms industry.

Hydraulic actuators tend to have high force density and high robustness to impacts, as impact loads are distributed over the large surface area of the hydraulic channels, rather than, for example several small gear teeth. Another compelling reason to use hydraulics, especially for high degree-of-freedom machines, is the relative ease of adding high-force degrees of freedom. For an electric motor driven robots, each actuator needs to be sized for its peak performance, which makes building systems with many degrees of freedom needing high peak power and force at all the joints (and especially at distal joints) very challenging. With a hydraulic system, it is easier to build high-force distal links (ankles, wrists, fingers, etc) without adding significant mass and inertia to the limbs.\" [1] https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/118671/105734... reply klowrey 15 hours agorootparentprevStatic holds.

And this is reflected in the choice of robots deployed in warehouses.

The head and torso are receiving a lot of shock forces with each step. That seems like a downgrade from the previous one. It clearly has a much larger range of motion and if it is also stronger as claimed then I can't wait for the acrobatics videos that are surely coming. But I think the most exciting thing is that it has hands from the start. Atlas didn't have hands for most of its existence and so couldn't do much in the way of useful tasks. I think controlling hands is actually much harder than walking or doing backflips. Hopefully Boston Dynamics will be able to make this version useful. reply jvanderbot 16 hours agoparentElectric motors dont have a lot of \"give\", like hydraulics do. But yes force-torque controllers can be tuned to be squishier. Someday I think electric motors will be the muscles and we'll have some kind of elastic tendons. For energy efficiency, it seems obvious to harness impact energy in a mechanical spring system, as nature does. Or just use wheels / a wheel. This whole humanoid thing strikes me as an addiction to old sci Fi stories. reply Animats 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn't work that way. Hydraulic systems have very little \"give\", unless you put a hydraulic accumulator (an air tank with a fluid/air barrier) in the system. Electric motors have plenty of \"give\". Forcing a motor to turn backwards won't hurt it. The gear train is usually the weak point. As motors and controllers have improved, robot gear reduction ratios have decreased, which reduces the load on the gear train and lets the motor absorb shock loads. Direct drive robots eliminate the gear train entirely. Here's a nice one.[1] \"You cannot strip the teeth of a magnetic field\" - General Electric electric locomotive rep, around 1900. With modern motors, you can get huge torque with light weight, and cooling becomes the limitation. Schaft used water-cooled motors in their direct-drive robot. Google bought Schaft, ran them into the ground and killed them. [1] https://shop.directdrive.com/products/diablo-world-s-first-d... reply jvanderbot 14 hours agorootparentI stand corrected! Thank you. I'm still mostly convinced that harvesting the energy and re-using it ala elastic tendons is a decently good idea. But probably far too complex. reply Animats 14 hours agorootparentIt's mostly for distance running. Humans get about 70% of energy back in running. Cheetahs, about 90%. Variable compliance muscles are desirable, but hard to do. A pneumatic cylinder with adjustable pressure on both sides will do it, and Festo builds a lot of that for industrial automation. Two opposed springs pulled on by two positional actuators will do it, but that's kind of bulky. There's a hack called a \"series elastic actuator\", which is a rigid positional actuator with a stiff spring on the end. When it gets some pushback, the spring compresses, and the motor frantically tries to move the positional actuator before the spring bottoms out. This allows you to simulate a spring with off the shelf screw jacks. Those new direct-drive motors are a good solution. Direct-drive pancake motors have been around for a while, but they used to be about a foot across. Now they're smaller. Probably a spinoff of drone motor technology. reply fragmede 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's not because of science fiction stories, it's because things designed for human to use, is designed for a humanoid form factor. If you want to accomplish a task, it's going to be reflected by that machine. Eg a conveyor belt doesn't look like a human. But if you want swap a robot where a human used to be, it's far easier if that robot is humanoid and has the same approximate capabilities. Thus, we have humanoid robots. reply jvanderbot 14 hours agorootparentCan someone point out where \"powered rollerskates\" are strictly worse than legs in civilized urban human environments, to an extent that a few extra hundred billion dollars of R&D are warranted? The \"approximate capabilities\" of a human are: moving around, and picking things up / fine manipulation. Wheels + arms does that just fine, and eliminates a lot of power, complexity, fragility. And it also potentially adds. This is one of those 80/20 things that is just glaringly obvious. Like lvl 5 autonomous cars vs lvl 3-4. reply lanternfish 14 hours agorootparentThe obvious answer is stairs. It seems like right now Spot is getting the most use as a highly mobile camera platform for automated inspection in industrial environments. Many of these have a lot of stairs. reply hanniabu 9 hours agorootparentAnd non hard/flat surfaces like carpet, grass, gravel, mud... reply klowrey 15 hours agorootparentprevHydraulics shouldn't have any give, as the working fluid is considered \"incompressible\". Of course in the real world the tubing can expand slightly and there are friction losses, but the reason they went with hydraulics in the first place is they can set a position and not have to use more energy to hold it there (since the cylinders are pressurized). If the gear ratio on these motors is high, then there can only be faked compliance in the tuned force-torque controllers you mentioned. MIT's little cheetah robot, on the other hand, deliberately used low-gear ratios to keep things naturally squishy if needed. This is the way to go; putting elastic tendons or spring elements seems like a good idea but then you can't actually model the non-linearity well (the 1st order motor becomes a 2nd or higher order system). reply jvanderbot 14 hours agorootparentAh, thank you.

If they were more focused on commercialization for the past 20 years then they wouldn't have pushed the tech forward as far and as fast as they have. The whole point of the article is speculating that they are specifically retiring their hydraulic robot because it was never going to be commercially viable. Which makes it look like they are finally ready to pivot from pure R&D to commercial production. Thus they want fully electronic robots instead of hydraulics that are messy and require more (almost constant?) maintenance. I'm not an engineering guy but I assume the hydraulics were more useful for pushing the boundaries of possible motion with such a heavy, robust, and versatile design. Now that the AI systems controlling vision, motion, proprioception/spatial awareness, etc are more fully developed, they can create more specialized and scaled down versions of the robot for specific applications that are lighter and don't require hydraulics to perform their tasks reliably?

I'm not in robotics, so this could be fan fiction, but: I guess they have figured out the physics engines for these things meaningfully, so I guess innovating on hardware can be the next focus? I feel like a lot of the early bots were just to understand the real word implications of the physics they simulated, now that they understand robot physics extremely well and seems to have built a whole OS around that, I suspect they can plug it into any hardware that they want? They have it to the point where they might be somewhat decoupled? If anyone who works in robotics sees this and can say if that is correct thinking or not, I'd be very curious. reply ragebol 19 hours agorootparentI suspect that they have something like that indeed. In robotics, there is the concept of a Whole-body-controller, and I think BD has one of these for their robots, which can be calibrated for each individual robot. And the tools & skills to make such a controller for new robot variants fairly quick. Such WBC then makes sure that the robot reaches both it's task goals (eg. grab something, with 1, 2 arms), as well as it's (dynamic) stability goals so it doesn't fall over. They are also capable of choreographing the robot pretty accurately as we say in earlier videos. But what is most very impressive to me is the robot using the mass and momentum of things it grabs to keep stable or move itself. In one of the videos it grabs a big piece of wood and uses it to turn itself around while jumping. Amazing! Controlling that in terms of dynamics is... wow! reply neom 17 hours agorootparentThat's what it seems like to me too, and let me tell you, i am right there with you on that last point ragebol, that stuff I also find really really amazing, because it's so thoughtful I guess, and I wish my brain was good enough to hack physics like that.

In it she covers the latest and greatest robot news, with occasional commentary/perspectives. However to more directly answer your question, you need to know/talk to someone in the industry at the moment. I am not aware of a single “spot” that gives an honest in depth appraisal of where we are. From my experience there is a ton of new “hardware” coming out, not just in the humanoid space (Agility Robotics being imho the most “real”), but also in lower cost robot arms, end effectors, sensors, and compute. Where things are harder to track is where we really are in the software realm. If you look at software driving this hardware, most of it is early stages. Perhaps TRL level 3 to 5 at best. The higher TRL is non-intelligent control software (that is based on decades of work). The newer, AI/Machine Learning/“Smart” software tends to only have limited roll out. At best it will be a startup at the relatively early stages, but more often then not it is still a researcher sitting at a University or a large corporations research lab. In either of those cases, you will see single to at most double digit examples of those systems actually doing work. However, to your point, it is super easy to create a single (or even a series) of cool videos… it just takes one success in 100s of takes. It is harder to make something that will perform day in and day out and really change the industry/world. reply adriancooney 19 hours agoparentprevLex Fridman has a long interview [1] with Marc Raibert, CEO of Boston Dynamics, which is really excellent.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/loopj/short-stack",
    "originBody": "World's Smallest Nintendo Wii, using a trimmed motherboard and custom stacked PCBs Features · Size & Scale · Components · Build Guide · Special Thanks Features World's smallest \"to scale\" Wii console Powered by USB-C HDMI for lossless digital audio and video (powered by GCVideo) Bluetooth for Wii remotes and accessories MicroSD card stores games and saves, instead of disc drive & memory cards 4 GameCube controller ports Power, reset, and sync buttons Power indicator LED and iconic blue glowing disc slot Soft shutdown, power on/off via Wiimote Size & Scale This is a 1:2.38 scale model of an original Nintendo Wii console, but since that is hard to visualize here are some other stats: Same size as a typical deck of playing cards 7.4% the volume of an original Wii console You could fit 13.5 of these inside an original Wii I'm pretty sure this sets the record for the smallest functional scale-model Wii console, but let me know if I'm wrong! Could we go smaller? Yes! It is definitely possible to go smaller than this. My version of the Omega trim keeps all four main mounting holes, which makes it around 7mm wider than a classic Omega trim. Additionally Wesk has managed to get a Wii motherboard down to 52x52mm on his final destination trim, which is a a full 10mm narrower than my trim. I estimate you could reduce the volume by a further 25-30% without losing any functionality, but it would be an incredibly tight fit and tricky to assemble. Components As the name implies, Short Stack is built from a stack of custom PCBs, and a custom heatsink, that are all designed to fit together in a compact and modular way. A modular motherboard Making a tiny build like this is made possible by trimming the Wii motherboard down to the bare essentials. The result is a board which is just 62x62mm, but still contains the CPU, GPU, RAM and flash memory. Since we removed the original power circuitry and trimmed off the USB, Bluetooth, and GameCube connectors, we need to provide power and data to the board another way. I designed a couple of boards which solder directly to the front of a trimmed Wii motherboard to provide power and data, which help avoid a tangled mess of wires. The Wii Power Strip supplies power to the Wii motherboards using a Molex Pico-Lock connector, and additionally has footprints to help relocate of a couple of capacitors which are typically removed when trimming a Wii. Periphlex is a flex PCB which breaks out the Bluetooth, USB and GameCube controller data lines, as well as the power, shutdown, and reset GPIOs. These are then made available via a 14-pin FFC connector. This approach replaces 11 magnet wires with a single, removable ribbon cable. On the back of the motherboard, I'm using two open-source boards designed by the very talented YveltalGriffin. fujiflex provides digital A/V output using GCVideo, and nandFlex relocates the Wii's NAND memory chip, to enable the tight trim. Custom PCBs In addition to the modular boards on the motherboard, I designed two PCBs specific to Short Stack which provide the rest of the functionality for the console. The main board PCB hosts the power regulators, USB to microSD logic, HDMI connector, GameCube ports, and a microcontroller for power management. A 14-pin ribbon cable connects this board to the Wii motherboard via Periphlex, and a power cable delivers power to the Power Strip. The front panel PCB hosts the power, reset, and sync buttons, as well as the power LED and disc slot LEDs. This board connects to the main board via a short 8-pin ribbon cable. Since the GameCube controller connectors on the original Wii wouldn't fit cleanly on a build of this size, I use TRRS headphone connectors instead. This is the exact same approach used on the amazing GC Nano and in fact I made sure the dongles are pinout compatible! Cooling The final part of the \"stack\" is a custom heatsink which is designed to be as low profile as possible, while still providing adequate cooling for the Wii's CPU and GPU. The heatsink is designed to be machined from aluminum or copper, and incorporates mounting holes which align with those on the Wii motherboard. I managed to find a tiny 5V blower fan (Pelonis AGB208N) which measures just 20x20x8mm and somehow puts out 0.84 CFM of air. This blows air through the heatsink fins, out the side of the case. Case The stack is housed in a custom 3D printed case, secured with four M2.5 screws and spacers. The rest of case is assembled using self-tapping M1.2 screws. The screw locations and fan vents are positioned to match the original Wii case as closely as possible, to minimize visible screws. You can access files on the SD card by connecting the console to a computer via USB, but I also included an access panel on the front of the case where the original Wii SD card slot is found. This panel is held in place by magnets and can be removed to access the SD card without opening the case. Shout out to Wesk for the magnet idea! To keep the clean aesthetic of the original Wii I wanted to hide the GameCube controller ports behind a panel. I always hated the hinged design of the original, and it is quite difficult to replicate at this scale, so I redesigned this panel to be a sliding panel. The Wii's iconic disc slot lights are recreated using a 1.5mm thick custom cut acrylic light diffuser, which is illuminated by two side-mounted addressable LEDs on the front panel board. The power, reset, and sync buttons are all also 3D printed, and the power button hosts a tiny light pipe to allow the power LED to shine through. I FDM printed the case on a Voron 2.4 in ABS using a 0.4mm nozzle at 0.1mm layer height, but it should print fine in PLA or PETG on a well-tuned printer. At this scale, dimensional accuracy is important. In theory it should be possible to print this on an SLA printer, but I haven't tried it. Build Guide Caution This is not a beginner project! This build requires performing a challenging motherboard trim, fine pitch soldering, and PCB assembly. If you are not comfortable with these tasks, I would recommend starting with a simpler project and working your way up - check out the BitBuilt forums for some awesome project worklogs. What you'll need 4-layer Wii motherboard nandFlex board (or 4Layer Technologies RVL-NAND) Assembled fujiflex (or ElectronAVE) Assembled Wii Power Strip - must be revision 1!

The short-proof approach/strategy would be to use small magnetic pogo connectors, but I really wanted to maintain compatibility with the GC Nano! reply rawbot 2 hours agorootparentGood to know this was already considered! reply oritron 5 hours agoparentprevThat's a very good point to keep in mind. I've seen that go wrong! There are lots of connectors out there where the pins never short. The tricky thing is finding ones that can be plugged and unplugged often, while still being small. I've misused USB B connectors for this purpose; it's not common enough for someone to have the wrong cable to plug in, yet very easy to solder and to get the parts. There are also some circular connectors (M5, M6) where the connector on the device is decently small and the bulk tends to be on the cable side. With a small crimper there are even more compact options which still handle many mating cycles, like Samtec's various Tiger Eye product lines. reply PrivateButts 5 hours agoparentprevHaven't touched a GameCube or a Wii in a long time, but didn't those things not support hot plugging GC controllers in general? reply rawbot 2 hours agorootparentYou can hotplug them, but when plugging them, there's no short risk, as all pins have their individual connectors. A barrel TRRS headphone connector can short, because the first \"pin\", the tip, goes through every single connector. Imagine this was power, and one of the connectors it went through was ground. reply nyanpasu64 3 hours agorootparentprevThe stock GC controller ports place the contacts next to each other, rather than at different depths, so they won't connect controller pins to the wrong port pins or short pins together when partially plugged. (I do suspect the ground and/or power pins may be longer than data lines, to connect first.) reply phinnaeus 8 hours agoprevThis was messing with my head for a minute, I thought maybe they had figured out a way to use mini CDs (like the GameCube) to make that tiny disc drive functional, but it appears to just be decorative. reply loopj 8 hours agoparentPurely for aesthetics!

Creating the smallest board possible while maintaining original game compatibility are about the only metrics to stick to. Usually this boils down to keeping the CPU, GPU, NAND (if exists like the Wii), and most times the RAM. There are some nuts people out there like Redherring32 with his TinyTendo project that go above and beyond just putting the components on a new board. He designed the TinyTendo which requires cutting down the DIP-packaged CPU and PPU from the NES into a smaller package.

Would one of those running an emulator be even smaller? reply delecti 6 hours agorootparentIt's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but the Wii's CPU was 32-bit, 729 MHz, and single-core, and its GPU was a 243 MHz SoC. I briefly checked the Samsung Galaxy S lineup as a point of comparison, and it seems like the second one (from 2011) already smoked those specs. As for space, even without doing any modifications to the phone it's already about half the volume of this mini-Wii. Of course that's really just sidestepping the challenge of \"how small can you get an actual Wii\". reply rawbot 2 hours agorootparentprevYou could 100% make a smaller fake \"wii\" by emulating it with a smartphone SoC. Mid-range phones can emulate Wii and Gamecube at 2x resolution. However, the intention of these miniature builds is to preserve the original device, just in tiny form. No emulation involved.

The algorithm is described here, and the implementation is open source. https://kolinko.github.io/effort/ I know these are bold claims, but I hope they survive the scrutiny :) renonce 5 hours agoEssentially the algorithm is about pruning parameters on the fly and making the weight matrix sparse by setting least significant weights to zero, where \"least significant\" is defined in terms of the rank of the absolute value of the pruned weight within its group? A search for model pruning turns out many results, including https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11627 which discusses \"magnitude pruning\" as a baseline, and refers to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00774.pdf, which asserts in the introduction: > First, as shown in Figure 1, SparseGPT can induce uniform layerwise sparsity of up to 60% in e.g. the 175-billion-parameter variant of the OPT family (Zhang et al., 2022), with minor accuracy loss. By contrast, the only known one-shot baseline which easily extends to this scale, Magnitude Pruning (Hagiwara, 1994; Han et al., 2015), preserves accuracy only until 10% sparsity, and completely collapses beyond 30% sparsity. I don't like how these papers boast their own methods by poorly implementing a baseline and describing their own methods using lots of mathematical jargon - the OP's blog post is a breeze in making the methods accessible to people with very little background. reply kolinko 3 hours agoparentThanks! The last full month was all about making sure all the research is as replicable and as trustworthy as I can do it. The original implementation was extremely inefficient, and even once I had the Metal/GPU mmul op working fast, I spent much time to bring the rest of the implementation as close to the Llama.cpp as possible to allow for easier benchmarking. As for the approaches - it seems the papers you mention do this statically, and din't produce an algorithm for actually speeding up computations with their 20-50% results - which was a large part of the difficulty. I'll probably take some time off one day and do a thorough review of the literature finally. Ultimately I want to add a citations page with these and some other papers people have posted in the comments soon. I expect sooner or later someone will find this algorithm written up by someone :) While development asked gpt-4 and googled trying to find information about this method - everything seemed either static, or focused on removing full dimensions/layers ad hoc with eventual retraining. Didn't find anything matching this idea exactly. reply bravura 2 hours agorootparentThank you. If you want to contribute novel research, a thorough literature search of prior work is essential. And hopefully a comparison to previous approaches. If you didn't find these works in your literature search, I encourage you to improve this skill, because it's important and valuable. reply kolinko 1 hour agorootparentTrue, it will be easier next time because new llms allow to better searching through papers. Having said that - the tradeoff with getting into a new field is that there is 50 years of history to dig through, and by the time you know exactly what you’re looking for, you don’t need to find it really. Although a better math framework or another approach would help a bit for sure. I think in the future it will be way easier with better llm searches. Gpt right now fell short in finding some stuff, but it was already very useful in giving me an overview of the field. reply spencerchubb 12 hours agoprevI love this line in the gpu implementation section. \"Readers fresh to GPU programming may ask now - how does it work? Readers experienced with GPU programming may ask - how the hell does it work?\" reply kolinko 11 hours agoparentHaha thanks! :) As far as I understand I had to implement the memory reads and some other things the opposite way to what is considered a proper approach. Would love to have that code reviewed by someone who actually knows stuff about Metal - this is my first gpu programming attempt reply bigcat12345678 15 hours agoprev“““ So instead, let's flip the matrix, sort the elements row-wise, and revisit the multiplications from that direction. This is called a Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format by the smart people. To do the multiplication now, we take, say, the 1 from the vector, multiply it by 256, and add it into the output vector at the 3rd row. And so on. Now, let's see what happens if we truncate the last column - the one with the lowest values. ””” How does csr works with reduced numbers multiplication? reply kolinko 15 hours agoparentCan you rephrase the question? Not sure I get it. reply bigcat12345678 11 hours agorootparentI could not read from the text how multiplication with CSR format works in the context of optimization. The key missing piece for me is that how to utilize CSR format to find the numbers to do multiplication, in other words, how does CSR format helps with picking the numbers to multiply with the vector. reply kolinko 11 hours agorootparentAh, I get the question now. If I understand correctly CSR, it stores indexes and values as a list. I store them also as a list - that's why the comparison is there. The difference is that with CSR you store say 15% of the values from a given row. I store all of them, but use only the first X% of them. The X% varies and depends on the input vector. They are stored sorted, from the one of a highest absolute value to the lowest absolute value. It's after midnight so my explanations may not be too good now, but I hope the pseudocode on the page and the examples explain it slightly better. I'll be fixing grammar / typos, and asking ChatGPT to rewrite the page text for me tomorrow to make it more readable :) reply marmaduke 12 hours agoprevHaving used CSR it's not surprising, and some newer formats might have more mechanical sympathy like block ELL, since they avoid uncoalesced reads / gathers, tho the code is trickier. reply kolinko 12 hours agoparentOh, nice to finally bump into someone who has experience with CSR! bucketMul has few uncoalesced reads, and it uses a different data structure than the regular CSR - it's decribed here: https://kolinko.github.io/effort/bucketmul.html It splits each Matrix row into 16 parts, and chooses which ones are necessary to read. The writes are fully linear. Not sure if I speak sense though, it's getting a bit late today, and it's been a long day ;) reply hatthew 11 hours agoprevThis seems similar to semi-structured (aka 2:4) sparsity, may be worth explicitly comparing. As far as I can tell by skimming, your technique: - is optimized for apple silicon - ~2x speed at 75% sparsity - dynamic, depends on input, applied at runtime - can choose amount of sparsity And 2:4 semi-structured sparsity: - is optimized for GPUs with sparse tensor cores (nvidia ampere and beyond) - ~2x speed at 50% sparsity - static, applied to the model at rest - probably worse results than your technique at 50% sparsity The interesting comparison I'd want to see is semi-structured sparsity results (50% sparsity, 2x speedup) vs your results at 75% sparsity (2x speedup). reply kolinko 10 hours agoparentThanks for checking it out! I also can’t wait to have more tests done. Also, I chose Apple Silicon because it was easier for me to develop on. It is possible that the algorithm would also have good performance on other architectures. reply dartos 16 hours agoprevThank you for this really cool and open contribution! I will be watching llama.cpp closely for them to implement this! I’ve been looking for ways to speed up CPU inference and I really like this idea of “effort” reply kolinko 16 hours agoparentHahah, thanks! It was a marathon to get develop this, and I'm glad it reached the front page. The name was proposed by chatgpt :) It claims it doesn't recognise this approach - so there is a chance it's really a new thing. I want to reach out to llama.cpp and the others - I hope it gets implemented. I considered just writing a patch to llama, but c++ and the scale of that project was beyond me. As for CPU inference - it should speed it up just as well. But thanks to the fact that it can load up a fraction of weights (e.g. just 70%, skipping the least important ones), it should be possible now to run models on less VRAM than before (still, Q8 needs to implemented though). Funnily - when I tried comparing benchmarks to llama.cpp, I couldn't find speeds for 7B/FP16 on MB Air 16GB, because it's impossible to run with regular methods. It is possible with Effort. Ditto, I was running full resolution, but cropped, Mixtral on my 96GB M2, even though it usually takes 114GB ram. I just loaded 75% of weights, and it was working smoothly. (before I messed something up with implementation and it now produces crap output - needs a fix) reply dhruvdh 15 hours agorootparentI would imagine the importance of weights depends on the prompt. How do you decide which weights are important? reply kolinko 15 hours agorootparentYeah, that is the point more or less - it dynamically chise the weights layer per layer depending on the internal state. A bit technical explaination here. https://kolinko.github.io/effort/equations.html reply 0x4139 13 hours agorootparentprevImplementing this approach could significantly enhance the adoption of LLMs within mobile phone libraries and other compact devices. I highly recommend opening an improvement issue for llama.cpp. reply indymike 15 hours agorootparentprev> It is possible with Effort. \"All things are possible with enough effort.\" -- Dad. reply kolinko 15 hours agorootparentHahaha :) reply gsuuon 14 hours agoprevNice writeup! Very curious about the performance per VRAM with this compared to just quantization. Any plans to implement a cross platform version? reply kolinko 13 hours agoparentPer VRAM - not much netter, because it still uses all the weights, just not all the time. I mean - it can also load less weights, but quality seems to degrade quick after offloading more than 20-30% weights. In other words - this algorithm decouples inference time from VRAM use. Having said that, I’m curious as well if using effort you can get better results on Q8 cropped to 75% than on Q6. But it’s still probably a few weeks to get the implementation polished enough to be well tested. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparent> Having said that, I’m curious as well if using effort you can get better results on Q8 cropped to 75% than on Q6. This is what I wanted to ask. This seems like the same kind of optimization as quantization, sacrificing a bit of quality for performance by discarding some data. So then the question is, which is better, and how do they combine? You could even potentially get different results at different points in the scale. Maybe Q8 cropped to 75% isn't better than Q6 but Q4 cropped to 75% is better than Q3, or vice versa. reply kolinko 3 hours agorootparentBelow Q8 I think it will combine poorly - bucketMul needs to keep a few bits for an index. It can be offset by the fact that the numbers from each bucket are from a limited range. My intuition is that with Q8 this trades off roughly evenly - meaning bucketed Q8 may store as much info as regular Q8, but it will be more difficult with lower quantizations, and cross the boundary of impossible after Q5. Don't have math to back it up, but perhaps some information theoretitian could pick up the calculations. You could say that these are divergent paths in the future developments (if the results hold for Q8) - perhaps you can crop the Q8 models to Q6 sizes and inference speeds of Q2/Q4. On the other hand, the wildly optimistic scenario is that the bucketMul speeds will overcome even Q1, with dynamic computation pruning - token by token and layer by layer, by having a separate small network that chooses effort levels based on the input data. (someone already proposed it in the thread). For now, the most important thing is fixing the bugs, doing more serious tests for FP16, and showing how the charts look for Q8. Especially the Q8 is the biggest unknown, although the initial results are hopeful. reply brrrrrm 6 hours agoprevI've been trying to think about how you'd amp up the batch size here. it's a bit tricky since the memory access would be way higher, but I think you can actually still save on compute by chunking things up in a clever way to utilize the tensorcores reply kolinko 3 hours agoparentWhat would definitely help would be a better understanding a GPU handles myVal - does it go to the cache, threadgroup memory or where. Or perhaps decompilation of the source kernel to see what's really going on there. If we knew, we could calculate the optimal parameters given an architecture. There is also another approach I tried - I've kept it in the wildMul.swift/metal . More by the book. Splitting work so that one thread keeps track of only one or two output dimensions when going through the buckets. Didn't manage to get it working with a decent speed though. The idea would be to make sure that one simdgroup reads 4/8 buckets in a batch (so still ~8-16 consecutive bytes which is considered minimum for an optimal read on Apple Silicon) and splits each single bucket among 4-8 threads. One thread might then need to remember only 2-4 dims in myVal, and this might stay in internal GPU registers. Not sure if I'm explaining this all correctly though. Having said this - the priority now will be to remove the overhead to get the whole inference time closer in speed to just the multiplication speeds, but above all - fixing the bugs causing suboptimal results at 100% (and breaking Mixtral), and doing Q8. The algorithm needs to work in Q8 to be really usable. reply toisanji 15 hours agoprevthis sounds related to this: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12456 https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/PowerInfer reply kolinko 15 hours agoparentSimilar theme, but they skip whole neurons, in my case it’s down to a level of single weights. From my experiment, skipping whole neurons (so whole rows/columns of matrixes) didn’t allow for such good results. In my case 30-50% neurons whole are skipped with 15% effort, but the rest is used partially still. There are a few papers on a similar theme that a friend sent me today morning - I plan to add them in the citations part reply toisanji 15 hours agorootparentawesome, looking forward to seeing how your results perform. I tested powerinfer on smaller models and didn't see large performance gains. reply globally_unique 13 hours agoprevThat looks like fantastic stuff. I just want to point out the 15ms delay looks similar to 60Hz vsync (16.7ms), if you are updating the screen once per token, maybe that’s causing a sync somehow? reply kolinko 13 hours agoparentNah, that's not it, I measure the CPU & GPU work separately, and 15ms happens between the kernel invocations. It also happens when I don't print out text. Thanks for the idea though! I treat it as the first community contribution :D reply yousif_123123 10 hours agoprevI know this doesn't retrain, but I wonder if approaches like this plus quantization could get back any \"lost\" quality with some post training. It's great to see, and to know in one's mind how much likely performance and cost will be better in the future. I know it's fun to work on, but I also want to say THANK YOU for developing open source. reply spencerchubb 7 hours agoparentAt first glance, that sounds like it could work. From what I've read, there seems to be two main ways to regain some quality with quantization: post-training which happens after, and quantization-aware training which quantizes during training but leaves the activations and gradients full precision reply kanwisher 15 hours agoprevCould you break down a bit more about why you can skip so many calculations ? reply kolinko 14 hours agoparentIt’s explained in detail here: https://kolinko.github.io/effort/equations.html Long story short - I kind of sort them and pick only the top % that would give a highest result. One part is choosing them though - I think this was done before in some papers. But the second part was an implementation of multiplication that is efficient on both gpus and cpus when choosing weights almost at will. All explained on the site, but I just got feedback that it may not be easy enough to read, so I’ll push it through gpt for grmamar fixes soon :) It’s also a bit complicated as an algorithm. reply throwaway2562 14 hours agorootparentHmmm. Very interesting. I wonder if you could speed up your clever approximation still further with this approach https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09120.pdf reply kolinko 12 hours agorootparentNah, sadly this most likely will not work with Q1/Q1.5 implementations - initially I was playing with monte carlo approximations (before I arrived at bucketMul), and the convergence was very slow for binary/ternary networks. Or, in simpler terms - if you have just ones and zeroes, and minus ones, you can remove zeroes from calculations, but that's it. No good method to figure out which ones are more important than the other ones. Also, there are no bits left to store positional information when bucketing. There are some paths that could be explored in this fashion, but it would require a redesign of the algorithm from the ground up. reply punnerud 14 hours agoparentprevA bit like calculating the fastest route for a car, you probably don’t need to calculate the distances for the opposite side of earth if you will not drive there. Then multiply that by a billion, but the optimization still holds. reply kolinko 2 hours agorootparentNice analogy, thanks! Yes - you still need a map, because one day you need this road, another day you need info about another road, but you're not using info about all the roads all of the time. reply bick_nyers 13 hours agoprevI'm wondering if you could sort the two inputs, add the indicies for the multiplications together, then take the largest of that. In your 0.1 example, 1000 gets index 2, and 0.1 index 0, combines to 2. This will tie with the 1*8, but I think it would even out with larger vector lengths. Edit: I could be wrong but I think you can precompute the indices for the weights in advance without a prompt, then you won't need to perform those sorts at runtime. reply kolinko 2 hours agoparentThat was one of the ideas I was also considering originally! Don't remember why is skipped it though - may have been because I tried the published one and it worked well enough during the first tries. As for indices for weight - not sure if I get what you mean, but the weights are sorted as a part of precomputations. Sorting is not done in runtime, because that would kill any efficiency - the moment you need to read all the weights, you've lost, because it's the memory reads, not computations that matter. If you can skip one memory read by doing 5-10 multiplications, it's a good tradeoff. reply wayoverthecloud 7 hours agoprevI was wondering if something similar can be done for CNN too. reply kolinko 2 hours agoparentA friend who first heard of the method immediately suggested this may work, perhaps even better in Diffusion models. It is really a drop-in replacement for the regular matrix multiplication. The data structure is a bit more painful to work with (you have three datasets, not just one to represent a weight matrix), but it shouldn't be too difficult for devs of the existing inference engines to implement it for a test. Half of my challenge was that I wasn't knowledgable enough to just patch llama.cpp or MLX and use their engines with bucketMul. That's why I opted for making my own - still not sure if it was a good choice to build everything from the ground up though, although I'm proud of the name :) Finally - the basic math behind approximation suggest that this should work with all the models - cosine similarity score is 0.99 until the magical 25% mark for most of the matrixes I tried. It can vary within a model though - e.g. in Llama, on the first layer, wq/wv/wk could be easily approximated with 5% effort, whereas some deeper layers at 25% had just 0.90 cos score - still seemed enough to not lose coherency within the model. reply byyoung3 14 hours agoprevI think this is the overall idea behind the MoE LLM models right? MoE just expands upon this idea by learning which sets of weights to use reply kolinko 14 hours agoparentI’d say that this expands on MoE really - MoE chooses dynamically which groups of weights may be needed, but it’s whole matrixes. Here it’s ingle weights. Also, this works on top of MoE beautifully - most of the development and testing was done on Mixtral and it was getting (anecdotally) even better results - getting down to 15-18% effort before seriously losing quality. I decided to release the Mistral version, but Mixtral was fully operational a few commits back :) Also, the cool thing - because you can load only the top say 70% weights, I was running Mixtral full precision on my MB 96G - there were no bemchmarks for this in other impls because others need to load full model into the memory. The real question is Q8 performance - I didn’t implement it fully so far. reply huac 11 hours agoparentprevIt also feels similar to mixture of depths (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02258). Being able to apply this post-training is pretty cool though, makes it easier to use across a wider range of setups. reply kolinko 2 hours agorootparentYes! I like that, and I saw that paper last weekend iirc. I think these MoD/MoE and other similar methods are highly compatible, and in a similar style. I was originally afraid that this method wouldn't be compatible with MoE and the other methods, but fortunately, at least for Mixtral, there seems to be an amazing synergy. By the way, other tasks have higher priority now, byt there is an interesting observation about MoE. In MoE you get two experts chosen, and each expert has a different weight attached to it - e.g. expert 1 has 75% weight, and expert 2 has 25% weight. Perhaps this could allow to scale the effort to give 75% effort to one expert, and 25% to the other. There are some issues there due to non-linearity of the layers, but perhaps there is something to it. reply smcleod 12 hours agoprevLooks like the models are missing on Huggingface, I've logged an issue: https://github.com/kolinko/effort/issues/3 reply kolinko 12 hours agoparentAh yes, forgot to make the repo public. Thanks a ton for pointing it out and writing the comment - I'd miss it if you didn't point it out on HN. reply avereveard 15 hours agoprevwe need this into llama.cpp it seems somewhat stable down to 40% effort reply kolinko 15 hours agoparentYes! I hope, if it’s proven, that it will be implemented into the main inference engines. 40% effort is only a bit faster than a full base multiplication, but I hope both the speed and the accuracy could be improved further. reply saurik 15 hours agoprevAlso being discussed at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40067489 reply gcy 15 hours agoprevCould you explain the pseudo code in your equations page?

I just refreshed and that is still there on the page[0]. [0] https://kolinko.github.io/effort/equations.html reply coolvision 15 hours agoprevhow does it compare to 8-bit/4-bit quantization in terms of speed/accuracy? reply kolinko 15 hours agoparenthard to say for now, I’m curious as well, but I used simpler tests so far because of the implementation issues - most test suites are geared towards testing models and not model implementation. I didn’t want to wait any longer with the release, but better tests will be coming soon I hope. Anecdotally, I think 30% effort should be comparable to Q8z More importantly, this algorithm should work on top of Q8. The quality is not yet certain though - I could use help with the implementation. reply a2code 12 hours agoprevIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is not. If removing weights improves some metrics, that may be a clue that the model is not optimal in some sense. reply kolinko 11 hours agoparentThe algorithm still uses all the weights, just not all the time - just skips the weights when they are not important given an input vector. Also, approximation methods, as a field, are not new and they have shown their use. Having said all that, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - that’s why I hedge the communication messages. It’s „probably” until we get serious tests going on reply mijoharas 9 hours agoparentprevThe metric that's improved is computation speed, and it's achieved by essentially changing the computation (by not performing some computation that likely doesn't have large impact on the results). Give that it's a different computation, you could argue that Mistral+effort is a new model with the improved metric of quality per amount of computation performed. Otherwise - given that for every different input there's a seperate set of weights in the model that are excluded - I don't think you could conclude from this (if it holds up etc etc) that the base model is not optimal. In a similar sense, quantization improved the \"quality per model size\" metric, but I don't think people are arguing that Mistral is less optimal than quantised Mistral (unless you're speaking about literally that metric). On the other hand, if you're targeting that metric specifically, then it would make perfect sense to say that quantised Mistral is more optimisal for it. I guess it comes down to optimality being dependent on the metric you're looking at, and there being many things you might want to optimise for. To note again, if this technique holds up, it's better than model distillation (just get rid of some of the weights) because for some inputs those weights could matter and this technique should (iiuc) account for that somewhat. To me, this is what it sounds like you're referring to when saying: > If removing weights improves some metrics, that may be a clue that the model is not optimal in some sense reply addandsubtract 8 hours agoparentprevWait, does the second \"it\" refer to the true part? Because traditionally, it refers to the \"too good\" expression. So you'd say, \"it _is_ too good to be true\". reply uhlo 12 hours agoprevOkay now add a small model that decides how much effort is needed in each inference step and we are good to go reply kolinko 12 hours agoparentYes! That would be awesome. Especially since there are ~32*6 independent effort settings for every single token. I tested the most basic implementation, with a flat effort setting for all the muls, but I bet the results could be pushed even further with such an approach. Or even with just doing some ML to figure out which layer/matrix needs more and which less effort. reply uhlo 12 hours agorootparentGreat work! One thing: it seems the hugging face link doesn't work... I get a 404 reply kolinko 2 hours agorootparentIt should work now :) reply brrrrrm 14 hours agoprevdo you have a simple python impl? :) reply kolinko 13 hours agoparentIt originally started as a fork to Recmo’s cria pure numpy llama impl :) https://github.com/recmo/cria Took a whole night to compute a few tokens, but I used it to do the first tests. Also, my friend pasted the paper to claude and it produced a working basic impl instantly :D But in all seriousness - I think MLX implementation would be doable, or a wrapper to the Metal gou functionality reply kwikiel 13 hours agorootparentWill share python implementation soon as a kind of executable pseudo code which then can be ported to any platform. This project is kind of like ultimate nerdsnipe as math is quite simple, you don’t need PhD to understand it and actually implementing things would teach you linear algebra faster vs just mindlessly doing exercises sets. reply kolinko 12 hours agorootparentHaha yes :) Publish it, Kacper! The project is a nerdsnipe for math geeks, because there are multiple small things that beg to be proven / described by math there. For example - what's the tradeoff between the number of bits we loose when embedding position vs the bits of information that we gain by knowing which bucket a weight belongs to? In other words - is it possible that when storing weights in the bucketed form we can actually end up having a higher precision than using a regular form? For Q8 we get just 4 bits to store the weight (and 1 bit for sign, and 3 bits for location), but these 4 bits need to express numbers from a smaller range than before. reply brrrrrm 8 hours agoparentprevnot sure why I got downvoted for asking this. seems like a reasonable thing in the ML space anyway here's a numerical simulation written in PyTorch for those who want to consider this algo on their projects before fully integrating: https://gist.github.com/bwasti/78d7058aad7f42dc893d906c877b7... happy hacking reply kolinko 2 hours agorootparentIf you got downvoted, it was briefly. That was a good question. PyTorch/numpy is awesome for initial testing. reply xrd 13 hours agoprevMy takeaway is that this proves what was said on the recent latent.space podcast with David Luan from Adept. https://www.latent.space/p/adept \"I think is going to commoditize a lot of the regular LLMs and soon regular multimodal models.\" In other words, if you train your own models, you will not get to take advantage of breakthroughs like this that start with open models (like Mistral). All the advantages are going towards the open models and this is an existential risk for OpenAI and other closed model companies. reply kolinko 13 hours agoparentIn this case though, the algorithm should be just as useful to closed models as to open models. There is nothing there that is optimised specifically for Mistral - aside from the hard-coded dimensions in multiple places in the code :D Having said that, it's awesome to have open source models out there, and I hope they will ultimately win in the end. reply Havoc 10 hours agoparentprevThat seems fundamentally flawed to me. Closed providers can copy techniques from open models but not vice versa. To me that reads as closed will always be a step ahead not an existential risk to OpenAI. reply quadrature 13 hours agoparentprevMaybe, but theres nothing that stops OpenAI from stealing these tricks. reply littlestymaar 12 hours agorootparentExactly, that's the problem with the current state of things with open models, the players that keep their secret sauce keep an edge over the people doing things in open while benefiting from all of their work without contributing back. reply kolinko 11 hours agorootparentThat was the claim with a lot of the software in the past, but open source won in many places in the end. reply iwontberude 10 hours agorootparentAt the end of the day, if their profit margins aren’t good, it doesn’t matter whether their competition is open source or not (which is often where OSS wins). I think we are seeing that AI isn’t the slam dunk for increasing productivity or we would see companies like UIPath being profitable. I don’t think we’ve seen anyone net a profit on AI software and the only company that has been investing since at least 2017, Apple, gets zero credit for their contributions and commercialization of the tech. I think about how Amazon abandoned the AI-powered, checkout-free tech because the margin of error stayed stubbornly high for too long. The clock is ticking on the industry and some players, like Apple, already have found it isn’t profitable (well to their standards of 60% return on investment). reply kolinko 2 hours agorootparentDepends on a field. The project from the thread would take me an impossible amount of time without GPT. Even the page itself would take me twice as long to generate - the charts were done by pasting source data to GPT and GPT writing plotlib code for me to chart them, and the equations were originally written by GPT as well, because I wasn't familiar with MathJAX. Ditto with the code - a bunch of it was written by GPT originally, since this is my first Swift/Metal project. I kept telling it what I want to do in Python, and it kept rewriting it in Swift/Metal until I learned the latter. The name \"effort\" was also invented by GPT. Originally, internally, I was using \"quant\" but that would be confused with quantization. I considered \"perc\" from percentage - but that's ugly. I described the project to GPT, and it suggested \"effort\" as a metric. As for self-checkout - in Poland we have Żabka Nano which is still going on, and seems more solid than Amazon, but of course the time will tell :) reply Hugsun 8 hours agorootparentprevIn these fast moving early times of LLMs, they can maintain this advantage with simple things like proprietary datasets and greater compute. The difference in quality between the best model that can be made with such proprietary utilities and without is likely to decrease over time as open datasets of greater quality are published and the field matures. The difference in quality and number of competitors ultimately pays the bills and the harsher the competition is, the less money there will be, for each individual company, to maintain their possibly dwindling proprietary edge. The greater access to compute is an edge companies will likely hold for a while. It will be interesting to see how much open models will be able to catch up and how great of an edge proprietary models will maintain. reply refulgentis 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's extremely unlikely anyone will take any of this. Quick take: - it was 15x slower than llama.cpp when I used Apple's new proprietary ML framework on my MacBook - So I made it possible to skip arbitrary amounts of work. - I identified an arbitrary tradeoff that seems arbitrarily good to me. - I've confirmed this by making GPT-4 write some prompt with questions. Then I had the normal version answer, and the \"skip arbitrary work\" version answer, and it LGTM. - So I threw it up on GitHub, then on HN with a title \"LLM inference 2x faster (possibly)\", and people missed: [on my laptop] [in the ML framework I'm forcing myself to use] [based on an eval I made up] [based on an an eval where I am the evaluator] This *really* shouldn't have the title it does, very misleading. Author, please feel free to correct me, I'm sorry for not taking the time to find a gentler way to communicate this. I hope you kick ass. You did put possibly in a parenthetical, but its carrying the weight of the world here, people just see LLM 2x faster. That's why everyone is spinning off into grand speculation land, which I also see you valiantly commenting to dissuade reply kolinko 13 hours agorootparentThe whole inference is slow, but it's matrix multiplications that count. They work reliably on all the Macbooks that I tested - at 50% effort it's the same speed as the state of the art matrix multiplications, at 25% they are twice as fast. The apple's MPS matrix multiplications from Apple are comparable in speed to the speed of Llama.cpp and the other models. When I was doing tests, I was comparing the Llama.cpp benchmarks ( https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/4167 ) to Apple's MPS - they match very closely. And then I was comparing Apple's MPS to my results. Even if the end-results would show that the models somehow break (which they might on Q8), there is no other implemented method right now that would give you such speedups with matrixes of 25% sparsity. The usual methods break even with full matrix multiplications around 15% mark, and show speed improvements under 10% (as far as I know, but I'm new to the field, so I wait to be corrected). As for the other metrics - I hope to get help from the community to get the implementation done properly. So far it's been 3 months of work 12 hours a day - even during Easter - to get this version going. It is as far as I can push it without the community support, which I'm happy I received over the last hour. Also, I'm not sure what you'd expect really. A full production ready system on the day one? From a solo developer? Seriously? :) Let's get the flame war going! :D reply refulgentis 13 hours agorootparentNah it's good work, you'll be able to flame me in a couple weeks...months?..too when I ship my yawn-worthy yet another llama.cpp / OpenAI wrapper. :p I'd love this knob, particularly in llama.cpp, inference is a bit too slow on Android, 6 tkn/s for 3B. just can't stand it when people don't actually read anything but the title, and go crazy overboard, like, how are we in a thread where people are like \"oh this confirm local models will definitely win like I heard on a podcast\" and \"big bad OpenAI will steal this\". reply kolinko 12 hours agorootparentHahah thanks, although I was hoping for a flame to get adrenaline flowing to push through the night :D I also hope there will be an extra knob - or more like knobs, because effort can be regulated smoothly layer by layer, token by token, matrix by matrix. Think more like an equalizer, not a volume control :) The biggest question right now is how (if) it will perform with Q8 and with smaller models. The risk is that the quality dropoff will show up closer to 40-60% at Q8, negating the performance gains. reply xrd 13 hours agorootparentprevI think you are commenting on the \"stealing\" reply and not my original comment. And, I think you are making my point stronger. OpenAI could easily (and will) put out a blog post or tweet saying \"next models do inference 2.5x faster!\" Koliko did that, or maybe he didn't and someone else put words in his mouth. I don't really care: I can validate and test your comments here (and they are great!) and I can try his experiments myself. I cannot do that against \"GPT-5-2.5x faster (c) 2024\"-42B (because it isn't released yet publicly). Putting a paper and some vague ideas on Arvix isn't really doing much these days except adding to the confusion. Truly open work like koliko is doing is really exciting and feels like it can only be done against truly open models like Mistral. Oh wait, Mistral isn't fully open either (ducks...). reply observationist 12 hours agorootparentThere used to be a class of software called freeware - you could download and use it without restriction, you just couldn't resell it, or have the source to modify it. Llama and similar models are like freeware - an inscrutable binary blob crafted to work with other software, except instead of a VM or native OS environment, you have llama.cpp or similar software that runs the AI model. Mistral is open source, in that you can do anything the Apache license allows you to do, even package it into your own product and resell or modify it. We're missing the dataset details, the source to the software that produces the model, similar to not having access to an operating system and special compiler software. That's not a huge deal, because people don't have the resources to make use of those large datasets or the Mistral training software, which is likely highly tailored to their own training and development pipeline, and wouldn't do much good for anyone without at least a pod of A100's of their own. Weights available and other terms are being thrown around, and Meta and the like are calling their stuff \"open\" but that use of the term bears little resemblance to the use of the word by the open source community. The public Mistral models have open source licenses. The model can be used like open source software. The terms are permissive and free, requiring only attribution. Meta's license scheme is novel and not open, with arbitrary lawyerese and absolutely, 100% will bite someone in the ass when the threshold between \"annoying to sue\" and \"profitable to sue\" gets exceeded by someone using Llama in a way that's technically incorrect. Right now, Meta wants the goodwill more than they want a couple million dollars chasing a couple dozen startups. If the model doesn't have an open source license, it's not open. It might be freeware. Llama is freeware. You can, technically, do whatever you want to it, but try to not attract too much notice or be too successful with it. Mistral, by using Apache licensing, couldn't go after you even if they wanted to, unless you do something deliberately stupid. reply oceanplexian 9 hours agorootparent> If the model doesn't have an open source license, it's not open. Actually, OSS comes with tons of strings attached that make the term open dubious. And there are many ways they could come after you legally. Apache, GPL, etc all have terms and conditions, you have to contribute back X Y and Z, agree to our manifesto, and so on. The only truly free license is MIT.

Seriously though, this is a very interesting biologically inspired idea, since not all neuronal pathways fire all the time.

Got laid off because sales goals were not met while they retained people which I think were incompetent in their work. Even some guys which I think were better and more critical to the projects were dumped. I'm not climbing that ladder by being proactive and \"pragmatic\" again... Call me a paycheck stealer, quiet quitter etc. Just give me some JIRA ticket and let me read books while I get my job done in 1-2 hours a day. reply hinkley 17 hours agoparentI’ll be you ten bucks they got rid of people who bring up bad news and kept the yes-men. A company that doesn’t know what’s broken is doomed to mediocrity. But some people want to play music while the ship sinks. So they arrange for the most pleasant rest of the voyage they can, instead of saving as many people as they can. reply klabb3 17 hours agorootparent> I’ll be you ten bucks they got rid of people who bring up bad news and kept the yes-men I’m pretty cynical and assumed this was how layoffs worked but at least in faang and even smaller (maybe 500 people) SV companies, I actually don’t think this is the case anymore. Most I’ve seen have been extremely random – it seems like they cut teams/orgs very differently but on an individual level it seems random. I got the impression it’s some lawsuit thing, because they never leak the info beforehand so managers and other seniors can chime in, so it appears they’re cutting blindly from the exec level. There’s probably some politics going on in the higher echelons and maybe they force individuals out but with managers (including decorated ones) and regular employees it has not looked like a surgical political - not performance - play. From what I’ve seen. reply lazyasciiart 17 hours agorootparentThat’s how salesforce did it. One way you can tell how terribly uninformed the layoff choices were is that there were people who were actually rehired immediately. reply hinkley 17 hours agorootparentI charge 3x my hourly rate and a two hour minimum to talk to anyone who laid me off. If I worked somewhere that I loved that much that I’d even entertain the idea of coming back, I’d probably be too gutted to talk to them about it. reply jbm 10 hours agorootparentprevWhen I got laid off at SFDC, I found out that they wanted to get rid of certain localities. Heroku was always a remote friendly place, which apparently irritated some of the new Microsoft-derived management; the story I heard was they wanted to consolidate Canada's talent in my branch in Toronto and Vancouver. I'm glad I left as I got a large pay raise and didn't have to move to Toronto; but I wouldn't say it was random, just based on metrics unrelated to the individual's contribution. reply lazyasciiart 7 hours agorootparent> but I wouldn't say it was random, just based on metrics unrelated to the individual's contribution. You're right, it could have been based on the number of letters in their name, or the last digit on the clock when their name came up for a decision. It could have been every employee who hit a certain ratio of salary/years of experience. For the purposes of many employees being laid off, it was completely random. We had a lot of farewell drinks in Seattle, but the offices there aren't going anywhere. reply jbm 3 hours agorootparentI can see how it could be seen as random after reading that. It certainly wasn't a \"fair\" layoff in that there was literally nothing an employee could do to keep their current job from a performance standpoint. Incidentally, did they do the \"2 months to find a new job\" thing for you too? I remember the whole process of looking for internal jobs to have been a bit chaotic and not very well planned at all. In retrospect, it made more sense to not apply anywhere, and just take it as a vacation, since they didn't pay out my vacation days. (I wonder if that wound up as an extra boat for someone) -edit- I have absolutely no idea why your post is being downvoted, and I have started seeing this random downvoting everywhere. reply Rustwerks 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is a legal thing. If you do a layoff it's for business reasons and you can avoid all of the PIP and such. But if you do it that way you can't select based upon performance. reply hinkley 16 hours agorootparentIsn’t this why some people are so into performative work? In a layoff the people they suspect might be underperforming go onto the list. They keep the people who look good on paper, the ones who play the game. Not the “untapped” people the author is talking about. reply rixthefox 15 hours agorootparentThat's exactly it. The untapped people are actually getting bunched into the \"underperforming\" category because in the eyes of the beancounter they are not meeting some benign performance metric that the company wants to see. Say I'm a phone support company. I have a script I want my employees to follow and the average support time per phone call should be anywhere between 15-30 minutes. Sally Sue is on the phone for the full 8 hours and handles 16 calls a day. Billy Brass is on the phone for 4 hours of the day but handles double the amount of calls a day. To the bean counters Billy is underperforming because he only spends 4 hours time on the phone and the company only makes money for the amount of time they can keep people on the phone. In this example it doesn't matter that Billy is an all-star because he completed more calls, he's underperforming because he's not following the script that should keep people on the phone for as long as possible. The point is that Billy will feel resentful because even though he's able to help more people in less time he's getting penalized so Billy has less incentive to go above and beyond and in fact needs to degrade his workflow to fit someone else's metrics. So Billy becomes \"untapped\" because the company has restricted his autonomy. He \"CAN\" do more but that's not what the company wants from him so he will choose not to do it even if it's to the benefit of the company. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentprevI wrote a comment on some other thread but there's just a lot of wrong place/wrong time at an individual level. If a company is doing a substantial layoff there just isn't the time, energy, or resources to train and fit people who may be generically \"better\" at some level into roles that already have people presumably doing adequate jobs filling them. People are not fungible. Someone can be in a role where they're really valuable. But the company evolves and roles evolve and the needs are different. Sure, they might be able to excel in a new role eventually--but maybe it's not optimal to try to make them fit especially at a senior level. reply mulmen 12 hours agorootparentOk then why do we still have recruiters and HR? If their job is impossible why do we pay them to pretend otherwise? If people aren’t fungible why do we force them into fungible roles? If the reality is that people are fungible and leadership is just out of touch and made bad decisions then they’re the ones that should be canned. Hiring people is expensive. Firing people is expensive. Reorganizing people requires competent leadership. reply ghaff 10 hours agorootparentYou're cutting a division. You're cutting a project. Yeah, if you were hiring into a new position, you might hire some of the people you're cutting. But you probably aren't. So, yeah, you might try to retain some specific people but you mostly aren't interested in doing a large-scal rewizzle which will probably disrupt things even more than the layoff is already going to do. reply mulmen 5 hours agorootparentThen why hire at all? If it’s all a project or disposable division just hire temps and contractors. reply giantg2 8 hours agorootparentprev\"Ok then why do we still have recruiters and HR? If their job is impossible why do we pay them to pretend otherwise?\" The same reason many devs exist - people convinced them it's better or more convenient to have an expert. The number of systems that could be an excel sheet... reply 8ytecoder 15 hours agorootparentprevThat's how I see it as well. In a layoff, the role is being eliminated as opposed to a person being fired. So they cut entire teams working on \"unprofitable\" products or certain roles deemed \"redundant\" within the product. You typically have the option to take a severance or apply for another role internally. This is my understanding based purely on my experience getting laid off once - so take it with a huge grain of salt. The product I was working on was shutdown. I got paid a retainer to stay until the product can be properly wound down. Then got hired into a different role in a different team with a pay bump within a month. I got to keep the retainer as well - as long as I support the wind down efforts. reply godelski 16 hours agorootparentprevThe part I'm confused at is it doesn't seem that they are doomed, and end up being very successful companies. But I think this is likely due to lack of competition. I recently did an internship at one of these big companies, doing ML. I'm a researcher but had a production role. Coming in everything was really weird to me from how they setup their machines to training and evaluation. I brought up that the way they were measuring their performance was wrong and could tell they overfit their data. They didn't believe me. But then it came to be affecting my role. So I fixed it, showed them, and then they were like \"oh thanks, but we're moving on to transformers now.\" Main part of what I did is actually make their model robust and actually work on their customer data! (I constantly hear that \"industry is better because we have customers so it has to work\" but I'm waiting to see things work like promised...) Of course, their transformer model took way more to train and had all the same problems, but were hidden a few levels deeper due to them dramatically scaling data and model size. I knew the ML research community had been overly focused on benchmarks but didn't realize how much worse it was in production environments. It just seems that metric hacking is the explicitly stated goal here. But I can't trust anyone to make ML models that themselves are metric hackers. The part that got me though is that I've always been told by industry people that if I added value to the company and made products better that the work (and thus I) would be valued. I did in an uncontestable manner, and I did not in an uncontestable way. I just thought we could make cool products AND make money at the same time. Didn't realize there was far more weight to the latter than the former. I know, I'm naive. reply riskable 16 hours agorootparent> due to lack of competition. So let's compete! What are they selling?

Honestly, I have no idea how to get initial capital. Yeah, I know what site we're on lol. But I'm not from a top university and honestly I'd like to focus on actual AGI not this LLM stuff (LLMs are great, but lol they won't scale to AGI).

In fact, I believe I even stated that on HN if not joked about it in person. I happily shit on plenty of papers too, and do so here) I think what a lot of people don't understand is that there's criticism and dismissing.

That said, I think it does better than a co-op. This fits the saying \"the opposite of stupid is not smart\". Standard corporations [frequently] used to serve only owners have a problematic incentive structure for everyone else. A co-op that serves only employees has a different bad incentive structure. Of course there are instances of improvements over the base incentive. The FairShares Commons attempts to be explicit about the balance between the stakeholders of the corporation.

Aggressive FIRE makes a ton of sense for the few people that know early what they want out of life. If you want to spend your life surfing by all means, work the system to the hilt (leetcode, job hopping, etc.) and retire by 30. But a lot of people that go down that road get to 30 and find that they have no clue what makes them happy to begin with. Fairy tales for upper middle class young adults notwithstanding, travel doesn’t magically impart this or any other wisdom either. reply robocat 12 hours agorootparentprevTrue wealth has a lot of non-financial measures. Non-financial goals are way way harder to achieve than FIRE: the biggest issue is selecting your non-financial goals. Money is a simple goal and it isn't impossible to achieve - then what? Deciding that money should be your primary focus overoptimises for financial wealth against non-financial wealth. For example, life satisfaction: do you know people doing jobs they love? People that would continue their calling even if it didn't pay them? Try to understand their wealth even if they don't have the financial freedom a successful business can give you. The main problem is most of those jobs are not in businesses and it is hard to understand things we haven't experienced. Jobs are a very poor example but you get the idea. I've retired early: for me personally, financial wealth is not enough. One limited resource that we are approximately all given the same amount of is time - you get fifty years between 20 and 70 to use the best you can. I think most people don't use their limited resource very well (even those that optimise their time well seem to use it poorly on bad meta-goals). reply 7789123 9 hours agorootparent>One limited resource that we are approximately all given the same amount of is time True, but I believe also its important to factor in that those in lower socioeconomic classes effectively have their time stolen from them in many ways. ex: I don't enjoy fixing the vast majority of things I have to fix, (although there can be a sense of satisfaction in it sometimes), but I have to 1st learn to do so and then do it because I absolutely need it fixed, but don't have the funds to pay to have it done. To compound the loss of time, financially wealthy people can afford to buy new things, like automobiles, which dont break down or require nearly as much maintenance. Many other things are also outsourced by people because their time is too valuable to do otherwise this outsourcing is just not an option for others. reply toomuchtodo 13 hours agorootparentprevMy path to discovering this was costly and fraught with suffering.

You cannot with any certainty tell what a work environment is like in the interview stage. You can job hop a half dozen times until you find a good fit.

I have a friend who can only bear to work at places that provide meaningful work and aren't toxic environments.

On the flip side when he finds something he likes he works 60+ weeks and never less than everything he can to the job. He burns bright and generally leaves after two years, repeating the process.

Does it describe what their services are in service to? - How many non-technical, non-domain experts will I speak with before I'm talking engineer to engineer? - How jazzed are the interviewers about speaking with me, in the moment? Are they interested in the details of earlier projects? Are they curious about me, or just running down a list of questions? - Do they use leetcode or similar? There are a lot of really good reasons for a company to use leetcode in their hiring process, but none of those reasons are particularly good for me, as an employee. - Do their interview questions make sense, given their context? E.g are they quizzing me on recursion from an environment where recursion wouldn't be a particularly great idea? reply Seb-C 8 hours agorootparentprevBy that definition, nothing is a choice because nothing is 100% certain in life.

Do you think that during the interview stage, an employer can characterize the work environment as different than it is in reality? If you say yes to both of these, then I don't understand the disconnect. Maybe I can summarize another way: - It's not possible to really know what a work environment is like until you actually start working there. To deny this is to deny that other people at the company play a role in the work environment. Since you don't have control over other people, you don't have control over the work environment. - Therefore, characterizing a decision to accept employment at a particular employer, as evidence of one's own superior ability to predict what the work environment is like is... misguided? Job hopping until you find a work environment that fits is a good idea. But this is trial and error. It's not the result of a superior ability to sniff out work cultures before accepting employment. My last question is: how did this line of reasoning offend you so deeply to suggest that I'm projecting insecurity? reply beeboobaa3 12 hours agorootparentDo you think you can't choose a different place of employment after saying \"yes\" to one?

In reality, the biggest source of untapped potential, at least anecdotally as an engineer, is that corporations tend to give grease to squeaky wheels. So, the upper quadrants in the article. If you have even a few years of industry experience, modulo being intentionally naive, you've noticed that work begets work. The 'skilled pragmatists' quietly do their jobs well. Their reward is even more work to do, without much recognition. It's analogous to software quality. It's fleetingly rare that a consumer of software writes in to let you know how great, zippy and bug-free it is. You only ever hear about how terrible things are. When things are 'good' -- that's just the expected status quo. So no reward for steadily doing good things. I'm also sure after a few years in industry you've also noticed that the Do-Nothing (TM) guy who sprints around with their head on fire gets managerial recognition, promotions, bonuses. You know the kind. They wander from meeting to meeting, initiative to initiative, never actually accomplishing anything concrete, but showing their face to management and saying a lot of nice words. Eventually, the skilled pragmatist notices this dichotomy and mentally clocks out.

In practice, this resulted in me being effectively invisible to management, even when I was out-performing everyone else on the team. The guys who were loud and boisterous and constantly cawing about their achievements got all the raises and promotions, even though I was consistently doing more and better work. This came to a head when someone with far less seniority was promoted over me. I brought it up with my boss who said something like \"I don't even know what you do all day. I never hear from you.\" The guy who was promoted would literally spend twice as much time boasting about what he was doing that actually doing it. I was objectively more productive, as in, there were metrics showing my productivity was significantly higher, but since I wasn't talking about what I was doing, I was unseen. reply nickff 10 hours agoparentI obviously don't know enough about your particular situation to be an informed judge, but... it really sounds like the management team is operating in a reactive mode, rather than a proactive one, and as a result, they don't understand what's really going on inside the company.

Or, is it that the business has a right/obligation to extract more? The latter is offensive, fundamentally because “value” may be arbitrarily (perhaps capriciously) determined.

I probably wouldn't if they'd written \"Some people are underused by their companies because they're Marias,\" which is a much smaller claim but still a perfectly fine basis for moving on to a discussion of how to get more value from those employees. > Feels like you found a small inaccuracy in the text, and jumped up \"Aha!

There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.\" So according to him, most people seem to fall into the bucket of being lazy and stupid, which is closer to reality. \"Skilled pragmatists\" seem to map into what he terms \"clever and lazy\". reply hinkley 17 hours agoprevI don’t think I can agree that 75% of the workforce falls into one quadrant. Particularly this one. If I’m very lucky the semi space contains 60% of my coworkers, if I’m unlucky (or arrive after the writing is on the wall) it’s more like 1/3. I suspect part of the confusion is that there are some people with enough political acumen to appear like frustrated agents of change without actually having the drive or skill to do so. If you create opportunities for these people to show up, you may be shocked to find them making excuses for why they still can’t. And truthfully the industry is not full of untapped brilliant people.

But you're suddenly substituting the word \"brilliant\" for \"pragmatic\" and that's kinda questionable. It might be that you define brilliant differently than some others, so that IQ is much less significant than pragmatism itself in your equation of brilliance; but if you think IQ -> pragmatic, I disagree. I think they're orthogonal. reply hinkley 16 hours agorootparentYeah that might have been a poor word choice or projection on my part. As I replied elsewhere, I feel I am in this quadrant and I often actively look for sympathetic people among bosses and peers to talk to about it.

And one time I got a very rude awakening when I discovered several of those people were all sizzle and no sausage. reply kerblang 15 hours agorootparentOkay, good. As authentic \"pragmatism\" goes, the author conveys a sense of cynical pragmatist-in-waiting rather than activist pragmatist-in-action; I would do the pragmatic thing, and yes, I'm smart enough, but not if there's risk. So, you're surrounded by invisible pragmatists, but these are the kind of pragmatists who sometimes burn you for profit outright, but mostly just look the other way while someone else does it - if that's where the money is.

The more a manager understands the work, on a micro level, the more they'll be able to judge it accurately.

And it doesn't mean you can't delegate: as long as you have intimate understanding of the details, you're free to delegate and be as hands-off as you want.

I will invent work, especially if I'm experiencing paper-cuts: e.g. I spend a stupid amount of time improving CI speed. It's thankless and invisible, but makes the mundane more bearable (nothing is worse than trying to push mundane work through flaky CI).

Barry is one acquisition away from becoming Maria. reply dkarl 17 hours agoprevI strongly buy the premise of this article, and it goes beyond people who try to fly under the radar and blend in because of toxic politics. Even in companies without toxic politics, a lot of managers subconsciously overestimate the abilities of engineers who regularly propose ambitious, complex solutions, and underestimate the abilities of engineers who are more leery of complexity. This not only leads to unnecessary boondoggle projects, it also results in managers not assigning challenging work to engineers who are quite capable of doing it, which is the waste the article describes. I was fortunate early in my career to have managers who had strong technical judgment themselves and rewarded it in their engineers, managers who spent their innovation tokens but spent them very carefully, so later in my career I was able to recognize when I had managers who relied on crude heuristics like assuming the engineers who proposed the most complex projects had the best judgment and the best ability to execute. One simple hack I use all the time, regardless of my manager's personality, is to say, \"It would be fun.\" As in, \"It would be fun to handle this with an event-driven system using Kafka. We could build an incredibly scalable and resilient system that way. I'd love to tackle a project like that, but I don't think we can justify it, because it would take more time and more engineers to build and be more expensive to operate, and I think our existing system only needs a few tweaks to what we need, even if we execute on our entire product roadmap and exceed our sales goals. I think we should take a careful look at tweaking the existing system, and if that won't get us what we need, we might have to build the more expensive solution.\" This lets me advertise my awareness of a fancier architectural solution, as well as my ability and willingness to execute on it, without actually saying that it's a good idea. reply jabroni_salad 17 hours agoprevTo me, pragmatism is set of knives by which I decide what to leave on the cutting room floor. The biggest one I have is that there are only so many hours in a day but more issues on the board than can fit into it. The second one is that my time billable, and anything that doesnt count towards my utilization is de facto not valued by the company. The overrunning theme seems to be 'how do we get more from a pragmatist' but my response is you can look at my todo list and rearrange it whenever you want. I am happy with my work, the metrics are on target, the feedback I get from clients is great and they ask for me on their future projects. Only one person is unahppy and its the guy who squints at spreadsheets all day. I think he is the one who is wrong. reply frank_nitti 9 hours agoparentThis took me a while to appreciate, but it tracks perfectly with what I’ve observed from veteran ICs who actually seem content with their careers. Fresh out of school it was almost frustrating to have a senior colleague say “hold off on that” in response to my attempts to go above and beyond (on items not specified or prioritized by leadership). I wanted to build great systems and was constantly looking for challenges that would align with the team/customer outcomes, so why wouldn’t they just let me “flourish” and show the team how much value I can deliver?! After going remote, with nobody to physically see me donating my time and energy to an unworthy cause, did I get to finally learn this the hard way. Bailing out incompetent leaders and weaker engineers to get deliverables across the finish line, which they were happy to claim as personal achievements, and to forget the many late nights they pleaded for help to salvage another unholy mess they had created while flying completely blind in the modern tech world. I’ll need to keep some sound bites from your comment close to the heart, as I work to set better boundaries and use that extra energy toward outcomes that are even 5% worth the effort. reply klabb3 17 hours agoprevInsanely spot on, for once (most of organizational analyses are not). Another fun thing pointed out in the article is the obsession over weeding out poor performers, ie the lazy ones. My theory is that it’s done solely to scare everyone else to work harder, whatever that means exactly. It’s about creating a culture of constant busyness which is only really a good proxy for work in domains that don’t require long term thinking. For engineers, it’s detrimental. If you wanna go after the ones who are contributing the least value, why obsess over the lazy? There are sooo many examples of people who added huge negative value, from the rockstars who create an unmaintainable mess to some product manager that re-steers the ship and changes something that was completely fine the way it was. Especially when they leave the mess behind which opportunists often do. Dead weight is nothing compared to the whales that swim towards the bottom and drag the rest of them down. reply hiAndrewQuinn 16 hours agoprevI'm more interested in figuring out what kind of knowledge base most reliably turns a junior dev into a \"skilled pragmatist\".

This can be either bash/Unix or PowerShell/Windows, depending on your career goals, although having gotten reasonably good with both sets I'd recommend the former.

Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent — he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.\" Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord This is an interesting quote from a WWII General.

Sometimes I crank out tons of extra work that helps various people by the simple virtue that its interesting to me. So I think this is hitting a chord with me somewhere. I find myself in management these days, and the people I manage are all great and talented and as far as I can tell no one is upset with my laissez-faire management style. But I'm always wanting to find how to make the job more interesting for them. The roadmap can often be kind of boring work.

Thanks for mentioning it, I missed the link to part 2. I don't think I can see the connection between the two parts though. Part 1 places people on two axis \"cares\" and \"conflicts\", with the largest number high on \"cares\" and low on \"conflict\". It seemed high on \"cares\" is desirable, and that getting more people to voice their oppinions (higher on \"conflict\") would be an improvement. Part 2 puts people on a single axis of how likely they are going to embed clean-up changes in their PRs. This is unlikely to be the \"conflict\" axis from part 1. If it is the \"cares\" axis, 75% would already show the desired behavior, with not much untapped potential remaining. Part 2 then continues by asking people about their oppinions. With most people on the lower half of the part 1 \"conflict\" axis it is surprising that everyone does even have an oppinion. I'll place myself high on the \"conflict\" axis with this: Clean-up should not be hidden in other PRs. It increases time needed for review and risk for collisions. It also increases the effort required for an analysis of the history in a distant future. Separate PRs for clean-up. reply AndyNemmity 4 hours agoprevThis might accurately describe me, although I am very challenged in what I do.

And other people see this, respond with, “I don’t want that,” and put up boundaries like you see discussed here. Orgs love to say they like results, and they do — to a certain extent. There’s a ceiling on it that isn’t there if you are coded by other people as One Of Us. This is wholly different from being a yes-man, of course. It can’t be too obvious you’re playing this game or people don’t like it…probably because it reminds some people of the gamble they’re making there. I’ll wager that some people are honest enough to say, “well how else should we treat loyalty?” And others would say, “well that’s what they chose for their life, so they should be rewarded.” Both answers really just serve to entrench no-life-ism, though. IMO, hovering on the border of engagement/disengagement is not a problem. People tend to oscillate back and forth there naturally. Work is fundamentally a transactional relationship that can sometimes confer meaning, intellectual stimulation, social connections, and structure. And sometimes it fails at some or all of those. Expecting it to always provide those things is delusional. Keeping the transactional nature in mind without being a jerk keeps expectations grounded. We should be far more suspicious of those who are constantly parading their love of work on social media. reply JohnMakin 17 hours agoprevI'd categorize myself as a \"Barry\" - which he seems to define in part II of this blog post as someone who is willing to take great personal and career risks to rock the boat, and will even risk getting fired to get their job done - it has usually cost me a lot in whatever organization I end up in.

To use an aviation analogy, you’re proposing replacing randomly spot checking of assemblies for properly tightened bolts, etc., with the legal shell game that Boeing currently uses.

The company pays extremely well but does not provide any sort of \"legal ownership\" as you describe. Still, I felt massive ownership of stuff I've .. well .. \"owned\" and I benefited financially and emotionally from it. I am no longer at the company but I have pride in what I've built there and the fact that it still exists and generates tremendous value. On the financial side of things, people (leadership) think of certain people as owning/driving certain things, because we do. So even though I am not the legal owner of platform X, you go get to have some good reviews for having created and nurtured that thing which is now creating goodness. After I left the company, my wife and I were in the south of Argentina on an ice trek. Started talking to a fellow trekker, who turns out what in finance. I told him that I used to be in finance and had built systems X and Y - and he was like \"you're the guy?! I use those things every day, they are game changing in our industry.\" That felt very good. Don't get me wrong, I would love to have a chunk of equity in that company but it doesn't matter - I am still very happy in how \"ownership mentality\" worked out in terms of $ and pride.

    "originBody": "How Nestlé gets children hooked on sugar in lower-income countries Laurent Gaberell, Manuel Abebe, Patti Rundall · April 2024 Deutsch · Français · Español · Português Photo: © Anne-Laure Lechat Nestlé’s leading baby-food brands, promoted in low- and middle-income countries as healthy and key to supporting young children’s development, contain high levels of added sugar. In Switzerland, where Nestlé is headquartered, such products are sold with no added sugar. These are the main findings of a new investigation by Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), which shed light on Nestlé’s hypocrisy and the deceptive marketing strategies deployed by the Swiss food giant. Meagan Adonis was 23 when she became blind as a result of a serious health condition. That same year she found out that she was pregnant, and was worried about the challenges of being a blind mum. She has now found her motherhood feet, and recently gave birth to a second child. Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the “blind goddess” – as she calls herself – now documents her life for more than 125,000 followers on social media and chronicles her daily routine with her new baby. Last year, Meagan posted several videos on TikTok promoting Cerelac infant cereals for babies from six months of age. “As you can see, I have a very active baby”, she explains in a video in December. “As a blind mum, feeding time is always an adventure! […] Now let’s go and prepare his favourite meal of the day. Little bodies need big support with Nestlé Cerelac being the perfect addition to our mealtime,” she assures her audience in a cheerful tone – while omitting to mention that this maternal counsel comes as part of a paid partnership with Nestlé. Thousands of kilometres away, in Guatemala, a father films his energetic little daughter. “There’s no greater satisfaction than seeing a strong, healthy child”, says Billy Saavedra, a reggaeton artist better known as Billy the Diamond. “That’s why we prefer Nido 1+, which supports the development of her bones and muscles, as well as her immune system”, he adds in a video promoting the brand’s formulas for young children in March on his Instagram account, which has more than 550,000 followers. The use of influencers, such as Meagan or Billy (and their children), is at the core of Nestlé’s marketing strategy to boost sales of its baby foods. This approach, which has become increasingly important in many sectors, allows companies to reach a broad audience, building on a sense of identification and relatability. Coming from parents with similar experiences, advertising messages are regarded as benevolent advice that can be trusted. A growing market Fifty years after the “baby killers” infant formula scandal, Nestlé claims to have learned from the past and proclaims its “unwavering commitment” to the “responsible marketing” of breast-milk substitutes. Cover of the “The baby killer” brochure © War on Want / Mike Muller The food giant is doing everything it can to present itself as the world leader in infant nutrition, meticulously targeting each stage in a child’s first years of life. It currently controls 20 percent of the baby-food market, valued at nearly $70 billion. Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestlé’s best-selling baby-food brands in low- and middle-income countries. According to exclusive data obtained from Euromonitor, a market analysis firm specializing in the food industry, their sales value in this category was greater than $2.5 billion in 2022. In its own communications or via third parties, Nestlé promotes Cerelac and Nido as brands whose aim is to help children “live healthier lives”. Fortified with vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, these products are, according to the multinational, tailored to the needs of babies and young children and help to strengthen their growth, immune system and cognitive development. But do these infant cereals and powdered milks really offer “the best nutrition,” as Nestlé claims? That’s what Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) wanted to find out, by focusing on one of the key public enemies when it comes to nutrition: sugar. An unjustifiable double standard © Trevor Patt (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 DEED) Spoiler alert: Our investigation shows that, for Nestlé, not all babies are equal when it comes to added sugar. While in Switzerland, where the company is headquartered, the main infant cereals and formula brands sold by the multinational come without added sugar, most Cerelac and Nido products marketed in lower-income countries do contain added sugar, often at high levels. For example, in Switzerland, Nestlé promotes its biscuit-flavoured cereals for babies aged from six months with the claim “no added sugar”, while in Senegal and South Africa, Cerelac cereals with the same flavour contain 6 grams of added sugar per serving. In Switzerland, Nestlé’s biscuit-flavoured baby cereal contains no added sugar. In South Africa and Senegal, Cerelac products of the same flavour contain more than one cube of sugar per serving. © Anne-Laure Lechat Similarly, in Germany, France and the UK – Nestlé’s main European markets – all formulas for young children aged 12-36 months sold by the company contain no added sugar. And while some infant cereals for young children over one year old contain added sugar, cereals for babies aged six months do not. Cerelac wheat-based cereals for six-month-old babies sold by Nestlé in Germany and the UK has no added sugar, while the same product contains over 5 grams per serving in Ethiopia and 6 grams in Thailand. “There is a double standard here that can’t be justified,” said Nigel Rollins, scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), when presented with our findings. For Rollins, the fact that Nestlé does not add sugar to these products in Switzerland but is quite happy to do it in lower resources settings “is problematic both from a public health and ethical perspective.” Rollins says that manufacturers may try to get children accustomed to a certain level of sugar at a very early age, so that they prefer products high in sugar. “This is totally inappropriate,” he believes. Cerelac baby cereals wheat are sold with no added sugar in Germany and the UK. In lower income countries, but the same product comes with high levels of added sugar. © Anne-Laure Lechat On the trail of hidden sugar The amount of added sugar is often not even disclosed in the nutritional information available on the packaging of these kinds of products. In most countries, including Switzerland and across Europe, companies are only required to indicate the amount of total sugars, which also includes those naturally present in milk or whole fruit, and are not considered harmful to health. While Nestlé prominently highlights the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients contained in its products using idealizing imagery, it’s not transparent when it comes to added sugar. To uncover these “hidden sugars,” we obtained Cerelac and Nido products from a number of countries to examine their labels and, in some cases, have them analyzed by a specialized laboratory. In Brazil, one of the main markets, Cerelac baby cereals are sold under the brand name “Mucilon”. The added sugar content is not declared. © Anne-Laure Lechat This turned out to be more complicated than expected. Several laboratories approached in Switzerland refused to conduct the sugar analysis of Nestlé products. One lab even wrote that it could not take part in the project because the results “could potentially have a negative impact” on its existing customers. Stonewalled, we decided to approach a lab based in Belgium. The results are edifying. One sugar cube per portion Cerelac is the world’s number one baby cereal brand, with sales exceeding $1 billion in 2022, according to Euromonitor. We examined 115 products sold in Nestlé’s main markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America. No less than 108 of them (94 percent) contained added sugar. For 67 of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar. On average, our analysis found almost 4 grams per serving, or about one sugar cube. The highest amount – 7.3 grams per serving – was detected in a product sold in the Philippines and targeted at six-month-old babies. In India, where sales surpassed $250 million in 2022, all Cerelac baby cereals contain added sugar, on average nearly 3 grams per serving. The same situation prevails in South Africa, the main market on the African continent, where all Cerelac baby cereals contain four grams or more of added sugar per serving. In Brazil, the world’s second-largest market, with sales of around $150 million in 2022, three-quarters of Cerelac baby cereals (known as Mucilon in the country) contain added sugar, on average 3 grams per serving. This product, sold in the Philippines and intended for six-month-old babies, contains almost two cubes of sugar per serving. © Anne-Laure Lechat “This is a big concern,” comments Rodrigo Vianna, epidemiologist and Professor at the Department of Nutrition of the Federal University of Paraíba in Brazil. “Sugar should not be added to foods offered to babies and young children because it is unnecessary and highly addictive. Children get used to the sweet taste and start looking for more sugary foods, starting a negative cycle that increases the risk of nutrition-based disorders in adult life. These include obesity and other chronic non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes or high blood-pressure,” laments the expert. “A form of colonization” Although less pronounced, this trend is confirmed with the Nido brand, the most popular on the growing-up milks market. In 2022, global sales of Nido products for young children aged one to three had exceeded $1 billion according to Euromonitor. We examined 29 of these products sold by Nestlé in some of the main markets in low- and middle-income countries. The result: 21 of them (72 percent) contain added sugar. For ten of these products, we were able to determine the amount of added sugar. On average, our analysis found almost two grams per serving. The maximum value – 5.3 grams per serving – was detected in a product sold in Panama. Here are some of the Nido products examined in this investigation. On average, they contain almost 2 grams of added sugar per serving. © Anne-Laure Lechat With sales at around $400 million in 2022, Indonesia is the world’s leading market for Nido, known locally as Dancow. The two products for children aged one and over sold in the country contain added sugar – more than 0.7 grams per serving. While the multinational is quick to highlight that these products are “without added sucrose,” they do contain added sugar in the form of honey. However, honey and sucrose are both considered by the WHO as sugars that should not be added to baby food. Indeed, Nestlé itself explains it very well in an educational quiz on Nido’s website in South-Africa: replacing sucrose with honey has “no scientific health benefit”, as both can contribute “to weight gain and possibly obesity”. In Brazil, the world’s second-largest market for Nido, Nestlé claims not to add sugar to its products out of concern for children’s health and diet: “It’s ideal to avoid consuming these ingredients in childhood, as the sweet flavour can influence a child’s preference for this type of food in the future,” warns the food giant on the brand’s website in Brazil. A shop covered with Nido products in Managua (Nicaragua). © Laurent Gaberell However, in most Central American countries, where Nestlé aggressively promotes Nido using influencers, the formulas for children aged one year and above contain over a sugar cube per serving. In Nigeria, Senegal, Bangladesh and South Africa – where Nido is very popular – all products for young children aged one to three contain added sugar. “I do not understand why products for sale in South Africa should be different from those that are sold in high-income settings,” states Karen Hofman, Professor of Public Health at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and a qualified paediatrician. “It is a form of colonization and should not be tolerated,” she adds. “There is no valid reason to add sugar to baby food anywhere,” Hofman insists. The first two years of life This view is shared by the WHO, which has warned for several years now about the high added-sugar content in baby-food products. “This study stresses the need for urgent action to reshape the food environment for children,” Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, told Public Eye and IBFAN. “Eliminating added sugars from food products for young children would be an important way to implement early prevention of obesity.” The WHO is alarmed that obesity is dramatically on the rise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it has now reached “epidemic proportions” and is fuelling an increase of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Increased consumption of ultra-processed foods, often high in sugar, is singled out as one of the main causes of this epidemic. Youngest children are not immune to this scourge: childhood obesity has increased tenfold over the past four decades, according to the UN agency. It’s estimated that 39 million children under the age of 5 are overweight or obese, the vast majority of which live in low- and middle-income countries. “The first two years of a child’s life are particularly important, as optimal nutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and fosters better development overall,” explains the WHO. In 2022, the UN agency called for a ban on added sugars and sweeteners in food products for babies and children under the age of three, and urged industry to “be proactive” and “support public health goals” by reformulating its baby food products. But Nestlé seems to be turning a deaf ear to these appeals. While the multinational publicly recommends avoiding baby foods containing added sugar, these wise words don’t seem to apply to low- and middle-income countries, where Nestlé continues to add high levels of sugar to some of its most popular products. Nestlé did not respond to specific questions about this double standard. But the company told Public Eye and IBFAN that it “has reduced by 11% the total amount of added sugars in [its] infant cereal portfolio worldwide” over the past decade and that it will “further reduce the level of added sugars without compromising on quality, safety and taste”. Nestlé also indicated that it is phasing out sucrose and glucose syrup of its Nido “growing up milks” globally. The company added that its products “fully comply” with the Codex Alimentarius and local laws. Weak regulation These baby-food products with added sugar are permitted under national legislation despite the fact that they go against WHO guidelines. National legislation is often based on the Codex Alimentarius, a collection of international standards developed by an intergovernmental commission based in Rome. The stated aim is to protect consumers’ health and ensure fair practices in the food trade. These standards, which gained importance as reference points for trade disputes following the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in 1995, tolerate added sugar in baby foods up to certain limits specific for each type of product – up to 20 percent in infant cereals. Codex Alimentarius Commission meeting in Rome. © FAO / Alessandra Benedetti Codex standards for baby foods have been strongly criticized by the WHO, which deems them “inadequate”, particularly concerning sugar, as children establish their food preferences early in life. The agency has called for the standards to be updated and brought into line with WHO guidelines, with a particular focus on banning the addition of sugars. Current Codex standards are insufficient to determine whether a food is appropriate for promotion for infants and young children, according to the UN agency. “WHO recommendations are independent of all industry influence,” Nigel Rollins told Public Eye and IBFAN. “At Codex, you have substantive lobbying: the sugar industry, the baby-food industry, and others are all present in the rooms where the decisions are taken.” Although the Codex Commission is an intergovernmental body, industry representatives may participate as observers, or even as members of national delegations. At a recent review of the standard for follow-up formula, industry lobbyists accounted for over 40 percent of participants. For Rollins, this is the main reason why Codex standards – and by extension national laws – are less protective than WHO guidelines. Controversial marketing practices Our investigation shows that Nestlé uses aggressive marketing methods to promote Nido and Cerelac in low- and middle-income countries, despite the WHO’s International Code which prohibits the commercial promotion of such products. The Code, originally adopted in 1981 in the wake of the “baby killers” scandal, and clarified and strengthened by later Resolutions, bans all promotion of infant formula in order to protect breastfeeding. The ban also applies to formulas for young children and baby foods that, like Cerelac, do not meet nutrition guidelines and contain “high levels of sugar”. Nestlé responds that it “complies with the WHO Code and subsequent WHA resolutions as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world.” “Where local law is less stringent than our Policy for implementing the Code, we adhere to our strict Policy,” Nestlé adds. In practice, while 70% of countries have adopted laws based on the Code, many contain loopholes and implementation is generally weak in low- and middle-income countries, often as a result of pressures from the baby-food industry and exporting countries. Furthermore, the Nestlé policy neither applies to formulas for children aged one year or more, nor to other baby foods, although these are all covered by the Code. What’s more, Nestlé promotes its Nido and Cerelac products as healthy and essential for children’s development, although they contain added sugar and carry many risks for children’s health and development. “Often manufacturers’ health claims are not supported by the science,” says Rollins, in response to reading our report. “If you have a pharmaceutical product for which you want to claim that it improves brain development in babies, or improve growth in babies, you would have to pass very high standards of evidence,” he explains. “But because it’s a food, you don’t have to pass those standards.” In Central and West Africa, Nestlé is active on Facebook with a page called “Nido Mums”. Nutrition and health claims “idealize the product, imply that it is better than family foods, and mask the risks,” the WHO explained in a recent report that warns of baby-food marketing practices that compromise the progress made in infant and young-child nutrition. They mislead consumers as to the real content of these foods and should not be made, according to the UN agency. Yet Nestlé has made them a core pillar of its marketing strategy. “Grow smart” “Grow smart”. Huge billboards in the centre of Jakarta and other main Indonesian cities display the slogan. It’s at the heart of Nestlé’s campaign to promote its Nido brand, known in the country as Dancow, as the “parents’ partner for children’s growth and development”. “Inspired by mum’s love for baby nutrition, Dancow is the healthiest choice”, claims Nestlé, while failing to disclose that its product contains added sugar. “Grow smart”. Advertising for Nido (Dancow) products in central Jakarta. Both products targeted at young children from one year contain added sugar © Ibfan Last year, Nestlé launched a campaign aimed at “supporting the potential of children of 1 year and above in Indonesia”. The campaign managed to engage 2 million mothers in sharing “exciting moments” with their children on social media, effectively turning them into unpaid advertisers and brand ambassadors. “Thank you @dancow for accompanying my child’s growth and development,” writes one of the mothers. Nestlé deploys the same, finely honed strategy in Brazil to promote its Cerelac (Mucilon) infant cereal brand. Its campaign is based on the concept of “nutrition enriched by Mucilon and chosen by mothers,” muses Dani Ribeiro, director of the advertising agency in charge. It plays on parents’ love for their babies, and highlights “the benefits of nutrients that contribute to babies’ immunity and brain development,” she explains. “Parents are nourished by the fact that they are making the right choice for their children,” Ribeiro adds. In Brazil, Nestlé promotes Cerelac (Mucilon) baby cereals as being rich in nutrients which contribute to children's immunity and cerebral development. In South Africa, Nestlé promotes Cerelac as a source of 12 essential vitamins and minerals under the theme “little bodies need big support”. “For over 150 years, generations of parents have trusted Nestlé Cerelac to provide just what their baby needs,” trumpets the multinational. Yet all Cerelac products sold in this country, which is facing a veritable obesity epidemic, contain high levels of added sugar. For over 150 years, generations of parents have trusted NESTLÉ® CERELAC® to provide just what their baby needs. #LittleBodiesNeedBigSupport. In South Africa, Nestlé is promoting Cerelac baby cereals under the theme \"little bodies need big support\". All products contain a minimum of one cube of added sugar per serving. Chris Van Tulleken, Professor at the University of London and author of the best-selling book Ultra-Processed People, which explores the pervasiveness and impact of ultra-processed food, is extremely concerned about the marketing strategy used by Nestlé. “These are not healthy products. They are not necessary. They are inferior to real food,” he stated. “These types of products are part of a global nutrition transition to an ultra-processed diet which is associated with weight gain and obesity, but also many other adverse health outcomes.\" An “educational” platform Nestlé pioneered “medical marketing,” involving a set of techniques that have become standard practice in the industry today, says Phillip Baker, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia and author of numerous studies on the subject. The strategy is based on strengthening links with health professionals and obtaining the endorsement of leading scientific authorities, while positioning the company as a partner for parents in the nutrition and development of their children. While the main goal is to increase sales on the baby-food market itself, it plays another key role for Nestlé: developing loyal consumers for life. Baker describes it as a “cradle-to-grave marketing strategy.” “The idea being to get consumers from a very young age, develop that brand loyalty, develop those taste preferences for their products”, he explains. Nestlé has created Baby and Me, an “educational platform” available in over 60 countries, with the stated aim of promoting healthy eating for babies and offering “expert-backed” information. Parents looking for information on infant nutrition may be directed to this platform and be exposed to content that steers them towards Nestlé products. Nestlé has created the “Baby and Me” educational platform, whose stated aim is to promote healthy eating for babies and provide information that is “expert-backed”. But the advertising is never far away. “Parenteam,” the Filipino version of the scheme, offers ovulation and pregnancy calendars as well as a due-date calculator. In South Africa, parents can access a “major moment checklist” to help them “win in every aspect of modern parenting”. Mexico has an allergy calculator and Brazil a guide to finding the perfect name. These websites are packed with advice, tools and recipes designed to attract parents. But ads for Nestlé products and “buy now” buttons are never far away. Experts in white coats Nestlé regularly organizes events on the Nido and Cerelac online channels with health professionals. Although most of the time the experts speak about child-nutrition related issues and do not directly promote the products, the Nido and Cerelac brands feature prominently, leading parents to believe that these products are endorsed by eminent scientific authorities and that Nestlé’s health and nutrition claims have scientific support. Our investigation also uncovered cases of experts in white coats directly promoting Nestlé products. “Nido’s specialized nutrition system is designed to protect every stage of your child’s development,” explains nutritionist Kenia Lawrence in a video posted on Instagram in Panama. “Nido1+ helps protect and strengthen the immune system, thanks to probiotics and prebiotics, and contains key nutrients for child development.” Not a word on the one and a half sugar cubes added to each portion of the product in question. For Baker, it is evident that “by using health professionals, the companies powerfully shape parents’ decision making”. An influence that “can very often be harmful,” he believes. This practice also goes against WHO guidelines, which state that manufacturers must not encourage healthcare professionals to support and recommend their brands and products. In a recent report, the UN agency severely criticized the marketing practices used by the baby-food industry to promote its products online, pointing the finger at the use of various strategies that are often not identifiable as advertising. These include the use of baby-clubs, as well as the use of health professionals and influencers such as Meagan Adonis and Billy Saavedra. The UN agency called on manufacturers to put an end to their “exploitative marketing practices”. Nothing can justify the double standards highlighted by the Public Eye and IBFAN investigation. If Nestlé truly intends to act responsibly, it must follow the recommendations and guidelines of the WHO and stop getting babies and young children hooked on sugar, regardless of the country in which they were born.

I always wondered what a Coke with just half the sugar would taste like. I think I would enjoy it. Well, recently, my grocery store has been stocking De la Calle Tepache. It's not cola, but still, it's a carbonated soft drink with just 8g of sugar in a 12 oz can. It's got less than a quarter of the sugar of Coke and it's still plenty sweet! How many people could have avoided diabetes or other health problems if coca-cola just set the standard that 8g of sugar is enough? reply windowsrookie 15 hours agoparentLooking at the ingredients of \"De la Calle Tepache\" it contains ERYTHRITOL, which is a sugar alcohol/artificial sweetener but does not count as \"sugar\" on the nutrition facts label. This is why it tastes \"plenty sweet\". So similar to Coke Zero/Diet Coke. reply vector_spaces 14 hours agorootparentIt's not correct to say that it's an artificial sweetener -- not all non-caloric sweeteners are artificial, and not all processed additives are synthetic. That is to say, erythritol occurs in the environment in all kinds of settings, where e.g. sucralose is artificial because it needs to be synthesized by humans in a laboratory. To be clear, that is the only sense in which I distinguish artificial/synthetic and natural substances -- those words are heavily loaded now and carry with them all kinds of connotations to the point of not even being particularly useful, but if we're going to use them we should at least be correct! reply jbandela1 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd Erythritol is linked to heart attacks and strokes via enhanced platelet activity. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9 reply WalterBright 15 hours agoparentprevI drank a couple Cokes a day for many, many years. I finally decided to quit. It took a full year before losing desire for Coke. I tried a few sips of it, and it actually tasted bad. Switched to diet Coke, and drank that for a few more years. Then decided that was probably just as bad, and now drink sparkling water. I no longer have any desire to drink sweetened beverages of any sort. Being older, I decided to stop eating all ice cream, cookies, candy bars, pie, etc., about 2 months ago. This is difficult. I've tried that before, and failed. reply WalterBright 15 hours agorootparentI quit consuming protein powder, too. I can't find a brand that is just protein powder, without any sweetener of any sort, even at health nut stores.

You can also buy protein powder directly from dairy farms, which is helpful when there's a shortage/price-spike - I've bought from Dana farms. It's also significantly more fresh and tasteless. Buying from Dana Farms you can either buy it with a small amount of emulsifier to help it dissolve in water or just single-ingredient pure without that. If purity is particularly important to you I'd recommend \"isolate\" over \"concentrate\", it will have even lower amounts of lactose, which can benefit people who are severely lactose-intolerant. reply jerojero 7 hours agorootparentprevYou could use Kefir to make your own whey protein.

Sometimes I feel the urge to have something more than just water, especially in the summer returning home and being really thirsty, and usually sparkling water is enough to fool my senses.

As a child I would happily eat spoonfuls of plain sugar. Children seem much happier eating candy, etc. than adults. I wonder if sugar provides some additional value to children.

In the past they tried this with Coke C2 but instead swapped it with artificial sweeteners (yuck). Nowadays I only drink sparkling water and avoid added sugars like the plague. Now I find Coke way too sweet now to the point that it's enjoyable. I can't believe that when I was younger I would drink multiple cans per day. As a sidebar, I really like British style baked beans. Trying to buy something locally made in the US with the same amount of sugar is impossible. For example, Heinz Vegetarian beans contains 31.5g! of added sugar per can. Even if you go to Whole Foods, the Amy's brand contains the same amount of sugar. The UK version only contains 12g, so I end up buying the imported beans. reply RetroTechie 14 hours agorootparent> Trying to buy something locally made in the US with the same amount of sugar is impossible. I avoid processed foods whenever practical, added sugar among the reasons. Sugar (and too much of it) is added to a ridiculous % of products, for no good reason. In your example: try dried (white) beans. Soak overnight, cook ~1 hour until the beans are soft, steep or add eg. potato starch to bind leftover liquid, and then: add tomato paste & salt to taste. Just concentrated tomato, not ketchup / pasta sauce! Personally I add some chili paste as well, various herbs / spices could also go in but are really not needed.

They are sweetened with stevia and have only 2-5g of sugar, plus a lot of added fiber.

In my experience all the Coke Diet/Zero/etc varieties has this really distinctive taste and the aftertaste is also quite different from Classic. My husband is a fan of Zero and also claims it tastes the same. He has occassionally poured Zero into a glass for me thinking I couldn't tell the difference. Every single time I take one sip and that's all I need to identify it. YMMV. reply mrguyorama 14 hours agorootparentThat bad artificial sweetener aftertaste is way less pronounced if you are making a Rum and Coke though, so I always use Coke Zero for my adult beverages.

But even so, 80% of the taste with 0% of the calories seems like a bargain. Getting some marginal pleasure for 140 extra calories seems like a bad trade-off unless you're not trying to lose weight. reply kiwijamo 14 hours agorootparentFor me Zero tastes quite different and quite unpleasant.

Both Diet and Zero leave a very distinct and unpleasant aftertaste that's just absent on the regular one. (doesn't apply to Pepsi though - here the regular one also tastes bad now as it contains sweeteners as well, so I doubt I'd tell it apart from Pepsi Max unless trained beforehand - they're both gross, so I unfortunately had to switch to Coca-Cola for my occasional coke cravings) reply runsfromfire 10 hours agorootparentprevI find this varies from person to person. I have nothing to back this up, but I have a hunch it is a genetic thing, like how cilantro tastes like soap to some but not to others.

My wife can’t taste a difference at all. reply goosedragons 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, it doesn't taste the same.

The cons: you'll need enough money for that to be worthwhile, you might not see as good a return as you would simply parking your money in an ETF, you will likely face higher fees than normal for active management.

It started centuries ago after moving tonnes of raw cargo from plantations in tropical agricultural colonies. The crop was not commercialized internationally like the crystals were. The syrup was extracted, crystallized, and accumulated for most efficient transportation as a fungible commodity in bulk. The highly concentrated active ingredient of an agricultural product, at a landed cost very low among the digestible alternatives in so many markets. Tropical oils come to mind as another concentrated active ingredient from other crops. Low cost alone can make some things fly off the shelf by themselves, but when you've got bulk, and trading, you get more surplus than lots of other times. And when the cost of some parcel of excess drops to effectively zero or even negative, it can fly off the shelf with much greater momentum, even if it is temporary while it lasts. But occasional stimulus effects like that over the centuries could outlast a market upset like few other things, sugar (and fat) are widely regarded as habit-forming. No stronger supply-chain to support the habit than to deal with the pure material. Looks like Nestle is a multinational re-exporting a highly value-added commodity in bulk (at its own scale), and to some tropical countries which have great agricultural potential themselves. No wonder it seems to have been accomplished in a deceptive way. reply spondylosaurus 15 hours agoprevA recent piece from ProPublica taps into the related \"toddler milk\" phenomenon and how, in essence, it's a way for formula manufacturers to capture the market in areas where they legally can't advertise baby formula. https://www.propublica.org/article/how-america-waged-global-... reply camelboy 11 hours agoprevI think sugar consumption is not unique to Lower-income countries. A study showed that a US kids consumes more than 49 pounds of sugar a year. All these are the processed food from the big box grocery stores. I suspect the sugar consumption is way less over in those countries where as a large segment of the population is unable to purchase processed food from the expensive grocery stores. Also sugary drinks are consumed by the kids at school to get some energy, many are unable to afford a breakfast and opt for that sugary syrup sold at the school canteen. reply creatonez 11 hours agoparentThe damning thing here is that they are trying to introduce sugar overconsumption in markets not already exposed to it. They will sell two baby food products that are labelled exactly the same, with the only difference being higher sugar content in the version sold in the 3rd world. What the science tells us is that sugar addiction at young age means sugar addiction in adulthood, which is something Nestle has plenty of products to cater towards. They are aware of rich educated markets having some degree of education to avoid giving their children sugary products (and that these markets already have plenty of adult sugar addiction), and are relying on every other market to have no option but Nestle. reply mncharity 14 hours agoprev> Parents looking for information on infant nutrition may be directed to this platform and be exposed to content that steers them towards Nestlé products.

So there's an exploratory debugging process around material diet expansion, with backing off to a known-good bland diet, and experimental (re)introduction of foods. A friend was very systematic, and ended up with a list of problematic foods. Nothing singular, there are lots of similar lists out there. Now you get a lot of mail around pregnancy and birth - it's a prime advertising window with new habits being formed. One bit of mail was a substantial booklet of recipes for new moms. Oddly substantial, with no ads. Also oddly, the recipe overlap with her breast-feeding distress list was massive. \"WTF?\" - a puzzle.

Having little money doesn’t mean your kids don’t magically need fewer calories (and not providing those calories is itself a crime), so if you have an affordable source of calories that’s what you go for, even if those calories come with a side helping of excess calories (stopping hunger requires volume of food so high calorie/volume ratio results in over eating), and often huge amounts of fat as well. I grew up dirt poor in the early 80s in NZ, and the cheapest food then was oatmeal and dried spaghetti, but by the 90s the time people were having to work and the amount being paid for that work and rent, and the super steep drop in price of McDonald’s etc (it went from being an expensive birthday treat when I was a kid to being cheaper than fish&chips) means that the diet switch was likely unavoidable. Luckily for me by that point my parents had been able to start working, so fridge and weekly shopping was an option (bread wouldn’t go stale, we could keep meat and vegetables in a freezer), but I can’t imagine having the same outcome if my families life was shifted ten years later (much higher student loans, even less money while they were students, most non junk food being more expensive while junk food was cheaper). I recognize 80s NZ poverty is not US poverty, but even in NZ I can’t imagine how much harder life would be for a similarly (economically) placed family is today vs for me, everything seems tailored to create obesity and struggles. reply WarOnPrivacy 12 hours agorootparent> Yeah, there’s a real failure to understand that sugar and junk ... remains the most cost effective source of calories.

But even past that: Being poor also means subject to ceaseless Denial of Resources Attacks. Resources here meaning funds, attention, energy, ability, hope, will and anything one needs to raise one's station. Hacking a meal plan struggles to rise to the top of a priority stack when one has dozens of problems in a critical state.

According to whom? reply twosdai 9 hours agorootparentTo me it's more of a response to how sugar has been added and is available too easily in people's diets in the current year, it's simpler for the cognitive load to cut it out entirely than to moderate it. I can see it the same way on how drug abusers will quit it entirely and rather than trying to have a moderate take on using since it's too much work to be moderate. Although, sugar is not the same as a drug, the response of cutting the substance out entirely has some parallels to drug recovery. So the movement makes conceptual sense to me at least, and it's not like cutting it out is actively unhealthy.

    "originBody": "Humane AI – Pico Laser Projection – $230M AI Twist on an Old Scam Karl Guttag December 6, 2023 18 Comments Quick Note: I’m Going to CES and SPIE AR/VR/MR 2024 Before getting to the article, I wanted my readers to know that I plan to attend CES from January 9th through the 12th. My schedule is just forming up as of this writing, so I currently have many time slots available. Most AR/VR/MR-specific companies exhibiting publicly will be in LVCC Central Hall or the Venetian like last year. While I am primarily there to meet with companies and see products, I always have some time to meet with blog fans. I will also attend the SPIE AR/MR/VR conference from January 29th through the 31st. It is much easier to meet at this conference as everything is in one building for the conference and exhibits. If you want to meet up with me at either event, please email me at meet@kgontech.com Introduction Humane AI (Humane, hereafter) combines the mid-2010s failed concept of using a laser projector to project on the body with the early 2000s failed projector phone (something I wrote about in 2013), only they left out the phone’s flat panel display and have more feeble processing than a good smartphone. Rational people wonder what this does that a good smartphone can’t do much better, and you can count me as one of these people. This blog has been written about various laser projector scams since the beginning of 2011. Scammers like to associate “laser” with near-mystic powers that violate all the laws of physics and rational thought. The other favorite word to deceive people is “Hologram” (when they are not). The new favorite buzzword is “AI .” It looks like Humane started with an abysmally poor-quality laser projector in a phone-like device, and by saying it does “AI,” it is magically something new. Their picture was good enough to raise $230 million from SK Networks (Korea), Microsoft, LG, Volvo, Qualcomm, Open AI founder Sam Alman, and others. Granted, with so many big-name companies, the stakes were chump change for each giant company giant, but it does show foolishness on a grand scale. Humane Adds AI to the Laser Projection (Hype Squared) At first glance, Human AI looks like it started with a monochrome laser projector, and realizing that that wouldn’t sell venture capital companies (VCs), they wrapped it in the current hype surrounding AI. Humane co-founders Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri (left) have the “Steve Jobs” black shirt costume down like other famous Silicon Valley scammers, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, Sam Bankman-Fried founder of FTX, and Ronnie Abovitz, founder of Magic Leap. I have learned to be suspicious of the Steve Jobs pretender look through the years; it’s not a complete tell, but it should make you suspicious. Humane AI Founders (left), Elizabeth Holmes, San Bankman-Fried, Ronnie Abovitz, and Steve Jobs This blog has documented for over 12 years how laser scanning is a terrible way to generate a display image. In short, the scanning process is too slow and inaccurate to generate a high-resolution image, and the lasers can’t be controlled fast and accurately enough to give good color depth, not to mention the poor power efficiency. The fundamental problems with pico projection include: 1. Where will you project from? Humane’s “big concept” is that they will magnetically pin the projector to your shirt or jacket, ignoring that it will sag a normal shirt and flop around as one moves. For the Humane’s introduction video, they pinned it on a heavy leather (or leather-like) jacket to give support (what do you do in the summer?). 2. What and where will you project on? Humane’s “big concept,” taken from laser projector scams of the past (more on this later), is to project on the skin. But the skin is a lousy, non-smooth projection screen with crevices and poor reflective qualities. Worse yet, it requires a person to hold their hand up wherever the projector happens to be pointing as it flops around hanging on your “shirt.” Unlike a phone display, you can hold where you want or sit down. 3. Ambient light is the biggest killer for pico projectors due to the loss of contrast. Humane has not specified the projector’s brightness (in lumens), but it has a class 2 laser, so it can’t be that bright when projecting an image compared to the brightness of daylight. Humane demonstration videos are “staged” to put the hand’s projection surface in shadow or a dark environment. The Humane display is guaranteed to be invisible in outdoor daylight, about 100 times brighter than typical indoor lighting. Unlike flat panel displays that absorb ambient light, projection displays directly compete with it. 4. Humane’s projector lacks color and grayscale depth. Humane’s display a monochrome cyan (blue-green). There is no ability to even highly anything with color. Secondly, they demonstrated very limited grayscale depth; they showed just “on,” “off,” and a half-level. Even if grayscale is theoretically possible with the Humane projector, the ability fo see a grayscale image is severely hampered by using skin as a screen and the lack of contrast due to ambient light. 5. Laser projection’s focus-free is a double-edged sword. While using laser scanning allows the projected image to be “focus-free,” it also means that the smallest objects blocking the projected image cast a harsh shadow blocking part of the image. Humane’s Poor Image Quality & 720p Resolution Lie Human claims to have a 720p (1280 x 720 pixel) monochrome resolution. All laser projector resolution claims I have seen through the years lie about their resolution, typically by about 2x horizontally and vertically. But Humane seems to have topped them by claiming about 4x of the horizontal and vertical resolution they can deliver. A picture of a 502- x 410-pixel Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on the right. Humane’s image quality is worse than a cheap 1960s B&W TV (see the series of pictures below). Humane’s website and other promotional material have a series of fake still images (“Photoshopped” images overlayed on hands). While even these pictures are pretty low-resolution (much less than a true 720p image), they turn out to be much better than what is seen in the videos of the Humane projector. I fear that AI will soon make it easy to make fake images and videos that are less obvious, but these fakes from Humane did not use its “AI” technology. The images below are still frames from the Humane Introduction Video, “This is the Humane Ai Pin.” In addition to the lower resolution and contrast than the fake stills above. Notice how the crevices in the skin break up the image and don’t just darken it. In the the third from the left still below, the hand has been turned upward, catching more light (but nothing compared to a bright room or sunlight); notice how the image looks even more faded due to the ambient light. The second set of video stills is from a demonstration by Bethany Bongiorno, Humane Cofounder. These videos were taken in a much darker environment, so the contrast of the projection is better. I want to see a demo in daylight (not in the shade). This video also shows how awkward it is to use your hand as a display screen and a controller and how the hand blocks the image. But, but, but, it is all about voice recognition and speech. Voice recognition has been on smartphones for about a decade with Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). People have all experienced the good and bad of voice input and output. Certainly, voice can be a good adjunct input, but it can also be very frustrating and difficult to correct when it does not understand you correctly. AI will likely improve the recognition, but it will not be perfect. In many situations, voice input is insecure, disruptive, and/or impractical (due to, say, noise or wind). What is one supposed to do with the Humane device in such situations? Humane’s introduction video was a fiasco in that it highlighted the combined voice and image recognition problems. The founders looked stilted, trying to time everything and speaking slowly with preplanned questions to the “AI engine,” and sometimes the device gave erroneous answers. When asked about the best place to see the next solar eclipse, it gave a location too far south, and when asked to estimate how much protein is in a small number of almonds, it said that “half a cup has 15 grams.” A spokesperson for Humane has responded that it got the date correct on the eclipse but that the location was a “bug” and that while the “AI” missed the question’s intent on the almonds, the answer was technically correct on the grams per cup. The AI answered like Cliff Clavin (bar know-it-all from the TV series Cheers who constantly gave erroneous information but showed full confidence in what he was saying – example, video clip). Apple uses “Siri” to trigger their audio response; maybe Humane could use “Cliff.” Just for fun, I asked my iPhone’s Siri, “Where is the best place to watch the next solar eclipse?” and it came back with a series of links to articles (that included color pictures and maps) that I could scroll through on my phone but would never be able to read on Humane’s terrible display or would want read back to me. In the real world, speech recognition is much more complex than Humane’s simplistic examples. The environment is going to be more complex and often noisy. When speaking, people are not careful to say each word clearly, particularly when they have to whisper to avoid disturbing the people around them too much. As has been widely discussed, AI will often answer questions with wrong information. Old Scam with Slightly New Twist Back in the days before Streaming, DVDs, and VHS tapes, the Disney company found they could rerelease their animated features every seven years, and a new generation of kids would think they were new. Disney then followed a similar pattern and put their VHS and later DVD releases in the “Disney Vault” between rereleases. This pattern of letting memories fade away before reintroducing them as “new” also holds in high-tech. In 2016, this blog wrote about eyeHand in Wrist Projector Scams – Ritot, Cicret, the new eyeHand. These companies showed some comically bad fake images that included “projecting black,” violating all laws of physics. The scams by the small companies got big companies like Dell and Hilton to buy into the scammer’s marketing hype, and they released several “concept videos” seemingly based on these scams (see below from that same article). In 2018, Haier and ASU revisited the concept (see the 2018 CES Haier Laser Projector Watch – (Wrist Projector Scams Revisited)). Haier showed a prototype at CES 2018, enabling me to photograph the difference between the less obviously fake images and their real appearance (see article for more details). Conclusions Once you get past the contrived demonstrations and crappy displays, Humane’s problem is convincing real people that what they have is better than a smartphone. A modern smartphone has a better onboard processor and, orders of magnitude, a better display, supports audio and video input, and can communicate with the internet for AI or related speech recognition and answers. A phone does not force one to wear clothes that will be able to support it or make me hold my hand out to see a crappy image. Few will believe a startup company has better speech recognition and information database technology than Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other giant companies. If Humane really had better technology, why didn’t they release it as a software application rather than developing this terrible device? Humane has no advantages and massive disadvantages compared to a smartphone, and it seems most people in technology have come to the same conclusion based on my reading of the responses. There are a few “everyone gets a trophy” and “anything is possible” people who have an open (or empty?) mind to this concept. How so many business people could get their companies to fork over a combined $230M confounds me. I’m waiting for the AI program that can explain it . . . Not really; it is probably a combination of ego, unwillingness to do good due diligence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), all very human problems. These same “businesspeople” will run most startups through the wringer for a few million in VC money and then hold a cash bonfire with Humane AI and Magic Leap (another company that originally told investors that a key technology was laser projection). Thankfully, at least this time, they are not stealing money from individuals on Kickstarter or Indigogo like Ritot, Cicret, and eyeHand did, even if the amount is two orders of magnitude higher.

He was ranting to the flight attendant about how inefficient their baggage storage solution was because of how he had to check his carry-on. The flight attendant very calmly said \"That's an interesting idea, sir.\" as he was mid diatribe about the lack of integrated sensor technology in overhead bins. He ended with a \"I'm going to Tweet about this, this is totally ----ing unacceptable.\" A few minutes later he stood up to take pictures of the overhead bins and the flight attendant made sure he had a good clear view. \"Let me help you, gotta get a good pic for the gram\". Mr. Humane, with all the indignant condescension he could muster, said \"Uh, it's for Twitter, not Instagram.\" Flight attendant responded \"Ooh, Twitter, my apologies.\" I found the tweet while waiting for take off. I wonder if he ever got around to disrupting the space. This is what I get for connecting in San Francisco.

Yes, I get it’s an affinity exercise, but one I don’t think marketing should be doing unless there’s something tragically wrong about it.

The problem is that scam has certain meaning and if we use scam more liberally we dilute the meaning. If every company is a scam(as almost everyone intentionally overhypes or does something similar to humane), then no company is a scam. Is google a scam as they scripted the gemini video? reply JohnFen 18 hours agorootparent> Is google a scam as they scripted the gemini video? That video was more of a fraud than a scam, but I think we're just splitting hairs at that point. reply nathan_compton 20 hours agorootparentprevI think the issue here is that arguably startup culture has _redefined_ scam to _not include_ \"fake it till you make it gotta get funding\" bullshit. In a previous era that stuff might arguably have been non-controversially been though of as a kind of scam. My own experience with startups is that they often hew as close to the line of scam as they can get away with and this behavior has been normalized. reply YetAnotherNick 19 hours agorootparentThis has nothing to do with startup or current times. That's why I gave example of Google. Google is not a scam in my definition but still has clearly faked gemini demo.

Whether the given thing is a scam depends on whether, at the moment of utterance, the statement is a lie meant to accomplish some goal or not. It doesn't exclude the possibility that success might happen someday. This is what I mean about the bizarre morals of startup hustler types. Lying to extend your runway is still lying and normal people still think its a scam. reply YetAnotherNick 17 hours agorootparentDo you use any word to distinguish what google did in my example vs what theranos/FTX did?

Thats not 1000km, but its much more than half. reply Manabu-eo 9 hours agorootparentprevBut one hypermiler reporting a long range under perfect conditions is exactly what he described at length while making that claim. It was pretty clear to me. And that was exactly what we got in 2017. If one wants to lie by twisting what he said, what happened or putting purposefully out of context to gain clicks or drive up hate against the guy, that is another thing. You should not do that. Nowhere he said what the site or you are implying. I'm tired how people are getting radicalized because they hear absurd things (\"pizzagate\") and instead of doubting it they believe it and become outraged. If you actually hear people talking, they are usually much more reasonable than what they seem if you just take a few of the most negative phrases out of context. It takes a lot of effort to undo fake news. A few more examples from that website: \"Rocket Fuel Solves Climate Change\", an absurd extrapolation on what was probably a tweet about ISRU for Mars. And this juxtaposition that makes you think he just sold what was paid to them, when instead it is 10% of what they had bought previously if you actually follow the link: Hodl [Link] 1,120 days since Elon Musk promised to hold bitcoin instead converting it. (3/24/2021) \"Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.\" Elon Musk in a Tweet 1,087 days since Elon Musk converted $272 million to fiat currency. (4/26/2021) As reported by Nate DiCamillo in yahoo! finance You might argue that the second move goes against the spirit of what he said in the tweet and all that, but you have to agree with me that this site is being purposefully deceitful on how it is presenting this to promote hate and radicalize more the people. reply nailer 17 hours agorootparentprevTheranos faked blood test results.

Five or so years ago everybody (rightfully) made fun of the juicero. Before that we had Google Glass (glasshole). Today the Humane Pin has to suffer slings and arrows. Humane AI would never have been able to raise 230+ million had they been truthful about what could be built with the current state of technology. Did the investors understand that you have to recharge the Humane Pin every 2 hours? Did the investors know their laser projection press photos are photoshopped? Did the investors know the laser projector doesn't meet the advertised resolution? The Humane Pin is science fiction. In many ways the Humane Pin is like Theranos.

Anticipating, long before launch, issues that are being discussed now, when reviewers have the device in their hands. Nor, in any way, shape or form is it unusual for a bad/imperfect product to receive poor reviews. That is not piling on--it is normal and expected. No one is literally saying that an individual contributor at Humane is a \"scammer\" just because they happened to have worked on a project that arguably takes perfectly good sand and subtracts value from it. That happens. A lot. Sometimes you intend to make a product, and you end up working on an empty product-shaped object. Heck, sometimes, say in healthcare, the drug or device you hoped would help people not only does nothing, but actually causes harm. That doesn't mean you were foolish to have started work, but simply because you started with \"good intentions\" doesn't mean a product belongs on the market. Humane is charging $700 for a device with $24 monthly subscriptions. If someone thinks that such an offering is worthless, or nearly so, it is hardly surprising if they use \"aggressive\" language to warn people away. If there is anything unusual or unsettling it is that some people in tech seem to feel that it is \"unethical\" to treat tech companies as anything less than bold innovators, irrespective of what that they ship. If someone is despairing over past week's discourse, one only can imagine how they'd deal with something like Apple's \"I'm a Mac/I'm a PC\" commercials. reply brookst 21 hours agoparentprevIt’s an unfortunate trend, but it is also an age-old reaction to hubris. Humane made the fatal PR mistake of trying to convince the world they had a revolutionary product that would change everything… without selling the benefits of the product. That triggers a bunch of memes, from emperor’s new clothes to pride before a fall. Add in a general societal distrust of tech and AI, plus the age-old derision for geeks/nerds, and Humane could not have set themselves up better for fiasco if they had tried. I do think it was all well meaning and earnest, not at all a scam.

I guess I am biased with one of the initial story that described the genesis of the product during a cliff top retreat on Benioff's property.

That is scam territory. reply suyash 17 hours agorootparentprevhand is just a surface bro, I don't think it has anything to do with hand, light will bounce back on any opaque surface, just think of it as a mini projector and it's not even full RGB spectrum colour. reply soneca 14 hours agorootparentThe hand movement controls what is being showed in the projector, which are inputs of the computation it does.

Instead of pitching a practical and attainable product, one has to aim for the moon in order to get the VC $$$$. The wilder, the better. Call me crazy, but as a society we’ve decided that “possible” is too boring. While many VC funded companies only want to get bought out (instead of actually being a freestanding successful company), I strongly feel there are a sizable subsection of “founders” that don’t even want to get bought out… They only just want to play the game and collect high salaries along the way… Sadly, they aren’t even to blame. Too many Fortune-50 executives just try not to embarrass themselves long enough to collect insane levels of compensation. Is a wonder that VC founders do the same? Too many startups are really just “playing house” — really flashy website, monochrome headshots of executive team, multiple officies, plethora of partner logos… Only missing substance and a real product. reply ryandrake 19 hours agorootparentMy only career regret is that I went for \"technical chops\" rather than charisma and \"storytelling chops\".

It ultimately just revolves down to empty moralism about \"people today,\" and fails to grasp the issue at hand. Like how phone scammers are often themselves trapt in a system beyond their control [1]. Or even case in point with this thing. Maybe the owners aren't malicious, but if not, they are clearly somewhat being scammed themselves by AI hype, to the point they are willing to invest so much in the chatbot box, tie their entire business presumably to one current API or another, however bad an idea we know that is. There are just many long chains of debt, confusion, hyperstition that are knotting around us, with no clear source. One person's scam turns into another's \"innovation\" before turning again back into a scam for the end user. If we are really getting ready for the AI future, we need to get used to being wronged and taken advantage of by technically blameless entities, whose intent is logical, capitalist, and at least nominatively \"benevolent.\" The era of morality itself might soon turn to something else! In a world so predetermined and calculated, where there is such advanced science around influencing thought, cybernetics, etc, how does it even make sense anymore?

It's a green laser (it isn't) 2. It's projected onto a white surface, (again, it isn't) 3. 9cm^2 of projected surface area (3cm x 3cm) Maybe they can modulate the brightness by the amount of stuff present on the projected screen, and maybe even have an outdoor mode, where they use light fonts, that are displayed on a higher brightness, so the overall energy emitted still classifies the device to be class 2. Still, 1mW must be very very limiting here, a 120 nits display is nowhere near usable outdoors, let alone a 120 nits display that reflects the outdoor light just as well as the projector's. Why on earth they aren't using a green laser if they are limited to class 2 is beyond me though. reply sbarre 19 hours agoparentThere are hands-on reviews out there of this thing (The Verge and others) and they all say the projector is next to useless in outdoor light. reply ActionHank 19 hours agoparentprevIt may not be a scam in that they delivered more or less what they promised.

Aside from that, it seems like the main things that might have made this thing seem impressive or stand out aren't even developed by them. I haven't seen any indication the laser is anything revolutionary they made themselves, and as much as they'd like to pretend they've developed some crazy AI, it seems to be OpenAI doing all the heavy lifting and everyone and their grandma has been using this technology for over a year now. reply Ductapemaster 18 hours agorootparentA former colleague of mine works at Humane as an engineer, and the laser tech is apparently closely guarded. They were reluctant to even give a demo when we ran into each other, stating that the laser tech was particularly sensitive topic. I got the sense it was very custom. reply mikestew 17 hours agorootparent...stating that the laser tech was particularly sensitive topic. Perhaps it's my jaded view seasoned by the observation of decades of tech bullshit, but that could go one of two ways: 1. The laser tech is full of trade secrets that we dare not reveal just yet. 2. We don't want anyone to find out that we bought these laser things off AliExpress. (Or maybe it's tech you could buy off Amazon ten years ago, who knows? https://www.amazon.com/Brookstone-FBA_mp-796246-Projection-V...) reply ericlewis 9 hours agorootparentI wanted to replicate many parts of the Ai pin and did research into laser projectors. It’s probably a MEMs projector. The cyan color they use is custom, at least. Minifying that tech and making it robust enough to be knocked around on a wearable device is pretty challenging and I couldn’t find anything of a similar size off the shelf. They also run pretty hot and apparently the pin has heat issues (and according to folks at CES (?) using the laser a lot makes it over heat. reply rasz 17 hours agorootparentprevYou know who eles secretly guarded demos of magical display tech that turned out to be garbage? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Leap reply hbn 16 hours agorootparentAlso the RED Hydrogen One if anyone remembers that reply refulgentis 19 hours agoparentprevI don't understand, isn't the laser green in demos and reviews? reply planede 19 hours agorootparentMaybe. In the article the photoshopped images look like as if it was green, but the screenshots from the demo videos look blue to me. The article says that it's cyan. Of course white balance could be way off in any of those pictures. reply lolc 21 hours agoprevThe blog post propagates the myth that you can't project black on skin.

It's very much worth subscribing to his blog if you want to know this stuff long before everyone else (note that this article was written last year before anyone had reviewed the device). reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 3 hours agoprevI could see a few situations where I could use something like this, for example for reading a book projected on a chair in front of me in the airplane, instead of carrying a ebook reader.

They released this \"video handbook\" a couple weeks ago that's much more human. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyPxwp3SxdU If there's anything about their work atmosphere I've gleamed from seeing employees talk about the company over the past few months it's quite the opposite of a cold, brutalist tech company. It's cult-like if anything. They've been acting way too impressed by their own product, and now that it's out and reviews have panned it, they tweet about how we all need to be more \"optimistic about the future\" and similar handwaving. It takes real faith-like buy-in to be shipping something like this and not feel totally embarrassed. reply iamleppert 16 hours agorootparentSadly I have worked for such places. At the top somewhere is someone with an ego so large it will always prevent them from taking any accountability or offering a shred of humility. If the market doesn’t like the product, they will blame the market before admitting to any defect in their own thinking. Narcissistic personalities are constantly rewarded in tech, they play right into the greed of VCs and unmask the fact most investors are completely incompetent. reply ungreased0675 13 hours agorootparentprevThere were more than a few “Wait a sec, that’s really hard to do” light bulbs that popped into my head watching that. I wonder if the result is more of a product management/focus failure than a technical one? Perhaps the outcome would have been better if they had just picked one or two hard problems instead of trying to make the everything device right at launch. reply ketchupdebugger 17 hours agorootparentprevwow it looks horrible. did their \"AI\" got the eclipse location wrong? April 8th was over NA but the AI said that the ideal location was in Australia? The interaction is awful. you have to touch it to operate it via voice commands? that means you cant use it in public. There's also a notification light? how is someone wearing it on their chest supposed to see that? I dont think this is a scam for the consumer, because no one in their right minds is going to watch this and want one. They are just cashing in on the AI crazy happening right now. reply hbn 17 hours agorootparentYeah, that video infamously had mistakes of it telling him the wrong location to view the eclipse, as well as saying a handful of almonds had WAY more protein than it should have. reply shubhamjain 22 hours agoprevI take issue with the word \"scam\", but other than, a very well-done rebuttal. It's not just v1 issue, Humane is a product of the most brainless assumptions you can make: a) That a palm-size laser projector could work as a display. b) That awkward hand gestures are a great way to navigate UI c) That voice could work as a primary input. d) That people would be willing to pay $700 and a monthly subscription for a device that barely works. It's at par or even worse than Juicero. The team and its supporters should stop hiding behind \"it's v1\", and \"we were trying to invent a new paradigm.\" The device has to be promising now, not in some imaginary future. And trying to invent shouldn't mean you're going to forgo questioning the basic foundational ideas. reply realfeel78 16 hours agoparent> I take issue with the word \"scam\", but other than, a very well-done rebuttal. > It's at par or even worse than Juicero. Sounds like a scam to me. reply _the_inflator 21 hours agoparentprevThanks for the mention of Juicero. That was awesome in its own kind. reply Retr0id 21 hours agorootparentI feel bad for the hardware engineers that worked on both. It seems like they did a great job under the design constraints they were given, too bad the product as a whole sucked. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentIt was exceptionally well-engineered. The people who worked on it should be proud of the machine they designed. The problem with it as a product was that it was worthless. Yes, it did what was claimed, but the machine and all that great engineering was completely unnecessary to get the insanely overpriced juice out of the bags. reply jsheard 22 hours agoparentprevAdd \"putting an inductive charger against the users skin\" to that. The heat issues aren't going to go away with the form factor they came up with, wireless charging isn't getting any more efficient. reply fossuser 9 hours agoprevI mostly feel bad for them. I generally hate pile ons on principle and HN tends to be nasty about anything new even when it is wildly successful so nastiness here is no signal (and hardware is hard, it's good for people to try new things, etc.). AI is a new capability and there is an opportunity for new hardware that can use it. That said, the Humane marketing reminded me of Magic Leap and I find it irritating. Particularly the big build up to what was going to be 'new information' and then it was an ad with no information. When the marketing is so divorced from what's delivered I think people are often nastier about it. The irony to me is that in a lot of ways they're trying to be Apple, but without Apple's strategic thinking - it's more cosplaying Apple. Ben Thompson had a good write up today in Stratechery that touched on some of this: when the iPhone came out it worked with Mac and windows - the dominant computing platforms of the day! They didn't try to immediately create a standalone device from the get go and they had iterated on a narrow use case with the iPod for several years already to perfect some things. Also - people love their phones! They may make overtures otherwise, but observe their behavior. This is a lot more akin to what rewind aka limitless is doing. Start small/focused with a good product that solves a well tested use case while working with the existing platform (mobile) then leverage that to grow and build an ecosystem as you go. There's so much about the Humane product that is strategically poor/user poor: a separate phone number, terrible battery, the extreme cost, etc. etc. even if the product actually worked (it doesn't) it's strategically DOA. You don't get to mars by starting a company and building a mars rocket - you have that as the end goal and a path to get there that requires doing a ton of other stuff first so you have a shot at achieving that goal. Any company that achieves great things builds a machine to build the machine - otherwise you just get a expensive art project if the product even works at all. Still they did build and ship something and I like their industrial design so they deserve kudos for that. Plus I like to see people experiment so it's good when people try even if they fail, but I don't think it's helped by pretending something isn't a failure. reply bearjaws 20 hours agoprevWe need to invent \"Touch Grass Driven Development\" TGDD. These products are clearly built by people who live in the SV bubble. Nobody is going to use this pin in their day to day if you can't wear a seatbelt with it. Nobody is going to be able to easily use it outside. This is obvious to anyone who has been outdoors in the last decade. reply chaostheory 10 hours agoparentThey used to work at Apple so they feel that they can match Apple’s success but doing it the “Apple way”: internal iterations instead of early feedback ie the Build it and they will come strategy which is hard to get working outside of Apple. The only team I’m aware of that was able to do it successfully was Nest, but it later ended in disaster. reply aledalgrande 4 hours agorootparentThe difference is Apple has incredible momentum behind it pushing the Apple way. It took them decades to get to this point (and Steve Jobs, the real one). reply tomaskafka 22 hours agoprevI love this take on Humane as a s̶c̶a̶m̶ business reselling the last decade laser projection b̶u̶l̶l̶s̶h̶i̶t̶ dreams with adding AI (edited, the question of scam/not scam is not the point). And probably poisoning the well for other, simpler and laser-less personal AI devices as a side effect. Btw, you can buy a 60g wearable device whose hardware is prepared for 24/7 microphone listening, has ML accelerator, 24h battery life, and has, for some reason, kept free 16GB of storage that the user can't access and the OS doesn't use.

I use nearly all of those GBs of storage on mine with synced music and audiobooks for running. reply tomaskafka 21 hours agorootparentDoes your watch show more than 8 GB synced? Mine does not. There's 32 GB of storage, sync uses 8, and it is really hard to fill more than other 8 with OS, apps & data. > Apple Watch limits the amount of music which can be stored on the watch and is typically limited to 24% of the available space on the watch, so given you have a watch with 32GB of total space, 8GB would the maximum you can store. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253403298?sortBy=best reply dmd 20 hours agorootparentYep, I'm using about 25% for music, another dozen gigs for audiobooks... it adds up. reply tomaskafka 17 hours agorootparentHmm, so each of Apple's apps has a limit? So far it seemed like the limit is shared to keep a lot of storage available (for the future?) reply threeseed 22 hours agoparentprevWords matter. We should reserve scams for the actual scams.

On topic, if the product is real but their marketing demos still show unrealistically different capabilities, then it's fair to call it a scam. Looking at the material provided, the marketing images show a usable device, and the real ones an unusable one in terms of contrast, resolution, and projection deformation. But because they do show real images I'd stop short of calling it a scam.

Devs who don't know sales are obviously not their demographic, they'll be speaking to layers of other biz dev people before they even get to the execs, and each one knows exactly how to extract concessions and discounts, and the opposing salesperson knows exactly how much of a discount they can give. In this way, it is much more of an efficient market than most devs think.

Those \"call for pricing\" companies are targeting large enterprises, not one person owned businesses. That you self select out of their market is exactly what they want.

How the hell do I know they're not giving me higher prices due to racial profiling or some other unethical reason?

It just mean they will negotiate the contracts for large projects, without disclosing the terms to the public ... in my view. reply black3r 14 hours agorootparentThe \"undisclosed\" also mean they can just straight up give you different prices than they give to your competition which can affect fair competition in your field.

    "originBody": "Premium Tech It's not just you: Reddit is taking over Google Hugh Langley 2024-04-17T09:00:05Z Share Facebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link Save Read in app Rebecca Zisser/BI Redeem now Google's AI search engine and the rise of forum posts like Reddit and Quora are upheaving SEO. Google's shift to promoting more human, helpful sites has led to a surge in traffic to Reddit. This rise in Reddit's visibility is being exploited by spammers, raising concerns. If you think you've been seeing an awful lot more Reddit results lately when you search on Google, you're not imagining things. The internet is in upheaval, and for website owners the rules of \"winning\" Google Search have never been murkier. Google's generative AI search engine is coming from one direction. It's creeping closer to mainstream deployment and bringing an existential crisis for SEOs and website makers everywhere. Coming from the other direction is an influx of posts from Reddit, Quora, and other internet forums that have climbed up through the traditional set of Google links. Data analysis from Semrush, which predicts traffic based on search ranking, shows that traffic to Reddit has climbed at an impressive clip since August. Semrush estimated that Reddit had over 132 million visitors in August 2023. At the time of publishing, it was projected to have over 346 million visitors in April 2024. Organic search traffic to Reddit over the past two years Semrush None of this is accidental. For years, Google has been watching users tack on \"Reddit\" to the end of search queries and finally decided to do something about it. Google started dropping hints in 2022 when it promised to do a better job of promoting sites that weren't just chasing the top of search but were more helpful and human. Last August, Google rolled out a big update to Search that seemed to kick this into action. Reddit, Quora, and other forum sites started getting more visibility in Google, both within the traditional links and within a new \"discussions and forums\" section, which you may have spotted if you're US-based. The timing of this Reddit bump has led to some conspiracy theories. In February, Google and Reddit announced a blockbuster deal that would let Google train its AI models on Reddit content. Google said the deal, reportedly worth $60 million, would \"facilitate more content-forward displays of Reddit information,\" leading to some speculation that Google promised Reddit better visibility in exchange for the valuable training data. A few weeks later, Reddit also went public. A Google spokesperson told BI: \"Our agreement with Reddit absolutely did not include ranking its content higher on Search.\" Indeed, SEO experts have watched this Reddit bump since August when Google rolled out a crucial search update six months before the deal was announced. It's not just Reddit. Q&A forum Quora is getting a huge visibility bump in Google search results, per Semrush and Sistrix data. Google says \"hundreds\" of other forums and communities across the web are also getting the bump. Still, given Reddit's size, its rise is the most noticeable. Per Sistrix data, Reddit is now as visible in top Google Search results as Instagram. Reddit's visibility in Google Search now matches that of Instagram Sistrix Steve Paine, marketing manager at Sistrix, called the rise of Reddit \"unprecedented.\" \"There hasn't been a website that's grown so much search visibility so quickly in the US in at least the last five years,\" he told Business Insider. Right now, Reddit ranks high for product searches. Reddit's main competitors are Wikipedia, YouTube, and Fandom, Paine said, and it also competes in \"high-value commercial searches,\" putting it up against Amazon. The \"real competitors,\" he said, are the subreddits that compete with brands on the web. Giving the people what they want Why is Google doing this, and why now? The company's stance here is simple: it's giving users what they want. \"Our research has shown that people often want to learn from others' experiences with a topic, so we've continued to make it easier to find helpful perspectives on Search when it's relevant to a query,\" a Google spokesperson told BI. \"Our systems surface content from hundreds of forums and other communities across the web, and we conduct rigorous testing to ensure results are helpful and high quality.\" Responding to a post on X, Google search liaison Danny Sullivan said users not only like seeing \"forum content\" but that they \"proactively seek it out.\" This shift in search behavior has already been happening for several years. In July 2022, Google's search head Prabhakar Raghavan said younger users were turning to alternative sources such as TikTok and Instagram for information and recommendations. Last year, during the Reddit blackout in June, Google Search got considerably worse. Google CEO Sundar Pichai on stage at Google IO 2023 JOSH EDELSON/GETTY Google's Reddit deal and its endorsement of Reddit content in Search show how much it sees Reddit as a crucial part of the future of search. Related stories \"It's obvious that Google has this vision that they need more user-generated content,\" said Aleyda Solis, an SEO consultant for Orainti, who added that this is one way Google can respond to the rise in TikTok, Instagram, and other social spaces. While Google might not be pumping Reddit results in exchange for training data, Google's AI systems would benefit from the more up-to-date information Reddit can give, especially when SGE rolls out in full. Furthermore, a paper written by several Google employees, published in late 2023, claims that pulling information from an internet search can better improve the accuracy of chatbots. Named FreshPrompt, the method would incorporate \"relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine\" to improve a chatbot such as Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. Grifters can hijack search The question is whether this Reddit bump will continue or Google will nerf it. There are risks associated with Reddit, which relies on unpaid moderators to police unsavory content and spam. Google told BI its systems work on all websites, including Quora and Reddit. Still, there's evidence that people are already abusing the rise of these sites in Google rankings. In a February study, SEO blogger Glen Allsopp found that 51% of Reddit's top-ranking threads in Google Search's forums sections contained spam as a top comment. YouTube already has heaps of videos offering advice on hijacking Reddit to rise to the top of Google Search. One of the most popular videos right now teaches viewers to purchase abandoned Reddit accounts, seek out popular Reddit posts to post comments filled with affiliate links, and then artificially inflate their popularity using \"upvotes\" purchased from third-party websites. This way, they can feasibly rocket to the top of Google. It might not be that difficult. Search Engine Journal reported this week that one Reddit user climbed to top-ranking Google Search results in minutes (BI could confirm the post ranked in the top 10, but couldn't independently verify the time it took to get there). A Google spokesperson said the company's anti-spam policies apply to all content and that it takes particular attention to searches for sensitive topics such as health or finance. Still, it's unclear how much Google's spam-attacking systems, which just got a boost, work right now. Reddit is \"heavily manipulated at the end of the day,\" and people can easily take advantage of it by posting content there, Solis said. Lily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy and research for marketing agency Amsive, told BI she is concerned that Google is \"shifting the burden\" of monitoring abuse onto Reddit moderators. Neglected subreddits risk getting spammed with unhelpful or even false content. Ray wrote on LinkedIn last week that she found an example of Reddit ranking prominently at the top of Google when she searched \"How to lose 10 pounds in a week\". \"A redditor suggested 'cutting your arm off,'\" she wrote. This raises questions about whether Google can keep bad content from being eaten by its AI-generated search engine, which often sources its responses from the top search results. Already, Google is fighting an influx of AI-generated content flooding the web. At the same time, rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity try to steal Google's lunch with AI chatbots that work like search engineers. A Google spokesperson told BI that the company's analysis did not find that more harmful content on Search comes from forums. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman Greg Doherty/Getty Images There's room to grow - and that's good news for Reddit investors The assessment in the SEO community right now is that Google has leaned too hard into community discussion, and it may need to recalibrate once users start complaining that, actually, too much Reddit in Google results can be a bad thing. Sistrix's Paine said 48.9% of the reddit.com ranking content appears in the top 10 Google Search results, yet only 8% show in the top 3, according to a study from his firm — giving plenty of room for Reddit only to grow, which is something Reddit investors will be pleased to know. Google may also decide to course-correct. \"Personally, I would expect this current dominance by Reddit to calm down once Google notes that the search experience has not been improved by the increased inclusion of Reddit,\" SEO consultant Natalie Slater told BI. \"One of the questions is, will it retain this visibility?\" Paine said of Reddit. \"On one hand, this is unprecedented growth, and there's a feeling that it must end soon.\" On the other, he added, there's plenty of space for Reddit's presence in Google Search to grow even bigger. For now, Reddit and Google need each other, and it may be in neither of their interests to stop a good thing. On February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31 other media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch court, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.

That was done specifically for SEO purposes. It was pretty much the only SEO optimization we ever did (along with a few DOM changes), because shortly after that, Google basically dedicated engineering effort specifically to crawling reddit. So much so that we lost the \"crawl rate\" button in our SEO admin page on Google, it was just set to \"Custom\". I had to stand up a fleet of app servers and caches and databases, and change the load balancers so that Google basically had their own infrastructure (although we would shunt all crawlers there). Crawler traffic was very different than regular traffic -- it looked at pages more than two days old, something humans rarely did at the time. It would blow out every cache (memory, database, disk, etc.). So we put them on their own infra to keep them from killing the rest of the site. And now I will hang an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. reply asdff 13 hours agoparentNowadays the reddit engineers perverted the link system for old reddit users. New reddit users link to posts using a syntax that for old reddit users returns the submit a new post page.

I wonder if that's because I'm using old reddit+RES. reply szszrk 4 hours agorootparentprevI literally have no idea how to open a large image on new reddit. I tried. The least amount od clicks I know to actually see it uncropped is 3 and it does full page redirects on each of them. Maybe it's ad blocker or something... Don't care anymore. I started using both old and new reddit at the same time. Old one also has working notifications... It's such a shitshow. I have no replacement for it, but combined with mobile app I've cut my usage by 95%. Barely post and reply anymore, stopped wiki edits and so on. reply im3w1l 8 hours agorootparentprevI just find it hilarious that old.reddit is one version, new.reddit is another, and www.reddit is yet another. reply asdff 8 hours agorootparentJust a few years ago they had i.reddit.com as well, which I loved as a mobile interface to be honest... reply chimeracoder 11 hours agorootparentprev> Also, just to twist the knife further, old reddit users can't open full resolution images hosted on reddit anymore.

It just happened to be the one thing that we specifically did for SEO first.

And please send me a picture if you actually do it. :) reply gary_0 14 hours agorootparentprevI see. I suppose in a perfect world, devs would just follow general best practices and search engines would reward that, and nobody would be looking for evil voodoo to boost traffic. And I would have a pet unicorn! reply saurik 9 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is you can't trust it: people can modify that part of the URL arbitrarily and so you think the URL has meaning, but it doesn't. reply kevincox 8 hours agorootparentIt depends how it is implemented. After extracting the ID and looking up the post you can then check that the \"slug\" matches. Return a 404 if it doesn't. This may add a bit of complexity (if the slug data is mutable you need to allow any past versions or freeze it in creation) but isn't too hard if this is the approach that you want to take. reply saurik 5 hours agorootparentOk, but we don't have to talk about this \"depends\" idea: that's not how reddit did it and I thought we were talking about reddit ;P. reply rasz 14 hours agorootparentprevNowadays reddit hides it, I use this to revert back to full url for (let value of document.querySelectorAll('.first a.bylink.comments')) { let href = value.closest('.top-matter').querySelector('.title a.title.may-blank').href; if (href != value.href && ( href.startsWith('https://www.reddit.com/') || href.startsWith('https://v.redd.it')) ) { console.log (href, value.href); value.closest('.top-matter').querySelector('.title a.title.may-blank').href = value.href; } } reply jedberg 14 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean the hide it now? I still see it in the URL? reply rasz 13 hours agorootparentThis is what I see https://v.redd.it/pzma14ni23vc1 for post titles, while comment link https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/1c6h... First one is also dynamic, so next ~day its different breaking one of the fundamental features of HTML - :visited link color. reply ammar2 13 hours agorootparentSaying they hide it might be a bit of a stretch, that URL just 302's to the comment link with the title-in-url as usual. I guess you're referring to being able to right-click and copy the url directly? reply mark242 13 hours agoparentprevIt's mind-boggling to me that Google didn't create a spec to work with special partners whereby they could get syndicated data in a format that was easy to ingest, and easy for their partners to produce. Lighting dollars on fire just to serve up pages to Googlebot, when you could just periodically dump a journal of updates to Google, is just crazy imo. On edit: if only there were some way to do some kind of really simple syndication of your data. reply wepple 12 hours agorootparentYou’d have to trust that the data being dumped was 100% identical to the actual pages users would eventually see, or you could end up with very weird (including dangerous) behavior Of course, I know that some version of this can and does occur with classic web scraping too, but that is an arms race that a search engine can win reply kevindamm 10 hours agorootparent> I know that some version of this can and does occur with classic web scraping too, but that is an arms race that a search engine can win Cloaked links and cloaked ads still happen on direct requests, too -- a search engine's crawlers come in a widely known IP range (or if they start using unknown or new IPs, they become known soon enough) so even spoofing the user agent of the bot isn't a reliable workaround. I'd say the arms race is still escalating, though I've been out of that game for a little while I'm still rather sure of that. reply kevincox 8 hours agorootparentprevYou can just spot check a tiny fraction of the data to validate this big it doesn't match the the site gets blocked. reply nitwit005 12 hours agorootparentprevIn the past Google just requested the HTML, and didn't bother with the javascript, so it was a simple document request. People started serving up pages that required Javascript to show content, so they had cope with that. I'm sure it's dramatically more expensive for them as well. reply pwdisswordfishc 5 hours agorootparentAs long as it’s prohibitively expensive for their competition, I’m sure they don’t mind. reply sorenjan 11 hours agorootparentprevIsn't that what WeSub (previously PubSubHubbub) is? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub reply kevincox 8 hours agorootparentI don't think Google uses this in a major way. It also probably isn't the best fit for this use case. 1. You can really only subscribe to particular URLs. So this would require millions of subscriptions. It would only make sense if most of your pages are changing every few days. 2. You need to also subscribe to feeds to fine new content. reply ivanjermakov 13 hours agorootparentprevAlso, isn't this illegal? Either Google respected rate limits (which I doubt) or it was a form of a DDoS attack. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentIt's only illegal if you poor people do it. For us rich corporations, we do what we want reply fasa99 6 hours agorootparentprevGoogle is the kingmaker and basically a monopoly on search. If you're going to light up dollars to share with a bot, let it be with google, who on a lucky day might decide you are king (because you let them index your site) I would presume and assume google obeys the robots.txt mandate as well. But I would agree it's a very outstanding and real problem that is YC-worthy - sharing structured webpage data with trusted partners in a generic and efficient way. I've heard about various AI companies that perform such data scraping and structuring with AI, forget the name - this is many notches in sophistication above a Selenium-headless type driver. If only html were made into a model-view-controller neatly and users were let to bring their own views & controllers. reply nosecreek 12 hours agorootparentprevAre there specific laws that deal with rate limits? Honest question - I get that something too fast could be considered DDoS, but so long as it’s below a certain threshold wouldn’t it be okay (not sure how said threshold would be determined)? reply germinator 10 hours agorootparentIn the US, CFAA prohibits causing \"damage\", which includes \"impairment to the integrity or availability\" of data or systems. But as with many other things in law, it boils down to the court trying to assess your intent, whether you could've reasonably anticipated the outcome, and what that outcome ended up being. There's no law that says \"you can't send more than n packets per hour\". reply jedberg 8 hours agorootparentprevIt was fine because we let them. reply aeyes 12 hours agorootparentprevI guess they wanted to be crawled because the Google crawler is easy to identify/block/rate limit. reply beeboobaa3 12 hours agorootparentprevGoogle's entire business model is based on behavior that is now illegal. reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparentprevThat syndicated data format may or may not be up-to-date. reply spiderice 8 hours agorootparentIf it’s specifically accessible to special partners, Google could just end their partnership if Reddit is serving up false information to them and go back to the old way of scraping. reply encoderer 9 hours agoparentprevBasically we had the same infrastructure back in the day at Trulia - a dedicated “bot cluster” We had two charges from management: let google crawl as fast as it possibly can, and don’t let it disrupt users. reply the_real_cher 12 hours agoparentprevDo you use the new design or stick with old.reddit.com? reply jedberg 8 hours agorootparentI mostly use old.reddit but sometimes use sh.reddit reply jgalt212 9 hours agoparentprevIndeed. Human activity is cacheable as it respects Zipf's or a power law. Spider activity is not cacheable. Most pages are GETed within a few multiples of each other. Probably a good way to detect bot traffic is put a URL on a sitemap, and have no links to it anywhere else. reply oniony 10 hours agoparentprevHmm, what's that on your belt? reply haunter 15 hours agoprevI still prefer reddit most of the time. Front page (default) subs are highly manipulated (especially anything news, politics, current things etc.) but for hobbies, video games, and sports it's still the best site. Video game discusssions especially because unlike Discord every tip, guide, and walkthrough is archived and searchable. And for sports mostly because it's _insane_ how quickly you get highlights and videos. I watch a game on my TV > goal scored > reddit alrady has the highlight posted 30secs ago. And there are countless wholesome little hobby subs which are focusing on one thing only and that what makes them great. Honestly my main problem with reddit was always the moderation, that how one sub can be taken over by certain ideologies. Which is worse when it happens to local (country, city) subs. I can't ready my city's sub because it's always the same tired politics posts instead of \"what are some good restaurants\" or \"here is a photo of a building I've never seen before\". reply Havoc 9 hours agoparentYup. Banned from my home countries sub because I dared posting to another sub. Literally bot based autobans by monitoring user for ANY participation in subs the mods don’t approve of. That’s what counts as moderation these days on Reddit. Parts of Reddit are still ok but others are utter trashfires presided over by power tripping lunatics that have taken over the asylum reply yieldcrv 9 hours agorootparentThrowaway accounts are the greatest I have an account all about some particular vice and honestly its been well received There are VERY FEW ad hominem attacks. Its like people treat you better when they know they cant hurt you in comparison to people that try to have a post history tip toeing around topics and subs. I think it’s symptomatic of what you see with other extreme personalities, they wind up getting so many followers that either agree with them or amplify them that they keep up that character. But this reddit version actually lets me navigate mainstream subs easier too, and ppl that try to suggest I cant have an intelligent opinion because of my post history get jumped on for being unprogressive or something. It’s amusing, and freeing. reply Havoc 2 hours agorootparentThat makes sense. Though at that stage - needing throw always to participate - I do wonder whether it’s worth interacting at all. reply verzali 12 hours agoparentprevNiche subreddits are still good, but above a certain size they all seem to become awful. Moderation is a major problem - not just the unpaid nature of it, but because so many of the moderators are terrible at their jobs or just sold out to some other cause. I've found myself drifting away from Reddit in the past year and now actually spend more time on dedicated forums (I was surprised by how many are still out there!) reply some_random 12 hours agorootparentThe biggest problem with mods is that normal people do not have the interest nor energy to moderate a subreddit past a certain point, so they end up getting muscled out by weirdos as a sub grows. reply robswc 11 hours agorootparentThis is 1000% the reason. It almost self-selects for the worst type of people. You not only have to have tons of free time, you have to be willing to be \"paid\" for your work in the small amounts of power you can wield in an online discussion board. In theory if you have a few people they could contribute a bit of time and have it covered... but like you say, the weirdos \"out-spend\" them on time and muscle their way in. reply floxy 10 hours agorootparentWorst of all, we probably have now immortalized this behavior in-the-before-AI-times archive, so that if you want to have an AI moderator, it will probably try to mimic the broken behavior. reply SkyPuncher 10 hours agorootparentprevI briefly modded a subreddit (before deleted my account in the blackout).

I’ve been banned for some very asinine/trivial reasons, you could feel the fedora being tipped through the screen every time. My favourite was when I commented on a post on /r/art of a naked woman, replying to a guy who was complaining that only naked women got on the front page, to which I commented with “it’s very simple, naked woman = upvotes”. I was permabanned immediately after with no reason given, so when I asked what rule I broke, I was replied with - and I quote literally - “the one you didn’t read :)”. I still have no idea what rule I broke, if I even broke one. Now, I could honestly not care any less about it, it was just an interesting interaction because of how unprofessional it was. It is kind of understandable, given that these guys don’t even get paid to moderate a very considerable influx of content, but still, it’s a very mild example of a larger problem that spans across the whole website. You have power tripping moderators that just do whatever they feel, some of them even banning based on what subs you interacted prior, regardless of content, and some of them even moderate hundreds, if not thousands, of subs. It’s insane. And yeah, any sub that has even the slightest hint of anything political is FUBAR. It’s almost like the moderation never evolved past what I would expect from a niche joomla forum from the 2000 with hundreds of users… except now it’s one of the biggest sites on the internet.

So I go to check, and sure enough, the pattern of posts by the parent poster is very inhuman, to put it one way. Strings of reposts of the same thing to many many subs in a short period of time, over and over and over again. I wouldn't go so far as to say reddit has been taken over by bots but I've started to wonder more and more about it. I generally feel like things have subtly but noticably changed for the worse since the exodus but I can't name a replacement in general except for some topic specific forums here and there. On the bright side I do think the new UI has improved noticably. I still revert to the old site often but the new site is better than it used to be. reply suby 2 hours agorootparentThis is an irrelevant tangent, but bots reposting content which previously was highly upvoted reminds me of exponential backoff in networking. The reposting serves as an automated way to maximally spread popular content to the widest range of website visitors, until the value of additional reposts diminishes and the bots reduce their reposting frequency on that item because it's no longer hitting the highs. It probably doesn't work out that way in practice since the karma farming bots may not be that sophisticated, but I think it's a cool idea at least. reply Teever 6 hours agorootparentprevHere's an example of a bot account that has an outsized influence on niche political subreddits: https://old.reddit.com/user/nimobo reply pixl97 14 hours agorootparentprevLook for reposts of the same topics and comments.

They come back with a new account. Delete, ban, move on, implement limits on new accounts. They would then spend months warming up new accounts, using them to write regular posts and messages, before doing the same thing. This was a thankless task and most regular users never realized it was even going on. Then, on the other side, there were people who absolutely lost it when they felt you made a bad decision. I deleted a post asking for cash under the table work in a local sub, combined with multiple people offering what looked like clearly illegal work. Multiple regular members of the community went absolutely crazy, as if I had personally wronged them. I enjoyed running the subreddit but I had to give up.

So, if the admins of the site to a really good job of banning accounts that exist for the purpose of vote manipulation, then voting works ok. If not the votes that generally dictate how well a post/topic does occur within the first few minutes of posting. Post topic -> Upvote -> Post conformation messages of approval of the topic -> bots upvote these posts -> bots downvote anyone that disagree. Moreso, downvotes themselves don't directly address things like raids and sustained attacks by bad actors. These kinds of attacks make the end user feel like they don't want to be in that subforum driving them off elsewhere and lowering participation.

Correct. There are powermods who \"moderate\" hundreds of subreddits. This is not an exaggeration. Hundreds. At least one has/had thousands. Why do they do this, when they are not paid? When questioned, they invariably say that they \"just watch the incoming queue\" or something, and the other mods \"do all the work\". While likely true in the literal sense (again, hundreds), such answers of course completely evade the question. Remember, \"Most of What You Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People\" . This also applies to powermods, assuming they're not being paid on the side to push some ideology (/r/politics being an obvious example). As you said, losers who crave ruling a petty fiefdom because it's the only thing they can exercise agency over in their lives. And/or are mentally ill. Quoting another: >and for each moderator there are 100 sycophants and narcissists lined up to take their place Most mods know this, which is why so many surrendered and reopened their subreddits during the recent \"protest\" the moment admins told them that otherwise they would be replaced. /r/formula1's mods forthrightly said as much; those of /r/nba claimed that negotiations had progressed far enough to justify reopening, which the thousands of replies show that the userbase 100% disbelieves. Even worse, a) /r/nba's top mod made more than 150 comments to six other NBA teams' subreddits during the blackout. b) /r/nba mods posted secret threads—including the Game 5 discussion that they denied from their own users—and made comments during the blackout. When users discovered the threads the mods of course scrubbed the comments, but there is no way for mods to actually delete (as opposed to hiding) posts, so evidence of their hypocritical behavior will live on forever.

A tiny niche sub can get by with just a couple mods just fine, but when they get 100x as popular, can they then have 200 mods? Or have 2000 mods for the most popular subs? No, there's just no way to coordinate that many volunteers sensibly, not in an environment like Reddit. reply rifty 13 hours agoprevThe relationship between Google and Reddit goes beyond just improving normal web search for Google - it's actually symbiotic. Because Reddit has horrible search, the best way to search Reddit content is actually using Google's indexing instead. Every time the Google algorithm feeds Reddit, it's feeding itself with more '...reddit' queries. Further, I feel the role subreddits are playing is not too different to the role curated directories used to play in sorting and filtering the web ecosystem for Google when it’s algorithm was considered good. So while there is a lot of user generated content, i feel the real benefit of Reddit to the Google algorithms quality of output, is the human sorting of content. So my theory follows: the Google algorithm has never been independently good, it has always been dependant on a large source of human curation. The Google algorithm only works well when Reddit is applied to it, because Google supplanted, or ignores the other places it happens on the web. Or worse, they've promoted and paid attention to unauthentic content curation through their SEO and 'trusted' sources initiatives. reply unclebucknasty 9 hours agoparent>the real benefit of Reddit to the Google algorithms quality of output, is the human sorting of content. I think it's 100% this. But, maybe worse. While Google is claiming they are simply giving users what they want (e.g. observing that users were adding reddit to search terms), I believe they were also getting their asses handed to them by SEO spam / gaming and their search quality nose-dived. In the last year or so I have noticed a very sharp degradation in quality, including non-user language obvious content spam taking top results. It's almost like their algo was finally broken for good and they had no response or didn't want to invest in the continued SEO cat-and-mouse while they pivot their search to AI. So, hardcoding to Reddit et. al. was the quick fix. >Google algorithm has never been independently good, it has always been dependant on a large source of human curation But, it does seem that at one time it was much better, and reliably provided reasonably useful results to non-explictly moderated results. reply bogtog 13 hours agoparentprev> Because Reddit has horrible search Sorry, but I've heard this so often, and I just don't know what people mean.

I actually have no problems with anyone using my public comments for training AI or other purposes, that's why I make them public.

I guess the goal of maximizing app usage is related to ads and tracking and also adblocking and probably fraud prevention. Pure speculation on my side but it's what everyone else seems to be doing. Lock your users into your walled garden and avoid bots, scrapers, click-fraud while improving some metrics regarding ads, as ads on mobile are probably easier to target and reddit earns more on them.

Full of dark patterns to draw people in, scores far to well in search results and often felt like very low quality results. Felt not much better than a bot driven SEO farm. Reddit was only as good as the subreddit mods and community but at its best the better subs felt more like a genuine community than an attention farm. All of these businesses seem like a terrible foundation to build real communities and I despair at the loss of independently run forums, mailing lists, news groups, blogs, rss feeds, web rings etc. Over easy access to capital ruined the web IMO. Too many companies had access to funds to build unsustainable businesses based on half arsed ideas. They over ran the more organic/amateurish/complicated alternatives reducing diversity and then either folded, got absorbed or turned to nasty practices to become sustainable. In relative terms the ratio of genuine organic content on independent platforms to content in closed platforms and generated content seems to have declined precipitously. It is possible there won't be enough content to sustain an ad driven search business. Search turning to machine learning allows them to synthesize results in the absence of indexed primary sources which can be impressive and perhaps useful in some situations but isn't what a lot of searchers want. When it comes to connecting with real people and communities I don't know how an LLM is going to entirely make up for a dying independent web. reply randycupertino 2 hours agoparentEvery so often I look up Lord of the Rings trivia on Quora and the answers there are incredibly helpful and detailed, way easier to find than reddit which is just randos spouting off, flamewars about the new amazon show and if it's cannon or posting memes about harfoot feet.

If they did the latter, it would just encourage SEO spam to move from generating fake blogs to generating fake forums full of AI discussions, and cause product spam to focus even more on posting in forums (which is already a problem). The current arrangement requires a two-step search to find good forums on a subject, then search those forums for my question rather than have Google directly surface content from the forums when I search for my question.

    "title": "Libxev: High-Performance Event Loop for Cross-Platform Development",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev",
    "originBody": "libxev libxev is a cross-platform event loop. libxev provides a unified event loop abstraction for non-blocking IO, timers, signals, events, and more that works on macOS, Windows, Linux, and WebAssembly (browser and WASI). It is written in Zig but exports a C-compatible API (which further makes it compatible with any language out there that can communicate with C APIs). Project Status: 🐲 Unstable, alpha-ish quality. The feature list is quite good across multiple platforms, but there are plenty of missing features. The project hasn't been well tested in real-world environments and there are lots of low-hanging fruit for performance optimization. I'm not promising any API compatibility at this point, either. If you want a production ready, high quality, generalized event loop implementation check out libuv, libev, etc. Why a new event loop library? A few reasons. One, I think Zig lacks a generalized event loop comparable to libuv in features (\"generalized\" being a key word here). Two, I wanted to build a library like this around the design patterns of io_uring, even mimicking its style on top of other OS primitives ( credit to this awesome blog post). Three, I wanted an event loop library that could build to WebAssembly (both WASI and freestanding) and that didn't really fit well into the goals of API style of existing libraries without bringing in something super heavy like Emscripten. The motivation for this library primarily though is scratching my own itch! Features Cross-platform. Linux (io_uring and epoll), macOS (kqueue), WebAssembly + WASI (poll_oneoff, threaded and non-threaded runtimes). (Windows support is planned and coming soon) Proactor API. Work is submitted to the libxev event loop and the caller is notified of work completion, as opposed to work readiness. Zero runtime allocations. This helps make runtime performance more predictable and makes libxev well suited for embedded environments. Timers, TCP, UDP, Files, Processes. High-level platform-agnostic APIs for interacting with timers, TCP/UDP sockets, files, processes, and more. For platforms that don't support async IO, the file operations are automatically scheduled to a thread pool. Generic Thread Pool (Optional). You can create a generic thread pool, configure its resource utilization, and use this to perform custom background tasks. The thread pool is used by some backends to do non-blocking tasks that don't have reliable non-blocking APIs (such as local file operations with kqueue). The thread pool can be shared across multiple threads and event loops to optimize resource utilization. Low-level and High-Level API. The high-level API is platform-agnostic but has some opinionated behavior and limited flexibility. The high-level API is recommended but the low-level API is always an available escape hatch. The low-level API is platform-specific and provides a mechanism for libxev users to squeeze out maximum performance. The low-level API is just enough abstraction above the OS interface to make it easier to use without sacrificing noticable performance. Tree Shaking (Zig). This is a feature of Zig, but substantially benefits libraries such as libxev. Zig will only include function calls and features that you actually use. If you don't use a particular kind of high-level watcher (such as UDP sockets), then the functionality related to that abstraction is not compiled into your final binary at all. This lets libxev support optional \"nice-to-have\" functionality that may be considered \"bloat\" in some cases, but the end user doesn't have to pay for it. Dependency-free. libxev has no dependencies other than the built-in OS APIs at runtime. The C library depends on libc. This makes it very easy to cross-compile. Roadmap There are plenty of missing features that I still want to add: Pipe high-level API Signal handlers Filesystem events Windows backend Freestanding WebAssembly support via an external event loop (i.e. the browser) And more... Performance There is plenty of room for performance improvements, and I want to be fully clear that I haven't done a lot of optimization work. Still, performance is looking good. I've tried to port many of libuv benchmarks to use the libxev API. I won't post specific benchmark results until I have a better environment to run them in. As a very broad generalization, you shouldn't notice a slowdown using libxev compared to other major event loops. This may differ on a feature-by-feature basis, and if you can show really poor performance in an issue I'm interested in resolving it! Example The example below shows an identical program written in Zig and in C that uses libxev to run a single 5s timer. This is almost silly how simple it is but is meant to just convey the overall feel of the library rather than a practical use case. Zig C const xev = @import(\"xev\"); pub fn main() !void { var loop = try xev.Loop.init(.{}); defer loop.deinit(); const w = try xev.Timer.init(); defer w.deinit(); // 5s timer var c: xev.Completion = undefined; w.run(&loop, &c, 5000, void, null, &timerCallback); try loop.run(.until_done); } fn timerCallback( userdata: ?*void, loop: *xev.Loop, c: *xev.Completion, result: xev.Timer.RunError!void, ) xev.CallbackAction { _ = userdata; _ = loop; _ = c; _ = result catch unreachable; return .disarm; } #include#include#includexev_cb_action timerCallback(xev_loop* loop, xev_completion* c, int result, void *userdata) { return XEV_DISARM; } int main(void) { xev_loop loop; if (xev_loop_init(&loop) != 0) { printf(\"xev_loop_init failure\"); return 1; } xev_watcher w; if (xev_timer_init(&w) != 0) { printf(\"xev_timer_init failure\"); return 1; } xev_completion c; xev_timer_run(&w, &loop, &c, 5000, NULL, &timerCallback); xev_loop_run(&loop, XEV_RUN_UNTIL_DONE); xev_timer_deinit(&w); xev_loop_deinit(&loop); return 0; } Installation (Zig) These instructions are for Zig downstream users only. If you are using the C API to libxev, see the \"Build\" section. This package works with the Zig package manager introduced in Zig 0.11. Create a build.zig.zon file like this: .{ .name = \"my-project\", .version = \"0.0.0\", .dependencies = .{ .libxev = .{ .url = \"https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev/archive/.tar.gz\", .hash = \"12208070233b17de6be05e32af096a6760682b48598323234824def41789e993432c\", }, }, } And in your build.zig: const xev = b.dependency(\"libxev\", .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize }); exe.addModule(\"xev\", xev.module(\"xev\")); Documentation 🚧 Documentation is a work-in-progress. 🚧 Currently, documentation is available in three forms: man pages, examples, and code comments. In the future, I plan on writing detailed guides and API documentation in website form, but that isn't currently available. Man Pages The man pages are relatively detailed! xev(7) will give you a good overview of the entire library. xev-zig(7) and xev-c(7) will provide overviews of the Zig and C API, respectively. From there, API-specifc man pages such as xev_loop_init(3) are available. This is the best documentation currently. There are multiple ways to browse the man pages. The most immediately friendly is to just browse the raw man page sources in the docs/ directory in your web browser. The man page source is a markdown-like syntax so it renders okay in your browser via GitHub. Another approach is to run zig build -Dman-pages and the man pages will be available in zig-out. This requires scdoc to be installed (this is available in most package managers). Once you've built the man pages, you can render them by path: $ man zig-out/share/man/man7/xev.7 And the final approach is to install libxev via your favorite package manager (if and when available), which should hopefully put your man pages into your man path, so you can just do man 7 xev. Examples There are examples available in the examples/ folder. The examples are available in both C and Zig, and you can tell which one is which using the file extension. To build an example, use the following: $ zig build -Dexample-name=_basic.zig ... $ zig-out/bin/example-basic ... The -Dexample-name value should be the filename including the extension. Code Comments The Zig code is well commented. If you're comfortable reading code comments you can find a lot of insight within them. The source is in the src/ directory. Build Build requires the installation of the latest Zig nightly. libxev has no other build dependencies. Once installed, zig build install on its own will build the full library and output a FHS-compatible directory in zig-out. You can customize the output directory with the --prefix flag. Tests libxev has a large and growing test suite. To run the tests for the current platform: $ zig build test ... This will run all the tests for all the supported features for the current host platform. For example, on Linux this will run both the full io_uring and epoll test suite. You can build and run tests for other platforms by cross-compiling the test executable, copying it to a target machine and executing it. For example, the below shows how to cross-compile and build the tests for macOS from Linux: $ zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-macos -Dinstall-tests ... $ file zig-out/bin/xev-test zig-out/bin/xev-test: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable WASI is a special-case. You can run tests for WASI if you have wasmtime installed: $ zig build test -Dtarget=wasm32-wasi -Dwasmtime ...",

    "commentBody": "libxev: A cross-platform, high-performance event loop (github.com/mitchellh)229 points by tosh 18 hours agohidepastfavorite26 comments mitchellh 15 hours agoThis is my project. I use it as the core cross-platform event loop layer for my terminal (https://mitchellh.com/ghostty). I still consider libxev an early, unstable project but the terminal has been in use by hundreds to now over a thousand beta testers daily for over a year now so at least for that use case its very stable. :) I know of others using it in production shipped software, but use it at your own risk. As background, my terminal previously used libuv (the Node.js core event loop library), and I think libuv is a great project! I still have those Zig bindings available (archived) if anyone is interested: https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-libuv The main issue I had personally with libuv was that I was noticing performance jitter due to heap allocations. libxev's main design goal was to be allocation-free, and it is. The caller is responsible for allocating all the memory libxev needs (however it decides to do that!) and passing it to libxev. There were some additional things I wanted: more direct access to mach ports on macOS, io_uring on Linux (although I think libuv can use io_uring now), etc. But more carefully controlling memory allocation was the big one. And it worked! Under heavy IO load in my terminal project, p90 performance roughly matched libuv but my p99 performance was much, much better. Like, 10x or more better. I don't have those numbers in front of me anymore to back that up and my terminal project hasn't built with libuv in a very long time. But I consider the project a success for my use case. You're probably better off using libuv (i.e. the Node loop, not my project) for your own project. But, the main takeaway I'd give people is: don't be afraid to reimplement this kind of stuff for you. A purpose-built event loop isn't that complicated, and if your software isn't even cross-platform, it's really not complicated. reply mattgreenrocks 13 hours agoparentVery nice! TBH, libuv sometimes felt like it is popular because it's popular rather than sheer technical prowess. I was never comfortable with how much allocation is done by it, and I don't always find how it deals with platform primitives as useful as I'd like. > don't be afraid to reimplement this kind of stuff for you. A purpose-built event loop isn't that complicated, Amen. There's no need to view the event loop as mysterious. It's just a while loop that is constantly coordinating IO. reply password4321 11 hours agoparentprev> libxev's main design goal was to be allocation-free Maybe \"allocation-free\" should be in the GitHub project description instead of or in addition to \"high performance\". reply samsquire 14 hours agoparentprevThank for you for sharing. What do you think are the next steps for a next generation event loop? I've been experimenting with barriers/phasers, LMAX Disruptors and my own lock free algorithms. I think some form of multithreaded structured concurrency with coroutines and io_uring. I've been experimenting with decoupling the making sending and recv independently parallel with multiple io_urings \"split parallel io\" - so you can process incoming traffic separately from the stream that generates data to send. Generating sends is unblocked by receive parsing and vice versa.

Scheduling things to other threads is expensive. The reason it works this way isn't good and we will fix it but haven't prioritized it yet reply eqvinox 12 hours agoprevAs someone maintaining a project with its own event loop: don't do it in larger projects. The problem is that you'll start having dependencies on external libraries. And when those then need event loop integration, things get messy. We've introduced bugs before, caused by subtle differences in semantics. (Like: does write imply read? Are events disarmed while running? What about errors?) If the lib and event loop are reasonably popular, someone else probably has integrated them before. Or the lib supports the event loop natively (or uses libverto.) Either saves you some trouble. Also: please add libverto support for your event loop :) https://github.com/latchset/libverto reply GoblinSlayer 50 minutes agoparentThe interface looks like verto is linux first design, like git. But what's the point? Just implement epoll like Illumos did.

The README only states that I use kqueue on macOS, but I don't claim it is specific or originated from macOS. I've read the README over a few times and can't find where you'd get the feeling that it's a macOS-only thing. If I can edit it in any way to make that clearer let me know. libxev is not compatible with BSD currently because macOS's kqueue API is very slightly different from BSDs to make it incompatible (i.e. I use mach ports a lot on macOS, but other parts of the syscall interface also vary slightly). reply asveikau 15 hours agorootparentIf you depend heavily on Mach ports I don't think \"kqueue (macOS)\" is an accurate description. That makes it sound like it has more of a chance to work on BSD than it does. reply mitchellh 14 hours agorootparentIt is an accurate description. The mach ports are waited on through kqueue, and I use kqueue for all other waiters with \"standard\" fds (i.e. files). But my usage of mach ports (even for a partial use case) make it incompatible with BSD, and even if I didn't use mach ports the kqueue structures used by macOS are slightly different and incompatible anyways, and I don't claim BSD support anywhere. It's splitting hairs and being a bit pedantic, but you also reordered my descriptions: in the README I always say \"macOS (kqueue)\" and not the reverse which you incorrectly quoted. I think that makes a small but tangible difference. reply asveikau 12 hours agorootparentI did misread and misquote that. But when a remark is parenthetical I guess I consider them equivalent. macOS and kqueue is not equivalent. Maybe macOS (using kqueue and Mach ports) would make it clearer? reply cornstalks 5 hours agorootparentNo one but you is saying macOS and kqueue are equivalent.
