And if so, is there evidence OpenSign has done this kind of SME research to make sure the electronic signatures are legally binding, or is this more \"we brought in some devs and UI designers and built something\" without actual legal review and guidance? reply kemitchell 9 hours agoparentI haven&#x27;t researched the law here in a while, but my general impression the last time I did was that there isn&#x27;t much in the way of legal requirements for signing things digitally beyond the federal ESIGN Act, general principles of state contract law, and the smattering of very particular kinds of transactions that require processes like notarization or recording. For everyday deals between the vast majority of people and companies, it really comes down to whether what the e-sign collects and saves will be available and convincing down the line, when there&#x27;s a dispute.When dealing with government entities, you may run into policies of those entities that require use of a pre-approved service. For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.ca.gov&#x2F;administration&#x2F;regulations&#x2F;current-re...All that said, I have both implemented electronic signature in my own software and reliably recommended clients running sales ops just buy DocuSign. Familiarity and credibility can matter way more than legal or technical details...or not at all. reply anonymous_sorry 38 minutes agorootparentDoes this hold true in the rest of the world? reply 3c6bYDXLMj 23 minutes agorootparentI am in Australia and the situation is largely the same. reply Projectiboga 8 hours agorootparentprevSupreme Court said you can agree to things online awhile ago. reply jacurtis 5 hours agorootparentNothing in the American legal system is that straightforward and simple, even less so among our Supreme Court. Things got even more confusing now that this year the Supreme Court has set a new precedent that they can now overturn their own rulings from decades earlier.While I think that’s generally true that online signatures are acceptable in most circumstances, I’d be careful to blindly believe it as a blanket statement. reply vitus 5 hours agorootparent> this year the Supreme Court has set a new precedent that they can now overturn their own rulings from decades earlierWhat happened this year specifically?Dobbs was in June 2022, but that isn&#x27;t even close to the first time that the Supreme Court overturned precedent from 50+ years prior -- Brown v Board largely overturned Plessy v Ferguson (\"separate but equal\") from nearly 60 years prior.And, we&#x27;ve had plenty of Supreme Court precedents overruled since the 19th century. According to Congress: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitution.congress.gov&#x2F;resources&#x2F;decisions-overru...(Most of those never rose to the level of landmark decisions, but Plessy certainly did.) reply otteromkram 1 hour agorootparentRoe v. Wade reply dataviz1000 1 hour agorootparentprevClick wrap is binding. reply thathndude 7 hours agoparentprevLawyer here. Not legal advice. Really not that much by way of law to consider. If everyone agrees that an E-signature is good, then, generally speaking, an e-signature is good. I’d suggest it’s more on the people actually drafting the documents being signed than the software layer facilitating. reply ildon 4 hours agorootparentLawyer here as well, but from Europe. Here the same is true, unless the government is involved.Documents from&#x2F;to any agency, including anything that has any tax relevance, - generally speaking (there are many caveats) - shall be signed with services compliant with the e-signature standards provided by Regulation 2014&#x2F;910&#x2F;EU (in short: PADES, CADES, XADES).Out of curiosity: is there a similar requirement in terms of e-signature in the US when documents need to be sent to some agency, such as the IRS? reply graemep 2 hours agorootparentprevNot a lawyer, but I know the position in the UK is pretty simple and much the same.The purpose of someone like Docusign is to provide a trusted third party to provide evidence.For most purposes GPG signed email (or anything else with a similar signature) would work perfectly well provided you could prove who the keys belong to. In fact it would be better than DOcusign who can (from the few documents I have signed) ultimately only really show they sent an email with a signing link to your email address.The last one from them has a warning:\"Do Not Share This Email This e-mail contains a secure link to DocuSign. Please do not share this e-mail, link or access code with others.\" reply dlandau 2 hours agorootparentFor most purposes a normal email with no signatures is fine too. reply alexopensource 6 hours agorootparentprevTrue. Even if one party from the signers dont trust e-sign, it wont work. But the number of people thinking an E-signature is good is only increasing day by day. reply menzoic 5 hours agorootparentI think by everyone they meant everyone involved in the contract being signed reply wrs 13 hours agoparentprevDocuSign itself just refers you to your own counsel for legal advice, but does publish and update a handy multi-country legal reference.For the US one, at least, they give examples of where electronic signatures are pretty common and straightforward, and where you need to be careful.Software-wise, they have features to help you show evidence of who signed, where, and when in multiple ways. Nothing magical, though.If there were secret sauce, you would think they’d mention it prominently, but they don’t.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docusign.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;electronic-signature&#x2F;legal... reply alexopensource 12 hours agorootparentWe also generate a completion certificate that has the time & ip addresses of everyone who accessed and modified a doc during the entire signing process, plus we are open source which means more transparent. We plan to publish a lot of content in that space but with limited resources currently we plan to build the product features first. Also, we are soon going to start our fund raise efforts which will ultimately speed up things. reply djbusby 10 hours agorootparentThose certs integrated with with any Timestamp Authority? reply szundi 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd soon after suddenly the Pricing page appears, after 3 months of disappointment convenient features turn paying ones. In some more years it is just as expensive as Docusign.Eh sorry, I’m just sad about Rocket Chat. reply alexopensource 11 hours agorootparentThe self hosted version will always be free :) reply josephcsible 11 hours agorootparentYour CONTRIBUTING.md file says \"By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.\" Since OpenSign is AGPLv3, why don&#x27;t you allow contributions under the same license, if the self hosted version will always be free? I&#x27;m worried that the purpose of that might be to let you make it proprietary later. reply anonymous_sorry 17 minutes agorootparentI guess this allows them integrate with proprietary code on their back end if necessary, whilst making it hard for a competitor to take their code and undercut them, since most corps with proprietary software to protect won&#x27;t touch AGPLv3 with a barge pole.Nothing prevents an AGPLv3 fork if OpenSign goes proptrietary in future.I&#x27;d rather this approach than yet another non-standard Amazon-proof licence. reply tormeh 7 hours agorootparentprevAGPL for thee but not for me, for I require MIT.To be fair, this is an entirely reasonable way to do business, but it&#x27;s also a bit funny. replyfigassis 11 hours agoparentprevWouldn’t it be amazing, since e signatures have been around for ages, that governments just published the requirements for legally binding digital signatures rather than ask each maker to go talk to them and get some obscure license or blessing? reply eKIK 6 hours agorootparentIn the EU this is actually the case since 2016. There&#x27;s this regulation called eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services).Article 26 (linked below) describes the requirements for an electronic signature to be legally binding.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eid.as&#x2F;#article26 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EIDAS reply amolshejole 11 hours agorootparentprevYeh, its already happening in a lot of regions across the world. We see a future that will have more open standards, it is precisely the reason we are working on this solution now. reply jeron 10 hours agorootparentprevHow else will DocuSign have a moat?? reply saled 11 hours agoparentprevYou know that there&#x27;s nothing stopping an open source project funded as a not for profit from doing the same thing right?If something is hard, that&#x27;s an argument for making a standard not for profit version of it, so it becomes a common good instead of platform rent seekers keeping out competition by saying it&#x27;s \"too hard\". reply nonethewiser 10 hours agorootparentHow do you personally differentiate between “rent seeking” and running a business? reply kurthr 9 hours agorootparentNot the OP, and this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m dramatically invested in, but...Rent seeking would be designing a product for collecting rent (not a one time payment) for a product (e.g. SaS) that doesn&#x27;t wear out or has separate maintenance costs. Like a house that is rented the value comes from the income stream and it likely is adjusted by something like inflation.Not renting would be selling a product for a one time fee, perhaps even if there are many customers (you still get to play ticket pricing games like the airlines so different people pay different amounts at different times, but not as variable as rent). Making the product non-transferable blurs the rent line a bit. Also not rental is the maintenance or improvement on the product (or the house) since that is new work that is being done.It used to be that only physical objects were rented and services were inherently work and required new effort&#x2F;ingenuity to be solved each time. However, with the introduction of art reproduction (visual, audio, physical) and copyright&#x2F;patent, as well as, non-perpetual licensing of software this is no longer the case. It&#x27;s possible to hold a piece of intellectual property and collect perpetual rent with little or no future investment.It does create a different incentive structure that can be quite customer hostile. reply robertlagrant 9 hours agorootparentRent seeking is trying to create a legal&#x2F;regulatory structure that means you can farm people. E.g. coming to the UK from some countries you need to prove you can speak English. Assuming you can, and you need a waiver on the test, there is a sole organisation you can pay hundreds of pounds to to send them your degree certificate, and for them to say in some government UI \"yes, this probably means they can speak English\".It&#x27;s not just general and optional recurring payments. reply kurthr 2 hours agorootparentRegulatory lock-in is certainly one method of guaranteeing rent. I&#x27;d argue copyrights and patents are as well. Microsoft and Google get accused of rent seeking because of their near monopolies, but I don&#x27;t think most of their income is particularly based on regulation. You find other forms of lock-in can come from network effects in social media (Facebook), or B2B lock-in due to outsourcing of basic business operations (IBM, Oracle, Salesforce). reply nonethewiser 9 hours agorootparentprevYou mean a SAS? The monthly payment goes towards support, maintenance, and further development. Or you could rebuy essentially the same thing every couple years. reply kurthr 2 hours agorootparentI meant a SaaS, but mistyped it. reply paulryanrogers 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen it&#x27;s &#x27;done&#x27; and you keep collecting money, without adding additional value?Like a slumlord who collects rent and does nothing to even maintain the property. Except perhaps vote down YIMBY reforms. reply hotnfresh 9 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rent-seeking reply rubberband 7 hours agoparentprevYour overall understanding is correct. People pay DocuSign to \"think\" of everything for them (which is not at all bad, it just comes at a cost). Depending on the space, you have to deal with crazy laws that no one in their right mind would know about (nor think to even consider).Essentially, \"no one ever got fired for signing with DocuSign\" (play on IBM).I&#x27;m late to the party here, but if the authors want real world examples, please reach out. reply alexopensource 4 hours agorootparentYou are right. But there are many Individuals&#x2F;companies who cannot benefit from DocuSign&#x27;s trust because of the price tag. We want to provide them the free&#x2F; open source option and during the process build a brand that is equally trusted if not more than DocuSign. reply jjeaff 13 hours agoparentprevAre there really any laws requiring special types of signatures? Because I&#x27;ve never had a legal doc sent to me that they weren&#x27;t fine with just stamping my signature on the line or even printing it out, signing it, and scanning it back in. reply p_l 11 hours agorootparentEuropean Union (and some states connecting with the same infrastructure, like Switzerland), have standardized formats as well as defined CAs that provide certificates for \"qualified\" signatures, which have the same legal weight as if you had a printed document with physical signature.DocuSign supports those mainly through some interop connections where, for example, a qualified signature vendor provides an API that DocuSign can use to sign the document. reply alexopensource 11 hours agorootparentYou are right, that is precisely the route we will also have to take for certain regions. For example in India, there are only 3 entities that are authorized by the government to enable Aadhaar based e-signature. We will have to integrate with any of those in order to be compliant. We have already started working in this direction. reply xvilka 9 hours agorootparentSimilar approach would be for signing documents in China. reply 2Gkashmiri 5 hours agorootparentprevMore than aadhar enabled signatures, India has pfx based digital signature system in place which is legally acceptable as good as a physical hand signature. reply Isthatablackgsd 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is one state agency in USA that requires wet black ink for contracts. I forgot which state it is, this happened two years ago. They said no expectations, it have to be wet black signature, period. They will inspect the PDF to check the signature that it is not e-signed.It was odd because I handled federal and state contracts in previous job, they don&#x27;t have a problem with e-signature. reply baz00 12 hours agorootparentprevDepends where you are but contracts and other legal documents are only ultimately enforceable in court usually. Electronic signatures tend to shorten that process somewhat as they provide signatory verification, contract integrity and ID verification so it&#x27;s seen as a legal risk and cost mitigation rather than an actual hard contractual requirement. reply alexopensource 12 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on jurisdiction you are located in and the level of legal safety and acceptance you need. Our solution is already able to digitally sign the document which kind of makes it tamper proof and electronically sign(draw annotations) which will have you covered in most regions. Some regions have specific laws for example India has IT Act 2000, UETA & ESIGN Act while Europe has eIDAS. reply fulafel 2 hours agoparentprevDepends on the jurisdiction and your definition of \"hard\" - in the EU there&#x27;s some kind of qualification process by the regulators but the system is supposedly design to encourage competition and be open to new providers, and it&#x27;s enough to be approved by one country&#x27;s regulators I think. reply alexopensource 13 hours agoparentprevThanks for asking the right question. We are taking legal help to be compliant with various jurisdictions. Our solution is currently able to safely sign a document with a digital signature that will make it tamper-proof and show a geen tick in Adobe PDF while keeping track of incremental annotations added by multiple signers. We envision to add support for eIDAS and AADHAAR e-sign(widely accepted in India) very soon. reply petertodd 12 hours agorootparent> Our solution is currently able to safely sign a document with a digital signature that will make it tamper-proofWho holds the secret key that actually signs the document? If this is in fact a self-hosted, open-source, project then clearly the user does, and they could sign a different, tampered, version of the document after the fact. I would hesitate to use the term \"tamper-proof\" in that situation. Right now your documentation doesn&#x27;t make it clear how this actually works.I&#x27;ll also point out, that even if you were using my OpenTimestamps scheme or some other secure timestamping system, I would still hesitate to call the solution \"tamper-proof\". The problem is that even with timestamps someone can in many situations pre-generate alternate versions of a document in advance. Calling this type of system \"tamper-resistant\" is better IMO. reply alexopensource 11 hours agorootparentIn the hosted version, we sign the document on behalf of the user using our own private key. Our roadmap also has the feature to bring your own cert(not relevant here). As soon as a user signs a document, a copy of the signed document is instantly sent to all the parties involved. This ensures that the signer cannot revoke the documents already signed. If the receiving party tries to modify the document, the signature becomes invalid. This is how we make sure that the docs are \"tamper-proof\" after signing. reply johnfonesca 1 hour agorootparent>This ensures that the signer cannot revoke the documents already signed. If the receiving party tries to modify the document, the signature becomes invalidThis,fortunately, is a feature of the PDF digital signatures standard. reply petertodd 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a reasonable, and pragmatic, way to implement this. But I&#x27;d still call it \"tamper-resistant\". One reason why is in situations where senders or recipients have modified something, proving that the _keys_ used to sign the documents were the correct ones can itself be a difficult problem. reply candiddevmike 12 hours agoparentprevAFAIK DocuSign acts as a trusted third party and protects&#x2F;prove chain of custody. Think of them like a digital notary public. reply alexopensource 12 hours agorootparentOur understanding is that DocuSign does not have any legal authority, they prove the chain of custody&#x2F;modifications using digital traces which our solution can also do, arguably in a more open way. reply ncallaway 11 hours agorootparentOne think that I think they provide (as opposed to the self hosted version) is just the fact of being a relatively neutral third party.If there’s a dispute over the veracity of a signature, it’s probably helpful to have a third party say “according to our server logs and software stack, this was signed by johndoe@example.com at 12:41pm on August 3rd, from the IP address XX.XXX.XXX.XX, and they authenticated with their email and password”. If I’m self-hosting, it’s marginally less convincing when I’m before a court if I say *my* software stack says that, since I have more direct control over it.So, I agree DocuSign doesn’t have a special status, other than being a relatively neutral third party to that dispute. But if a signature’s validity is being questioned, that third party status is probably somewhat helpful. reply rubberband 7 hours agorootparentLate to the party here, but I deal in this space all day. You are 100% correct.Disputes over eSignatures come up allllll the time. And if you mention that it was \"DocuSigned\"... although you have done nothing aside from name-dropping... it will essentially end the dispute. Not saying that it should. Just saying that it does. reply alexopensource 2 hours agorootparentHopefully people will say “OpenSigned” one day and it will have the same impact. reply toomuchtodo 12 hours agorootparentprevElectronic signatures legally recognized in the United States are provided for in the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“ESIGN”) and state and territory versions of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”).These are the regulations you’ll want to adhere to in order to provide parity with digital signature authority of traditional commercial providers (in the US at least).Great work btw!(Not an attorney, not your attorney, but happy to chip in fiat so you can consult with counsel and obtain an opinion letter from one in support of your project) reply ncallaway 11 hours agorootparentUETA has been substantially adopted by 49 states. The state of New York has their own statute.So, if you look at e-sign, UETA, and NY’s Electronic Signatures and Records Act, then you have fairly comprehensive coverage across the US.Also not an attorney, and this is also definitely not definitive legal advice! reply alexopensource 12 hours agorootparentprevSaved the info in my notes. Will discuss it with our counsel in the next meeting. Thanks :) reply benatkin 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, making a mill for supposedly trusted third parties, over having an actual trusted third party, is a more open way.Edit: I suppose in all except the free self hosted one, OpenSign would be the trusted third party, which I guess is more plausible. Unless the paid customers are given something close to root to administrate them. Still, a trusted third party is generally based on recognition. Even if I really dislike a company I eventually acknowledge they&#x27;re trusted if it lasts long enough, like with ID.me. I didn&#x27;t use ID.me until it was required for logging into the IRS and now I grudgingly admit that I think it&#x27;s an extra security check on logging in. So until you&#x27;re big like DocuSign I wouldn&#x27;t view you in quite the same way as a trusted third party.That does bring a question, are your paid customers prevented from going under the hood in such a way that they would also have to be trusted at such a level along with OpenSign?--This to say I&#x27;m open to using OpenSign, because there are plenty of uses where I would be open to using something that doesn&#x27;t have this \"trusted third party at the level of DocuSign\" feature. The \"digital notary public\" analogy is apt. I sometimes sign documents with a notary, and other times without. reply alexopensource 11 hours agorootparentGreat insights. The hosted version functions in a more or less same way as DocuSign with an added advantage of knowing what the code is doing under the hood. We dont intend to provide root&#x2F;admin privileges as its going to be a multi-tenant system at the end of the day. reply benatkin 8 hours agorootparentAh, I see. A multi-tenant system makes sense, I was thinking it might be closer to managed hosting. With managed often people have root or close to it. Just make sure people understand that it’s a multi-tenant system where the customers don’t have access to do anything which would make it less secure, unless they’re using the self-hosted version. And when you grow, maybe there will be an enterprise self-hosted and&#x2F;or managed hosting version where the customer needs to be trusted to provide security. That would be appropriate with some potential customers.So that leaves the challenge of becoming a well known trusted third party, which is a challenge but doable. replytiahura 11 hours agoparentprevYou are incorrect. I&#x27;m not familiar with any law that requires Docusign in any jurisdiction in which I practice.The Federal Esign Act provides: 15 USC 7006(5):The term “electronic signature” means an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record. reply Sebguer 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re misreading OP, they&#x27;re not saying anything about law requiring Docusign, they&#x27;re saying that Docusign has invested in meeting the law. reply SoftTalker 10 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK, anything that is intended to be a signature, is a signature. This can be a hand-drawn \"X\", a signed name, a typed name, a fingerprint, a rubber stamp, clicking \"I Agree\" checkboxes, etc. reply calvinmorrison 8 hours agoparentprevClose, the whole point of docusign is to avoid all of that by, one, paying docusign to solve those problems, and two because docusign is a \"neutral\" 3rd party who has good housekeeping records compared to \"Opensign\" where a self hosted sleazy hacker may decide he wants to fudge the datestamps on the signatures etc. reply icelancer 9 hours agoprevI went to the installation instructions:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenSignLabs&#x2F;OpenSign&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;INSTALLAT...And it says you can auto-deploy to DigitalOcean (neat) and to a local server, and instructions are included for both.There&#x27;s the bit on AWS S3 which makes sense but then no build&#x2F;install instructions for local deployment. are those somewhere else? reply johnchristopher 3 hours agoprev> You will need to create an AWS S3 bucket or digital ocean space in order to store your uploaded documentsThe org I work for would love to self-host on-premise a digital signing solution so they definitely won&#x27;t use external dependencies like AWS.

Being able to prove that a document was in fact created in the past, before a dispute existed about the document, is significantly better than not being able to prove that. OpenTimestamps is free and open source, using Bitcoin so that you don&#x27;t have a trusted third party. Timestamps made with OpenTimestamps are free, as merkle trees are used to allow the whole world&#x27;s documents to be timestamped with a single Bitcoin transaction.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentimestamps.org&#x2F;A good example of how it&#x27;s been used recently is by the official election authority in Guatemala to timestamp polling documents in their recent presidential election: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g0nnM5_Z90E reply alexopensource 12 hours agoparentThanks for the suggestion.

Or is this a \"take it or leave it\" system? reply alexopensource 12 hours agoparentIts really important to preserve the integrity of the document during the signing process because of which modifications other than annotations are currently not allowed. We are building this to support an open architecture(micro frontend based add-ons). The two add-ons currently under development are - - A document organizer for signed&#x2F;in-progress documents as we believe organizing legal documents is very different from organizing regular files as the user should be able to visually identify the status of the document and just hover on a document to see the current status of signers, etc. - An AI based assistant that will allow you to get any clause of a contract re-worded, explained, analysed for risks, etc.(we dont intend to replace lawyers here) Once we have these plugins ready.

DocuSign&#x27;s main sell from a commercial perspective is it separates the parties into the signer, the signee and the authority. If the authority is the signee or the signer then it could be considered unfair.

They care about when things somehow end up in the court, there is clear understanding of a signed document and nobody has any question about it. More or less a guarantee -- probably not really a guarantee but good enough to hold in court. If your selling point is open source or \"free\" you have already lost. reply alexopensource 12 hours agorootparentWe take pride in being open source as we are sure being open source brings a lot more transparency in the entire process. When it comes to the authenticity of a signed document, the cryptographic proofs generated by our solution and digital traces are no different than those generated by DocuSign. It will hold equally true in any court.

STINE PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 27, 2023 FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel says the FCC plans to “incentivize innovation and experimentation in the amateur radio bands” by getting rid of outdated restrictions and providing licensees with the flexibility to use modern digital emissions. The commission at its November meeting is expected to take action on a Report and Order that would eliminate the baud rate limitation and establish a bandwidth limitation in the amateur radio bands below 29.7 MHz. The order being circulated for tentative consideration by the commission would remove the baud rate limitation — the rate at which the carrier waveform amplitude, frequency and/or phase is varied to transmit information — for data emissions in the amateur radio bands, the FCC says. The current baud rate limits were adopted in 1980. The order would implement a 2.8 kilohertz bandwidth limitation in place of the baud rate in amateur radio bands. The 2.8 kHz limitation is consistent with the commission’s treatment of other wireless radio services, the FCC says. The current rules limit the baud rate for high-frequency amateur radioteletype/data transmissions to 300 baud for frequencies below 28 MHz (except in the 60-meter band), and 1200 baud in the 10 meter (28-29.7 MHZ) band. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau says the change in technical standards would allow the amateur radio service to operate more efficiently, including during times of emergency to support public safety. The American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in 2013 asked the commission to delete references to the baud rate and to establish a bandwidth limitation of 2.8 kHz. The group argued the public safety benefits of making the change. ARRL stated: “[i]ncreasing speed is especially important when amateurs voluntarily assist during and after hurricanes, forest fires and other disasters.” At the time, ARRL also told the FCC that eliminating the baud rate limitation will “incentivize innovation by allowing more data to be transmitted within each signal without increasing bandwidth from that currently used.” A spokesperson for ARRL says the organization supports the proposed action and the proposal of further notice. In a subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2016 (WT Docket No. 16-239), the FCC tentatively concluded that a 2.8 kilohertz bandwidth limitation for radioteletype and data emissions in the MF/HF bands was not necessary, and sought comment. [See Our Business and Law Page] A few commenters at the time of the NPRM opposed any rule change, arguing that the existing rules should be retained in order to protect access to amateur bands by Morse code and other narrowband transmissions. However, the commission writes in the order: “Based on the record in this proceeding, we find that the baud rate limitation has become outdated and hampers, rather than promotes, innovation and robust use of the amateur bands.” The commission continued in the new order: “We are persuaded by the weight of the record in this proceeding that, without a baud rate or bandwidth limit, data stations using a large amount of spectrum for a single emission could do so to the detriment of simultaneous use by other stations using narrowband emission modes.” In essence, the technical change mean amateurs will require less time to transmit messages, which in turn will open up more spectrum in the time domain for more amateurs to use, said David Siddall, general counsel for ARRL. “This is a very simple change. In 1980, at the inception of digital technologies that could be used by radio amateurs, the FCC adopted a speed limit of 300 baud for the stated purpose of limiting the amount of spectrum occupied by any single signal,” Siddall said. “Radio amateurs, being tinkerers and experimenters, worked to develop faster and faster speeds that still fit within the standard spectrum bandwidth. Eventually their innovations to the technology significantly increased spectrum efficiency but ran up against the FCC baud rate limit.” One of the benefits of the changes will be allowing for “faster emergency communications” by volunteer ham radio operators during emergencies, the FCC says. The agency says its Wireless Telecommunications Bureau’s Mobility Division has previously issued waivers allowing amateur operators directly involved with disaster relief efforts to exceed the baud rate limitation in the interest of public safety. The FCC at its November meeting will also consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) that proposes to remove the baud rate limitation in the 2200 meter and 630 meter bands. The commission also proposes to remove the baud rate limitation in the very high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands. The commission says it expects to seek comment on the appropriate bandwidth limitation for the 2200 meter band, the 630 meter band, and the VHF and UHF bands. Steve Stroh, editor of amateur radio newsletter Zero Retries, says the need for improved data communications in amateur radio also coincides with spectrum becoming more “noisy” due to “pollution” by systems such as LED lighting, small switching power supplies and even solar panels. “That noise has an outsize impact on analog modes such as voice and very low power transmissions. Improved data communications modes, including digital voice modes, can overcome the noise issues,” Stroh said in an email to Radio World. Stroh says he is happy to see the FCC address the same limitation on the amateur radio VHF and UHF bands — where there is arguably much greater potential for technological innovation in data communications technology — if it wasn’t for the data rate and mode limitations. “Fortunately, in its proposal, the FCC recognizes that the symbol rate and mode issue does include the Amateur Radio VHF and UHF bands. Thus the FCC’s proposal is a very good one that will significantly benefit Amateur Radio,” he said. The FCC’s next meeting is scheduled for November 15. A comment period on the FNPRM will commence 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. [Sign Up for Radio World’s SmartBrief Newsletter] RANDY J. STINE Randy J.

A baud is a raw bit in a digital data stream, it can either be data or part of the channel protocol. For example, a typical serial port like you have on a PC or an Arduino or something might operate at 9600 baud, each \"chunk\" consisting of a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit. That is a total of 10 bauds, two of them, the start bit and the stop bit, are part of telling the circuit where the data starts and stops. So 9600 baud sends 960, 8 bit bytes per second over the line or only 7,680 bits per second. With me so far?Okay, so the reason baud rates were used is because digital modes were modulated using a technique calls \"frequency shift keying\" or FSK. Frequency shift keying would send one tone for a zero bit, and one tone for a one bit. Those tones were detected with a circuit called a tone detector circuit and typically they needed a few tens of cycles of the tone to reliably detect the tone. A higher frequency tone meant you could detect it sooner (shorter time for the detector to latch on to the frequency) and that would give you a higher baud rate. But if you&#x27;re modulating a higher frequency tone on to an RF carrier, it creates a wider impact on the spectrum and everything else was predicated on 2.5kHz max width voice channels. So allowing a faster baudrate, using FSK modulation, would result in digital modes taking up way more spectrum and thus limit the number of users.But between then and now, there has been a freakin&#x27; Cambrian explosion of modulation techniques because digital signal processing is just math. We have a whole stable of techniques in the barn because of this, And as a result, you can put a lot more bits on a channel without pushing the spectrum bandwidth out.A lot of people have pointed out to the FCC that making the limit baud rate based was silly if they really wanted it to be a spectrum bandwidth limit. Just make it that, and the experimental folks will compete to see how many bauds they can fit into that space.I will admit I am biased, I&#x27;m one of those folks who got back into Amateur Radio because I was playing around with SDRs and wanted to start trying new modulation techniques. I am not motivated by \"QSOs in every state\" or every country, I&#x27;m motivated by \"I just pulled an image off a weather balloon over the Atlantic ocean on 20 meters!\" and \"I can see my beacon 500 miles away on the KiwiSDR network!\" things like that. So this change is really going to open up a lot of space for experimentation for me and I can&#x27;t wait. reply lbourdages 12 hours agoparent> A baud is a raw bit in a digital data stream, it can either be data or part of the channel protocol.If we wanna be pedantic, a baud is not a bit, it&#x27;s a symbol. It may be equivalent in some modulation schemes but in things like quadrature amplitude modulation, 1 baud > 1 bit. It goes up to 32768-QAM at 15 bits per symbol. reply ChuckMcM 11 hours agorootparentYou are absolutely correct. My experience, which is by no means exhaustive, is that \"symbol rate\" vs \"baud rate\" vs \"bit rate\" and \"protocol encoding\" vs \"data bits\" are topics that go deep but can quickly overwhelm someone thinking about this stuff for the first time (or at least nearly so). So to reassure you I was trying to be more \"accessible\" than \"precise\" in my writing here. And yes, I often miss the mark and go too far one way or the other.That said building large constellation QAM modulator&#x2F;demodulators is a lot of fun I&#x27;ve discovered, but building real world modems that can deal with fading, reflections, and multipath takes away the fun pretty quickly :-). reply Turing_Machine 6 hours agorootparentprevYes. Suppose you&#x27;re communicating with signal flags. You have a black flag and a white flag, and assign them to represent 0 and 1 respectively. If you can change flags once per second, you have a bit rate of 1 bit per second, and the baud rate is also 1 (1 flag change per second).Now suppose you have a red flag and a green flag as well, and assign black = 00, white = 01, red = 10, and green = 11.If it still takes you one second to change flags, the baud rate is still one. However, each symbol change now encodes two bits, so the bit rate has doubled, to two bits per second. reply aliljet 12 hours agoparentprevThis is so damn cool. How do you discover services in this environment (e.g., how does that weather balloon announce it has an image?) reply ChuckMcM 10 hours agorootparentThere are lots of ways, one possible way being an indication in the beacon package via APRS or WSPR that a new image is available. \"SSTV\" is a protocol for sending \"Slow Scan TeleVision\" images over the air on 10 meters which is 28 MHz which has decent propagation. Generally such transmissions are energy intensive and might blip on then blip off given a solar charged power source. Most Amateur balloons just tell you where they happen to be at the moment via GPS co-ordinates. reply baz00 11 hours agorootparentprevAmateur radio is mostly lots of pointing stuff at things and waiting. reply sidewndr46 11 hours agorootparentnot sure you what you&#x27;re thinking of, but most amateur radio can be done with an omni antenna. reply ChuckMcM 11 hours agorootparentto be fair a lot of high frequency stuff has pointing :-) But certainly HF stuff, especially below 30MHz, is like any old wire will do.

Is there a technical reason for it like causing interference or something? reply ryukoposting 7 hours agoparent> Is there a technical reason for it like causing interference or something?That&#x27;s correct, more or less.There&#x27;s this thing called \"frequency shift keying\" (FSK) which was the de facto standard digital modulation technique at the time the regulations were created. With FSK, you transmit data by toggling back and forth between two frequencies. That abrupt jumping back-and-forth creates hellish interference for people trying to use nearby frequencies.Today, the obvious solution is to limit bandwidth so that there&#x27;s a healthy amount of space for people to avoid that interference. However, in a (1970s&#x2F;1980s) world where FSK is the only widespread modulation scheme, that wasn&#x27;t really the mindset. The way they saw it was simpler: \"higher baudrates demand more bandwidth, and more bandwidth creates more interference.\" Thus, they regulated baudrate as a means of regulating bandwidth.The impetus for the rule change is simple: we have better modulation techniques nowadays. In case I haven&#x27;t bored you to death, the simplest one to explain is probably GFSK. It&#x27;s similar to FSK, but instead of abruptly jumping between the two frequencies, you gradually slide back and forth between them (the \"G\" stands for Gaussian). GFSK requires more precise electronics, but it doesn&#x27;t cause as much trouble for people trying to operate at nearby frequencies. There are countless other modulation techniques as well. Bluetooth is probably the most notable implementation of GFSK (though modern Bluetooth actually uses something else).For completeness: FSK is very useful and it&#x27;s still widely used today. Your garage door opener uses it, among other things. reply Steltek 13 hours agoparentprevWhen the limit was put in place, we didn&#x27;t know that symbol rate and baud rate could be different. A lot of these discoveries really came into their own during the 90&#x27;s and enabled far more data transmission than previously imagined.However, amateur radio has some natural conservatism to it, like Morse code requirements (since retired) to gatekeep the hobby. Getting rid of this baud rate limit is long overdue as analog transmissions are laughably archaic for anything outside amateur radio. reply Crunchified 12 hours agorootparentPlenty of stories of old hams that became dysphagic following a stroke, but could still chat with fellow hams using Morse - whether using simple finger movements in the hospital or months later on-the-air. reply selfhoster11 13 hours agorootparentprevMorse sounds like a useful thing, really.

The cleaner your oscillator and the narrower your output the better.

It is not a mode that can easily automated. replythrtythreeforty 13 hours agorootparentprevDo you mean bit rate and baud rate can be different? My understanding is that baud rate and symbol rate are the same thing. reply mal10c 12 hours agorootparentBaud rate and symbol rate often refer to the same thing, especially in the context of digital communications. However, they don&#x27;t necessarily equate to the bit rate. In the digital realm, we&#x27;re familiar with the concept of 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s, which represent binary states. When we transmit a single bit, it can be visualized as a digital line being high (for 1) or low (for 0). The rate at which this line transitions from one state to another is called the baud rate or symbol rate.To understand this further, let&#x27;s consider a more advanced modulation scheme. Instead of just having two states (high and low) to represent binary bits, imagine we have four distinct states: high, medium-high, medium-low, and low. These states can represent combinations of bits as follows: high = 11, medium-high = 10, medium-low = 01, and low = 00.In this scenario, each state transition represents a symbol, and since each symbol can represent two bits, the symbol rate (or baud rate) is half of the bit rate. If you know the symbol rate and want to determine the bit rate, you&#x27;d multiply the symbol rate by the number of bits per symbol. In this example, you&#x27;d multiply the baud rate by two.Most signals rely on techniques beyond simple voltage differences though to transfer information, and that&#x27;s when you delve into the world of RF theory. Instead of a discrete voltage, a sine wave is used at a particular frequency. The amplitude of the sine wave can be adjusted just like we adjusted the voltage on that line. If we want even more symbols, maybe 0000 to 1111 or bigger, we can introduce another variation to the sine wave called phase. Phase of a sine wave is just shifting it left or right, but could be visualized as two people on a race track. If they start a race from the same line and run at the same speed in the same direction, they&#x27;re in phase. If one of them starts a quarter of the way ahead from the other and they both run at the same speed in the same direction, then he&#x27;s a quarter phase shifted from the other.That adjustment of phase and amplitude falls into a broad category of RF modulation called QAM, and it&#x27;s used in more than RF between two radios. It can also be used over Ethernet or PCIe busses.I could go on rambling for a long time on all this, but hopefully this helps answer your question. reply Steltek 13 hours agorootparentprevOops, yeah and it&#x27;s not quite my domain of expertise. In fact, that&#x27;s the big draw for me: Amateur radio has been amazing for filling in knowledge gaps of low level electrical engineering details. it takes things way past the simple CPU&#x2F;system models from university CS class and the Arduino DC logic hobby projects. The educational potential is really top notch. reply fsckboy 13 hours agorootparentprevif there are two possible symbols in your communication medium that you switch between, bit rate is baud rate (with the two symbols being 0 and 1).

The rules were what they were, and amateurs experimented within those rules such as modifying fax modems for use on HF.The FCC set the rules, not a bunch of old farts upset that the morse code test was eliminated.

Rate limits restrict the amount of spectrum one occupies, leaving more of it for use by other operators.There are other restrictions like this. For instance, in my country, only clubs are allowed to transmit analog TV continously.

I can understand the point, but I would rather experiment with low-bandwidth modes than to take larger portions of the spectrum with faster, potentially wasteful modes. reply kmbfjr 9 hours agoparentprevTwo reasons, avoid interference because the benchmark was a generously wide single-sideband transmission, and to avoid creating the opportunity for competition with commercial services.When these rules were adopted, a phone call to Europe was $3 per minute and a Telex as $10 for thirty words. reply TedDoesntTalk 13 hours agoparentprevI think to limit the amount of spectrum used by any one signal… prevent bandwidth hogs. reply gaze 13 hours agoparentprevIn nearly all cases, the lower the baud rate, the lower the bandwidth.

You can come up with sufficiently pathological cases but indeed it’s the bandwidth that should be limited.This is not the case for classical frequency-shift amateur radioteletype. This sends two tones on single sideband, at 2125 Hz or 2295 Hz. So it uses up about 2.3KHz of bandwidth no matter how low the baud rate goes. 45.45 baud is classic mechanical Teletype speed, so the bandwidth is about 50x the data rate in that mode. You can do FSK up to maybe 600 baud; you need a few cycles to detect the tone frequency with classical filters. 300 is a traditional limit. Beyond that antique technology, you need a modulation scheme less than half a century old. reply Johnythree 10 hours agorootparentYour \"2.3KHz of bandwidth\" is caused by using a wide SSB filter to send a relatively narrow shift of 170Hz.You equally could have used a narrower filter. reply Animats 9 hours agorootparentPre-single-sideband suppressed carrier systems used an AM carrier, so there really were two audio tones.

I think that encrypting a message so that only certain people could decipher it would fall under the category of \"messages encoded for the purpose of obscuring their meaning.\" Yes, you could encrypt a message with a published standard, but to be legal I think there would have to be some specific exceptions made to allow it because it ultimately runs afoul of the spirit of that rule. reply NovemberWhiskey 13 hours agoparentprev>services like winlink and digital messaging are hampered without encryption and become unsafe for the operatorsHow so? reply vorpalhex 13 hours agorootparentYour messages are cleartext, can be forged, and your password can be trivially grabbed across just a few logins.It&#x27;s like pre-https internet basically.This also means winlink shouldn&#x27;t be used for PII (which is sort of important in an emergency!).If you can at least key exchange and encrypt between you and the next node, you have some safeguards and your messages aren&#x27;t in the clear - but that is currently prohibited by the regs. reply kwk1 12 hours agorootparent> Your messages are cleartext, can be forgedDigital signatures are permissible under the current rules and in principle avoid this issue although the software tooling around it isn&#x27;t there.

The vast majority of modern hobbyist radio technology involves encryption as an integral part-- both because the ease of abuse has made cryptography a mandatory feature for communications generally, because radio censorship rules are incompatible with lots of perfectly reasonable communications (you can&#x27;t lawfully read HN over the radio, for example, because posts can and sometimes do contain naughty-words... you can&#x27;t even read most ham radio internet message boards over the radio!) and because it&#x27;s a standard part of existing protocols and software designed for usage over the internet.The ham prohibitions on encryption are just keeping that usage out of ham bands which, particularly in UHF remain somewhere between dead and completely dead. This will ultimately result in our loss of these allocations, and the experimental usage is hampered by the restrictions in the ISM bands and the lack of potential for coordination that comes from having identified and competent operators.> Part of the beauty of ham is being able to go along the dial and be able to observe the traffic. That would die with widespread encryption.Digital modes in general break this, because there is a proliferation of them and some are only readable if you pay considerable licensing fees or buy special licensed hardware. I disagree that this is an essential part of the radio as it&#x27;s already not true. Though, one could preserve it to a degree by requiring some amount of plaintext identification of the traffic, the identities of the parties and the purpose of the communication.> Your insulting of people who try to maintain radios for emergencies is unnecessary, too.If you&#x27;re at all familiar with amateur radio usage in the US you&#x27;ve probably encountered wackers. Heck, even if you are considered one yourself by others you&#x27;ve probably seen people worse than you. The ancestors post didn&#x27;t suggest that all emergency prep activity is excessively LARPY, at least by my read.The excessive restrictions harm more boring usage like \"I want to check my email from the woods on infrastructure that I built and maintain\". The larpy usage doesn&#x27;t care, because it&#x27;s mostly fantasy and if there were some doomsday event no one is going to care what encryption you&#x27;re using (or at least won&#x27;t be able to do anything about it). :) reply ilyt 9 hours agorootparent> The excessive restrictions harm more boring usage like \"I want to check my email from the woods on infrastructure that I built and maintain\".

Ham operators happily use the internet to communicate when appropriate and at the same time use the ham bands for playing with their radio equipment. I don&#x27;t think many of them want to use their radios to do what they do with their smartphones and vice versa.It is like saying that gliders and airliners are in competition. Even if both are about aerodynamics, no glider pilot is mad because using a glider is inconvenient for travelling overseas, no one thinks gliders have \"lost\" to airliners because of the insistance on not using engines (motorgliders exist but they are still inadequate for practical travel). Glider pilots take the plane like everyone else when going on vacation.It doesn&#x27;t mean gliders are useless, a few of them have practical applications, and they make excellent training for \"useful\" plane pilots, in fact most of the best airline pilots have flown gliders, and some still do.Same idea with ham radio.

It&#x27;s a different medium. reply nullc 10 hours agorootparentPedantically, use of amateur radio as a broadcast medium is prohibited in FCC land except for special exceptions like beacon stations. This, like the wholesale prohibition on music is also antiquated in my view -- already commercial broadcast radio is dying because of streaming. The public interest would be maximized by allowing a degree of non-commercial broadcast and music usage over amateur bands, subject to restrictions.For example, it would be pretty rad to have an event with an orchestra linked between two nearby cities with full duplex ultra low latency radio--- which can achieve much lower latency than ordinary internet due to the line-of-sight nature.Now I realize that by &#x27;broadcast&#x27; you don&#x27;t mean the rule-violating one-way-communications kind but the literal propagation characteristics. But at UHF+ it&#x27;s easier to have a directional signal than an omnidirectional one, and once you get to a few GHz it&#x27;s quite natural to have laser beam like signals. Plus, at 2m+ signals are naturally limited to the radio horizon (except for exceptional cases).Personally, when I&#x27;ve advocated for relaxations on encryption and other content restrictions I&#x27;ve done so for UHF+ (or even SHF+) bands where the degree of under-utilization and potential for spectrum reuse through directionality are very high, and abuse is inherently geographically limited by physics. reply TheSpiceIsLife 9 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be implying HAM should be something different than it is, to the point the two become largely undifferentiated. reply genmud 12 hours agoparentprevI thought the encryption restriction was only for analog radio, not digital? reply unethical_ban 12 hours agorootparentNo. You can encode data digitally, per a specification, but you can&#x27;t encode it. reply genmud 9 hours agorootparentSo, why wouldn’t you be able to encrypt the data you send before digital encoding? reply unethical_ban 7 hours agorootparentI meant you can&#x27;t encrypt it. And the other person is correct. It&#x27;s simply against the rules and the spirit of ham radio. reply BenjiWiebe 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause it is against the rules. reply nullc 11 hours agoparentprevAgreed-- at least relaxing the restriction for UHF&#x2F;SHF signals on a \"secondary usage\" basis (traffic must yield to plaintext). Potentially with with reduced power (say 100w) or minimum directionality, but I think a &#x27;secondary usage&#x27; would be sufficient. Without doing so virtually all non-HF experimentation will continue to be deflected onto the ISM bands and we will lose our allocations through disuse.So long as identification is still decodable, spectrum usage can be managed.It&#x27;s sufficient to prohibit commercial usage you don&#x27;t need plaintext to do so. The old threat of tow trucks and cab services moving onto ham-bands had long since been mooted by ubiquitous cellular, but even if it weren&#x27;t any significant commercial usage will eventually have a whistleblower. Usage that is obscure enough to not be vulnerable to whistleblowers could also be hidden just as well in \"plaintext\" traffic that was really uncrackable steganography.As it stands you can&#x27;t even lawfully log into your own personal systems over amateur radio even if you take the unreasonable steps of using specially modified software to authenticate-but-not-encrypt because inevitably some third party will send a message to you via the internet that contains some naughty words that aren&#x27;t permitted over the radio.Without relaxing the encryption rules, innovative radio usage like meshtastic (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meshtastic.org&#x2F;) will continue to be pushed onto ISM bands where (1) they&#x27;re still technically unlawful because the homebrew hardware is not type-accepted (amateur bands are the ONLY place where homebrew intentional radiators are allowed!) and (2) where the band choices, power limit, and EIRP limits are detrimental to full exploration of the possibilities.Besides, the FCC has long allowed proprietary, license fee bearing, patent encumbered digital modes. These are very close to encryption in terms of their ability to lock others out of ham comms, and have frequently been used by amateur radio groups to establish \"lid free\" communications channels. (Because most of the more irritating people aren&#x27;t technically sophisticated enough to adopt some new mode without help, and people won&#x27;t help them...).The rules as they stand punish honest people who follow the intent and spirit of the rule in favor of people willing to just ignore the rules (including operating unlawful devices in ISM bands), willing to use stego, or willing to use obscure protocols to achieve the same ends that they&#x27;d otherwise achieve with encryption. It blocks modern networking by disallowing standard internet-grade software use with radio since all of it has integral encryption which generally can&#x27;t be disabled to prevent downgrading and cross domain attacks in contexts where the encryption is needed -- or because in some cases the protocols are designed in such a way that authentication without encypherment isn&#x27;t possible.73s, NT4TN reply BenjiWiebe 9 hours agorootparentAs to cell phone service being ubiquitous - there&#x27;s a lot of farmers in places without ubiquitous cell service, and those farmers do need to communicate. Some use CB, and a lot use business band (licensed) or GMRS (without getting a license usually, and IME using more power than legal). If ham radio was an option (by allowing encryption) they&#x27;d be using it. reply nullc 8 hours agorootparentAllowing encryption wouldn&#x27;t make ham radio any more an option than their GMRS usage. To the extent that someone in far off nowhere might make some rule violating usage (e.g. using it commercially) it&#x27;s moot: they already can. They&#x27;re at risk of getting caught and getting a forfeiture order and fine, but they are regardless of if they use encryption or not.Practically in those locations the likelihood is that they won&#x27;t interfere with anyone at all in any case. In which case it&#x27;s irrelevant.What&#x27;s vastly worse than a bit of misuse is losing the bands entirely.We&#x27;ve essentially lost 9cm (half already, the rest when the FCC finishes selling off the half). But for a few hundred KHz used for EMEers (whos numbers are only in the hundreds) the bands higher than 23cm are essentially unused, and 23cm has quite limited usage.There is tons of UHF+ non-commercial and experimental radio activity going on _outside_ of amateur radio however, innovative things with SDR and mesh networking to gives some examples-- but due to antiquated content restrictions its operating (usually unlawfully) on the ISM bands and struggling with interference from other activity there and with low power limits (even though much of the experimental usage is unlawful, it still stays usually stays low power since folk wisdom says that&#x27;s what keeps the enforcement away). These applications are squarely within the purpose of amateur radio and to the extent that they used non-certified homebrew hardware and antennas the amateur service is the only place they could lawfully operate.But in practice the content restrictions have more force than the requirement for type-certification, and the ISM bands don&#x27;t have hall monitors, so as a result the vast majority of interesting UHF+ radio experimentation is outside of the amateur service currently. This is a serious danger to the continuation of the amateur allocations.

Maybe there was power creep? And more concerning, all NPCs attacked me on sight, shouting \"murderer\", and I have no idea why. I tried asking in chat, which was surprisingly international, but got no answers. The manual doesn&#x27;t explain any aspect of the game world either.I guess that&#x27;s the danger of MMORPGs in constant development. It&#x27;s hard to integrate existing characters and guides with new behavior.Also, I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with the new UI and reflection rendering.

    "originBody": "Switch theme Light theme Dark theme System theme iliana etaoin August 6, 2023 Getting my library cards onto my phone the hard way Our local libraries, The Seattle Public Library and the King County Library System, issue pieces of plastic with barcodes printed on the back assigned to your borrower account. These cards are not strictly necessary in 2023; most everything at Seattle libraries is self-service, including circulation, and these self-service entrypoints usually have a way to type in a library barcode manually. But having the barcode is far more convenient, and I’d like to have it without having to keep yet another plastic card I rarely use in my wallet. So I put it on my phone, in my iPhone’s Wallet app. This became extremely silly extremely quickly, so I’ve decided to document it here for myself and others. A brief introduction to passes The Wallet app can manage many things: payment cards, government/employee/student IDs, house/car/hotel room keys; none of these were part of what Wallet, initially called Passbook, could do at its 2012 launch. At that time, Passbook only managed “passes”. Apple’s documentation on passes covers this in more detail, but they are self-contained zip files full of JSON and PNGs designed to be distributed through email or the web from a vendor to its user. If you have a pass on your phone, you can usually go to Pass Details and find a share icon in the top right, allowing you to send the .pkpass file to somewhere you can unzip it and inspect it. The contents are pretty simple. There’s a specific list of supported images, there’s a pass.json file which describes all of the non-image content of the pass, there’s a manifest.json file which lists the SHA-1 checksum of all the other files, and a signature which is an S/MIME signature of the contents of the manifest.json. Our first interesting problem is one of barcode formats. Passes support four types of barcodes: QR code, PDF417 (commonly used on United States driver licenses), Aztec Code (used for boarding passes by the airline industry), and Code 128 (the only supported linear symbology). My library card uses… [stares at Wikipedia for half an hour] Codabar, widely used in libraries1, and perhaps one of the cutest barcode symbologies (and names) I’ve ever seen. It’s possible that the barcode scanners at the library support other linear symbologies, but Codabar is the only one I know guaranteed to work at all of them. So we will need to fake it by providing some image that functions as a scannable barcode. Our second interesting problem, which is a much worse, “oh no”-level problem: for some reason, passes are cryptographically signed, and they have to be signed with a key known to one of Apple’s certificate authorities. Cryptographically signing these files makes some sense when you consider that passes were designed to get automatic updates from their vendors; for example, your boarding pass for a flight reflecting gate changes or changing your seat assignment. If you are already an Apple developer you can get yourself a pass signing key pretty trivially, but I am not, and I do not intend to drop $99 on this. Perfection is the enemy of something or other There are other people who are already Apple developers who have made various apps for designing passes. They are… passable? Unfortunately I am a perfectionist. For one thing, there is the matter of the logo in the top left of the pass. Apple has designed this somewhat flexibly, with a maximum height of 50 device-independent pixels, but a square logo with text to the right side is going to most comfortably fit at about 40 pixels tall. Pass developers are expected to provide correctly-sized logos at logo.png, logo@2x.png, logo@3x.png2 for different device pixel ratios, but these apps tend to let you select a single logo and not give you any control over how it’s scaled. If you give it a 40-pixel image, it’ll be blurry on any currently-supported iPhone; if you give it an 80-pixel image, it’ll be too large. Not great! For another thing, I’d really like to have the screen be brighter as I open the pass. Passes with normal, supported barcodes do this to support scanners that need better contrast. To me, the ideal situation here is to trick iOS into making the screen brighter without actually having a non-functional barcode present. I’m not going to be able to get away with this kind of JSON fuzzing without digging into the JSON myself. And, these apps tend to be free to download, but only let you save a limited number of passes to Wallet before asking you to pay up. I am not here to judge the developers for doing this but I am probably also not going to pay for your app unless it does what I want it to (and unfortunately what I want is kind of extreme). Finding a key Well, I did just download half a dozen free-to-start pass generator apps. You could make these one of two ways. Probably the “correct” way is to have some web service which performs the signing, so that you don’t ship a private key with the application itself. But surely one of these apps I’ve downloaded lets you generate passes offline? Sometimes you want the app to work without having to also maintain a web service; that sounds like a one-way ticket to dealing with a ton of bad reviews and refunds when it inevitably goes down. I turned on Airplane Mode, turned off WiFi, and tried them all. Sure enough, at least one does. I’m not going to draw attention to the specific app I used in this post because I don’t want their key to get revoked3. But it was kind of funny how simple the process was: Download the app on my Mac, since Apple silicon Macs let you run iOS apps. In the wrapped iOS app bundle, observe that there is a very obvious .p12 file. Run strings on the main binary and look for anything that might be a password (as PKCS#12 files require an import password). And, well: $ openssl pkcs12 -info -in [redacted].p12 -legacy -nodes Enter Import Password: MAC: sha1, Iteration 1 MAC length: 20, salt length: 8 PKCS7 Encrypted data: pbeWithSHA1And40BitRC2-CBC, Iteration 2048 Certificate bag Bag Attributes friendlyName: Pass Type ID: [redacted] localKeyID: [redacted] subject=UID = [redacted], CN = Pass Type ID: [redacted], OU = [redacted], O = [redacted], C = [redacted] issuer=CN = Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority, OU = G4, O = Apple Inc., C = US ... We also need a certificate chain; this certificate is signed with an intermediate. The app needs it too, so it’s probably somewhere in the bundle, but the certificate contains within its X.509 extension fields the URL to download the intermediate if you need it (you can view a certificate’s various fields with openssl x509 -noout -text -in whatever.pem). Laying out the pass First we need to pick a pass style out of “boarding pass”, “coupon”, “event ticket”, “generic”, or “store card”. We want a layout that lets us put a large horizontal image across the pass somewhere. This limits us to layouts that support the “strip” image: coupon, event ticket, or store card. Out of these three, the store card is most skeuomorphic to our physical library card. Let’s type up the start of a pass.json. The documentation for this file is found at the PassKit Package Format Reference. { \"passTypeIdentifier\": \"[redacted]\", \"teamIdentifier\": \"[redacted]\", \"formatVersion\": 1, \"serialNumber\": \"whatever\", \"organizationName\": \"me!\", \"logoText\": \"The Seattle Public Library\", \"description\": \"Library Card\", \"storeCard\": { \"headerFields\": [], \"primaryFields\": [], \"backFields\": [], \"secondaryFields\": [], \"auxiliaryFields\": [] }, \"backgroundColor\": \"rgb(255, 255, 255)\", \"foregroundColor\": \"rgb(0, 0, 0)\", \"sharingProhibited\": false } The passTypeIdentifier and teamIdentifier must match the UID and OU fields, respectively, of the certificate subject you got from Apple and/or found lying around. serialNumber needs to be unique for each pass you generate with the same passTypeIdentifier. organizationName is ostensibly supposed to be who made and signed the pass, but if you’re never distributing the pass then it probably doesn’t matter. Now for some images. icon.png is required but is not shown on the pass itself. logo.png is the logo displayed at the top left. I generated three logo files: a 40×40 logo.png, an 80×80 logo@2x.png, and a 120×120 logo@3x.png; then I copied logo@3x.png to icon.png. Finally, we’ll need the strip.png, which will contain our pre-generated barcode. Generating the barcode Fortunately iOS scales and crops the strip.png we generate to fit whatever size box it is on a device, so we don’t need to worry about making three different versions of it. Both my library cards use “A” and “D” as the start and stop symbols. If you already have a barcode scanner handy this is the easiest way to figure out what your start and stop symbols are, but you can also compare the beginning and end of the barcode against the symbology table on Wikipedia by eye pretty easily. There aren’t many ready-to-use Codabar generators online, but the format is pretty simple to implement yourself. While prototyping I used the Barcoders library for Rust to generate an SVG, then tweaked the SVG and exported a PNG. After some experimentation I settled on the following layout (where 1 unit is the width of a narrow bar): The barcode height is, in units, twice the number of total symbols (including the start and stop symbols) in the barcode. (For example: a 13-digit barcode number is 15 symbols, and so I made my barcode height 30 units tall.) 15 units of quiet space is placed before the start and after the end of the barcode. (Various reader documentation I’ve seen suggests 10 units is sufficient but I had a harder time scanning it with my fancy 2D barcode scanner.) 50 units of padding are placed above and below the barcode. This is overkill, but helps ensure the image is cropped on the top and bottom, not on the left and right. Each unit is scaled up to 8 pixels to ensure iOS is always scaling the image down. (This makes the final image size 1040 pixels tall and, for my example 15-symbol barcode, the barcode 240 pixels tall.) Codabar has such a simple encoding that I felt an overwhelming urge to write a 69-line shell script that generates a bitmap of an encoded Codabar barcode in the above layout: #!/usr/bin/env bash if [[ $# -ne 2 ]]; then >&2 echo \"usage: $0 BARCODE OUTPUT\"; exit 1 fi scale_factor=8 # needs to be multiple of 4 for BMP reasons quiet_space=15 vert_padding=50 draw_black() { head -c $(($1 * scale_factor * 3)) /dev/zero; } draw_white() { draw_black \"$1\"LANG=C tr '\\0' '\\377'; } encode_long() { for __x in 0 8 16 24; do echo -en \"\\x$(printf %x $((($1 >> __x) % 256)))\" done } workdir=$(mktemp -d) trap 'rm -rf \"$workdir\"' EXIT { draw_white $quiet_space echo -n \"$1\"while read -r -N1 symbol; do case $symbol in 0|2|6|C|\\*|B|N|.) bars=0001 ;;& 1|-|7|D|E|/) bars=0010 ;;& 4|$|8|A|T|:) bars=0100 ;;& 5|9|3|+) bars=1000 ;;& 0|1|4|5) spaces=001 ;; 2|-|$|9) spaces=010 ;; 6|7|8|3) spaces=100 ;; C|\\*|D|E|A|T) spaces=011 ;; B|N) spaces=110 ;; .|/|:|+) spaces=000 ;; *) >&2 echo \"$0: warning: ignoring symbol $symbol\"; continue ;; esac for i in {0..3}; do draw_black $((${bars:$i:1} + 1)) draw_white $((${spaces:$i:1} + 1)) done done draw_white $((quiet_space - 1)) } >\"$workdir/line\" image_width=$(($(wc -c0)); do cat \"$workdir/line\"; done draw_white $((image_width * vert_padding)) # bottom vertical padding } >\"$workdir/barcode.bmp\" # if not on macOS, replace with your image conversion tool of choice sips -s format png \"$workdir/barcode.bmp\" --out \"$2\" Writing this script’s output to strip.png is all we need. Adding the barcode number I also wanted the barcode number to display under the barcode; this is simple enough to do with the secondary fields: \"secondaryFields\": [ { \"key\": \"number\", \"label\": \"CARD NUMBER\", \"value\": \"6942069420\" } ], Faking the barcode UX the rest of the way When a user selects a barcoded pass, the phone screen gets brighter to assist with scanners. iOS doesn’t think we have a barcode yet. I hoped that specifying an empty barcode would do the trick, and… yeah! It does! Specifying this in the top level keys of pass.json works: \"barcodes\": [ { \"message\": \"\", \"format\": \"PKBarcodeFormatCode128\", \"messageEncoding\": \"iso-8859-1\" } ], It’s the perfect workaround: no barcode is displayed at the bottom of the pass, but the phone acts like there’s a barcode present. Signing and packaging the pass Once all our files are in place, we need to generate the manifest.json, which is an object with filenames as keys and SHA-1 checksums as values. I wrote a terrifying jq filter to generate the manifest for me: sha1sum *.png pass.json\\ jq -Rs 'split(\"\\n\")[ .[]select(. != \"\")split(\" \"){(.[1]): .[0]} ]add' Now we need to sign the manifest, placing the signature at signature. This is done with the openssl smime command. openssl smime -binary -sign \\ -signer pkpass.crt -inkey pkpass.key -certfile wwdrg4.pem \\ -in manifest.json -outform der -out signature It’s possible to use whatever signing time you like4 with the -attime option, so if the certificate you got from Apple and/or found lying around is expired, you can still sign with it. The -attime option takes a UNIX epoch. And now, we create a zip! zip -r out.pkpass *.png pass.json manifest.json signature macOS comes with a pass previewer tool, so you can open this pass to check that it is valid and mostly looks right. (If it’s not valid, look for an error in Console.app.) The previewer isn’t 100% accurate, but it does have a button to send it to your phone via iCloud, which is pretty cool. You can also get it onto your phone in whatever manner is convenient. Not my real card number, sadly. I will note that I have not yet tested this pass in a real library yet, but my barcode scanner can read it off my phone just as well as it can read it from my physical plastic card if I turn the screen brightness all the way up (yes, even further than the zero-length barcode workaround causes the screen to get brighter). Closing thoughts I think it’s pretty neat that the pass specification has remained pretty much unchanged in a decade. But I wish, like many things within the Apple ecosystem, that this didn’t require a $99 USD/year membership to get a certificate in order to sign an otherwise harmless pile of PNGs and JSON. There’s a few features you can use in passes that I’m glad require signing, but nothing I did here should require it, and I hope that changes someday. Also I think Apple should add Codabar support to Wallet. I’m not aware of any library that supports using a digital form of a library card in-person, and I think with some tweaks the platform could support libraries without requiring an audit to ensure every barcode scanner across the system can support Code 128. Footnotes And blood banks? ↩︎ @3x was news to me! Apparently some newer phones have a 3× ratio now. ↩︎ Given that most of these kinds of apps do not make the passes updatable via the internet, that these keys are limited to signing passes, and that the keys are specifically used in “make whatever pass you want” apps, I do not think there’s any reason to revoke the key I found. Unfortunately I do not trust Apple will accept this reasoning. ↩︎ Astute observation, Michael. ↩︎",

They know how many people use the stairs vs the escalator, which areas of the station become congested fastest during peak. It&#x27;s helped them redesign stations for the better. I&#x27;m fine with that, I can opt out by turning WiFi off.TFL is run by the Mayor, so if dystopian microlocation-based advertising was even proposed I would expect it to end very badly for him in a political sense. reply LeafItAlone 4 hours agorootparentprevCurious, who are you worried about anonymity from?If you buy a transit card with a credit card already (how most people do), there goes your anonymity from the transit system.You can reduce tracking by credit card companies (with is the group I think would be doing a lot of analysis of spending, including when and where you travel (they get when, since it posts immediately, but they might not get where, if the transit billing all originates the same). That reduction in tracking is probably valuable.I would think facial recognition cameras in transit systems will become commonplace, if they aren’t already. New York is already using other “AI” for fare evasion (saying they don’t currently use facial recognition).

The only person this really benefits is new users to the system that haven&#x27;t figured out how to get a transit card yet.I respectfully disagree. I’ve lost more transit cards than credit cards. And since the tap-to-pay on credit card also works with Apple Pay and Apple has the ability to choose which card to apply transit charges to, it gets the same one every time. I have found the new system to be preferred. Plus, if every system implemented this, it makes it easier to travel and not worry about loading up a transit card that then loses its value (I have a few in my drawers from cities I’ve visited once). reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentprev> The only person this really benefits is new users to the system that haven&#x27;t figured out how to get a transit card yet.In many transit systems, that&#x27;s millions of people per year: Tourists, occasional riders that would just forget the pass at home if they&#x27;re not using it regularly etc.> This system really sucks because you can&#x27;t just slide your wallet over the reader. It&#x27;ll pick up your cc before your transit pass.There&#x27;s theoretically ways to preferentially pick a given type of card, but it&#x27;s quite hard and unreliable to implement, so I guess that rather than promising something they can&#x27;t reliably deliver (and slowing things down in the process), transit systems just pick the first card.It is slightly inconvenient for transit-pass-only users, but I do also see the huge benefits for the transit system and its users in aggregate. reply ghaff 10 hours agorootparentThe digitization we&#x27;ve seen over the past couple of decades has mostly greatly improved the experience for regular users over tokens etc. It&#x27;s also mostly between a pain and terrible for the occasional user like tourists. The systems are all different with often confusing menus of options, they may not even read the default language well, etc. Tapping a CC and javing the right thing happen is so much better. reply pempem 9 hours agorootparentIt also more deeply tracks each individuals movement through the system to a higher level of fidelity than a disposable metro card that was paid with cash. reply ghaff 8 hours agorootparentCash in some form is usually still an option—possibly at the cost of a lot of convenience. reply philistine 10 hours agorootparentprevTransit authorities are really being hammered with lower ridership right now.

This not only makes traffic worse (which kinda defeats the whole purpose), it also tanks political support for transit, since fewer voters are using it and then they see no point in supporting it. reply Kye 13 hours agorootparentCan you point to where you found this measurement? This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of it. reply themadturk 8 hours agorootparentSeattle got rid of its downtown core free ride area in part because of disruptive and illegal behavior by riders. reply Kye 7 hours agorootparentAnalemma_&#x27;s comment made it sound like some broad and well-studied thing. All I&#x27;ve seen is mention of a single city. This is not remotely enough to support the claim.My claim was based on skimming an article that said fares ranged from about 10 to 50% of funding and I speculated that most probably tended toward 10% since most are small, and small ones depend on federal funding, special purpose taxes (Georgia has a lot of SPLOST[0] projects), and partnerships.Smaller systems suffer from low ridership and might see more benefit from dropping fares. A full bus and an empty bus cost about as much to run, but a system of full buses is easier to bolster and improve because more people will support it.And I don&#x27;t see why this would be connected to behavior on buses and trains. Where is this research? At least for Seattle since everyone wants to focus on it for some reason.

Cryptographically signing these files makes some sense when you consider that passes were designed to get automatic updates from their vendors; for example, your boarding pass for a flight reflecting gate changes or changing your seat assignment.How does this make sense? There’s a perfectly well supported system for doing this: HTTPS.Maybe Apple wants passes to be verifiable by the phone offline instead of just when updated? This still seems silly — a malicious actor could replace a pass instead of updating it. reply robryk 14 hours agoparentHaving the initial pass specify the public key that it accepts for updates would be sufficient. Having an association with an Apple developer account doesn&#x27;t help for the updates problem at all AFAICT.The only reason I came up with for the blessed-by-Apple requirement I came up with is selling fake tickets. There is no way to tell (with or without that requirement) whether a pkpass file with a \"ticket to concert X\" is actually legit. So, one can try to combat the (potential?) problem by responding to complaints of fraud by revoking the corresponding developer&#x27;s account. However, that doesn&#x27;t seem like a solution either: developer account are probably way cheaper than how much you can gain on fraud before you get caught in that way. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentYeah, I also found the justifications for Apple requiring passes to be signed pretty vague. Locking things down is just the default for Apple; it&#x27;s usually only in later iterations that they open up integrations to the broader ecosystem.On the face of it, it&#x27;s really weird to require passes to be signed: I can always just store a PNG or PDF showing the same bar code in my photo library or files app and present that.

They’re great and I love them but they play a sound whenever you pair, unpair, or connect them, and it’s way too loud for my preference.1 I also wasn’t able to fix it by e.g. setting the equalizer to subtract a few decibels across the board. I asked them via email about this and they responded promptly and said that there was nothing they could do, which is understandable - it’s probably not a common request. But it was too loud for me to continue using them, so I decided to try to solve the problem myself. Tozo T6 earbuds. They’re great. I only have one complaint… To solve the problem, I need to modify the firmware that runs on the device. My initial expectation of how this would work was: I would get a binary file from somewhere for my device. People often share firmware files online, maybe I could find a copy using a search engine. The firmware file would be in some easily-understood binary structure like ELF. The audio files would be contained in the binary somewhere, maybe as an ELF symbol (going from the last point). Knowing how the image format worked would let me modify the data within it while making sure that I didn’t accidentally give it a corrupt image and possibly brick my device. The audio files would be in a format that would be easy to transform, maybe PCM since it’s running on an embedded device with perhaps limited computational power to decode audio (of course, it’s also a headset, so probably it can decode compressed audio just fine). Once I can modify data within the firmware image (either unpack/repack it or modify data in-situ by knowing its offset and length within the image), do so to make the audio quieter (e.g. if it’s PCM then maybe halve each sample, etc). Finally, I would flash my modified firmware to the device with some kind of tool made for my model of equipment or its underlying chipset, etc. Some of these assumptions ended up being completely false and unwarranted (I have no idea why I hoped that the audio would be uncompressed on a low-power device like this, for example), but this was my thinking starting out. It also doesn’t include any reverse engineering, which ended up taking up most of the time that wasn’t spent on setting up infrastructure (such as an intercepting proxy), but this was mostly just going down rabbitholes. In the end, I actually didn’t need to reverse engineer much at all. So this post is less about reverse engineering and more about the general process of solving my particular problem. First steps: initial research The first step is to collect information about what exactly the device is. There seem to be several different entities involved in the production of cheap electronics: The vendor, who actually brands and sells the device - Tozo, in this case. The chipset, a specific piece of hardware the device is mostly designed around, which runs the firmware code and might have special features for the application at hand. The ISA - the chipset will run code of a particular instruction set, with a “core” derived from some other base tech like ARM, MIPS, etc (or perhaps they rolled their own). Additional features - the chipset might integrate technology from other people onto their chip, such as additional coprocessors, chips to interface with different kinds of hardware, etc. The chipset for my device ended up being an Airoha AB1562, which apparently is based on an Tensilica Xtensa ISA and includes a “Cadence HiFi DSP coprocessor”. I wasn’t able to find this out searching for my device model however, so I ended up just looking through the disassembly for their Android app. There I found an SDK for a company called “Airoha”, with references to specific chip models and containing all of the primitives for talking to devices. I wasn’t able to find any other chipset SDK’s, so I assumed this was the chipset manufacturer. I still had to find the specific model though. After a bit more searching, I found a Reddit community for discussing AirPods clones called /r/airreps, which gave me some good advice about how to proceed. They have also written an Android application called “AirReps156X”2 which also uses the Airoha SDK, and can provide diagnostic information about Airoha devices3. I was able to connect to this app with my device, so it’s definitely an Airoha chipset, and one of the diagnostic strings was “QW_1562U_SDK1.5.1”, which leads me to believe that my device chipset is in the Airoha AB1562 series: The “Airreps 156X” app display device information. The application also lets you flash new firmware, which is a fairly critical item on the checklist. So now that we’ve gotten that prerequisite out of the way and identified the chipset all that’s left to do is to find the actual firmware and modify it. Finding the actual binaries The Tozo application is my first lead. When you connect your earbuds to the Tozo app, it displays the firmware version and whether or not it’s “current”. So it must talk to a server somewhere, which knows what the latest version of the firmware is: Tozo’s app displaying the current firmware version. In theory, I could probably just read through the decompiled code in jadx or something until I find out what servers it’s talking to, how, and what it does when it checks for updates (such as, presumably, downloading the firmware files I’m looking for). But that’s a lot of work, so I have a better idea - when the app checks if the firmware is up to date, it might also make API requests that could shed some light on where to find the actual firmware files. It might even be able to be tricked into trying to update, which would also lead me to the right URLs. So some quick and dirty “dynamic analysis” via traffic interception is the logical next step. Setting up an intercepting proxy To this end I set up an intercepting proxy using my wireless NIC with hostapd and mitmproxy, and patched the Tozo app with apktool + uber apk signer so that it’ll let us strip the TLS and snoop on its raw network traffic.4 Patching the APK is pretty standard stuff - I just followed this gist. The idea is that Android applications have two CA stores, one that can be easily modified by the user, and one that can’t, and by default most Android apps only check TLS certificates against the latter. But, by patching the APK, we can tell it to use the former too, which is where we put our mitmproxy-provided TLS certificate that we’re going to use to snoop on all of the network traffic used by our app. Then we have to sign it so Android will deal with it. The intercepting proxy setup was pretty straightforward - just set up the AP, set up some iptables rules to direct traffic to mitmproxy’s listening port, and do the typical NAT song and dance: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 .PHONY: start start:nmcli device set wlp3s0 managed nosudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1sudo iptables -I INPUT -i wlp3s0 -j ACCEPTsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlp3s0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlp3s0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlp3s0 -o enp5s0f3u1u3c2 -j ACCEPTsudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp5s0f3u1u3c2 -j MASQUERADEsudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPTsudo hostapd hostapd.conf .PHONY: stop stop:sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=1sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0sudo iptables -D INPUT -i wlp3s0 -j ACCEPTsudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i wlp3s0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i wlp3s0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080sudo iptables -D FORWARD -i wlp3s0 -o enp5s0f3u1u3c2 -j ACCEPTsudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o enp5s0f3u1u3c2 -j MASQUERADEsudo iptables -D FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPTnmcli device set wlp3s0 managed yes.PHONY: mitmproxy mitmproxy:SSLKEYLOGFILE=\"sslkeylogfile-attempt1.txt\" mitmdump --mode transparent --showhost -k Copy The script I used to start and stop the TLS-stripping wireless AP. I know make isn’t really the right tool for this, but it’s a force of habit at this point. Snooping on the application’s network traffic Once it was all working, I saw that when I connected the device to the app and the “current” string popped up next to the firmware version, it made a request to an endpoint /api/v1/getOtaVersionV3. And, lo and behold, the response contains links to all of the firmware bins we’re looking for! How nice. No trickery needed. getOtaVersionV3 Request in Wireshark getOtaVersionV3 Response in mitmproxy Analyzing the firmware There are four files, two per earbud, each having a “FotaPackage” and a “FileSystemImage”. The two filesystem images are identical, so we wind up with three distinct files - two fotapackages for L and R earbuds, and the filesystem image. The first thing anybody does when they get a weird file is, they run the Linux command “file” on it, to see if it has a magic number that indicates its file format: Unhelpful. …and, if that doesn’t help, they might run strings or hexdump over it, to see if there’s any interesting human-readable ASCII strings in it: From the filesystem image - some filenames, at least. and then binwalk to see if there’s any files embedded in it: The LZ4 region contains the NVROM, which isn’t useful to us - it doesn’t contain any audio files. Unfortunately, binwalk didn’t find anything, even the mp3 files whose filenames are referenced directly in the image. They are indeed in there, it’s just that the mp3 file format is just not very easy to carve out of arbitrary binary data because it doesn’t have any kind of magic number (it can start with either 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE, neither of which are particularly distinctive, and there’s no footer). So even though you can tell they’re in there, it’s not immediately obvious how to unambiguously calculate the offset and length for each mp3 file. So, I decided the best way to figure this out would be to decipher the filesystem image format, which probably has information that tells you where each file begins and ends. Entropy analysis The next step for this is entropy analysis. This basically tells you what parts of a file are constant (0x00 or 0xFF are popular bytes for this), which parts resemble random noise, which parts are valid ASCII text, and the offsets at which one of those things changes into another. It’s useful because it sometimes lets you visualize the structure of something without actually knowing anything about it. The filesystem image looked promising (generated with http://binvis.io/): It does some grouping of the data into blocks to make the structure more visible, so it’s not row-by-row like you might expect. Unfortunately, the FotaPackage files however were obviously encrypted or compressed somehow: It’s not looking good. Oof. I also noticed that the left and right FotaPackage binaries had some curious differences - their headers only differed sporadically, while the body was identical except for the end, where there was about 7KB of complete difference. The header (0x00-0x1000) appears to be unencrypted and only differs in small segments. Then, at the end, the footer suddenly changes to completely different, at around 0xC4E38. I wasn’t completely sure as to the meaning of this, beyond the fact that there was obviously some kind of opaque transformation at work. My initial guess was encryption, with the same key/IV but different plaintexts, and that the sudden difference corresponds to a single-byte difference (perhaps an #ifdef EARBUD_R doBluetoothMasterThings(); #else doBluetoothSlaveThings(); #endif sort of thing) that then leads to the rest of the file being different, but I wasn’t able to verify this. Regardless of why, it was obvious I wasn’t going to get anything out of them without serious effort. A quick appraisal of the situation The fact that we know the audio is mp3 was actually pretty bad news to me at first glance. My understanding of media encoders is that they generally have a lot of options for how to encode something, while sometimes a given decoder will barf on a perfectly well-formed file that happens to use a feature it wasn’t expecting. This is very bad for us for two reasons: Our decoder is of utterly unknown provenance, who knows what it might barf on. The audio gets played right when the device first pairs, so if we produce an mp3 file that the decoder does not like and the device crashes before we can connect to it again, then we risk putting it into an unrecoverable state. Furthermore, even if we use precisely the expected encoding parameters while producing our volume-adjusted mp3 files, if we change the length of the file while modifying it then we must also make sure that we account for this when we modify the filesystem image, where what that specifically means depends on the exact structure of the filesystem format. Presumably, it records the length of each file somewhere, and we need to make sure we adjust this number to accurately refect the new length of the file (or else it will either be truncated or have garbage added to the end). This is a lot of work, and with an uncertain outcome. So, at this point I was somewhat worried about the future of this project, and was desperately trying to figure out how to proceed without any re-encoding. Luckily, it turns out that you can indeed modify the volume (or “gain”) of an mp3 file without changing its length, or re-encoding it, or even modifying its metadata. It’s kind of like how you can rotate a JPEG file without re-encoding it as well - you can just look inside of its data structures and modify them for this one particular transformation without needing to change anything else. Pretty neat! An mp3 file transformed with mp3gain - see, only a few bytes of difference. ROFS Back to the filesystem image - it seems to contain the mp3 files that correspond to the sounds I am trying to enquiet, and I want to replace them with modified versions, so at a bare minimum I need to know where files begin and end inside of the image. At this point, binwalk couldn’t identify them, so I thought that the problem was that either they were either obfuscated somehow (compressed/encrypted) or the structure of the filesystem might be making it difficult to identify them. So, I decided that the next point of attack was to understand the structure of the filesystem image, which begins with the ASCII string “ROFS”: Hexdump of ROFS image. The first step is to search for information about anything with that name online, but no dice. I’m pretty sure it’s bespoke to this particular chipset manufacturer, as I was completely unable to find any reference or documentation of something called “ROFS” that would describe the file I have and the Airoha SDK I would later find contains an implementation of an interface for reading files from it. At this point, I made a somewhat regrettable decision that the next course of action was to try to attack the firmware, so that I could get to the code that presumably understands the filesystem image format. But the firmware code was (seemingly) encrypted, so I decided to see if they were doing something silly with their encryption and check if maybe the FotaPackage files were decrypted client-side by the SDK before being sent out over the wire. I was eventually able to ascertain with some certainty that the SDK does not transform the firmware in any way before sending it out, but it took me a few hours of reading decompiled code before I came to this conclusion. So of course, I didn’t succeed in attacking the firmware crypto and it was all a waste of time. Oh well. SDK Breakthrough The final breakthrough occurred when I searched for the chipset name online, and found a copy of their SDK. Looking through it, I could see that it had a bunch of .mp3 files in it - the same ones I could hear on the device. I wrote a quick python program to check if a file was contained within another file (probably a tool already exists for this?) and verified that the mp3 files in the SDK were contained in the filesystem image verbatim. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 import sys assert(len(sys.argv) == 3) # returns if a is contained within b a=sys.argv[1] b=sys.argv[2] x = False i = 0 with open(a, mode='rb') as af: ab = af.read() with open(b, mode='rb') as bf: bb = bf.read() while i < len(bb): o = 0 while ((o < len(ab)) and ((i + o) < len(bb)) and ab[o] == bb[i + o]): o = o + 1 if (o == len(ab)): x = True break else: i = i + 1 if x: print(\"found: {}\".format(i)) exit(0) else: print(\"not found\") exit(1) Copy bincontains.py Modifying the filesystem image I was slightly worried that the ROFS image might contain additional data, such as checksums for the files inside of it, but I briefly skimmed the ROFS-related code from the SDK (unfortunately it only seemed to exist as prebuilt object files) and it only had a few symbols in it for operating on the filesystem, none of which suggested the presence of checksumming: There’s not a lot of code in here, and there’s no external references to anything relating to checksumming. So with that out of the way, at this point I actually have everything I need to complete the task of modifying the volume of the sound files in the firmware image with no further reverse engineering. I have: A way to flash updated firmware to the device, as well as the firmware files themselves. Knowledge that the mp3 files from the SDK are included verbatim in the filesystem image (no compression, splitting into blocks, etc). This means I have their lengths and offsets in the filesystem image. Knowledge that you can modify the gain of an mp3 file without re-encoding it or changing its length. The assumption that the filesystem format doesn’t include any checksumming or additional information about its files that would be invalidated upon modifying their occupant byte range in the image. Then, it’s just as simple as looping over the mp3 files, and if it’s contained in the image, running mp3gain on the file and then replacing it in the image with the gain-modified version. I used an adjustment of -19.5 decibels. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 #!/usr/bin/env bash NS=\"$1\" HS=\"$2\" DB=\"$3\" for N in $(find \"$NS\" -type fgrep -E 'mp3$'); doF=$(python3 bincontains.py \"$N\" \"$HS\");X=$?if [ $X -eq 0 ]; then START=$(echo \"$F\"awk '{print $2;}') LEN=$(stat -c '%s' \"$N\") TMP=$(mktemp \"XXXXXXX.mp3\") cp \"$N\" \"$TMP\" mp3gain -q -T -s r -s s -g \"$DB\" \"$TMP\" LEN2=$(stat -c '%s' \"$TMP\") printf \"%s,%s,%s,%s\\n\" \"$N\" \"$START\" \"$LEN\" \"$LEN2\" dd if=\"$TMP\" of=\"$HS\" bs=1 seek=\"$START\" count=\"$LEN\" conv=notruncfi done Copy binsearch.sh A quick binary diff of the final firmware image - only a few bytes of difference, as expected. Finally, I flashed it to the device and it worked! Hooray! I shortly verified that the device was fully operational and the sound was, indeed, much quieter than it was when I started. Mission accomplished! That’s a wrap! I didn’t end up having to decrypt the firmware (probably impossible for me) or understand the ROFS image format at all - most of the time spent reverse-engineering was actually going down rabbitholes that didn’t help me in the end. I also kind of wish that volume control of system sounds was a first-class feature - from a UI perspective, I think it’s an error for a device that plays audio to not have a volume control that modifies all of the sound that gets produced by the device. But apparently it has a workaround, so I guess it’s fine. But yeah, all in all this was a pretty fun little project, would do again/10. I suspect that this is probably a “me” problem rather than a “them” problem because I have noticed a consistent pattern of having a much quieter preferred volume than other people, but that doesn’t change the fact that this equipment is junk to me unless I modify it so it suits my preferences. ↩︎ Can be found here: https://airpodsreplicas.com/useful-apps#airoha ↩︎ Only ones with chipset models beginning with 156-?, I assume?

I imagine you were very pissed off when you first discovered that one.I had a similarly flawed one. I had an alarm clock which had a MSF radio sync thing built in. But every time it resync&#x27;ed with the MSF time signal it&#x27;d make the same sound as the alarm for 2-3 seconds. You couldn&#x27;t turn it off. This was invariably at 3AM or some horrible time. I eventually opened it up and cut the MSF antenna out and slept better knowing the clock was always slightly wrong. reply iforgotpassword 2 hours agorootparentOn that note, about 20 years ago, there suddenly was an abundance of small cheap alarm clocks with DCF77 receivers available. Got one of these and totally overslept every couple months. I eventually got a second alarm and set it a few minutes before the other one, and sure enough eventually there was a day where the second one (so my original one) didn&#x27;t ring its alarm. I didn&#x27;t look at the clock so was not able to see what was going on, but at least knew it wasn&#x27;t me.years later when I long didn&#x27;t use that clock as an alarm anymore, I had it in a spot where it wouldn&#x27;t properly receive the DCF signal and I noticed that it would quickly lag behind after just a few days. So my theory at that point was that sometimes the clock just managed to fall behind enough in its old spot and then resync just when the alarm would&#x27;ve gone off, and there was no logic to account for this. ie the clock would compare the time to the set alarm exactly once a minute, but when the clock would receive a new time signal of 7:01:00 when its local time was 6:59:59 or earlier, I&#x27;d oversleep. reply thedanbob 7 hours agorootparentprevHow could anyone think such a \"feature\" was a good idea?

They shut down whatever audio is currently playing.2. They take a dramatic pause.3. They announce \"BATTERY LOW. PLEASE CHARGE NOW.\"4. They take one more dramatic pause.5. Normal functioning resumes and you attempt to pick up on the thread of whatever the person you were talking to was saying for the past several seconds. This doesn&#x27;t work well.This announcement is, quite obviously, much worse than doing nothing at all. The worst case scenario, if a warning is just not given, is that my sound cuts out and I miss whatever someone was saying. But that is precisely the effect that the ear clips intentionally generate on an accelerated schedule!There is no reason not to just add the warning into the existing audio stream. It should be an unobtrusive beep pattern or similar.

If so, I&#x27;d be willing to sacrifice a bit of enjoyment for a bit of ear health.

I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that -- not with AirPods or Bose or a cheap brand TOZO.Are you sure it&#x27;s not a problem with the earbuds themselves, that their minimum level is higher than it should be?If you&#x27;ve dug into it, what is the range&#x2F;steps of Bluetooth volume levels, and which are the range&#x2F;steps that iOS supports?Also, have you ever tried dragging the volume slider in iOS? That lets you set volume smoothly, not restricted to increments. Does that not let you set the smallest volume? reply aloisklink 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had the same issue with some wired IEMs on iOS, using Apple&#x27;s official USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor. I even have the EU model A2155 of the USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor that&#x27;s supposed to have half the power of the US model.What I found that helped was to create a custom Shortcut that \"Set Media volume to 1%\". iOS reports that this is 48 dB when playing pink noise. I managed to hit 47 dB when dragging to volume slider on iOS below 1%, but the Shortcuts app only seems to support integer percentages.In my case, even the 1% volume level was too high in a quiet room, but some apps have a custom EQ setting that you can use to lower the volume further. E.g. if you&#x27;re using Apple Music, you can go to Settings -> Music -> EQ and pick \"Loudness\" to lower the volume further. reply toast0 11 hours agorootparentprev> That&#x27;s wild. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that -- not with AirPods or Bose or a cheap brand TOZO.I had something similar with a usb &#x27;sound card&#x27; I was using with a mac. I had to use some DSP software to artificially reduce the sound level to about 1%, and then it was usable. Worked fine on windows as I recall. I had a similar issue with a set of logitech usb speakers; one pair worked great, so I ordered a second pair, where (on windows) the lowest output volume is tremendously loud, I couldn&#x27;t get the DSP software to stick though, and ended up replacing them.In conclusion, computers are awful. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agorootparentprev+1 here reply chrismorgan 14 hours agoparentprevMy phone (Android 5, and I barely use it, frankly, so until it stops working I don’t need anything newer) does the same thing when connecting it to my car over Bluetooth, the first time after every reboot.

This could be implemented well. But I agree, it probably isn&#x27;t. reply mrob 13 hours agorootparentWhat if the manufacturer changes the sensitivity but keeps the Bluetooth identifier the same? I assume Apple would rather set a conservative limit for everything than risk getting sued for allowing hearing damage with an incorrect custom limit. reply jjoonathan 13 hours agorootparentIf not raising an alert is \"allowing hearing damage\" then they already do plenty of that, as does everyone else. It&#x27;s not a reason to do a poor job. Maybe an excuse, but not a reason. reply Cthulhu_ 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;d have to set up their own audiolab and produce a long list of models and what the output levels are per volume setting. OTOH, these things should be standardized. reply crazygringo 11 hours agoparentprev> I want to commend Apple if they did the right thing and built a database mapping (model,volume_setting)->physical_volumeEven if they did, it would be out of date the moment it shipped.But no, there&#x27;s no reason to believe they&#x27;d do anything like that. It would be interesting if headphone manufacturers reported the dB range when connecting with Bluetooth to enable something like that, but I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing. (That is an area where Bluetooth could enable something like that, in a way that the 3.5mm jack couldn&#x27;t.) reply jjoonathan 11 hours agorootparentSoftware updates aren&#x27;t just for distributing first party malware, you know -- they could also conceivably be used to update a device database. We have the technology.This is probably an \"all of the above\" situation. Implement on AirPods and push for a standard and make measurements of popular old models and have a fallback that assumes industry averages. On the scale of Apple, this is not much to ask. reply Swizec 13 hours agoparentprev> Is the phone correct? If so, I&#x27;d be willing to sacrifice a bit of enjoyment for a bit of ear health.Noise cancelling headphones&#x2F;earbuds solved this problem for me. With noise cancelling I can keep volume below 20% and have a comfortable listening experience that doesn&#x27;t blow up my ears.For me, I know the Apple notification is probably right because I started noticing ear aches after long workout sessions a few years ago. This has completely gone away after noise cancelling. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agorootparentMmm, Bose works great for that. But if you accidentally go one past \"lowest volume but not silent\" (which is still a bit too loud when everything is quiet around you!) into \"silent\", then the Bose headset makes a VERY LOUD DING SOUND to alert you. Thanks Bose. reply Eisenstein 11 hours agoparentprevThe volume which comes out of speakers and into your ears is dependent on many different things. Some that come to mind are the sensitivity and impedance of the speaker drivers, the amplifier in the earbuds and the fit over&#x2F;in the ear.They are most likely just setting a toggle at a percentage of maximum volume level. The phone has no way of knowing what the sound pressure is at your eardrums.You can rest easy knowing that you can ignore the warning if you think it isn&#x27;t loud enough with the caveat that you could be damaging your hearing over time. reply jjoonathan 11 hours agorootparent> The phone has no way of knowingIt could make a useful guess based on device identifiers. Or it could make a useless guess based on industry averages or some random device an engineer had on their desk one day. It clearly does one or the other, the question is which. Useful or useless? reply Eisenstein 9 hours agorootparentOccam&#x27;s razor says they are not going to keep a list of all devices and their configurations including types of ear pieces and their sound pressure level output at each volume setting when they could just say if (volume > .75){ warning();} and call it a day. There is no benefit to going above and beyond in this case -- they just need to say they warned people. reply solarkraft 12 hours agoprevI love this stuff. All of a sudden this model of earphones is quite interesting to me.Side note: The system sounds a bluetooth device makes are among the strongest differentiating factors (with some being completely awful; see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;J2wPsH64JEM). Yet I have never seen a review or product page which tells you about what sound (which you will have to hear multiple times per day, with no way to opt out!) the product will make.The ability to change them also seems like a pretty easy differentiator. reply msrenee 11 hours agoparentI really wish I could turn down the play&#x2F;pause beep on my aftershokz.

I&#x27;ve accidentally triggered that like three times.

Doesn&#x27;t this mean that the earbuds must now have a mp3 decoder?Is there a resource-usage argument for preferring mp3? reply toast0 11 hours agoparentI dunno how big the sound files are, but mp3 is going to use a lot less storage than uncompressed PCM. Using a smaller flash chip saves money on the BOM.Bluetooth headphones already need to manage several formats to decode, and the chipset that does that may also decode mp3, and mp3 is easy to work with to prepare the files. reply krackers 8 hours agorootparentBluetooth audio uses SBC codec by default (unless your device something modern like aac or apt-x) right? I imagine that there&#x27;s probably some all-in-one decoding chip that includes various codecs. reply abdullahkhalids 7 hours agorootparentYeah. So Bluetooth never uses mp3 for transmission as far as I am aware - it is simply not one of the codecs specified in the protocol.So why does that decoding chip have mp3 decoding, and why use mp3 when you could just use SBC. reply distract8901 6 hours agorootparentMP3 decoding is just math. If you have enough CPU to decode a compressed audio stream, it doesn&#x27;t cost anything to also have it decode MP3.Sure, you could store those clips in a more appropriate codec, but what do you gain? It&#x27;s dead simple to encode an MP3, every audio editor from the last couple decades can do it. How common is SBC support?If MP3 decoding is free, and MP3 encoding is free, why bother spending any effort at all on anything else? Sometimes good enough is good enough and cheap and easy wins over correct every time. replyravenstine 15 hours agoprevThis is the one thing I dislike about Apple Airpods.

But the other way around - they added the jingle to mask the delay. reply distract8901 6 hours agorootparentBluetooth link negotiation happens in a few dozens of milliseconds.

Hodgetts, Pavel V. Cherepanov, Cuong K. Nguyen, Karolina Matuszek, Douglas R. MacFarlane & Alexandr N. Simonov Nature volume 609, pages 722–727 (2022)Cite this article 33k Accesses 99 Citations 109 Altmetric Metrics details Abstract In addition to its use in the fertilizer and chemical industries1, ammonia is currently seen as a potential replacement for carbon-based fuels and as a carrier for worldwide transportation of renewable energy2. Implementation of this vision requires transformation of the existing fossil-fuel-based technology for NH3 production3 to a simpler, scale-flexible technology, such as the electrochemical lithium-mediated nitrogen-reduction reaction3,4. This provides a genuine pathway from N2 to ammonia, but it is currently hampered by limited yield rates and low efficiencies4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we investigate the role of the electrolyte in this reaction and present a high-efficiency, robust process that is enabled by compact ionic layering in the electrode–electrolyte interface region. The interface is generated by a high-concentration imide-based lithium-salt electrolyte, providing stabilized ammonia yield rates of 150 ± 20 nmol s−1 cm−2 and a current-to-ammonia efficiency that is close to 100%. The ionic assembly formed at the electrode surface suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and supports stable N2 reduction. Our study highlights the interrelation between the performance of the lithium-mediated nitrogen-reduction reaction and the physicochemical properties of the electrode–electrolyte interface. We anticipate that these findings will guide the development of a robust, high-performance process for sustainable ammonia production.

    "commentBody": "Nitrogen electroreduction with almost 100% current-to-ammonia efficiency (2022)Hacker NewspastloginNitrogen electroreduction with almost 100% current-to-ammonia efficiency (2022) (nature.com) 212 points by gorpovitch 12 hours ago| hidepastfavorite115 comments zeristor 9 hours agoLooking at the paper, in similar papers reference is made to this paper published 13th September 2023:“Laser-induced nitrogen fixation” https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-023-41441-0This is Open Access, and mentions how that is also a leap forward in Nitrogen fixation“Abstract: For decarbonization of ammonia production in industry, alternative methods by exploiting renewable energy sources have recently been explored. Nonetheless, they still lack yield and efficiency to be industrially relevant. Here, we demonstrate an advanced approach of nitrogen fixation to synthesize ammonia at ambient conditions via laser–induced multiphoton dissociation of lithium oxide. Lithium oxide is dissociated under non–equilibrium multiphoton absorption and high temperatures under focused infrared light, and the generated zero–valent metal spontaneously fixes nitrogen and forms a lithium nitride, which upon subsequent hydrolysis generates ammonia. The highest ammonia yield rate of 30.9 micromoles per second per square centimeter is achieved at 25 °C and 1.0 bar nitrogen. This is two orders of magnitude higher than state–of–the–art ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions. The focused infrared light here is produced by a commercial simple CO2 laser, serving as a demonstration of potentially solar pumped lasers for nitrogen fixation and other high excitation chemistry. We anticipate such laser-involved technology will bring unprecedented opportunities to realize not only local ammonia production but also other new chemistries.” reply wolfi1 5 hours agoparent\"The corresponding lowest energy consumption of ammonia synthesis based on the light power can be calculated to be approximately 322 kWh kg−1 NH3 (Fig. 3b). This value is significantly higher than that (10 to 13 kWh kg−1 NH3) of the H–B process at an industrial scale\" still way to go. found nothing about the \"subsequent hydrolysis\" step, skimming the article reply londons_explore 11 hours agoprevBig if true...This could enable fertilizer production with no CO2 emissions. The numbers in the paper suggest that it might prove cheaper than natural gas based production which is common today. Fertilizer production is 2.1% of all CO2 emissions right now. reply RetroTechie 10 hours agoparentNot just fertilizer:\"In addition to its use in the fertilizer and chemical industries, ammonia is currently seen as a potential replacement for carbon-based fuels and as a carrier for worldwide transportation of renewable energy.\"Long-term grid storage?Publication: 22 July 2022Anyone know if maybe some pilot &#x2F; small scale production facility has been set up in the mean time?I&#x27;ve read about a farm that produced its own fertilizer, but dunno whether that uses this or some older &#x2F; unrelated process.Would be a huge breakthrough in any case. reply aifooh7Keew6xoo 8 hours agorootparentWhere are all the people that complain about the dangers and impracticality of hydrogen when the topic of using a corrosive gas that poses an immediate danger to life and health at concentrations as low as 300 ppm as a fuel comes up?They&#x27;re trying to avoid using the stuff in industrial refrigeration it&#x27;s so nasty, and yet here we are gleefully considering rolling down the highway with it in the cheapest vessel industry can lobby for strapped to our bum.I guess the notion has passed so quickly we haven&#x27;t had time for the media to program us with corporate agendas... reply PumpkinSpice 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic as a fuel for cars, but \"worldwide transportation\" means more than that. I suspect they&#x27;re talking about container ships, tankers, and such.Ammonia is easier to liquify than hydrogen, and is in many respects easier to handle. However, it&#x27;s definitely not something you want to have a spill of at a gas station or in your garage, and for that reason, it probably won&#x27;t have \"consumer\" uses.As far as industrial gasses go, it&#x27;s certainly nowhere near the worst, and there&#x27;s plenty of ammonia tankers on the roads today, but large spills do kill people every now and then. reply alwayslikethis 7 hours agorootparentIt is important to note that hydrogen, due to the small size of the molecule, is really hard to contain as a gas. Moreover, leaked hydrogen gas is an indirect but potent greenhouse gas via interfering with the degradation of existing methane in the atmosphere. If we leak enough hydrogen, we might not be helping the climate very much.I was once in a presentation which claimed formic acid to be a better alternative, but I&#x27;m not an expert in that field, so I can&#x27;t comment on its merits. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentThere were some recent articles suggesting that there may be enough natural hydrogen seeping out of the ground to supply all of humanity’s energy needs. It seems a bit unlikely that leakage of hydrogen from fuel systems would matter much in comparison. reply nick222226 6 hours agorootparentHow about radon, is that fissible? reply nukeman 6 hours agorootparentNo, it gives off alpha particles and gamma rays. Hypothetically, you could build a device to harvest that energy (along the lines of an RTG), but the energy density and conversion efficiency would be laughable, given the 3.8 day half-life and gaseous state. reply ForgedEngine 7 hours agorootparentprevUse compressed air or NOx as oxidizers for delayed combustion in engines. Not only would it provide a means of storing energy for ICEs, but it would also eliminate pumping losses on the intake stroke. reply keep_reading 8 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enginelabs.com&#x2F;engine-tech&#x2F;engine&#x2F;corrosion-of-c... reply aifooh7Keew6xoo 8 hours agorootparentprevIt is certainly easier to liquefy, I can&#x27;t argue that point. reply idontwantthis 5 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if this process would be easy enough that “ammonia battery” plants would just synthesize on site when solar power is high. Like charging up a battery with no need to move anything.Or maybe a regional factory with short pipelines. reply TheSpiceIsLife 8 hours agorootparentprevToyota have produced a prototype ammonia engine they claim is the end of the EV market. reply _aavaa_ 6 hours agorootparentThey can keep making claims to cover up their complete bungling of their market position.As for the idea itself. Ammonia as fuel fails the first principle of safe design. It’s a poisonous gas. Using it as a fuel is a willingness to trade the safety of people for a cheaper fuel. reply aaronbrethorst 8 hours agorootparentprevNeat. I look forward to them rolling out a production model in 2043. reply jacquesm 7 hours agorootparentI look forward to them rolling it out downwind. reply justinclift 8 hours agorootparentprevHmmm, \"gas station filled with petrol that explodes\" vs \"gas station filled with hydrogen that explodes\".Being near either one as it explodes would be bad, but I wonder which one looks more impressive movie-effects-wise? :) reply sfink 8 hours agorootparentIn my limited understanding, neither one really explodes. The petrol one would look like a huge impressive fireball that launches a big black mushroom cloud and then just burns like crazy. The hydrogen one, if the hydrogen is fairly pure, would be like a big faint blue wispy fireball, not all that impressive.If there were an oxidizer in the mix somehow, it would be rather more explosive. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentIf the hydrogen is fairly pure and the amount is question is small, then sure: combustion will happen at the hydrogen-air interface. If it mixes with air before ignition, then it can burn all a once, and Wikipedia informs me that “the limits of detonability of hydrogen in air are 18.3% to 59% by volume.”. Yes, it will literally detonate with supersonic flame velocity.I once got to watch some moderately crazy students fill an ordinary party balloon with a stoichiometric mix of hydrogen and oxygen at ambient temperature and pressure. When it was ignited, the result was extremely impressive. No one was injured (because we were all warned to protect our ears and open our mouths and balloons don’t produce significant shrapnel), but the shock wave was not at all subtle.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hydrogen_safety reply ben_w 9 minutes agorootparentWhy is having open mouths important? anon_cow1111 7 hours agorootparentprevThe issue with hydrogen is that it has a fairly wide combustion range (meaning the ratio of fuel&#x2F;air that can burn), I can&#x27;t remember the numbers but it&#x27;s several times greater than other common fuels. The other issue with hydrogen is that the combustion happens VERY fast... if you ignite gasoline vapor&#x2F;air in an open 5-gallon jug, you have a nice rocket that&#x27;ll fly 50 feet or so. If you ignite hydrogen&#x2F;air in the same jug, you have permanent hearing damage and shards of plastic embedded in you. reply justinclift 8 hours agorootparentprevCool, thanks. :) reply colechristensen 8 hours agorootparentprevHydrogen is way worse than gasoline or any hydrocarbon. It has to be stored at very high pressures and there’s no practical situation in which it doesn’t explode. reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentprevAt atmospheric pressure Ammonia liquifies at −28 °F (−33.3 °C), Hydrogen −423.17 °F (−252.87 °C). That alone is a vast improvement. You can build a car&#x2F;boat&#x2F;aircraft that keeps its Ammonia fuel tank cool with minimal effort however it’s wildly impractical with hydrogen.Add the issues with hydrogen embrittlement and Ammonia starts to look trivial by comparison. People deal with industrial quantities of Ammonia on a regular basis without significant issues. Hell even gasoline and diesel are toxic and can be quite dangerous reply ianburrell 7 hours agorootparentYou don’t have to keep it cool. Ammonia has similar profile to propane. It is liquid at 7-14 bar. We build pressure tanks like that all the time for propane.Ammonia is probably too unsafe for cars and boats. But anything filled by professionals like trains or ships would work. But might work to have tank exchange system like with propane. reply aifooh7Keew6xoo 8 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcchicago.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;attempt-to-pass-a-tank...No, they have significant issues on a regular basis still. reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentAnything dangerous at scale has issues. That doesn’t mean people are unwilling to fill up at a gas station or use other hydrocarbon fuels despite plenty of far worse examples. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;1053162519&#x2F;sierra-leone-oil-t...And plenty of more recent examples: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fox29.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tanker-truck-fire-closes-stretch-...Ammonia is one of the most common chemicals manufactured and transported around the world and has plenty of accidents but hydrocarbon accidents get into the hundreds of deaths: 150 dead https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tacoa_disaster 500-600 dead 5000–7000 suffering severe burns https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;San_Juanico_disaster 167 dead https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Piper_AlphaPeople even hook up to natural gas lines after events big and small like: 300 dead https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_London_School_explosion or here’s a recent event which destroyed 60-100 homes https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Merrimack_Valley_gas_explosion... reply aifooh7Keew6xoo 8 hours agorootparentMy primary point here is that if you see an ammonia spill you&#x27;re going to die whether or not it explodes.I suppose it&#x27;s worth noting in your second link, the fatalities were from the kinetics of the impact, which is a hazard that belongs to \"things with velocity\" rather than \"things containing fuels\".We can assume that uncontained fire and explosion are categorical hazards with fuels.Ammonia has significant risks that few other proposed fuels present and I believe it&#x27;s worth considering whether this is something we want moving outside of hazmat routes between industrial zones. reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentExcept the risk of fire &#x2F; explosion is lower. NFPA 704 for gasoline is 1 Health, 3 fire, 0 Instability where Ammonia is 3 Health, 1 fire, 0 InstabilityMajor spills of either are dangerous but rare compared to how much is being created and transported. We’re only ~5x as much gasoline vs Ammonia today. Considering most cars would be EV’s I suspect the total amount of Ammonia produced even with widespread adoption isn’t going to change by that much. Say Long haul trucks, heavy equipment, aircraft etc.PS: Which isn’t to say Ammonia is actually a good fuel, the only thing I can think that actually used the stuff was the X-15. So it would need significant economic advantages to end up adopted. replydoctorwho42 2 hours agorootparentprevReplace highway infrastructure with train infrastructure that is powered by overhead lines. Build out the power grid to support that, and blanket the country with new rail lines that are nationalized and run as a public utility.Result, reduces carbon footprint of travel - land shipping - ability to build out modern towns - etcToss in a bill to require all train lines to also install national fiber. You now have enabled the revitalization of large swaths of the county. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think either is a good fit really, if that helps. reply rossjudson 7 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure they&#x27;re talking about moving energy, not energy for moving. reply ClumsyPilot 7 hours agorootparentprev> danger to life and health at concentrations as low as 300 ppmWell its not like you can put any petrochemical fuels in you coffee reply Gare 38 minutes agorootparentThis is for ammonia inhalation. reply fbdab103 10 hours agorootparentprevAre there power plants today that burn ammonia directly?

It might work in power plants but not in EVs reply adrian_b 9 hours agorootparentprevThere has been a lot of research in fuel cells that generate electricity from ammonia, with much simpler storage problems than for hydrogen. reply aifooh7Keew6xoo 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d leap to \"much simpler storage problems than for hydrogen\" for a highly corrosive gas.The lower explosive limit of hydrogen is ~4%. By comparison the 300 ppm immediate danger to life and health threshold of ammonia is .03%.It is intrinsically dangerous, i.e. without a source of ignition, at concentrations 2 orders of magnitude lower than the LEL of hydrogen.Not every hydrogen leak is a concern, but just about every ammonia leak is.The established OSHA 15 minute exposure limit for ammonia is 35 ppm, 8 hours is 25 ppm. reply Projectiboga 8 hours agorootparentprevYes, fuel cells need more usage as we move away from oil & unnatural gas. reply galangalalgol 8 hours agorootparentDirect propane fuel cells have some thermal issues, but recently there was a breakthrough in propane synthesis that would make it efficient to produce. Are ammonia fuelcells efficient? reply dexwiz 10 hours agorootparentprevNot sure if they are today, but Toyota is putting a lot of effort into ammonia turbines. Also ammonia can be fired with coal or natural gas in existing setups. The main issue is neutralization of NOx exhaust. reply bequanna 9 hours agorootparentprevWell, we don&#x27;t necessarily need as much storage if we can just shift a good amount of demand.Fertilizer production via this method might be a good fit for times when rates are low or even negative due to wind energy overproduction during off peak. reply jtbayly 10 hours agorootparentprevFarms have been producing their own fertilizer for centuries. ;-) reply eternauta3k 4 hours agorootparentYes, and yields were crap back then.

But as the paper states, they produced 3.9 millimoles — 0.068 grams — of ammonia in 96 hours.So I&#x27;m not exactly holding my breath. It&#x27;s a big improvement over previous methods, but there&#x27;s still a long way to go. reply hinkley 2 hours agorootparentDefinitely hold your breath around people trying to produce ammonia. reply colechristensen 8 hours agoparentprevCO2 production with current processes isn’t necessary. They could use renewable electricity to hydrolyze water and power the plant, it’s just cheaper to use the grid and methane as a source of hydrogen.Switching to carbon free ammonia would be no great task, just a price hike and some minor retrofitting. reply aaron695 9 hours agoparentprev> Big if true...Could you explain exactly why you would say this?Working past their fake news headlines like 100%. Hydrogen is almost 100% and that&#x27;s not big if true.We are decades away for renewable electricity only for our electric needs.Then you have oil and many other things electric can replace which are worse than gas.What about this is big? In a dream world of unlimited electricity everything is easy, like synth fuel and fertilizer and climate control. Today, burning coal to make fertilizer doesn&#x27;t seem good, if this is true. reply japanuspus 10 minutes agorootparentAt current costs, a price-optimal solar&#x2F;wind&#x2F;battery mix for handling existing electricity needs would have on the order of 400% overcapacity. All that extra electricity is what will power the hydrogen-generation.The main challenge is building cheap electrolysers without so much regard to efficiency, in order to use all the power when available. Most commercially available electrolysers today are expensive and cannot ramp up and down quickly. reply ianburrell 7 hours agorootparentprevWe are decades away from needing this. But we need to generate ammonia without fossil fuels for fertilizer and feed stock.Also, we need a fuel for long distance transport like ships when batteries won’t work. Ammonia will always be cheaper than synthetic fuel because no carbon doesn’t have to come from air, and it stores better than hydrogen.There may be lots of surplus electricity in the future but there will also be a lot of demands for carbon capture, hydrogen, long term storage, and chemical processes. reply colechristensen 8 hours agorootparentprevCalifornia produces about half of its electricity from renewables, mostly solar.We’re decades away from 100%, but how long away are we nationally from 50%, 65%, 90%, 99%?As solar production ramps up to higher percentages there is going to be more and more peak power in excess of demand. Industrial scale electrochemistry is going to be one of the alternatives to batteries that’s going to be developed.Already nitrogen fixation requires a huge amount of energy, this process at scale could very well require less energy than the modern haber process. reply applied_heat 6 hours agorootparentWhat factory that produces X is so cheap to build in relation to the cost of energy on a daily basis that it is worth producing less X at different times of day due to the price of energy? The cost of the energy is usually such a small component of total costs it is not worth altering behavior for daily small energy price fluctuations, and nobody is advocating for energy prices to change by 10x throughout the day. reply gofhwgwidi 1 hour agorootparentAluminum reply Paul-Craft 6 hours agoparentprevNot until you can generate electricity at grid scale without CO2 emissions. That includes building the infrastructure to do so. Even nuclear doesn&#x27;t get you there. reply HPsquared 10 hours agoprevWhat does the term \"current-to-ammonia efficiency\" mean here? I imagine it would refer to the specificity of the reaction, i.e. that 99% of the electrons passing through the system are used in the main reaction, and > ... would this method result in less CO2 emissions using regular grid >> electricity, or would it need to be 100% low-carbon electricity? ...Who cares? This is about electricity to ammonia.Given: a very efficient way to make ammonia (as an energy store) using electricity, this becomes a storage mechanism. So then, make ammonia and money whenever the grid is in a &#x27;pay to take power&#x27; state, and (up to a point) even if you have to pay. End source is irrelevant.Alternate process: run a solar farm, produce ammonia whenever that&#x27;s cheaper than paying someone to take the power (or curtail), then sell the stored power when prices are high. Or, sell the ammonia directly. reply snewman 5 hours agoparentprevBear in mind that grid electricity is getting cleaner over time. We need to skate to where the puck is going, which is 100% clean electricity. Now is an excellent time to be developing and preparing to scale technologies that work well with clean electricity. reply HPsquared 2 hours agorootparentYes - in theory, it&#x27;s probably pretty efficient. Just would be interesting to see how it compares. We know it has good Coulombic efficiency, but that&#x27;s only half the picture - at least for energy storage &#x2F; synfuel applications. reply danans 2 hours agoprevThis could be a game changer for seasonal energy storage if it allows round trip efficiencies of even say 60%. Ammonia has been demonstrated as a fuel in existing natural gas turbines [1] at combustion efficiencies up to 99%.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nh3fuelassociation.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;performance-of-amm.... reply hinkley 2 hours agoparentHighly caustic to delicate tissues however, such as lung tissue. reply hn_throwaway_99 10 hours agoprevThis would be a gigantic breakthrough if true and scalable, correct? Most ammonia production for fertilizer currently uses natural gas, and of clean sources of electricity with such a high yield of ammonia production would have a huge worldwide impact. So is there something I&#x27;m missing? reply credit_guy 10 hours agoparentThe scalable part is going to be difficult though.This is not all that different from the production of hydrogen. Hydrogen is most economically produced from natural gas nowadays. You can produce it from water, with (just like here) an almost 100% current-to-hydrogen efficiency. But it&#x27;s still twice as expensive, if not more. reply Superfluidity 9 hours agorootparentElectrolysis of water is 70–80% efficient (a 20–30% conversion loss) while steam reforming of natural gas has a thermal efficiency between 70 and 85%. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hydrogen_production#:~:text=.... reply ororroro 4 hours agorootparentCurrent&#x2F;Faraday efficiency is an entirely different thing. 100% current efficiency means you won&#x27;t get a buildup of side products or erosion of your electrodes due to stray electrons. In isolation it is not a measure of power efficiency. reply pfdietz 10 hours agoparentprevNot if the energy efficiency were poor, compared to electrolytic hydrogen into a conventional Haber-Bosch process. And remember hydrogen is very storable, so that process could buffer renewable intermittency and keep the H-B plant running continuously. Electrolyzers are getting cheap. reply jillesvangurp 50 minutes agorootparentActually storing and transporting hydrogen are technical challenges. It takes up a lot of space and hydrogen molecules are so small they leak through a lot of materials. Not impossible but you need a lot of expensive infrastructure to handle it.Most hydrogen produced today is consumed very close to where it is produced. Also energy storage and fuel type use cases rank very low on Michael Liebreich&#x27;s hydrogen ladder. That&#x27;s a nice tool that ranks different uses of hydrogen by their economic feasibility and overhead. Chemically binding it to something else to store it works of course. Ammonia (NH3) is common for this; and in fact the biggest use case for hydrogen. People have speculated about using that as a fuel. It&#x27;s much easier to store and transport. And of course these chemical transformations also have an energy cost. reply hiddencost 10 hours agoparentprevIf you can start&#x2F;stop the process easily, it could be a great sink for excess solar capacity. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 9 hours agoprevOne downside of ammonia is its toxicity (with an IDLH threshold of 300 ppm). I doubt we&#x27;ll ever see cars running on it, and storing large amounts as energy storage sounds risky.Do we know if this process is burstable (i.e. the devices for running it are likely cheap enough compared to the energy requirement that they don&#x27;t need to run 24&#x2F;7, and could use excess renewable energy when available)? reply ilyt 9 hours agoparentWell, petrol or diesel isn&#x27;t that nice either reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentAnhydrous ammonia is much worse, creating rolling clouds of ground level deadly gas for long distances. And being very flammable. And explosive.Gas doing 2 of those 3, and diesel only 1. reply gimmeThaBeet 7 hours agorootparentI agree, it&#x27;s kind of a different class of threat for everyday people.Not assuming it would be the same, but picturing a spill at a gas station. Spilling gas is a problem, but at least it&#x27;s just sort of there. If you get an ammonia leak and it forms a vapor cloud, I don&#x27;t think most people would know how to deal with that. I&#x27;ll bet your spilled gas likely won&#x27;t migrate into the intersection.But on the plus side, we already see what handling&#x2F;transportation of large amounts looks like for agriculture, even if rail carriers etc. dislike dealing with it. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentFor sure - definitely doable, and certainly not the worst industrial chemical used at large scale. But not super consumer friendly. reply alwayslikethis 7 hours agorootparentprevCorrection: Ammonia is not flammable since the flash point is significantly above room temperature. It would only be explosive if you consider the pressure vessel exploding, but we also have natural gas powered cars which also have pressurized cylinders. The main real issue is the toxicity. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentNope. Anhydrous ammonia between 18-25% is literally ‘explodes like gas vapor’ type explosive&#x2F;flammable.[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worksafebc.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;resources&#x2F;health-safety&#x2F;risk-a....] [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osha.gov&#x2F;laws-regs&#x2F;standardinterpretations&#x2F;1994-....]It does have a higher ignition point than gas. But one a spark can definitely reach. It’s been a common problem in industry where ammonia gets used a lot (refrigeration in particular).BLEVE’s are also a problem too of course. And the toxic nature of breathing it in! Haha. reply totetsu 6 hours agorootparentWasn’t that what happened on the docks in Beirut?

What can ammonia be semi-efficiently converted to?Edit: Maybe methanol? reply jacoblambda 7 hours agorootparentWell... there&#x27;s hydrazine (N2H4) which is the stuff they use as monopropellant rocket fuel. It burns even without the presence of oxygen and it&#x27;s even more toxic and explosive than ammonia. It&#x27;s the reason the capture crews for returning spacecrafts wear hazmat suits.However hydrazine is liquid at room temperature and it can be converted to hydrazone (also being considered for fuel cells) which is solid at room temperature and non-reactive... until it comes into contact with water at which point it all turns back into hydrazine.But yeah no there&#x27;s really not a \"nicer\" fuel. Generally, if it has nitrogen in it and it isn&#x27;t literally just nitrogen with itself, it&#x27;s dangerous. And the more nitrogens it has the more dangerous it is. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentIf there is anything that would make ammonia seem warm and cuddly, it is indeed hydrazine!Urea maybe? It’s almost non toxic and is 2x ammonia + a carbon monoxide molecule.though not sure how efficient it would be to extract energy from.Speaking of ‘extra nitrogen’s are generally bad’, a callout to the azides!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Azidehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lead(II)_azide reply TheSpiceIsLife 8 hours agorootparentprevDiesel is none of those things.I have extinguished a fire with diesel. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentDiesel is definitely flammable. I works great as an accelerant.It isn’t as easily flammable as gas, and doesn’t have easily autoignitable vapor like gas.I’m guessing you dumped a lot of it on something without a lot of thermal mass?If you did the same on a bonfire, you’d have a different story. replyanon_cow1111 6 hours agoprevI need to ask this question for any chemical engineers currently reading this. I&#x27;m seeing people in the comments talking about how this could be applied to consumer vehicles, not just industry like cargo ships and agriculture.If I, the consumer, had unlimited access to cheap, unregulated liquid ammonia (as common as gasoline), how many precursor-steps am I away from having access to like... a LOT of high explosives?-asking for your friendly neighborhood crazy person with a vendetta against... whoever.As far as I can see, it&#x27;s a very similar problem to hydrogen. It doesn&#x27;t matter how safe you can make it, it matters how dangerous a random nutjob can make it. reply jandrewrogers 4 hours agoparentSynthesizing high explosives from anhydrous ammonia is not trivial and no random person would ever bother. There are easier precursors to work with and much easier ways to acquire high explosives than trying to bootstrap from ammonia.And if someone really was bent on mayhem, well, anhydrous ammonia is nasty toxic stuff as is. You don’t need to do anything chemically to it to kill or injure a lot of people. On the other hand, it isn’t a chemical that sneaks up on you. If you are being exposed to dangerous levels, you’ll know it. reply sidewndr46 6 hours agoparentprevWhat would it matter? I can go buy as much materials to make explosives as I want today.Or I could just purchase actual explosives at the sporting good store, like tannerite. reply anon_cow1111 6 hours agorootparentYes, the difference is tannerite (by yield) is many times more expensive, and much easier to trace when someone buys hundreds of pounds of it from a sporting goods store. Similarly, a random individual buying a half ton of AN would probably trip some kind of alarm bells somewhere. reply fodkodrasz 3 hours agoparentprevIt is already very dangerous, no need to turn it into an explosive. It won&#x27;t be given out for handling to untrained people. reply vGPU 6 hours agoparentprevYou can buy ammonium nitrate in bulk. Much easier to turn into an explosive if that’s the point you’re making. Just say you’re opening a farm and off you go. reply anon_cow1111 6 hours agorootparentWell of course, but that only works once before you get traced and caught, might still be acceptable for the aforementioned crazy guy but I assume most others would rather blend in with the 50 million people buying gas on any given day. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentAnhydrous ammonia is even more illegal in most places to get - apparently it’s a precursor to meth production or something? reply anon_cow1111 5 hours agorootparentI heard something about this too, though I omitted it for the sake of brevity. Don&#x27;t know the specifics, but yes I think it&#x27;s also a drug precursor. I remember some CCTV footage of people stealing ammonia from large tanks on a farm, not sure what other reason they would have other than drug production. reply Horffupolde 6 hours agoparentprevNot a reasonable path. reply seventytwo 6 hours agoparentprevIt only needs to be as safe as fossil fuels, or even slightly less safe, if the benefits are higher.This always bothers me. People freak out about LiIon battery failures, or hydrogen, or ammonia, or nuclear power. But here we are with an entire economy riding on an explosive, firey, dirty fuel that is already causing global climate problems.Safety concerns should be kept on-par with what we have today. Let’s not throw out a good solution because it can be dangerous in some cases. Any high-energy-dense thing we switch to after fossil fuels is going to release that energy if handled improperly. That concern should be quite low on the list. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentFueling up with ammonia is roughly as dangerous as fueling up with concentrated pesticide, on the health risk scale.

Gas expands to fill the container, so it&#x27;s only worth discussing in mass terms.It&#x27;s rate of production over the area of the catalyst.

    "originLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln4rsxWq3WM",
    "originBody": "hey everybody how's it going hope you're having a lovely day today I'd like to talk about a couple of Manufacturers that decided to disable products that customers purchased after they purchased them because they did not purchase them the right way further we'd like to talk about how these companies not only decided to disable these phones from being able to make phone calls they also disabled customers from being able to access their data on the phone effectively holding their data hostage until they purchased the new one at their retail store and utilize their own special proprietary software to get the data off of it the worst offender here is Samsung several companies took part in this and I'm going to show you what was going on here I'd like to thank Wan Zago I'm going to include his contact information and his publication down below because he has done so much research in order to get this story out to everybody this is something that's been affecting a lot of people who purchase phones via AliExpress in Mexico many people in Mexico may not buy a phone from the official store because a lot of people in Mexico don't necessarily have the um income standards that we do in America they don't have the the privilege of being able to just walk into an Apple store or a Samsung store and with their middle class job plop down enough money to buy the latest gadget so they will often buy phones that are not stolen they don't have stolen imeis they're simply gray Market phones that were supposed to be for another region but just so happened to work fine in Mexico and many of these phones are displaying messages like this this has been put through translate so it it may be a little bab fish here over here it says your device will be disabled in one day for not complying with regulations in Mexico buy Motorola approved devices for operation in Mexico and you've got this warranty stuff over here uh only one Motorola device which complies with the regulations in Mexico works with the bands and frequencies of the country which is obviously untrue because there are PE people had this device and it was working fine until they decided that they were going to disable it and then you have other brands that decided to jump in and do the same thing your device may not be the official one for your region it's recommended that you contact your dealer for further assistance this over here your device may not be the official one again here they're not actually disabling it which I think is a good thing there are some manufacturers like xiaomi that did not disable the devices for they users which seems to be a much friendlier way to approach it they did send messages to the users saying hey this may not work right in the region but they didn't go out of their way to disable it the way Motorola did Samsung was the worst offender they send out notices saying your device does not comply with Mexican regulations so it'll be disabled as of October 11th 2023 this Samsung device does not comply with Mexican regulations so it has been disabled now you would think that since the device is not following regulations supposedly for cell phone calls they would only be disabled for cell phone calls no they disabled people's abilities to open their applications and get access to their information if the if the device is too dangerous then why not force it to turn off if the device is too dangerous to connect to a cell phone network then why why not just put it in Airplane mode and allow people to get access to their data either it's too dangerous to be on the network but it's fine to turn on in which case you can just permanently put it in Airplane mode or it's too dangerous to be turned on at all in which case you should force the device to turn off and brick itself completely that doesn't seem to be the case here because you're allowing the device to turn off on you're just not allowing the user access to their data which kind of seems like Samsung's trying to hold a user hostage for their personal information which frankly doesn't surprise me this company this year has Astro turfed Reddit and tried to destroy the entire repair industry based on a patent that is 20 years old for a pixel pattern to an AMOLED this is not a pro consumer company this is a company that believes after you purchase their product from a legitimate vendor that you should not be allowed to use it that they have the ability to reach into that device and turn everything on that device off unless you pay them more money uh it continues here you could see more screenshots of this now I know my audience well enough to know what I'm going to see in the comments I understand what I'm what kind of contrarian push back there's going to be if this phone is gray Market maybe it doesn't follow government regulations maybe the government is telling them that they need to shut all these phones down that they need to disable them in this way to keep customers from getting access to their data hold those customers hostage put your forearm to their throat so that they buy the proper phone funny how this worked out Not only was the government not asking these companies to do this they actually punished the companies that did this on October 19th profco and the if issued a suspension against all manufacturers who disable those mobile devices because they unilaterally violated consumer rights by blocking imported phones this suspension was effective immediately and had to be complied with as soon as possible by the different vendors especially Motorola and Samsung because Motorola and Samsung were the ones that were not just sending out messages but actively disabling the phone and in the case of Samsung not even allowing you access to your data or your applications the press release from those government agencies urge them to follow a common path to fight the gray Market without falling on more anti-consumer Behavior it's important to note that both profco and the if launched their own social media campaigns to raise awareness of the gry market of mobile devices but they didn't comment on the specific measures that those companies were planning until now Samsung Oppo and Motorola had to stop all their procedures and they posted their statements through social media and press willing to cooperate with the Mexican Government to find a common solution Not only was the government not requiring the manufacturers to disable these phones they were out right saying this is not how you do this this is not how you're going to do business in our country stop this immediately would you want to buy a phone from a company that actively disables your ability to access your information simply because they want to the simple fact that they have the ability based on IMEI to reach into your device and stop you from being able to access your applications is the most [ __ ] up thing I've ever heard and is one of the best arguments that there could possibly be to run something like graphine Os or lineage Os or CX Os or anything else on your phone other than the garbage stockrom that they give you if you purchase a device in 2023 that is a locked bootloader that you cannot unlock and then relock to install an operating system of your choice on you are essentially giving the manufacturer cart blanch to reach into to your device and [ __ ] you anytime that they see fit and if you're okay with this simply because it was gray Market something tells me you're not going to be okay when they do it for a different reason because if there's anything we've gone over on this channel many times when a company has the ability to reach into your device and take out features or functionality because they want more money they do it the best part of this are the reasons they gave oh my did they give some good reasons the device is approved for correct charging and use with existing voltages in Mexico in such a way that the operation of the battery is not put at risk how is this a problem Samsung doesn't even include a charger with the phone anymore you can't have it both ways you don't you include a USBC cable USBC is a universal standard I could be in the United States I could be in North Korea I could be in Antartica I could be on the moon USBC is going to work the same way we're not even talking about you're selling the device with a 110 volt charger in the box and that country has a 220 volt AC you don't even include a charger with the device not only is the lithium ion battery inside these devices the exact same voltage for every region of the world but they outright say on the website don't listen to me they do not include a charger in the Box anymore why isn't Samsung including earphones and a charger plug in the Box Samsung smartphones come with a USB type-c data cable but they do not come with earphones or a charger plug because we want to minimize the impact their products have in the environment which is why we are going to claim that the charger and the charging voltage is the reason that we have to Brick your phone get rid of your access to your data so that you could buy another one because we care about ew we care so much a better impact on the environment that way are going to reach into your device and [ __ ] disable it unless you give us more money the gall of these people the balls to think that people are actually going to let you get away with this and the sad part is the sad part is the sad part is they probably will not the people that watch this channel but the rest of the world probably will and that makes me sad this is the extent to which these people are willing to [ __ ] test you to see what they can get away with when claiming that what they are doing is for your safety and for your security when it's not again if the device is so dangerous disable it from turning on of course you're not going to do that because if you do that you're not going to be able to have that little message show up that scares them into giving you more money this is disgusting you use the exact same voltage battery in Mexico Meo as you do in America as you do in England as you do in Russia as you do in China the battery inside the device the lithium ion battery is the same voltage and again you're actually bringing up the correct charging use when you don't even include a charger in the box with your phones anymore which by the way was something you used to make fun of Apple for until you started doing it yourself what a piece of [ __ ] company if and again be it's difficult to do these videos now because it's people are going to ask in the comments which company isn't a piece of [ __ ] anymore I don't know man I don't know I can't tell you which companies you should be happy to buy from but I can tell you which company you should be ashamed to buy from and Samsung is one of them let me know what you think in the comments down below I'll include a list of sources as well as a some contact information for the journalist that was responsible for digging all of this good stuff up thank you very much Juan for really being a part of uh of this conversation uh and again if people like this were not pushing as hard as they were who knows maybe the Mexican Government wouldn't have pushed back on Samsung Motorola and every other manufacturer that did this maybe people wouldn't be getting their data back uh maybe they would still be held hostage today so thank you very much for your work and Samsung if you're watching this video [ __ ] you and I wonder why this channel doesn't have sponsors after 11 years on YouTube that's it for today and as always I hope you learn

I’ve not seen that brand before coming here.Some of them are pretty cheap even.I thought about buying one so that I could leave my iPhone in the hotel room some days and only carry a cheap phone when I am outside walking in some parts of the city.We are leaving Cancún soon, so now there is not so much point in doing that anyways.

Either the runtime keeps it safe and postpones actually destroying the arena if there are references leading to it. Or it trusts the programmer, which will eventually result in fun late-night debugging sessions. TA indicates that SBCL is rather of the former variety since it describes debugging tools to find references leading from the heap to the arena.I guess it is best practice to bury arena management inside some sort of framework and don&#x27;t fiddle with them in business code. reply benreesman 4 hours agoprevOh man, we’ve needed a rock-solid arena model in C++ forever. There’s stuff but it really needs compiler support to be clean.Jai just seems to be going from strength to strength with arena-by-default.The key insight is that a modern malloc isn’t terribly different from a modern GC: people seem to vastly overstate the difference IMHO.Arenas are like a bumping nursery but better. I hope we keep seeing more of this. reply alexvitkov 2 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t see why a language would need special support for arenas, unless it is GCed. It&#x27;s a simpler alloction model than malloc, and C++ doesn&#x27;t really have builtin support for malloc either, it just calls free() in a bunch of destructors in the STL. reply pfdietz 10 hours agoprevI&#x27;m guessing this is something they&#x27;re finding useful at Google?

Intermission Was the Trial Too Short? Do European Doctors Suck? Why Was There No Impact on Overall Mortality? Discussion You’re Invited to a Colonoscopy! Dynomight Colonoscopies are the first-line method for preventing colorectal cancer in America —and almost nowhere else. But do they work? We finally have a comprehensive trial, but it’s left gastroenterologists with more questions than answers. Colorectal cancer is the second-most deadly cancer, killing over 1 million people per year around the world — 1.7% of all deaths. In the United States, where colorectal cancer causes 50,000 deaths per year, the foundation of the fight against it is the colonoscopy. Getting one periodically is recommended for everyone over the age of 45. Colonoscopies are rarely used for screening elsewhere but have been standard in the U.S. for decades. There are many reasons to think that they should work. But they are also expensive, invasive, unpleasant, and rarely — but not that rarely — have serious side effects. Are they worth it? Until recently we didn’t have any randomized controlled trials that directly tested how well colonoscopies work. We finally just got one and the results were — how can I describe them? Confusing? Ambiguous? Frenzy-inducing? Let’s try to understand what to make of this trial, and why American gastroenterologists were so quick to criticize it. Karol Banach Reminders About Tubes After you swallow food, your body uses rhythmic waves of contractions to send it on a 4-meter (13-foot) journey through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. These extract most of the food’s nutrients and render it into a pulpy acidic fluid called chyme. The chyme then travels through your colon, a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tube that reabsorbs water and electrolytes, creating a solid mass that is then moved to your rectum for storage and eventual disposal. Yay! The outermost layer of your inner colon is a single layer of epithelial cells whose job it is to let the good stuff through and keep the bad stuff out. Stem cells deeper inside the colon constantly divide to make new epithelial cells, which climb to the surface and live for four or five days before committing “suicide.” Colonoscopies rest on the adenoma-carcinoma hypothesis. The idea is that errors can arise in the DNA, resulting in epithelial cells that don’t die on schedule. If they do anything too weird, your T-cells will kill them. But some mutations fly under the radar, causing little clumps of cells to grow on the surface of the colon. These clumps, or “polyps,” are usually not cancer — they grow slowly, and won’t (yet) spread to neighboring tissues. But if these persist for many years, they can acquire additional mutations that make them start spreading. To prepare for a colonoscopy, you must empty your colon. This is achieved by drinking some chemicals and enduring some spectacular biological functions. Then a doctor threads a 1.5-meter (5-foot) flexible tube with a light and camera to look at the entire colon and remove or sample any polyps. The idea is not just to detect cancer but, by removing precancerous polyps, prevent it. The primary alternative to colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening are “occult blood tests” that look for spooky hidden blood in the stool. The oldest of these use an extract of the guaiacum tree and have RCTs showing they reduce colorectal cancer mortality by 9%-22% when used for screening. Newer tests look for antibodies and/or genetic mutations. These are more sensitive, though we don’t yet have RCTs estimating how much they help with mortality. Another alternative is an older procedure called a sigmoidoscopy, which is basically a “mini” colonoscopy with a 0.6-meter (2-foot) tube. Compared to colonoscopy, it is quicker, safer, less painful, and cheaper, but it can only look at the lower (“sigmoid”) colon. Still, randomized trials have shown that screening sigmoidoscopies reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 26%-30%. In principle, colonoscopies should be better than either of these tests. Unlike blood tests, colonoscopies try to remove polyps before they become cancer. And unlike sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopies can examine the whole colon. But how much does it actually help to remove precancerous polyps? Gastrointestinal doctors often point to the National Polyp Study, but this is not a true randomized comparison — the study did colonoscopies on all subjects and concluded, based on comparisons to base rates in other “similar” populations, that removing polyps helped. And how much does it help to screen the whole colon? Cross et al. compared sigmoidoscopy to colonoscopy in English patients with suspected colorectal cancer and found that sigmoidoscopy was sufficient to detect 80% of cancers. Because of the cost, the lack of direct evidence for efficacy, and the fact that it’s hard to convince people to do colonoscopies, they are rarely used for cancer screening outside the United States and some parts of German-speaking Europe. So it would be really useful to have an RCT that tested how well screening colonoscopies work. The Trial That brings us to the star of our show. The Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) is a huge randomized trial aimed at rigorously measuring how much colonoscopies reduce cancer and death.1 Here’s what the researchers did: Between 2009 and 2014, they identified 85,1792 subjects mostly in Poland (64.1%), Norway (31.2%), and Sweden (4.3%), drawn at random from population registries of people between 55 and 64 years old.3 They invited one-third of them to a one-time screening colonoscopy. Of those contacted, 42% accepted the invitation and underwent a colonoscopy, while 58% refused the invitation. The other two-thirds of people were not contacted and seemingly never knew they were in the trial. The researchers then followed everyone (invited or not, colonoscopy or not) for a median of 10 years and checked government records to see who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, died from colorectal cancer, or died from any cause. This was an “intention-to-screen” analysis. That means that it compared the control group to the whole invited group, including both the 42% of people who agreed to a colonoscopy and the 58% who refused. (If that seems strange, keep reading.) These were the main results: The 18% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence was statistically significant, while the 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality and 1% reduction in overall mortality were not. So the reductions — they are small. This was a surprise. The study had a huge sample and simple, reliable statistics. The authors seemed to expect a stronger showing for colonoscopies. When that didn’t happen, they made no excuses — they just followed their preregistered statistical plan and published the results. We want research to be reproducible, right? Well, then this is what we want people to do. The Debate This paper was greeted with gastroenterological bedlam. One response was that it shows colonoscopies aren’t cost-effective, since there was only a small effect on deaths from colorectal cancer, not much better than in previous trials of less invasive screening methods. Others took the more extreme stance that the study was further proof that American medicine is rotten, subjecting us to horrible expensive procedures for little benefit. Overwhelmingly, American gastroenterologists did not agree. A primary concern expressed on Twitter (now known as X) seemed to be that the study might cause patients to do the worst thing a patient can ever do: Read a paper and ask questions about it. For a little slice of the debate, take CNN’s piece, “New Study Examines the Effectiveness of Colonoscopies.” It describes the study and results, gives a few quotes from the authors and other experts about how the results are surprising, cautions that it isn’t conclusive and further research is needed, and notes that “other studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.” The American College of Gastroenterology disagreed with CNN so strongly that it released a rebuttal, claiming: 1. The way the study was set up, colonoscopies couldn’t possibly succeed because only 42% of people agreed to screening, 10 years isn’t long enough to see a benefit, and European doctors are bad at colonoscopies. 2. There is other evidence that removing polyps and doing colonoscopies save lives. 3. It’s irresponsible to call colonoscopies “invasive” (as CNN did) since that might make people think they are unpleasant and not do them. 4. Actually, the study shows colonoscopies are great. Similar points were raised elsewhere, such as in a letter doctors sent to the New England Journal of Medicine. Are these points correct? Why were American gastroenterologists so eager to dismiss this trial? Did the Trial Actually Show That Colonoscopies Are Great? By far the biggest controversy with the trial comes from the fact that only a minority of people agreed to screening. Colonoscopies can’t do anything if they don’t happen. Many doctors suggested that if you look at the numbers in the right way, then this trial shows colonoscopies are great. For example, Hanley argues that while only 42% of people agreed to screening, among the people who did, colon cancer incidence was reduced by 31% and colon cancer mortality was reduced by 50%. Many, many other doctors repeated the claim that this trial showed that getting a colonoscopy reduced the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by 50%. A common meme was to reframe the 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality in the main intention-to-screen analysis by rewriting the title in dismissive ways like “Effect of Mailing Letters to People on Risks of Colorectal Cancer and Related Death.” In my opinion, that 50% number is at best unreliable and probably just wrong. Looking into why gives a great lesson on why statistics is hard and how that hardness conspires with social dynamics to confuse people. In this study, there were three types of people: Controls, who were never contacted Refusers, who were invited to get a colonoscopy but declined Acceptors, who were invited to get a colonoscopy and chose to proceed The main analysis only compares the controls to the combination of the acceptors and refusers. One reason to do so is that all screening programs see some proportion of people refuse assessment; what the analysis provides is a direct estimate of what an actual program would do. But if you’re deciding if you should get a colonoscopy personally, then you’d like to know how much it would help. Naively, you might try to find out by looking at results for the acceptors versus controls, ignoring refusers. Unfortunately, there’s a deep problem: Acceptors and refusers are different. They might vary in age, sex, education, ethnicity, family health history, or comfort with their own tubes. Even if the colonoscopies had never happened, they would have had different outcomes from the controls. This is not hypothetical! At the end of the study period, 1.2% of the controls were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, compared with 1.05% of refusers and 0.89% of acceptors.4 The refusers have less colorectal cancer than controls, even though neither had colonoscopies. The likely explanation is that people have some idea of their risk, either because of their family history, their lifestyle, or how their tubes have been feeling recently. Those at lower risk are more likely to refuse. (It’s also possible that refusers just hate going to the doctor and so just had fewer diagnoses, but never mind.) So you can’t directly compare acceptors to controls or to refusers. They are different populations. Sadly, there’s no good way to solve this problem. But there are many bad ones! The main results in the paper are the intention-to-screen analysis that compares the controls to the whole invited group. This understates the benefits of colonoscopies because it ignores the fact that less than half of invited people agreed to have colonoscopies. But this analysis is ultrarobust, because it compares two perfectly randomized groups. It found an 18% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. An intuitive way to fix that bias would be to do a naive correction and pretend that the 42% of people who agreed to colonoscopies were random. If that were true, then the benefits if everyone agreed would have been 1/0.42 = 2.38 times as large, meaning that if 100% of people agreed instead of 42%, there would have been a 43% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 24% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. I call this “naive” because people did not agree at random. But what’s the bias? Remember, people at higher risk were more likely to agree. That means that the colonoscopies that were done were allocated more efficiently than a random allocation. Thus, the naive correction is likely an overestimate. We’d expect somewhat less than a 24% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality if everyone accepted. One thing you can do is estimate what would have happened to the acceptors if they hadn’t gotten colonoscopies. Imagine a world where the trial never happened. Outcomes for the control group and the refusers would stay the same — the only people with a different result would be the ones who would have accepted colonoscopies had the study occurred. On the whole, though, the would-be invited group (that is, the would-be refusers and the would-be acceptors) would be just like the controls, since no one would have received any screening. With this in mind, we can work out what would have happened to the would-be acceptors in that world. You can see this in the dotted line in the graphs below: Source: Dynomight, data from NordICC The right graph compares those results to the observed outcomes for acceptors in our branch of the multiverse, where they did have colonoscopies. At the end of the trial, there’s a reduction of 37%. Unfortunately, data aren’t available to do this for mortality, but this confirms the idea that the true effects are probably a bit lower than what the naive correction gives. So where does this “50% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality” everyone is quoting come from? This is a complex per-protocol analysis that tries to use math to “make” the acceptors be like the controls. The details are a little fuzzy because the paper does the common academic thing where it says the details are in another paper that itself cites other papers in an infinite regress. But, basically, the analysis takes data from all the acceptors and refusers and fits a big equation to predict someone’s odds of getting diagnosed with or dying from colorectal cancer based on their age, sex, country, and group (acceptor or control). Then they see how much those odds change when you flip the group assignment. This gives the much quoted decrease of 31% in colorectal cancer diagnoses and 50% in colorectal cancer mortality. Because that kind of analysis is known to be unreliable, they also included a sensitivity analysis as a sanity check. This gave a 34% decrease in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 28% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. To summarize: The last three analyses all give something like a 33% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses. I think we can be reasonably confident that’s right. But should we believe that 50% number from the per-protocol analysis for colorectal cancer mortality? I mean … no? Let’s start with common sense. Certainly, if everyone invited had colonoscopies, the observed 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality would have been higher. But would it have been five times larger, even though almost half of people already got colonoscopies? Doubtful. The naive correction gives a reduction of only 24% in colorectal cancer mortality, and we have strong reasons to think this is an overestimate. The 50% number comes from a fiddly statistical technique that only works under strong assumptions. One of these is that all the ways controls and acceptors vary are included in the dataset. But the dataset used was very limited — it didn’t have income, education, family history, or how people’s tubes were feeling when they got the invitation. If any of those things influenced people’s choices to accept, then this analysis wouldn’t have been able to correct for the biases between the groups. And there weren’t that many colorectal cancer deaths during the trial (229 total), so the analysis was done on sparse data. And the sensitivity analysis — the point of this was to check how sensitive the per-protocol analysis is to its rather tenuous assumptions. It worked! It showed that the “50% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality” calculation is exquisitely sensitive to those assumptions! But then everyone just sort of ignored it. So what happened? How did we end up with so many gastroenterologists quoting this 50% number? I wouldn’t blame the study authors. The paper largely just carries out the preregistered analysis without much comment. But in a letter to the journal, the authors emphasize that the per-protocol analysis is “prone to bias” and “not as trustworthy” and “caution against overinterpretation … because the number of deaths to date was small.” But further removed reports get from the original study, the more those cautions disappear. Other doctors writing about the study didn’t pay much attention to those concerns. By the time you get to the doctors on social media, they’re basically gone. It’s hard not to think that there’s some motivated reasoning at work here. Around 15 million colonoscopies are done in the U.S. each year, at an average cost of something like $3,000 for each. I don’t think doctors are intentionally distorting the truth. But they have been trained that colonoscopies are extremely effective, and most of them are busy and — no offense — have only a superficial understanding of statistics. So when a study comes out with various numbers, it’s human nature to look much harder for flaws in the surprising numbers than the ones that reinforce your worldview. Or, to put it another way: Imagine a world where the intention-to-screen analysis showed strong effects, but the per-protocol analysis showed weak ones. Which one do you think everyone would be quoting? Intermission There are no good colonoscopy jokes. I asked everyone and found none that were funny or tasteful. Here’s the least-terrible one, a joint effort of myself and a large language model. Q. Why do Bayesians love colonoscopy trials? A. Because they use posteriors to inform priors. I know, I know. Anyway. Was the Trial Too Short? Many doctors also objected that the trial didn’t give colonoscopies a fair chance. One theory is that 10 years isn’t long enough (we'll know more when the trial ends and 15-year mortality is released). It takes years for polyps to turn into cancer and even longer for that cancer to kill you. Maybe the colonoscopies removed lots of polyps that would have eventually turned into cancer and/or deaths, but wouldn’t have done so yet. The best way to check this theory would be to look at how previous trials evolved after 10 years. We don’t have any such trials for colonoscopies, but we do for sigmoidoscopies. NORCCAP ran in Norway, where 61% of men agreed to screening. UKFSST ran in the U.K., where 71% agreed to screening. Here is the reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and mortality in the invited group compared to the control group in all three trials over time:5 Source: Dynomight, data from NordICC, UKFSST, and NORCCAP For diagnoses, the “reduction” is negative at first because screening catches a lot of cancer that would otherwise be missed. In NordICC, the reduction is smaller than sigmoidoscopy trials probably just because NordICC saw fewer people agree to screening. But, overall, the NordICC curve looks similar to the other trials, suggesting modest gains over time. For mortality, things just look weird. The other trials seemed to reach their maximum benefit by five to seven years and then sort of bounce around randomly. But NordICC actually had higher colorectal cancer mortality in the invited group until almost the end of the trial. I assume this was just bad luck. It’s hard to say what that green line will do in future years. Do European Doctors Suck? While the equipment is standardized, colonoscopies are effectively artisanal: The doctor decides what looks bad and what should be sampled or removed. Another theory for the small effect in the NordICC trial is that since colonoscopies are less common in Europe, the doctors had less experience than American doctors. The skill of a doctor doing a colonoscopy is often measured by their adenoma detection rate — how often they find a precancerous polyp. American doctors find them 40% of the time. In the NordICC trial, doctors found them only 31% of the time. Many suggested this meant the doctors weren’t great. Cappell et al. counter that perhaps it wasn’t the doctors but that there were more adenomas to find in the American colons because of “higher prevalence of obesity (30% vs. 12%), a higher rate of ever having smoked cigarettes, higher fat and cholesterol consumption, and poorer physical fitness.” Dominitz and Robertson reply that lifestyles notwithstanding, the U.S. has substantially lower rates of colorectal cancer. I was surprised by this and looked up the numbers. Here are the rates per 100,000 people aged 55-64.6 The obvious interpretation is that Americans have fewer adenomas than Europeans, meaning the doctors in the trial were worse than American doctors at detecting them. But be cautious: Diagnoses aren’t a great measure of incidence, since they depend on how aggressively you look. And deaths also aren’t great, since they depend on treatments. It’s also conceivable that Americans do have more adenomas, but because colonoscopies are already common in the U.S., many get removed before they become cancer. Also, I’m not sure I trust that the diagnosis rates in this data reflect cancer rates: Do we really believe that Norway has 45% more colorectal cancer than Sweden, despite the fact that these countries have similar diets, life expectancies, and mortality rates — and that Norwegians drink and smoke a bit less? (The mysteriously high colorectal cancer diagnosis rates in Norway have been noted for decades.7 ) Another oddity is that there were zero perforations in the NordICC trial across all 12,000 colonoscopies performed whereas previous studies report them at rates between 1 in 100 and 1 in 20,000. (Perforation of the colon is fatal without emergency surgery.) One interpretation of this is that European doctors are awesome. Alternatively, Powell and Prasad give this heart-warming speculation: It has been hypothesized that the absence of perforation in NordICC was due in part by the fact that the vast majority of procedures were unsedated, preventing the operator from using more force—a contributing factor to perforation. If doing colonoscopies without anesthesia reduces perforations, that’s great. But one doctor I talked to suggested that without anesthesia it’s impossible to be as thorough, so this might reduce the benefits of colonoscopies. Overall, I don’t think we have a clear answer here. I think there is weak evidence for the idea that the average American colonoscopy is better than those in this trial. But it’s very uncertain. Why Was There No Impact on Overall Mortality? Among nondoctors, many people were surprised that overall mortality rates — from any cause — were the same in the control and invited groups. Isn’t the point of colonoscopies to prevent death? Does this mean colonoscopies are worthless? No. I ran millions of simulated trials assuming “magic colonoscopies” that reduced the odds of dying from colorectal cancer to zero. The results ranged from the invited group having 5.6% lower overall mortality to 2.5% higher.8 So we can’t conclude anything from this. There just aren’t enough people to detect a tiny signal (change in colorectal cancer mortality) that’s drowned out by tons of noise (mortality from other factors). Discussion Are colonoscopies better than other screening methods? I don’t know. Maybe! But on the margin, surely this trial gives some evidence that colonoscopies might not be as effective as we hoped. So why were American gastroenterologists so keen to dismiss it? There seemed to be no similar frenzy of doctors in other countries trying to discredit the trial. Or, to back up — why has America settled on colonoscopies when most of the world has not? Regulators in Europe basically give two reasons that they continue to recommend fecal blood tests: 1. It’s hard to get Europeans to do any colorectal cancer screening, and exceedingly hard to get them to agree to colonoscopies. 2. Colonoscopies have not yet been proven to be cost-effective. In America, neither of these apply. When setting recommendations, the U.S. Preventative Service Task Force explicitly does not consider costs. And since we expect colonoscopies to be effective, it would be too risky not to do them. Americans are probably more open to colonoscopies simply because doctors have told them for decades how important they are. (Note: None of these things are obviously bad!) So that’s my theory. Europe wants stronger evidence for cost-effectiveness. America is more aggressive and more willing to accept high costs. I don’t think this trial changes that. Colonoscopies are still expensive, and still possibly but not conclusively better. One thing is clear: Screening works. If you’re of the appropriate age, please get screened. If your tubes are acting funny, please get screened without delay. The best method and the level of benefit are debatable, but we know it helps. Use a stool test if you want (multitarget DNA test if you can), or a colonoscopy, or a sigmoidoscopy, or a “virtual” CT colonoscopy, or a crazy edible camera. Do one of them. Statistics show colorectal cancer is highly curable when caught early, and now that we have feisty checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies,it’s probably even better now. Just do it. Your tubes will thank you. An earlier version of this article referred to the NordICC trial in the past tense. It has been updated to reflect that the trial is still ongoing. This piece is based on the ten-year preliminary analysis. We'll know more when the final results are published for the 15-year trial, probably in 2027. They originally identified 94,958 individuals, including 9,780 participants from the Netherlands. These were not included in the final analysis because a Dutch law based on EU data protection regulations was passed which made follow-up impossible. They excluded 221 people for having a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer and 373 for being — umm — dead, leaving them with 84,585. Since no data were available, I extracted the numbers for refusers and from images in the published papers. This was tons of fun and probably introduced a bit of noise. Unfortunately, there is no data available on the breakdown of these three groups in terms of colorectal cancer mortality or overall mortality. I checked with the authors, who said they aren’t releasing the numbers because there aren’t enough data available yet. Again, for this and all the following plots, I had to extract the data from images in the published papers, which probably introduced some noise. These are all age-standardized numbers for 2020. The mortality number for the U.S. comes from the CDC’s WONDER system, combining deaths from malignant neoplasm of the colon and rectum. All the other numbers come from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. (Mortality numbers aren’t available for Sweden.) See, e.g., N. Malila and T. Hakulinen, “Epidemiological Trends of Colorectal Cancer in the Nordic Countries,” Scandinavian Journal of Surgery 92, no. 1 (2003): 5-9. Suppose that over 10 years, someone has a 0.31% chance of dying of colorectal cancer and a 10.73% chance of dying of something else (the observed rates in the control group in the trial). And suppose that 42% of people invited for colonoscopies agree, and if they do, their risk of dying from colorectal cancer drops to zero. I ran millions of simulations with the same numbers of people as in this trial. If you take the inner 95% range of outcomes, these ranged from the invited group having 5.6% lower to 2.5% higher. It’s a weird coincidence that there was no change in this trial. Dynomight writes about science and dispenses life advice at dynomight.net. Published October 2023 Have something to say?

I did what any smart, effective 20yo would do: ignored it because I was embarrassed.Fast forward 10 years, and I’d been ignoring it for a decade. It had continued to happen every few months. Sometimes the blood was so bad I’d have to wait up to 20 minutes for it to stop. Other times I would see blood, but no bleeding.These are bad signs. If you see this, don’t do what I did. I was gambling with my life. Remember that popular video game commenter that died from this? Totalbiscuit? He concealed his, and he lost.The most unexpected thing is that when I actually wanted one, the process took over two years. And that was after a year or so of periodically mentioning it to the doctors, who would give me a sheet of numbers to call and I never bothered. Those three years could have been the difference.Turns out, there’s nothing wrong with me. It was hemorrhoids. You might think you’re smart enough to tell the difference. I thought so. I was a cocky idiot who could’ve died from cancer before seeing my daughter get married.Just get one if you see something. The final paragraph of the article pleads you to. The peace of mind alone was worth the small unpleasantness and major logistical annoyance. reply antoniuschan99 3 hours agoparentIt’s also good know that if you’re seeing bright red blood then it’s a higher chance it’s hemorrhoids whereas dark red you definitely should get it checked because it’s coming from inside your colon.Also there’s supposedly a poop test called fecal occult blood test that has a high rate of detecting colorectal cancer that you do over the course of 3 years. I saw this on nhk Doctor&#x27;s Insight: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www3.nhk.or.jp&#x2F;nhkworld&#x2F;en&#x2F;ondemand&#x2F;video&#x2F;2086035&#x2F; reply spondylosaurus 2 hours agorootparentBright red blood can also be a sign of inflammation&#x2F;bleeding in the low low colon, e.g., proctitis. (Ask me how I know, lol.)As a rule of thumb, the farther the blood has to travel, the darker it&#x27;ll be. Blood from high up enough in your GI tract will be a black, tarry substance, NOT red, but it&#x27;s absolutely blood and you need to get that checked out ASAP. reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentprevUnless, of course, you uave both: the office worker hemorrhoids and colon cancer. Ask me how I know that! So no, if ypi start bleeding from your body without having injured yourself, see a doctor and get it checked out.Wrll, actually, if thebimjury is beyond \"a self applied band aid can fix it\", see a doctor as well! reply szundi 1 hour agorootparentprevAdvice too simplistic, end of colon can emit blood also and then it’s brighter reply Aeolun 4 minutes agorootparent“Recurrent bleeding from colon is bad, go see a doctor.” Is a fairly simple rule. reply maxbond 3 hours agoparentprevThank you for sharing.I&#x27;ll share a story to help destigmatize. A few months ago I was taken completely out of commission by GI symptoms, just hours and hours of pain and vomiting. It turned out I had an infection, but the infection caused there to be shapes on my intestine that apparently looked vaguely like Crohn&#x27;s disease on the MRI (or something, I&#x27;m not a radiologist, my understanding is pretty vague. There were bubbles in my intestine from bacterial respiration).So I got a colonoscopy. And it turns out I&#x27;m fine. Drinking the prep isn&#x27;t my favorite thing, but it&#x27;s a task that gets done.If two gallons of salt water and a trip to the doctor is all that stands between you and seeing your daughter&#x27;s wedding, make it happen and you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Everybody poops and everybody gets a colonoscopy.I got hemorrhoids afterwards too. Cutting corn kernels (if you know, you know) out of my diet made them go away. Afterwards I could eat them again.

Most likely hemorrhoids.The problem is when you have BLACK blood in the stool. That may be an internal bleeding. reply k0k0 1 hour agorootparentWrong. There is melena, which is a generally unmistakable consistency of black sticky stool (nothing anyone would identify as \"blood\") that is indicative of upper GI bleeding - not the colon. It doesn&#x27;t really indicate severity because it may be fast or relatively slow. Both upper and lower GI bleeding can be serious in terms of acuity or seriousness of disease (cancer).However if the internal bleeding from the upper GI system is brisk&#x2F;fast enough it will come out bright red. This can happen to people with esophageal varices (sequela of liver disease and cirrhosis) or brisk stomach or duodenal ulcers and the prognosis is usually poor, but very likely they will be getting emergent endoscopies and&#x2F;or mass transfusion if they make it out of the ED.You can&#x27;t tell by color.> That may be an internal bleeding.Colonic bleeding is just as internal and will typically be red or maroon. reply thinkingemote 1 hour agorootparentJust a little aside for those doing a search in the future: many things you consume can also turn poop reddish so be sure to think about what you had for dinner if you&#x27;ve just noticed it.

The best method and the level of benefit are debatable, but we know it helps.That&#x27;s unfortunate, because it&#x27;s a poor summary of the actual paper the article is discussing. If you bother to read the rest of the article, you&#x27;ll see the actual summary of the trial, and it&#x27;s pretty darned easy to interpret for yourself:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asteriskmag.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;pages&#x2F;issues&#x2F;04&#x2F;you-re-invited...to wit:> The 18% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence was statistically significant, while the 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality and 1% reduction in overall mortality were not.(Those reductions are relative risks, which are on very small baseline numbers.)Then the article goes on for many pages about how American gastroenterologists do not agree...which isn&#x27;t terribly shocking, considering the source of the argument. But a number of rebuttals are made, some of which are reasonable (i.e. colonoscopies are one of the few screening tests to actually do something to prevent disease, in the form of clipping polyps), and others of which are quite simply lies (\"other studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies\" -- yeah, but those studies were bad, and this one was good, which is why we&#x27;re talking about it!)Note that American gastroenterologists do a lot of colonoscopies, mostly without good evidence. This was the first major RCT in decades to consider the question at all. The other screening methods have even worse evidence, and certainly no good evidence at the young ages we do them in the USA (currently 40 in men; the studies are all in much older age groups).Overall, the NORDICC trial paints an incredibly ambiguous picture for the effectiveness of colonoscopy at preventing severe illness or death -- at the very least, the benefits are likely dramatically overstated. Discussing all of this, then turning around and claiming \"it works\" is an insult to evidence-based medicine.(FWIW, I&#x27;m personally torn on the meaning of the study. I just think that \"one thing is clear\" line is a particularly odious bit of \"journalism\" -- not the least because it confuses symptom-free screening with doing something in reaction to symptoms. The rest of the article is pretty fair, IMO, but that line is substituting the opinion of the author for an actual summary of the data.) reply Expez 3 hours agoprevThe article doesn&#x27;t cover this, but it&#x27;s worth pointing out why the study asks this particular question. With a single-payer system the Nordic countries want to know what the ROI is if we sent letters out to everyone above a certain age offering a free colonoscopy. The study is well-designed to answer that question.The study does a poor job of helping an individual asking a similar but different question: Is it worthwhile for me to pay out of pocket for a colonoscopy?The latter question is very important in a system that isn&#x27;t single-payer and so this has sparked a lot of debate in e.g the US. reply kashunstva 2 hours agoparentThe intention-to-screen design of the trial depends heavily on the effectiveness of recruitment and the pre-existing “prevalence” of the test in the setting in which the study is conducted.

If it&#x27;s assessed as like a national program applied to everyone, that&#x27;s one way of understanding its value. But if you believe yourself to be a part of a special at risk population and can have good reason for making that determination, to me it raises a new question about the wisdom of proceeding. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agoprevPeople struggle with binaries. It is very likely that regular colonoscopies are net harmful for most people, and very beneficial for some.The population isnt homogeneous.Some people have significant risk factors, like family history, others do not.We don&#x27;t ask if everyone should start wearing glasses at 40, so why this? reply kqr2 2 hours agoparentBut people with healthcare &#x2F; vision care usually have their eyes checked yearly. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentYes, but eye exams don’t carry a risk of death. It is a noninterventional screening. It is more like a stool sample or questionnaire than a colonoscopy reply theogravity 46 minutes agoprevI just got one two days ago because my family has a history of it. Other than having to go on a no fiber diet and ingesting specific sets of salts to empty the bowel for the procedure, it was pretty in and out, and no pain at all afterwords (probably because they didn&#x27;t find any polyps).

As others have said: if your colon is otherwise healthy, it is safe and the worst part is the prep.However, the last time 10 months ago, my body&#x27;s immune system was stressed by another cancer, and so a tumour developed in only nine months. Because of the risk of more colon cancer during the treatment of the other cancer, the doctors removed my colon, despite it otherwise being \"strong, young and healthy\".

Good trials try to minimize bias or at least limit it to things we know don&#x27;t introduce bias.The article does a nice job at digging into the nuances of the trial design and how it may influence (or not influence) the results.That&#x27;s why the \"reference wars\" you see on HN are so pointless. It&#x27;s easy to just find a paper that supports your position. But trials are of varying quality.What you see in this article is what normally happens with most major trials - results get discussed, challenged, discussed some more. After a few months doctors finally settle on the main takeaways. Sometimes it takes years. reply re 5 hours agoparentYeah, I thought the discussion of how you couldn&#x27;t just directly compare people that accepted the colonoscopy invitation with the control group was really interesting, and non-obvious (at least to people like me that don&#x27;t design studies). It reminds me of the fundamental problem that all surveys have in terms of the bias introduced by being limited to \"people who agree to take surveys\". reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparentAny self-selection where higher risk individuals opt-in more, increases benefit&#x2F;cost ratios.That seems like a pro invitation argument.

There was no sign of foul play. BY RICHARD WINTON, MATT BRENNAN, CONNOR SHEETS OCT. 28, 2023 UPDATED 9:11 PM PT Facebook Twitter Show more sharing options “Friends” star Matthew Perry was found dead Saturday in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home, law enforcement sources said. He was 54. Authorities responded about 4 p.m. to his home, where he was discovered unresponsive. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing, did not cite a cause of death. No drugs were found at the scene, sources said. Additionally, no foul play is suspected, according to law enforcement sources. A representative for Perry did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment. The Los Angeles Police Department’s robbery-homicide detectives are investigating the death. The cause of death will be determined at a later date by the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. “We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry,” Warner Bros. Television Group, which produced “Friends,” said in a statement to The Times. “Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family. The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans.” “We are incredibly saddened by the too soon passing of Matthew Perry,” NBC, which aired the series for all 10 seasons, said in its own statement to The Times. “He brought so much joy to hundreds of millions of people around the world with his pitch perfect comedic timing and wry wit. His legacy will live on through countless generations.” ADVERTISEMENT ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS Hollywood remembers ‘comedic genius’ Matthew Perry: ‘His legacy will live on’ Oct. 28, 2023 Saturday evening yellow-and-black LAPD crime scene tape blocked off the entrance to Blue Sail Drive, a tony street just off the Pacific Coast Highway at the crest of a hill with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. Shortly after 7 p.m., as multiple helicopters whirred overhead, Perry’s mother, Suzanne, and her husband, broadcaster Keith Morrison, arrived on the scene. Morrison declined to comment. An LAPD officer at the scene said he had no information and that he did not know when any would be forthcoming. Peter, a neighbor of Perry’s on Bluesail Drive who declined to give his last name Saturday evening, said he only spoke to the actor once, for five minutes, and that he was “very pleasant” and a “nice guy.” “It’s shocking,” Peter said as he waited for the LAPD, who had barred journalists from passing the police tape, to approve him for entry. “He’s been redoing this house forever and he seemed fine. It’s very sad.” Leo, another neighbor who declined to give his full name, said he was home when an ambulance arrived at Perry’s house Saturday afternoon. He declined to say whether paramedics tried to revive Perry or if a body was removed from the premises. ADVERTISEMENT “I was shocked,” he said. “It was very disturbing and sad after all these years.” Perry was one of his favorite actors, Leo said, and the funniest member of the “Friends” cast. “I encountered him once and he was very, very friendly. More so than I thought,” Leo said. “It’s definitely a tragedy, especially at such a young age,” he added. “I was very heartbroken to see what happened.” Perry’s stepfather, Canadian broadcaster Keith Morrison, crosses under the police tape near Perry’s house in Los Angeles Saturday night. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Perry, the son of actor John Bennett Perry and Suzanne Marie Langford, onetime press secretary of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was born in 1969 and grew up between Montreal and Los Angeles after his parents separated when Perry was 1. He got his start as a child actor, landing guest spots on “Charles in Charge” and “Beverly Hills 90210” and playing opposite River Phoenix in the film “A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon” in the 1980s and early 1990s. But his big break came when he was cast in “Friends” — originally titled “Friends Like Us” — a sitcom about six single New Yorkers navigating adulthood that premiered on NBC in 1994. The series soon became a juggernaut, the anchor of the network’s vaunted Thursday-night “Must-See TV” lineup, and turned Perry and his castmates Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer into mega-stars almost overnight. At its high-water mark — for a 1996 Super Bowl episode and the 2004 series finale — the series could notch more than 50 million live viewers; by its end, cast members were earning more than $1 million an episode. As Chandler Bing, the handsome, wisecracking roommate of LeBlanc’s Joey Tribbiani and, later, love interest of Cox’s fastidious Monica Geller, Perry distinguished himself in a crackling ensemble cast. With his dry delivery he created a catchphrase with a mere turn of inflection, based on banter he’d shared with childhood friends: Could he be any more Chandler? Soon, he was attached to major stars like Julia Roberts and appearing in prominent films such as 1997 rom-com “Fools Rush In,” opposite Salma Hayek, and 2000 ensemble mob comedy “The Whole Nine Yards” with Bruce Willis. BOOKS Matthew Perry says he’ll remove Keanu Reeves insult in future editions of his book April 23, 2023 There was a dark side to the life of one of television’s most beloved funnymen, however. In his 2022 memoir, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” Perry recounted his lifelong struggle with addiction to alcohol and opioids. He wrote that he had his first drink at 14, but didn’t recognize the signs of alcoholism until 21. Since then, he estimated, he’d spent more than $7 million on efforts to get sober, including multiple stints in rehab. His substance abuse also led to a number of serious health issues, including a five-month hospitalization in 2018 following a colon rupture that left him, he wrote, with a 2% chance to live through the night. And it was fueled, he acknowledged during a “Friends” reunion special in 2021, by the pressure to land the joke in front of a live studio audience night after night. The cast of “Friends,” clockwise from bottom left: Courteney Cox as Monica Geller, Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani, Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay, David Schwimmer as Ross Geller, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing and Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green. (NBC / NBCUniversal via Getty Images) “Nobody wanted to be famous more than me,” Perry told The Times in April, discussing “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing” at the Festival of Books. “I was convinced it was the answer. I was 25, it was the second year of ‘Friends,’ and eight months into it, I realized the American dream is not making me happy, not filling the holes in my life. I couldn’t get enough attention. … Fame does not do what you think it’s going to do. It was all a trick.” Perry was remembered on Saturday by friends and collaborators such as Selma Blair, Paget Brewster, Morgan Fairchild and Mira Sorvino as a singular comic talent and kind soul. Perry’s “Friends” co-star Maggie Wheeler, who played his on-again, off-again girlfriend Janice on the hit show, shared a sweet tribute on Instagram. “What a loss. The world will miss you Mathew Perry,” she wrote. “The joy you brought to so many in your too short lifetime will live on. I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared.” He was also memorialized by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Pierre’s son and one of Perry’s childhood friends. “Matthew Perry’s passing is shocking and saddening,” Trudeau wrote on X. “I’ll never forget the schoolyard games we used to play, and I know people around the world are never going to forget the joy he brought them. Thanks for all the laughs, Matthew. You were loved — and you will be missed.” ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS Adele honors ‘incredibly brave’ Matthew Perry during Las Vegas show Oct. 28, 2023 Though Perry estimated he had relapsed “60 or 70 times” since first getting sober in 2001, he maintained a steady presence on American television, playing key parts in backstage dramedy “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” and therapy sitcom “Go On,” and making a steady stream of guest appearances on acclaimed shows such as “The West Wing” and “The Good Wife.” Since his near-death experience in 2018, Perry had found solace in friends, frequent games of pickleball and, especially, writing. Though producing “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing” had forced him to relive his darkest moments, it also connected him to “all the sufferers out there”: “I had a story to tell, a story that could really help people,” he wrote. “And helping others had become the answer for me.” Indeed, for all his success as an actor and, more recently, as a bestselling memoirist, Perry told The Times in April that his work was not the center of what he hoped would be his legacy. Asked how he’d like to be remembered, he said: “As a guy who lived life, loved well, lived well and helped people. That running into me was a good thing, and not something bad.” Staff writer Meg James and deputy editor Maane Khatchatourian contributed to this report.

It filled me with dread thinking about Chuck Norris, Arnold, Stallone, etc.Seeing the memory of Friends taking hits, first with James Michael Tyler and now with Matthew, is very hard.Even sadder is his fate was probably sealed because he was alone. It was probably a cardiac event that disabled him in the hot tub &#x2F; pool and he drowned. Could&#x27;ve been unrecoverable anyway but being alone is making pretty sure it is. reply flkiwi 8 hours agoparentSame age bracket here, but ... it&#x27;s just not affecting me that much. Admittedly I didn&#x27;t really watch Friends, though I was squarely in the age demographic and was aware of him. And, to be clear, I am deeply, deeply sorry for his friends and family, especially after having seen him go through so much in life.But this one isn&#x27;t filling me with existential dread and I don&#x27;t know why. I keep ping-ponging between \"We got started early with the gut punch of Christa McAuliffe, Ron McNair and the rest of the Challenger crew, then Kurt Cobain then River Phoenix then...\" and \"I guess I&#x27;m old now and this is just normal.\" There&#x27;s even an argument that, my goodness, how on earth did he make it so far? And I am not being flippant: Perry lived an absolutely hellish life in too many ways.I have no idea what his cause of death was, but ... I just hope people get help when they need it. reply browningstreet 7 hours agorootparentDid none of the deaths of the last decade or two have an impact? Honest Q.I found that the deaths of Hunter S Thompson, David Bowie, and Sinead O&#x27;Conner put me a bit on my heels. Some of the others had some kind of impact. And many of the others.. nothing. But at least those three, and maybe a couple of others, definitely threw me a bit.So that&#x27;s the Q. Anything..? Nothing? If nothing, I&#x27;d personally find that possibly worth investigating. And I&#x27;m not big on para-social celebrity&#x2F;artist relationships. But a few landed for me. reply sshine 22 minutes agorootparentIt sounds like the phenomenon of getting affected by the death of some particular celebrity is very subjective.For me there was a small “but he was young…” with Matthew Perry, but also an “oh well…”.I frequently talk with my 84-year old neighbours. One lost her husband a year ago, the other one’s wife has dementia. They themselves are sharp as ever, but their whole world is a museum of memories. They have grand children, but everyone they knew is dead. They like company, but one said there’s something special about same-aged people, they share things with.I don’t know when the death of a celebrity will hit me, but it’s probably when someone younger than me dies of non-accidental causes. reply flkiwi 7 hours agorootparentprevOh MANY deaths were hard. Justice Ginsburg absolutely obliterated me (and, respectfully, others may have a different reaction and I understand that). But I haven&#x27;t really experienced the \"I&#x27;m old now and watching my heroes die\" reaction. Does that make sense?Limited just to entertainment industry celebrities, I will admit I don&#x27;t have a strong emotional reaction to ... most of them (other than the general empathetic sadness on behalf of a vibrant human&#x27;s friends and family) ... but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything worrying. reply jcul 3 hours agorootparentI agree, I find it hard to get too emotional about celebrities, even though I may have had great respect and admiration for them. For example, David Bowie, I was a little sad and disappointed to lose a great figure, but we all have to die.For some reason Sinead O&#x27;Connor was an exception to this, and I did feel quite emotional at her passing. reply checkyoursudo 7 hours agorootparentprevI have had teenage classmates, beloved pets, sibling, parent, all my grandparents, and close friends die. These have been varying degrees of devastating for me, for a while at least. Some for a long time (my sibling dying young was so, so hard).Celebrities&#x2F;artists&#x2F;all-around-famous-people dying rarely affects me. Prince, maybe? But that was possibly because I like his music so much and probably grieved the loss of more music than the person whom I never met.Knowing about kids dying in war and from gun violence and domestic abuse and such probably hits me harder than hearing about any random celebrity dying. reply flkiwi 7 hours agorootparentprevOne more thing: I lost a parent and a very close friend when I was young, so death has been part of life for me for perhaps an unusually long time. reply hinkley 7 hours agorootparentprevI still can’t look at the fact that Fred Rogers is dead. reply flkiwi 7 hours agorootparentSame here.

The first time I realised I was older than all the Friends felt strange. Now I&#x27;m older than Fraiser. In a way, advancing age allows us to surpass the characters we idolise, which at least for me, has a positive effect on self esteem. reply dehrmann 8 hours agoparentprev> Chuck Norris, Arnold, Stallone, etc.The guys from The Expendables? reply ackbar03 8 hours agorootparentYea I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried about those guys either reply justinclift 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, they each used to be famous in their own things. reply harryquach 6 hours agorootparentprevI feel old reply lolive 4 hours agoparentprevLet’s admit it was a heart failure.

If anything happens to a neighbor, others would probably never find out, and it takes a long time for ambulance to get there.On a side note, I wonder if Apple Watch can detect this kind of events and report that to 911 immediately. Even better, can Apple Watch \"predict\" such fatal events based on data of millions of users who&#x27;ve had similar incidents?Edit: Maybe the downvoters can say their counter-argument? reply iancmceachern 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve lived in both suburban and urban (current) situations.In my personal experience, I always felt for more supported and a much bigger sense of community in suburban areas. Most suburban streets I&#x27;ve lived on, even when they weren&#x27;t in the best neighborhoods, I felt comfortable asking anyone on the block for any kind of help. I do not feel the same way in my current apartment building.

I occasionally saw him when we were both out for a run. After a while he recognized me, and he&#x27;d smile and wave.

I’m sure someone of his means wasn’t going to insurance funded rehab. There are tons of boutique rehab options that will gladly take 50,000, 100,000, 500,000 for a stint that includes all sorts of “luxury” accommodations like massage, chef&#x2F;catering, fancy private rooms, on site security, etc. some of these place will also take your insurance for the base rehab program but then you can pay thousands to add on the luxury stuff as well. It’s a fringe part of the medical system that doesn’t apply to 99% of peopleDon’t get me wrong rehab is a costly endeavor regardless but rich actors spending millions on rehab is often because they’re doing it in style. They aren’t going to recovery centers of America, eating Sysco hospital food, and sharing a room with a 22 year old heroin addict that steals car stereos whose family is giving them one last chance. That 22 year old will still end up paying a lot but not as much as you’d think for 28 day inpatient residential. It’s often like 20-40k which is for sure a lot of money but when you think of taking care of a human being for a month, monitoring them, feeding them, housing them, providing them counseling (usually multiple types), nursing and admin support, etc. it’s especially crazy when a single mri can take that number in a 40 minute scan. reply seanmcdirmid 9 hours agoprevOh wow.

I liked the TypeScript being added and then removed in the TODO.I&#x27;ve been working with the web since before JS and CSS existed, back in the cgi-bin days, and have somehow ended up still working with it to this day.I used most of the pre-SPA frameworks, when everything was what is now being referred to as \"SSR\".Then I was dragged (somewhat kicking, screaming, and muttering about &#x27;kids these days&#x27;) into the world of SPAs, except I ended up on the Angular side and have not really been on the React side.I will say that I have been following along with this Next.js stuff and the other changes going on over in the React ecosystem, and I am left utterly confused while at the same time having an uneasy feeling about the whole thing.It&#x27;s not necessarily because we&#x27;ve seen all this before, it&#x27;s more about \"why now?\", and then wondering about how badly this is going to be abused, because if it can be, it will be. I get it, people need SEO, FCP times need some help ... and ... well that&#x27;s about what I came up with off the top of my head.Have you ever seen a SQL statement that JOINs 20 tables in your a component, that uses a magic string to indicate that it is not your ordinary component? You will.Naturally, almost anything can be used in ways it should not be. But when you are combining the dominant SPA framework, blurring the lines between the front and back ends, and employing a large amount of fairly complex magic behind the scenes to make it happen, I get the sense that bad things may be afoot.I for the moment am content working with a different framework, it&#x27;s been smooth sailing for a complex enterprise system. I&#x27;ll see how the rest of this unfolds from afar. reply te_chris 1 hour agoparentNext&#x2F;nuxt are an architectural dead end for me. It’s so confusing with the subtle differences between what the front lib can do and what next&#x2F;nuxt can do. If you treat them as server side static site engines they’re ok, but bigger then that they’re a solution looking for a problem.I implore people to try liveview though, doing everything (pretty much) on the server is incredible. So powerful and no headaches about leakage or security of APIs or whatever - all data is in BEAM&#x2F;elixir process state unless you render it into a template or explicitly send it to the client in an event. reply teaearlgraycold 3 hours agoparentprevI’m currently wondering if I should switch to Vue or something else because of “use server” reply keyle 8 hours agoprevUntil React can cross compile in Rust and spawn a browser instance in WASM with a graphql interface, I will keep making sarcastic jokes about React. &#x2F;sI started as a front-end dev, focused on that in the 2000s as this was where the work was interesting...Now I go by back-end dev, because I just can&#x27;t deal with the front-end \"industry\" anymore.All the best, though. reply work_hard93 30 minutes agoparentSometimes I too find getting things out of hand. I have been working as a frontend dev for the last 5 years now , tbh sometimes there are pointless discussions over the app architecturefor 90% of the cases it is simple React SPA app + REST APIs , thats it and then people try to put SSR there and what not which tbh is not required even from a business pov.It takes the joy out of things.Although i hear folks say the same about backend , but honestly i have not done backend so cant comment about that,planning to move though reply postalrat 7 hours agoparentprevIf you think the front-end is a mess just wait to till you see the layers upon layers of complexity people are using the manage back-end services. reply qudat 6 hours agorootparentTotally agree. All of these arguments claiming the FE is too complex need a reality check with the real monster: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landscape.cncf.io&#x2F; reply 0xpgm 5 hours agorootparentMost of these are optional, one can stay with a very simple stack similar the LAMP stack i.e. a web server, a database and a backend language on Linux for small to mid-sized apps. And pick something simple for CI&#x2F;CD.Of course if you are into enterprise or &#x27;web scale&#x27;, things can get a bit more complicated, but it&#x27;s how complicated you make it to be. reply MrJohz 4 hours agorootparentAnd of course, much the same thing is true for the frontend as well. Most of the time, the worst takes off frontend excess or backend complexity are being told by people who aren&#x27;t working in field, and just looking in from outside.Rendering everything on the server and adding a bit of Javascript along the way works - it had its flaws, but so does everything else, you just need to figure out which flaws make sense for you to deal with. For a little extra complexity, use Vite as a bundler, and add a framework - Vue is pretty simple to get started with - and you&#x27;re almost immediately away. You even get some stuff like Typescript for free at this point.And like you say, you can make things more complicated with various other tools, but if you need that, you probably know you need that, and you know what it&#x27;s doing and why it&#x27;s necessary complexity. reply herewulf 3 hours agorootparentI had a problem and got TypeScript for free. Now I solve my many problems with \"any\" problems. reply throwaway290 1 hour agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t forget that you don&#x27;t need any bundlers and frameworks if you just want some reactivity, React is very minimal and works in pure JS, just alias createElement to something like el() and off you go reply keyle 5 hours agorootparentprevOh my. reply synergy20 6 hours agoparentprevthe SSR first trend for SPAs finally pushed me away from React(along with Vue,etc). I&#x27;m an embedded developer, I can not run node.js on the target, even MVC on the server(i.e. target board) in C or Lua could be too heavy, so SPA with restful was the best option, now all SPAs are turning into SSR-first and making things even more complex, I can no longer justify the time spending chasing the modern frontend any more, I need alternatives.I&#x27;m trying nim for SPA at the moment, also thinking about some C based restful approach(civetweb, ulfius)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nim-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;2926 reply jasongi 2 hours agorootparentWhy would you ditch react because you don’t need SSR? You can still use vanilla React without SSR and serve it statically. It’s not as if you’re forced to use nextjs if you want to use React. reply winter_blue 3 hours agorootparentprevEven a Raspberry Pi Zero that costs $5 retail[0] should be good enough[2] to run modern Linux + a node process running Next.js with SSR.Why do embedded developers pick really resource-constrained chips, when decently powerful chips that can run Linux have become so cheap?[1] probably even cheaper if purchasing B2B, in bulk[2] i.e. should have enough CPU (1 GB) and RAM (512 MB) reply DanielHB 2 hours agorootparentI work with a frontend app that talks with microcontrollers that have 2mb of ram, they don&#x27;t run linux and can&#x27;t even support an HTTP stack. We actually use UDP to send messages to them (through a thin native layer in our app)I don&#x27;t remember the exact numbers as I don&#x27;t work with the manufacturing side but the budget for our microcontrollers wasWhy do embedded developers pick really resource-constrained chips, when decently powerful chips that can run Linux have become so cheap?1) Often you have multiple microcontrollers per device2) It just follows a general trend with industrial manufacturing of always trying to find ways to cut costs. It is not just microcontrollers, after a product is finished, v2 will always strive to cut costs and be cheaper. Components costs grow linearly with production volume. If you sell a million of devices with a 5 USD chip that is 5 million dollars that could have been spent on R&D (maybe like 5 devs working on it full time for a year)3) Sometimes the microcontrollers are dedicated for security&#x2F;safety, those you don&#x27;t want to run linux on because it makes them harder to QA and certify (non determinism doesn&#x27;t play well with safety). You want them small, lean and as simple&#x2F;dumb as possible4) Sourcing problems, advanced chips are harder to source in higher quantities, especially lately. Crappy microcontrollers can be bought like buying legos at the lego store5) Size, reliability and heat constraints. Bigger chips are harder to integrate into a custom board, require more power and could generate enough heat to cause problems. Integrating a Raspberry CM requires a custom connector with like 50 wires or so and wiring it can be really annoying&#x2F;error-proneOne of our systems had a Raspberry CM3 before, it was the first thing on the chopping block for the v2. Apparently it was the most expensive single electronic component of the whole system. reply matthews2 2 hours agorootparentprev> Why do embedded developers pick really resource-constrained chips, when decently powerful chips that can run Linux have become so cheap?There are other things to consider, like power consumption, size, reliability, IO...

Imagine a cross runner, then give him a 180K yearly package. He&#x27;d only have to bridge the distance between React and rustc, which is clearly 4 (s&#x2F;ea&#x2F;us&#x2F;t|c)^42. reply cultofmetatron 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been out of the node community for over 5 years but this seems in line with the \"hurr durr use javascript for everything!!\" crew. can someone tell me if this is a parody cuz I seriously can&#x27;t tell anymore? reply junon 11 hours agoparentTL:DR it&#x27;s a meme.The context here (as I understand it) is that Next.js, a popular React-like framework that allows (in a way) coding both the server and browser portions of a web app in one codebase, such that each portion is extracted at runtime and automatically wired up via API calls. This is a simplification but it&#x27;s how you can think of it.They&#x27;ve now introduced an even tighter way of introducing server code into what are otherwise frontend React components by piggie backing off the old \"use strict\" directive syntax, called \"use server\", allowing you to interleave - directly and inline - the client and browser code.Many a meme have been created, half-jokingly comparing it to PHP, ranging from the supportive jest, to the very seriously critical, as one would expect the internet to do.Some of those memes have been in the form of \"use ___\", such as \"use binary\", \"use php\", etc.I don&#x27;t use frontend frameworks much these days so maybe someone can correct me on some of this, but hopefully this helps explain it a bit.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextjs.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;app&#x2F;api-reference&#x2F;functions&#x2F;server-a... reply sophiebits 10 hours agorootparentOne clarification: client and server code are never mixed within the same file. \"use server\" can only be used in server files and marks code that the client can call back into. reply ipsum2 8 hours agorootparentThis is incorrect (outdated). In the NextJS conference, they demoed interleaved client and server code. reply crucialfelix 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s caused confusion, but that is a server side component. Dan Abramov confirms that here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dan_abramov&#x2F;status&#x2F;1717648341234778376The html for the button gets SSR and sent to the client. The button click handler is an RPC that runs the actual sql statement on the server. reply acheong08 9 hours agorootparentprevI think they introduced some weird mixing in the NextJS conference that just occurred recently. I don’t understand it enough to be sure though. reply cal85 9 hours agorootparentYes, they demo&#x27;d a component with an onClick callback that contained a &#x27;use server&#x27; directive followed by serverside SQL query, right there in the onClick. So presumably that callback is automatically replaced at build time with some generated clientside code that posts to a dynamic endpoint generated from just that function, or something. Seems like a strange idea with lots of ways to go wrong, but I don&#x27;t know enough about it to judge. reply mlfreeman 8 hours agorootparentHmm, server-side onClick event...did they just reinvent ASP.NET Web Forms? reply ryoshu 8 hours agorootparentYes. That&#x27;s one of the jokes. reply williamcotton 7 hours agorootparentprevThese conditional checks are an obvious sign that they’ve cleaved the rock in the wrong location.These conditional checks on server state exist because they didn’t create the shared environment between web server and web browser at deep enough of a level.The key is to replicate the server-side pattern of “user actions cause HTTP request”. That is, you make a version of express that runs in the browser. Then you make parallel middleware that runs in both the browser and the server. Then you make your React components fire off mock HTTP requests that are handled by the browser express router.So you write the same route handlers and components for the browser and server to run but then you write environment specific middleware.Browser middleware:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;williamcotton&#x2F;williamcotton.com&#x2F;tree&#x2F;mast...Server middleware:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;williamcotton&#x2F;williamcotton.com&#x2F;tree&#x2F;mast...I’ve expanded beyond express in the above application to add controllers, a routes file, and views, all code that has no conditionals and runs in both the browser and server environment.What NextJS demoed is poorly conceived. There’s no need to autogenerate a link to an API.Instead, your frontend middleware has req.update() defined to make an API request and the server middleware has req.update() defined to make the SQL update. GraphQL pairs well with this approach, but so does something like Graphiti&#x2F;Spraypaint for a more traditional ORM-like model.And there you go, sane server and client side rendering. reply cal85 9 hours agorootparentprevThis kind of explanation is why I come here. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agorootparentMe too, but I still don&#x27;t understand. This must be what it feels like to not know how computers work. I recognize some of the words in the explanation. reply elnardu 11 hours agorootparentprevPretty much this! reply boringuser2 10 hours agorootparentprev>API and frontend in the same code baseWell, it takes very little knowledge to know this isn&#x27;t a good design paradigm. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 3 hours agorootparentWat? Of course front and back should be in same codebase. Why on earth would you need them to be in different repos? Put them in different folders if it makes you happy but there&#x27;s no need to toss stuff all over the place. They&#x27;re friends. They need to talk to each other. Let them live together reply gedy 8 hours agorootparentprevThough, isn&#x27;t this what full-stack&#x2F;server side UI folks favor? Rails, etc. reply nsonha 6 hours agorootparentprevit&#x27;s not that conclusive, there are many other aspects in which it can be bad (security, team&#x27;s workflow etc). There is however no design principle ever dictates how components should&#x2F;should not be stored in the same code repo. reply flykespice 11 hours agoparentprev> can someone tell me if this is a parody cuz I seriously can&#x27;t tell anymore?You just don&#x27;t use javascript enough in your life. reply cultofmetatron 11 hours agorootparentwell you&#x27;re not wrong haha. I switched to elixir for my startup so I haven&#x27;t touched a javascript file in almost 4 years now.

For most webapps you can just ship html or create SPA and it&#x27;s fast enough. If shipping 30kB of js on first load is an issue, then send plain html.I tried nextjs and for a simple site with few pages and echo endpoint it creates like 2MB of javascript. I could make the same result in 100 lines of code but apparently it&#x27;s not fast or modern.The issue is that static file hosting and effective servers don&#x27;t generate money for infra providers. So better run some js cluster** to get a login form for client. reply sebastianconcpt 9 hours agoprevAwesome!

What the fuck were they thinking? reply jsunderland323 3 hours agoprevIt looks like you’re basically sending raw c code to an express server then evaling it with some zig module import.

Leaning towards against reply CSSer 8 hours agoparentIf it does, I think it’s a pretty poor argument. JS is the lingua franca of the web. The web is the platform. Frankly, I’d love it if there were some pure, high-level (but lower than the web), widely satisfactory “native” multi-platform solution with truly altruistic motives but I know of none. Serious engineering is done on the web motivated by strategic business decisions.

Author Name Jason Stiebs Twitter @peregrine Image by Annie Ruygt We’re Fly.io. We run apps for our users on hardware we host around the world. Fly.io happens to be a great place to run Phoenix applications. Check out how to get started! As an Elixir/Phoenix developer going on 10 years it is very easy to take for granted everything that Elixir and Phoenix can do for us. So I wanted to take a step back and list all of the stuff that we get for free when we choose Elixir and Phoenix. My goal with this post is dump an list of information and links and let you choose your own path. If you are unfamiliar with any of these topics or Elixir and Phoenix please click any of these links and take a peak, I think you might be surprised at the quality and depth of what you find! The inspiration for this post was a Saša Jurić re-tweet where he shared the following slide from his GOTO Conference Talk. This image enumerates some of the technical requirements that the Erlang Virtual Machine can replace in your tech stack. Not to say that these other projects can’t do these things well, they can and do in our own stack here at Fly.io. The point is that in those ecosystems you have to solve these problems in the first place, when reviewing this article José Valim said it best: removing the problem altogether instead of solving the problem The BEAM This above list doesn’t even cover the built in support for incredible bits like: Actor Process Model, meaning do to concurrency you have a Process and it sends messages to other processes. No Shared memory. Fully managed by the BEAM’s built in scheduler. Millions of processess are no issue. Fearless concurrency! Distribution: meaning two servers can communicate seamlessly and automatically. It just works and is incredible. RPC: Calling a function or process remotely is as easy as calling a local one, no need to concern ourselves with connections or serialization or deserialization. This is one of the many reasons Fly is so committed to using Elixir and Phoenix, the wireguard based network and globally hosting makes using this trivial and desirable. Parallel Garbage Collection, meaning the VM is Soft Real Time, minimal pausing! Emphasis on low resource usage in general Built in UDP/TCP/SSL server support. Built in Key Value Store ETS. Tooling for tracing and observing your code. 37 Years of constant development and production use. The beauty of this list is that if Elixir and Phoenix team have done our Job right you don’t need to think about any of this at all. It just works for you and lets you stand on the shoulders of this giant. Elixir If we go higher level the Elixir programming language provides us even more as developers: A full dependency management and build tool with mix and Hex. With modern tooling built in: Testing Documentation Formatting Language with a clean, documented and fully exampled Standard Library. Its remarkable how little cruft there is in this Language. Go into any other language to find random functions or modules that are marked do not use, or without examples or documentation. Not the case for Elixir. Modern Documentation: Built in Cheatsheets Built in Custom Markdown Links to source Search Support for Mermaid, Math.js, Vega-Lite and more! Modern language features like: Protocols enabling high level collections and functions like Enum, Streams, and Access Stream, enabling lazy and performant data processing Full featured Date/Time/DateTime/Calendar modules. Task for trivial parallel processing. Agent for trivial shared state management. Config for environment specific configuration Registry for local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage. This is just a subset of what Elixir the Language provides. It doesn’t include the deep catalog of libraries within package registry Hex enabling so much more. Some examples from Hex: Machine Learning with Bumblebee with HuggingFace integration and it works with batching and distribution globally. Math/Science comparable to NumPy using Scholar. Complex distributed big data processing using GenStage or Broadway Embedded and IoT Programming using Nerves. Stream-Data for property and generative based testing. Sobelow for security and static Analysis. Oban for a Worker/Job Queue implementation. Req for high level HTTP Clients. Plug for HTTP Servers. Bandit for pure Elixir HTTP1/2 Server! LiveBook for Juypter like workbooks with Elixir! Membrane for video stream processing. Decimal for arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic. Jason for highly performant JSON Encoding/Decoding. Image for image manipulation. CLRD for maybe the most complete Internationalization and Locale libraries outside of maybe the Web Browser. Numbers, List, Units, Date\\Time\\DateTimes, Collation, Territories, and more. Rustler and Zigler for truly simple Rust and Zig FFI support, for when you need to drop down and bash bits. There is very little that the Elixir Ecosystem hasn’t tackled! Phoenix and LiveView The fun doesn’t stop there because Phoenix simply builds on all of his incredible tooling to provide us with: A fully featured HTTP library with Advanced Routing Plug-able steps Built in HTML and JSON handling With HTTPS with sane security defaults Secure Cookie Sessions Secure Tokens Controller Actions for MVC Style apps. Built in Internationalization Tooling Websockets with Multiplexing via Channels JavaScript library that handles backoff and common error modes Serialization Sessions Scalable to millions of clients. PubSubFully Distributed With optimizations for “hot paths” Presence Monitoring and tracking who is in a channel Fully Distributed Built using CRDT’s JavaScript support Development Tooling: Live Code Reloading Helpful and actionable Errors Built in End to End Testing. (No Chromedriver needed) JavaScript Bundling/Minification/Integrity/Cache Busting Using esbuild that is installed for you NPM support Custom JS is trivial CSS via Tailwind Bundling/Minification/Integrity/Cache Busting Using tailwind that is installed for you Custom CSS is trivial LiveView Simple, server rendered Live HTML and CSS, in pure Elixir. HTML and Html Attribute Compile Time Verification Highly Optimized for the modern web Debug tooling for Dev JS Interop is Trivial Latency Simulation Single BEAM Process per connection Trivial File Uploads to disk or the cloud. Databases with Ecto Postgres/MySQL/Sqlite/and more Full Query DSL with Raw SQL escape hatch Migrations Up/Down/Schema dump Full Schema and Change Validation Transaction Support Multi-step Queries/Transactions Full Authorization/Authentication generator Register, Login, Forgot Password, Email Verification and Sessions LiveView or Server HTML Email Rendering and Sending Built in Metrics Tracking Single Line to add a full Metrics Dashboard Dockerfile generator Just going through this list there is everything you’d need to start a company or build a website to solve nearly any problem. Coupled with the BEAM’s ability to scale from the smallest server to a globally distributed network with millions of customers on every continent! I may sound a little breathless but I am out of a breath just collating all of these links. Wrap up Stepping back it’s incredible that a small team is able to accomplish so much. Every one of Phoenix’s incredible features is built on the shoulders of the fantastic Elixir project underneath. Further backed by 37 years of constant development by the Erlang project. If you haven’t looked into Phoenix or Elixir I urge you to explore any one of the above links that catch your eye. Installing and setting up Elixir has never been easier with LiveBook or Natively!

I&#x27;m always going to reach for Postgres there unless I&#x27;ve got some very specific use case.I do think having most everything else \"under the same roof\" is nice for a smaller company that doesn&#x27;t want to run a whole bunch of different services, though. Having an internal cron thing, and an internal job thing are probably fine for a lot of people getting something off the ground and easier to deal with than having something external to deal with. I think in particular this is often nice when trying to replicate the production environment on both a staging and local development system. If the infrastructure is complicated, that&#x27;s harder to do. It&#x27;s nice to be running substantially similar systems everywhere.I&#x27;m not 100% sold that it&#x27;s that big a win compared to having more libraries and such available with, say, Rails or PHP or Python or something. But it&#x27;s definitely nice to have. reply toast0 11 hours agoparentprevI dunno, the blogging community of Erlangers seems to have a different opinion of hot-loading and mnesia scalability than I developed working at WhatsApp.Specifically, hot loading allows for tremendous agility in rolling out code: for better and worse. There&#x27;s sharp edges, but it&#x27;s worth it IMHO (of course, it should be noted that AFAIK, hot loading is either unused or very rarely used at WhatsApp now. I believe they now use fairly conventional rollouts where new instances are started with the new code, load balancers shift the load and old instances are shut down eventually... back in my day, we didn&#x27;t have load balancers or easy access to spare machines to rotate through, etc)Mnesia has lots of sharp edges too, but if you are willing to learn them as you grow, and maybe do a bit of work here and there, disc_copies and ram_copies tables scale pretty good (afaik, we only used disc_only_copies for the schema table, and that&#x27;s a small table, so it works; I don&#x27;t think that table type works well with large tables). And having data and application colocated makes a lot of things pretty nice. IMHO, if you are doing the volume of data and accesses we were doing with any other database, you&#x27;d need in house engineering on the database as well, so I don&#x27;t see it as a strong negative that it&#x27;s needed for mnesia. If you have a smaller need, maybe it works out of the box. IMHO, mnesia works best with stable nodes and stable network though: the original use case was for two nodes in the same chassis, and the farther you stray from that, the more work you may have to do. But we had replication setup between Reston, VA and Dallas, TX and it worked fine as long as the backbone between the two wasn&#x27;t being extra flakey.Again, I think post-acquisition, mnesia was phased out, but FB doesn&#x27;t value stability of nodes or networks. reply sodapopcan 11 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s more that it&#x27;s not recommended within the web development community which, of course, was Elixir&#x27;s initial \"purpose\". As a web developer who has worked with a lot of web developers, I think this is pretty sound advice. However, I do wish there was more multi-node literature out there for web developers as I&#x27;m very interested in it myself. I&#x27;m talking running different OTP applications on different nodes.

A lot of managers don’t even understand that what language they use makes a difference in terms of their product or their productivity—they optimize for whatever stack they can most easily the hire the cheapest devs for.That leads to the market responding much more slowly to newer options, even when they have clear advantages.

We regularly have to deal with code which are about 10 years old and it&#x27;s a moving target. You have to deliver quickly with migration requirement in mind. Also we frequently collaborate with the other teams and you have to be able to understand others&#x27; code quickly.Typing is critical as you don&#x27;t have time to deal with the constant stream of the new projects to dig deeper in to the objects.

It markets the “traditional” and “unchanging” and, in doing so, changes it. As the old joke goes, “come to this beautiful unspoiled island and spoil it.” The clock starts ticking from the moment the first person says “timeless”. Then everything that is celebrated starts to become the shadow of itself. Similarly, food and farming, industries now intimately connected in some places with tourism, are caught in the endless tension between their reality and their representation. As soon as a region becomes celebrated for its food, gastrotourism accelerates its gentrification. Soon the old boulangeries, boucheries and fromageries are replaced with boutiques selling home decor and handbags. Then a new wave of specialist food shops appears among them, selling the old produce at boutique prices, prices that double with every adjective and place name. The products are real but the stories that surround them – the autochthonous peasant economy, the weathered subsistence among woods and meadows – are vitiated by their telling. The tourist dollars they attract internationalise the local economy. They convert the barns and sheds where cows were kept, grapes were pressed, honey was strained into Airbnbs or second homes. Pastures on the valley floor become glamping sites or pony paddocks. The money generated by the myth of timelessness draws local people away from the sparse living the labels revere. Meanwhile, to keep pace with gastronomic demand, farming relentlessly intensifies. In the famous cheesemaking regions of France, you will scarcely see a dairy cow. Instead, vast tracts are cultivated for maize. Passing tourists romantically assume it’s sweetcorn for human consumption – the French must eat a lot of sweetcorn! No, it will be turned into silage to feed the cattle stalled in the vast steel sheds – cow factories – that have sprung up from Brittany to Savoie, a business as brutal and industrial as any other. Milk is trucked across hundreds of kilometres, trade fairs market the cheese from Dubai to Shanghai. The further the cycle of intensification turns, the longer the teleconnections of the “local” economy, the more bucolic and homely the marketing becomes: close-ups of cracked and dirt-grained hands, chickens clucking through buttercupped meadows, girls in Heidi costumes and all the other autophagous nonsense of the Spectacle. The Spectacle of Production To seek to reverse such economies of scale is not a relaxation into a “simpler” mode, but a conscious and frantic race against entropy. Fair play to those who succeed! We need, among others, small local producers, ideally using new forms of high-yield agroecology. But it’s not for the faint-hearted. They are running up the down escalator, and it accelerates every year. Land prices, house rents, low farmgate prices, easier and more rewarding opportunities elsewhere all militate against survival in the new-old economy, let alone success. And you are always in danger (a danger, admittedly, that some embrace) of becoming your own trope, the re-created peasant self-marketed to the gluttonous Spectacle. Of course, we all re-create ourselves to some extent. We are all self-consumers. But self-creation is seldom more intense than in sectors deemed “authentic”. Bucolic re-creations bear little relation to the things they claim to be. What we now fetishise as “peasant food” is much richer and more diverse than the food peasants would once have eaten, except, perhaps, on feast days. Meat was, for most, a luxury, cheese eaten less often than we imagine, salads, in many places, not at all. Diets were often inadequate and deficient in crucial components, such as protein. This is one of the reasons – alongside other aspects of health – why the rustic ancestors we celebrate were, on average, tiny by comparison to us. Many of the “traditional” ingredients considered essential to the cuisine – such as tomatoes in Italy or peppers in Spain – were unknown until surprisingly recently to those whose diets we claim to honour. Much of the protein, insufficient as it was, came not from cheese and meat but from what we now call dhal. It had names (to give some English examples) like pease pottage, pease pudding, mushy peas and pea soup. Few of these dishes are celebrated by gastronomes today. As George Crabbe remarked in The Village, written in 1783, such food was “Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such As you who envy would disdain to touch.” But, to the wealthy people spending lavishly on what they fondly imagine to be peasant diets, every day is a feast day. Lands of Plenty We benefit above all from a different legacy: the marvel of the past 50 years of falling hunger during a time of rising population, a marvel we in the rich world scarcely acknowledge, so comfortable has it made us. This remarkable phenomenon was widely considered, just 60 or 70 years ago, simply impossible. There are three things upon which I think we can all agree. First, that this marvel came at a great environmental cost. It was delivered through hungry and thirsty new crop varieties, reliant for their survival on lashings of agrochemicals, unsustainable water use and practices that can accelerate soil degradation. Second, that it also involved severe social and political dislocations, including land-grabbing, enclosures and rising corporate power and concentration. Third, that it might now be running out of road: the prevalence of global undernourishment rose from 613 million (median estimate) in 2019 to 735 million in 2022. The immediate reasons for this partial reversal are the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but there are also three deeper and increasingly urgent issues: the decline of crucial resources, such as soil and water, environmental shocks hammering farm production, and the global food chain’s loss of systemic resilience. So the question – one of the key questions of our time – is how we can feed a population likely to rise to 9 or 10 billion by the middle of the century before starting to decline, reliably, equitably and at a much lower environmental cost. In other words, how we might feed the world without devouring the planet, the subject of my book Regenesis. There are, as I found, plenty of possible ways forward. But there are no ways backward. If we were to seek to restore the agricultural systems of, say, 60 or 70 years ago, a time, remember, when many people were deeply pessimistic about human nutrition and expected global starvation as the population rose, their grim predictions would materialise. Why? Because productivity was much lower than it is today. In 2023, a world of 8.1 billion people suffers far less hunger and famine than the world of 3.2 billion did in 1963, the year of my birth. Let’s pause to consider this for a moment, because it is one of the most remarkable (and, bizarrely, least celebrated) transformations of our time. The numbers who died in famines were especially high in the 1960s, as a result of China’s Great Leap Backwards. An estimated 16.6 million perished during mass starvation events in that decade. This compares to 8.8 million in the 1950s and 3.4 million in the 1970s. But 3.4 million, by comparison to more recent figures, is massive. Between 2010 and 2016, the most recent years in the standardised dataset, 255,000 people died this way, all of them in the famine that afflicted Somalia. Since then, there have been four major famines: in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia (again) and Tigray, in which, in total, hundreds of thousands died. All four were caused by conflict. Famine is also much less geographically widespread than it used to be: it now tends to be confined to one nation or province at a time, rather than afflicting vast areas. To grasp just how astonishing this decline in mass death through hunger has been, we need to look at the death rate in famines as a proportion of the population. A century ago, the rate stood at 82 per 100,000 people. In the 1930s, it was 56, in the 1940s, 79, the 1950s, 32, the 1960s, 50, the 1970s, 8.4, and on down to the most recent figures: 0.5. At no known point in recorded history has the third horseman wielded less deadly power. There’s a similar trend in total deaths from malnutrition (in other words not only those that occurred in the mass events known as famines). These fell, on a fairly steady trajectory, from 656,000 in 1990 to 212,000 in 2019. What lies behind these extraordinary trends? There are several reasons, but let me dwell on two of the crucial ones. One is the much greater availability of food per person. This is also a remarkable phenomenon. Our World in Data, which collates such global figures, shows that between 1961 and 2014 the world’s production of cereals rose by 280%. This is twice the increase in the global population during that period (136%). It was achieved almost entirely through higher crop yields per hectare. Another is the long-distance transport of food, something that many of us have railed against, but which, for all its downsides, makes an essential contribution to falling rates of hunger. The reason is simple: if there is a bad harvest or outright crop failure in one place, food can now be shifted from regions with a crop surplus, either through trade or through aid and famine relief programmes. The extreme globalisation of the food system has introduced new sets of problems. But without long-distance transport, many more would starve. Returning to earlier modes of subsistence is a formula for global catastrophe on a scale that defies imagination. The Great Divide To make these obvious statements is to become the sworn enemy of many food and farming writers, influencers and film-makers (who have a lucrative industry of their own to support). It is to commit the modern equivalent of blasphemy, as food nostalgia inspires semi-religious beliefs. To make these statements with the support of numbers is to multiply the sin. As I’ve discovered since publishing the book, if there is one habit that incites fury more reliably than any others, it is to put numbers on the problem. Hectares, yields, nutrients, calories, inputs, outputs, costs, emissions, hunger, death: any form of quantification is as welcome in this arena as a tambourine in a Bach sonata. Why? Because the romantic story of how food “should” be produced is entirely qualitative. It’s an aesthetic reverie. It’s about pictures, poetry, gut feeling – understandable when it comes to food but, literally, lethal when it comes to ensuring everyone has it. It is the great indulgence of those who never miss a meal to celebrate the times and modes in which people missed plenty. There are two entirely different questions here: “what production systems do certain well-nourished food writers in the rich world want to see?”, and “how might everyone on Earth be fed?”. But, though often leading to very different conclusions, they are endlessly and callously confused with each other. Fantasising about a food system in which the third horseman would ride victorious again is among the more perverse habits of comfortable people. The anger and passion with which some of them defend their formula for starvation is a wonder to behold. They privilege their aesthetics – their arcadian fantasies – above the wellbeing of 8 billion people. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised: nostalgia is among the most powerful and dangerous of all social forces. Woe betide the person who seeks to disabuse another of their fantasies about the past! Well, I thought I had seen it all: the full gamut of cruel fantasies which privilege bucolic comfort zones above global necessities. But this was before I read the new book by Chris Smaje, a small farmer and writer with an academic background, called Saying No to a Farm-Free Future. The book has been praised by a number of prominent food, farming and environmental writers and campaigners, most of whom subscribe to the worldview I have just described. It is becoming something of a bible for their movement. It promotes what appears to be a recipe for mass global starvation. Before I go any further, I want to emphasise that Chris has every right to write and publish this book. He has been criticised online for fomenting internecine war within left/green circles (as have I). I don’t see it that way. The argument in which he participates is a crucial one, the divisions are real and the debate needs to be had. I believe this is in fact the greatest of all rifts within environmental movements, and we do ourselves no favours by pretending it does not exist. Though his book is framed as an attack on my book Regenesis and, more broadly, on me, I’m glad he has written it. It is highly instructive. Mark of the Beast Chris launches his attack with labels. Apparently I’m both an “ecomodernist” and an “urbanist”. He fails to define what he means by an ecomodernist. His use of the term would capture anyone who favours new or newish green technologies: solar panels, wind turbines, electrified railways, GIS mapping, induction hobs …. I do have a definition of ecomodernism: a movement that treats green technology as a substitute for political and economic change. I see it in the vision of people like Bill Gates and Ted Nordhaus, a vision I strongly oppose. I believe technology is just one of the components of the change we need: necessary but not sufficient. I’ve spent my working life pressing for political and economic change, seeking to dethrone the oligarchs (including Bill Gates) and corporations whose economic and political power impede both democracy and human flourishing. As for the charge of being an “urbanist”, the only evidence he advances is that a Dutch website calls for 90% of the population to live in cities by 2100. I had nothing to do with this, and the idea appals me as much as it appals Chris. But the way he writes this passage makes it look as if it’s my view: a shocking elision. I was not surprised to see a commentary on his book (since changed at my request) reporting this terrible idea as “one of Monbiot’s proposals”. On these fictitious grounds, Chris states that I want a “depopulated countryside”, an “un-peopled” nature, to “eliminate” ruralism, to “keep as many people as possible out of garden-sized or small farm-sized patches in the countryside” and to “concentrat[e] people in the cities as helpless consumers”. I want none of these things. In fact, I strongly oppose them all. I will state my position once more, but with no confidence that he or others will hear it: I do not want to see any depopulation of the countryside. But in one respect, though I have no great enthusiasm for cities, I guess you could call me an urbanist. Why? Because I believe urban populations are a reality that cannot be wished away and, crucially, that they should have food. These, if I’m reading his book correctly, appear to be the two great dividing lines between my vision and Chris’s: I don’t want anyone to have to leave their homes; and I believe urban people need to be fed. The “ecomodernist” and “urbanist” labels could be seen as the usual cut and thrust of debate: by attaching an alienating definition to someone, you might induce people to stop listening to what they’re saying, and to dismiss their evidence and arguments out of hand. It’s the way certain politicians turn complex and difficult questions into culture war fodder. But as the book goes on, his labelling takes a much darker turn. Priced Out Chris devotes an entire chapter to inveighing against people (I am, apparently, the archetype), who believe that sustaining high crop yields is a good idea. Apparently, this is “agricultural improver ideology”, which is in turn an “urban-industrial articulation of class power against rural and agrarian people”. Sorry, what? He explains this contention as follows: “The narrative of agricultural improvement has always had this class element to it – a concern with class improvement for unmanaged farmers as well as agricultural improvement for unmanaged farming.” Yup, that’s the real agenda: a cunning plot to improve farmers’ table manners. My interest in high yields couldn’t possibly be because I worry about how, without them, 8 billion people might be fed. But this is by no means the end of it. If you believe that enough food should be grown to feed everyone, you are also guilty of “productivism”, “consumerism”, even “colonialism”. This brings us to the issue he carefully swerves throughout the book: that a certain number of people requires a certain amount of food, and this food has both to be produced and to reach those who need it. If there’s not enough food, or it’s not accessible and affordable to everyone, people will starve. It seems extraordinary to have to point this out. One of the reasons why high yields ensure that more people can be fed is that more supply reduces the price of food, making it more accessible to the poor. Chris flatly rejects this reasoning. He asserts that “Low food prices, high yields and overproduction are absolutely at the root of food system problems, including global poverty and hunger.” He then goes on to make two statements that left my jaw on the floor: Lower food prices are “the last thing the global poor need. The result is usually more poverty, more hunger”. and “Higher food prices might alleviate hunger globally”. You might have imagined that such astonishing statements would be carefully explained and evidenced. But they are asserted without justification. The closest he gets is to point out that, in countries like the UK, people spend more on housing and energy than they do on food (which is true) and that the cheapness of this food helps the owners of housing and energy to generate more profit, which might be true, but would need some unpacking. But this says nothing about the situation of the global poor, the subject of those two astonishing statements. So let’s just take a moment. The global definition of an affordable diet is one that costs 52% or less of average household expenditure. Using this definition, 3 billion people – over one-third of the global population – cannot afford a healthy diet. In other words, buying adequate food would mean spending more on it than on housing, energy, education, health, transport, clothing and all other items put together. Importantly, the 3 billion below the line include not just urban people and rural people working in the non-agricultural economy, but also many subsistence farmers, some of whom cannot produce enough food, and of sufficient diversity, to meet their nutritional needs. In some countries, a healthy diet costs more than the median income: even if people spent all their money trying to purchase one, they still couldn’t afford it. Yes, the problem is poverty: a gross maldistribution of wealth. Yes, this maldistribution urgently needs to be addressed, which is why we need political and economic change, not just new technologies. But while I have seen no evidence (and Chris provides none) that higher food prices alleviate global hunger, there is a wealth of evidence that they exacerbate it. Is it really possible that you can write a book on food and farming and fail to grasp this basic fact? Yes, it seems it is. Saying No to a Farm-Free Future is a powerful lesson in how motivated reasoning can lead you to an utterly perverse and ludicrous position. Let Them Eat Nothing So how does Chris Smaje believe people should be fed? After launching such a ferocious attack on evil bastards like me, you might expect him to produce a clear alternative. But another remarkable aspect of this book, and of the movement it speaks to, is how vague it becomes on such trifling matters as producing sufficient food for 8 billion people. Here are the most specific phrases I could find, while trying to decipher how he proposes that everyone on Earth should be fed. “Predominantly local self-provisioning of food, fibre and other material requisites of life” We should “gain autonomy and feed ourselves” People should “spread themselves out in the landscape and make low energy livelihoods there” “Repeasantisation, where commercial farmers step off the productivity treadmill and …. orient themselves instead to more autonomous local agricultures geared to local needs” “We could boost urban food provision by increasing the number of allotments, community gardens, market gardens and truck farms on brownfield sites” So the question which arises – and please forgive this ecomodernist, urbanist, productivist, consumerist, colonialist framing – is who, in this world of “self-provisioning” and “repeasantised” commercial farmers, will feed those who do not feed themselves? Most of the places where large numbers of people live do not have sufficient fertile land nearby to support them. A paper in the journal Nature Food found that only a quarter of the world’s people could be fed with staple grain crops grown within 100 kilometres of where they live. The average minimum distance at which the world’s people can be supplied with staple foods, it found, is 2,200 kilometres. Much of the world’s food is grown in vast, lightly-habited lands (US plains, Canadian prairies, Russian steppes etc) and shipped to tight, densely-populated places. These are the numbers to which people of Chris’s persuasion most furiously object, even though they have no answer to them. Why? Because the numbers are incompatible with their worldview. They show that, while agrarian localism might be great as far as it goes, it simply cannot, by itself, meet the challenge of feeding the world. Cities can grow only a tiny fraction of their food, as Chris acknowledges elsewhere in his book. Again, it’s not hard to work out why. Urban areas occupy only 1% of the planet’s land, and this land is in high demand for other uses. Allotments, community gardens, market gardens and truck farms are wonderful things to have, enhancing urban life, but they can produce only a very small proportion of a city’s demand for fruit and vegetables, and close to none of its staple foods. While this is predominantly an urban issue, it’s not just big cities which rely on non-local production. There are many areas dominated by smaller settlements which simply do not have the agricultural capacity to feed themselves. Even regions which are blessed with sufficient agricultural land and water could, as has happened many times in the past, see their production wiped out by local harvest failure, ensuring that a world of agrarian localism would, once more, become a world in which famine is ever-present and widespread. So how will the 4.5 billion people who live in cities – over 60% of the global population – and many others living where there is little fertile land be fed? Answer comes there none. Seriously: in 159 pages there is no explanation of how they would survive. If you’re not an agrarian localist either producing your own food or buying from local growers, you’re stuffed – or rather, starved. If Chris has a plan for feeding you, he hasn’t mentioned it. Discussing his own, proudly low-yield production of wheat and potatoes, Chris states: “there’s no point labouring for next to nothing on someone else’s behalf when you’ve already grown enough to eat for yourself.” This is why farmers who do not share his worldview pursue higher yields: these yields make it economically worthwhile to produce staple foods that can be sold to other people. We should thank our lucky stars for such people. “Human Feedlots” How did he get to this point? I can’t see into his mind, but part of the reason might be his hatred of cities. He rails against them like an Old Testament prophet denouncing Sodom and Gomorrah. He describes them as “human feedlots”, a term I find grotesque and dehumanising. They “consume everything around them and then themselves”. They are “built on cheap and abundant energy and models of globalised trade that aren’t destined to endure.” It is true that cities rely on unsustainable and exploitative models of extraction, consumption and dumping. But this applies to the economy as a whole, urban or otherwise. The answer, I believe, is not to rain curses on them and their people, but to replace the destructive economic models with systems in which everyone’s needs are met without breaching planetary boundaries. This is what Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics seeks. I believe we can move towards her vision with the help of what I call “private sufficiency, public luxury”. None of this, of course, magics away the need to produce sufficient food. If I interpret his airy euphemisms correctly, the question of how urban people should be fed is not worth answering, because cities are soon going to collapse, and their people will have no choice but to “spread themselves out in the landscape”, growing their own “food and fibre, building shelter, producing a modest livelihood from the local ecological base.” (Never mind that in many places the “local ecological base” could support only a small fraction of the region’s people). When your solution is societal collapse, you should ask yourself some hard questions about what you are trying to solve. The Great Cruelty I guess there’s a small consolation here: that Chris might have given up on the idea that his xià xiāng – the mass migration to the countryside he envisages – will happen voluntarily. Perhaps he has at last realised that most people have no particular desire to have to grow their own food and fibre, make their own clothes and build their own shelters. Instead, he now appears to believe that urban people will be forced by catastrophe to leave the cities and succumb to “re-ruralisation” and “repeasantisation”. It might be worth noting that the Old Testament prophets also foresaw the imminent collapse of urban life, two and a half thousand years ago. How mild and gentle he makes it sound! Refugees from the cities “spreading themselves out in the landscape”, “producing a modest livelihood from the local ecological base.” When the fugitives disperse into the countryside, the inhabitants will doubtless greet them with open arms, saying, “Welcome sister! Welcome brother! Here, have some fertile land. Oh, and some water, knowledge, skills, tools, traction and all the other means to grow your own food and live happy lives as re-peasants in our agrarian wonderland.” If history is any guide, this is not quite how it’s likely to pan out. The more probable outcomes of societal collapse include warlordism or full-scale war, coercion, fascism, slavery, disease, starvation and mass death. Moreover, if a cataclysm is sufficient to bring the cities down, it is likely also to destroy the basis of much of rural life. After all, the distinctions between the two are not nearly as crisp as Chris would have us believe. In fact, and horrifyingly, it’s likely that, as a result of environmental disaster, rural life in many parts of the world will collapse before urban life does, as suggested by a highly disturbing recent paper in Nature, showing how and where the “human climate niche” is likely to shrink. If anything, we are likely to become more reliant on long-distance transport to deliver our food – a prospect no one, myself included, relishes. If a catastrophe of the kind Chris envisages – and sometimes appears to yearn – were to materialise, people everywhere are likely to become more desperate. The remaining fertile land and water would be even more valued and fiercely defended than they are today. To me, Chris’s long-standing plan – to move the people to the food, rather than the food to the people – is a further instance of the Great Cruelty of the past two centuries. The Great Cruelty is common to colonialism, capitalism, communism, Nazism, neoliberalism and all the other conquering and interconnected forces that have dominated thought and action during this period. It can be summarised as follows: People are counters, to be moved in their millions, as interests or ideology dictate, across the board game called Planet Earth. It’s consistent with the kind of thinking that characterises cities as “human feedlots”. Mysteries and Passions But never mind. Whether there is enough food and everyone can afford to eat it is, Chris says, a “secondary goal”. This is because it doesn’t “speak to the mysteries and passions of what animates human (or non-human) life”, which Chris describes as our “primary goals”. In obsessing about “productivity, numbers, yields, costs and so forth”, we “risk missing what makes for the flourishing of humans and other organisms”. Well, call me old-fashioned, or urbanist, or whatever label you choose to apply to me, but I would say that having enough food is pretty damn primary. In any hierarchy of human needs, it features close to the top. I don’t for a moment deny that mysteries and passions are important to us, or that we need meaning and purpose to lead fulfilling lives, but their pursuit can be somewhat hampered if you are starving to death. This is the heart of the matter. The particular “mysteries and passions” that appeal to people of Chris’s persuasion come first, and the physical requirements of other humans are secondary: they must either fit in somehow, or fall aside. There is now a wide movement, some of whose leading figures are quoted on or in Chris’s book, that prioritises its mysteries and passions above other people’s survival to the point at which it promotes the idea of “withdrawing” and “walking away” from the effort to prevent Earth systems collapse. On behalf of the rest of the world, such people grandly proclaim that it’s futile to try to stop the slide. We should give up and “adapt to”, even embrace, whatever awaits. But there is no “away” to walk to. Ecological and social collapse will find us, wherever we go. What some people can escape is the shared responsibility for facing our multiple crises, and their duty of care towards others. The acceptance of – sometimes apparent longing for – collapse is among the greatest self-indulgences in human history. It is peculiar to people who are either relatively wealthy and insulated, or have the land and means to grow their own food (or both). It is a variation of the prepper mentality, whose props in this case are not bunkers, bitcoin, tinned food and AR-15s, but hoes, scythes and leather jerkins. (Though these “repeasantised” folk might discover that if the calamity does occur, they’ll also need some heavy weaponry to defend their land and crops). While the Old Testament prophets had to rely on God’s wrath being visited upon the human feedlots, today the curses have more temporal means of realisation. All we now need do is nothing: let the corporations, the oligarchs and the rising consumer demand that are breaking Earth systems have their way, and some form of collapse is likely to occur, with or without God’s wrath. By deliberately stepping back from the struggle to contain these forces, and even seeking in some cases to dissuade others from participating, they make this possibility more likely. My belief is that we have no right to grant ourselves this indulgence. Given that rich nations and wealthy people are primarily responsible for the planetary dysbiosis we all face, including the massive burdens the food system imposes on the living world, we all have a duty to engage. Engaging means valuing the lives of others as we value our own. Living on this planet, especially as a member of a privileged society, our lives are intimately bound with the lives of others, including those who live thousands of miles away. We cannot excuse ourselves from the responsibilities we owe to each other. Our aim should be not to use societal collapse as a tool to shape the world to our tastes, but to seek to avert societal collapse. Discordant Notes There are no perfect solutions in an imperfect world. Everything we might propose, including all the ways forward I suggest in Regenesis, has downsides. We are working in a very tight space, one in which 8 billion people and more need to be fed, within an Earth system whose planetary boundaries have already been breached, to a large extent as a result of food production. There are no remaining comfort zones. There is no longer – if there ever was – scope for ideological congruence, for solutions that fit snugly into any one worldview. We will find ourselves in disconcerting places. We will be assailed by cognitive dissonance. In seeking to address our great predicaments, we should be, as much as is humanly possible, open-minded, open-hearted, receptive to evidence, argument and persuasion. The answers, contradictory, incomplete and inadequate as they will always be, will be social, political, economic, organisational and technological. We might not like some of our own conclusions. But it’s not just about us. When some writers and campaigners, prioritising their own mysteries and passions, appear to treat billions of people as disposable, it should tell us something important: we need to check ourselves. We need to ask what impulses we are following, whether we are really seeking the best outcomes for humanity and the living planet, or simply avoiding cognitive pain. We need, as much as we are able, to set our passions aside.

Many farmers and meat eaters don&#x27;t like the idea that livestock farming at the scale needed to support modern western diets is fundamentally unsustainable. People who believe that eating free range meat means that they&#x27;ve made the clearly ethical choice may be surprised at how that works out over an entire population. Many non meat eaters are uncomfortable at the argument that just hoping people switch to vegan diets is unlikely to work in practice. Many environmentalists don&#x27;t like the conclusion that the best hopes for a way forward involve more technology, not less.I&#x27;m not sure he ends up betting on the right horses, but it seems to me that the substance of the book is well thought through, and hard to disagree with without falling into the \"let them eat cake\" trap that&#x27;s called out in this essay.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.penguin.co.uk&#x2F;books&#x2F;317018&#x2F;regenesis-by-monbiot-... reply peteradio 12 hours agoparentFree range eaters are hoping to maintain a relationship with their free range farmer if&#x2F;as the screws get turned.

A lot of pasture land is pasture land because the land can&#x27;t support much else. reply teknopaul 17 hours agoprevStarts out so wrong. I live in Spain, traditionally good food still a staple. Most of the world I have visited is like that too.OK USA has screwed it&#x27;s food chain, but that does not apply outside. People generally value traditions, and specifically food traditions, highly. It&#x27;s a long way from financially difficult to keep these alive. People just have to decide they want to and spend time, not money. People round here do that.N.B. Traditional food does not come from a shop, you make it yourself. Thus, it cannot be gentrified away. Growing your own local specialities is usually easy where it is traditional.If you can&#x27;t imagine obtaining anything without going to the free market and haggling, your limited options are your own doing. That&#x27;s not gentrification. reply fnordpiglet 17 hours agoparentN.b., the author is British not American. Argindustry isn’t a uniquely American thing, it’s global and pervasive, specially for protein and animal feedstock. A lot of vegetable in a global context is grown locally and purchased at local markets (outside the US and urban settings globally, which are end to end industrialized), but most people don’t raise artisanal pigs for slaughter. Most people buy their meat from a store or merchant who buys from a middle man who buys from a dense industrialized setup. Even in developing countries dense animal farms are the norm for most meat, even if individuals raise some amount of animal for extra money or protein in their diet. The economics are just too strong. Likewise feedstock tends to be larger plot farming by either large land owners or corporations.I do not believe you though that people in Madrid and Barcelona and other urban areas of Spain raise their own food in their studio apartments, herding their sheep in their half bath. They buy from supermarkets, or often restaurants, who buy from distributors, who buy from wholesalers, which buy from whoever sells them the food for the cheapest.What the article gets profoundly wrong is that somehow tourism is driving industrialization of food production. What’s driving industrialization of food production is profit motive and a growing population with enriched tastes and growing wealth that’s outstripping the ability of small farm operations to meet at scale and relatively flat pricing as demand soars. That requires ever increasing supply, which requires ever increasing land productivity with a shrinking farm workforce and shrinking available arable land. The “it’s all the offensive bourgeois food tourists fault” is absurd and talks more to the author seemingly unreasonable social dislike of certain types of people than a level headed economic assessment. reply bsder 12 hours agorootparent> The economics are just too strong.This is really the crux of the issue.Farming sucks. Farming at small scales really sucks. There is a massive incentive to consolidate. Even when left alone, farmers tend to form co-ops in order to mitigate risk.I had a long talk with a local producer of \"Hormone free, antibiotic free, grass fed, grass finished\" beef (need it because of family member with corn allergy). The economics are brutal. Corn finishing a steer nets you 3x (or more) the weight. Grass is highly dependent upon rain. etc.Basically, the best thing I could do was commit to buying a whole steer every 6 months and let them sell what I can&#x27;t deal with. Effectively, I gamble that they can sell the extra meat or I eat the loss. It generally works, but how many people can float a $5K-$10K loan every 6 months? And, even if they can get enough customers to float the loan, it will quickly saturate the number of customers who can buy the \"extra\". It&#x27;s really a tough problem.Everybody talks like farmers don&#x27;t know what they are doing. Go talk to one and prepare to be surprised--you&#x27;ll find out really quickly that most farmers know their business extremely intimately and can tell you how every single dollar is put to work. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentOh yeah, farmers are engineers of the land and nature for sure. They know their processes, their dependencies, and procedures in extreme depth and they are complex and unforgiving. Farming isn’t gardening, and every farm is a business end to end - and a risky one with low payouts and huge downsides that are often entirely out of your control. Modern farming techniques aren’t that way out of some sort of malevolent spite, they actually work and make farms profitable reliably. That they blast the earth and poison the populace is sad and most farmers don’t relish destroying their land. reply thaumasiotes 4 hours agorootparentprev> even if individuals raise some amount of animal for extra money or protein in their diet.It happens more often than I expected, but of course it&#x27;s still not common.A friend of mine living in an apartment in Shanghai once complained to me that her neighbors were keeping a chicken in their apartment and she was irritated by the daily crowing.But she took the philosophy \"soon enough they&#x27;ll eat it and the problem will go away\".Hard to imagine something similar happening in the US. reply jcampbell1 16 hours agorootparentprevI didn’t take away the same message. To me it was a decent attempt to explain that offensive liberal bourgeois foodies have been sold a bill of truthy sounding bullshit because that is how free markets work. If you want to help someone tell them the truth, if you want to help yourself then tell them what they want to believe. There is a whole market of selling expensive things and claiming it will save the planet or the poor or stop colonialism or some other lie which is designed to enrich the seller.In terms of peak bullshit, I personally think the absurd stupidity of vertical farming is what caused most people to realize the ideas coming out of one camp are mostly bullshit. reply 3seashells 16 hours agorootparentprevDense?

In the famous cheesemaking regions of France, you will scarcely see a dairy cow. Instead, vast tracts are cultivated for maize. Passing tourists romantically assume it’s sweetcorn for human consumption – the French must eat a lot of sweetcorn! No, it will be turned into silage to feed the cattle stalled in the vast steel sheds – cow factories – that have sprung up from Brittany to Savoie, a business as brutal and industrial as any other.

Someone wrote a book talking shit about him specifically (while making wild and often absurd claims about society and food systems).. I think we can allow him to spend a few paragraphs thoroughly refuting it. reply oldbbsnickname 8 hours agoparentprevYellow vests protests and Occupy Wall St. are examples of ineffective movements: lacking identification of root causes of problems, lacking specific demands to redress, lacking leaders, or lacking resolve. XR is also sort-of in this camp.The unfortunate reality is declarations about existential peril and what we \"should\" be doing fall on deaf ears of policymakers and regulators where particular governments are de facto run by the billionaires. Most necessary changes cannot happen without first defenestrating corporate lobbyists and the money politicians receive. This won&#x27;t happen by elections, by reform from within (Sen. John McCain discovered this), or by wishing for it. And honestly, most US politicians should be in prison because they do more than just take stacks of cash and gold bars to fund reelection media buys, many allow their attention and votes to be curried for it, and even propose bills verbatim from the lobbyists of their benefactors.Change can only happen externally by many, sustained, nonviolent mass demonstrations sufficient to achieve specific policy objectives. (\"World peace\" and \"save the planet\" aren&#x27;t policies, while \"phase out all coal power plants in 5 years\" is.)In absence of the people demanding specific actions and changes, the \"green revolution\" will be half-assed for renewables in electricity (currently at 30% worldwide, may top out at 80-90%), but that&#x27;s about it. No net negative global emissions and not much carbon sequestration. Ultra-processing and megafarming practices sure as shit won&#x27;t change by debate or wishful thinking alone. reply kranke155 16 hours agoparentprevThats exactly how I felt.

They think, they talk, they discuss. Historically, good intelectuals have helped societies identify problems by asking questions and challenging common assumptions (something very difficult to do well).And, of course, we need engineers and people with the right technical skills to develop solutions that improve life in practical ways. reply davedx 15 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t think books with solutions (like the author has written) are useful? reply kranke155 15 hours agorootparentIm sure that some are, but the text that is linked in this particular post - could you explain its usefulness? reply spicymapotofu 11 hours agorootparentA simple comparison might help: while from the outside this likely looks like the famous \"leftist yells at leftist\" scenario, the alternative - where a single expert has their theories elevated into law, without room for disagreement, looks a lot like Lysenkoism, and usually results in large-scale suffering with no scientific value (due to mistakes, large or small, in individual theories).I&#x27;m not in this field and can&#x27;t hazard a guess at the exact utility of this dispute, but when I see specialists and the impassioned debating vigorously on their principles, I trust it&#x27;s because of relevant disagreements in the field, because that&#x27;s what I observe in my preferred domain. Some amount of slapfighting is inevitable - we&#x27;re all human - but this is a particularly humane way to hash out differences. reply mplanchard 15 hours agoparentprevI thought that it seemed clear that the article&#x27;s author also holds this position reply TacticalCoder 15 hours agoprevGreat TFA but I partially disagree with this:> A healthy, nutritious diet is much more expensive than a calorie sufficient one. As a result, three billion people cannot afford a healthy diet.Is that so? My wife is the kind to obsess on healthy eating and always tells me it&#x27;s cheaper to cook healthy than to cook unhealthy stuff. She&#x27;s the kind that forces me to eat soup as dinner and that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not expensive to buy a few vegetables and to make soup.(we buy, weekly, stuff from a local farmer btw and it&#x27;s not exensive at all and he&#x27;s happy to see people not buying everything from the supermarket)Eggs aren&#x27;t expensive: I find eggs super yummy.Lentils, canned tuna (I love that: I just love that, not too sure if it&#x27;s healthy or not but it&#x27;s cheap), advocados (ok, they may be a bit pricey), corn, there are fishes that are cheap...It&#x27;s easy to go to a drive-in and buy junk. But they&#x27;re not handing that junk for free at drive-ins. People who buy that could buy vegetables instead. Sure, there may not be same amount of calories and fat and whatnots but seen the average overweight person, I&#x27;d argue that that&#x27;s... A good thing?I mean, put it this way: it may be expensive to buy healthy food and yet end up as fat and unhealthy as when buying ultra high fat, ultra high calories, junk food... But maybe, just maybe, you don&#x27;t need to be that fat and unhealthy?My eight years old kid has been conditioned by my wife to only health healthy stuff: she sees a Mc Donald sign and pretends to throw up.I understand that people can&#x27;t be bothered to buy healthy stuff and don&#x27;t have the will to eat reasonable amount of food and can&#x27;t be bothered to make soup but I don&#x27;t buy the whole \"fat people are fat because they&#x27;re poor\".They&#x27;re fat and unhealthy because they are eating junk.There&#x27;s a spectrum between \"Supersize me\" and \"three-star restaurant selling $$$ sushis\". reply InSteady 15 hours agoparentHe&#x27;s talking in global terms here. This isn&#x27;t directed at people from wealthy nations. He&#x27;s talking about places where the majority of calories come entirely from grain, not because of dietary preferences or convenience but because of economic realities:>The global definition of an affordable diet is one that costs 52% or less of average household expenditure. Using this definition, 3 billion people – over one-third of the global population – cannot afford a healthy diet. In other words, buying adequate food would mean spending more on it than on housing, energy, education, health, transport, clothing and all other items put together. reply givemeethekeys 12 hours agorootparentWould you consider India to be a wealthy nation? Even in India, it is cheaper to eat healthy than to not.Perhaps this article only applies to nations suffering from outright famine. reply picture 15 hours agoparentprevWhile eating healthy can indeed be cheap, I think systemically there are other costs like having the free time and free energy (which both might be depleted after a long day of hard work), other issues like the need to have some sort of transit to a grocer with fresh goods. For many parts of the United States, there&#x27;s only Dollar General within accessible distance, and many people cannot afford to own or rent cars, and public transportation likely don&#x27;t exist in their area. I think it&#x27;s unlikely that prominent statistics of lower income being correlated with lower quality diets can be explained just by \"poor people are lazy\" reply jwells89 15 hours agorootparentEven if one technically has time, cooking is a considerable commitment and so it’s easy to end up having little to no downtime after working it into a schedule, especially in a family situation.It’s hard to keep that kind of tight schedule up for long periods while maintaining sanity. Even if you start out cooking regularly and eating healthy it’s easy to burn out and wind up in a funk which then causes a spiraling effect that makes it ever-harder to get back to a healthy lifestyle.So I might suggest that many don’t just need time and energy to be able to cook healthy, but enough to cook healthy and still have time and energy left over. In other words, a sustainable schedule. reply adrian_b 14 hours agorootparentCooking with modern methods can take much less time than with traditional methods.Until three or four years ago, I was cooking traditionally. Because that required many hours, I could not do that daily, so I was cooking for the entire week during one day of the weekend, which was mostly lost to this activity.Then I have switched to cook everything in a microwave oven (which I had previously used for decades only for reheating food), including things like baking home-made bread. This allows very short and perfectly reproducible cooking times. Many kinds of food, typically those with high water content, like potatoes or meat, can be just roasted in closed glass vessels without adding anything to them and they are much tastier than when they are boiled, without needing to fry them in cooking oil. Other vegetables are better boiled in water with salt, but regardless of the method all vegetables require less than a quarter of hour in the oven.Since then, I am cooking every day what I eat just before I need it, which takes less than half of hour from start to finish for all operations, when cooking vegetables.Meat required less preparation time but more time in the oven (at reduced power levels), depending on what kind of meat it was, e.g. up to 30 minutes, so when I was eating meat I was cooking it separately, in amounts sufficient for several days, and I was cooking everything else just before the meal, when it was combined with the precooked meat.So with some experimentation, it is possible to find ways to cook your food without wasting too much time and energy with that. reply petre 4 hours agorootparentYes, that. Yay to ovens and electric appliances where you just set the power and the time and go do something else until the food cooks itself. I stopped boiling most vegetables, I steam process them over a pot with a strainer on top. reply pfdietz 14 hours agorootparentprevOne thing to note here: although industrial agriculture in the US is criticized for using too much energy, we in the US use more energy cooking food than is used to grow it (including all energy used to fuel farm equipment and make agrochemicals.)So don&#x27;t think that cooking is somehow a trivial problem, especially for the world&#x27;s poor. reply hollerith 13 hours agorootparent>we in the US use more energy cooking food than is used to grow itDo you have a citation or a calculation for that? reply pfdietz 10 hours agorootparentNot directly, but various things I google show that in the US food system, only 10-20% of the energy used is on the farm. Much more is in handling (which includes cooking and refrigeration), transportation, and processing. reply asdff 9 hours agorootparentNo surprise, farm is powered by the sun and water pressure. reply tormeh 8 hours agorootparentI hope you&#x27;re trolling, because that&#x27;s definitely not how that works. reply adrian_b 13 hours agorootparentprevThat happens only because most people use energetically inefficient methods of cooking, not because it is something intrinsic to cooking.Everything that I eat is cooked by myself from raw ingredients and for that I consume around 0.6 kWh of electric energy per day. reply pfdietz 13 hours agorootparentAs opposed to the global poor, who have highly energy efficient cooking equipment? That doesn&#x27;t sound right. reply adrian_b 11 hours agorootparentWhile the maximum energy efficiency for cooking is obtained with modern equipment, like microwave ovens, cooking equipment does not necessarily have to be modern and expensive.I am pretty certain that the kitchen stove used by my grandparents had a much better energy efficiency than the kitchen stoves that burn natural gas and which are still very widespread now.That old kitchen stove was a wood-burning kitchen stove, but only a small quantity of wood had to be burned, because it had a huge thermal inertia and after becoming hot enough food could be cooked for hours with minimal wood consumption. The heat transfer from the large hot iron stove (but with a temperature close to that needed for food, i.e. much lower than the temperature of a gas flame) was much better than from a gas burner, which resulted in much less lost heat.The efficiency of such a wood-burning kitchen stove is likely to have been similar with the efficiency of an induction electric stove. replyajsnigrutin 15 hours agorootparentprevPoorer people are fatter in other countries too, and in most countries (at least the developed ones), very few people work more than 8 hours per day (so enough time to cook), and grocery stores are easily accessible. reply youngtaff 15 hours agorootparentPoor people often have to work multiple jobs and often work many more hourse than 8 hours a day.

Random independent contractors (electricians, painters,...) are an exception, but they&#x27;re far from poor.Having to work multiple jobs and many hours and low access to food (stores) is pretty much a uniquely US problem. reply asdff 9 hours agorootparentDepends on where you are in europe. Germany, probably better than the U.S. Romania, far worse. reply petre 4 hours agorootparentDepends where you live and work. I&#x27;d totally pick Romania or even Bulgaria over Germany. Healthier and tastier food for one, and I&#x27;m not talking restaurants, but farmer&#x27;s markets. Cities are probably worse, more cars parked eveywhere, more annoying drivers operating them, more pollution, more chaos. I&#x27;ve also met people from Moldova and Ukraine telling me food is way less expensive there. They also eat tastier and more healthy food: borsch, fish, salads but lack EU regulation for big agriculture, so grain, and industrially grown vegetables and meat is probably laced with chemicals banned or regulated in the EU. In Germany the traditional food is quite boring. I won&#x27;t venture to say awful, because it&#x27;s still eatable, but doesn&#x27;t have much variety or taste, like South or East European food. Czech Republic and Poland were also very pleasant food wise: great pickles or cabbage based foods. Hingary? They&#x27;re eating too much meat. But the goulash and sausages ate usually quite good. replyadrian_b 14 hours agoparentprevHealthy food is significantly cheaper than random food selected from what is easily available from a supermarket.For instance, I live in the European Union and I eat very healthy food that I cook myself from raw ingredients, and in most days the food consumed during all day does not cost more than 5 EUR. Buying random food could easily cost ten times more than that.Nevertheless, there exists much cheaper food than the healthiest food and the people who cannot afford the healthiest food choose cheaper alternatives.For example, the largest amount of my daily fat intake comes from extra-virgin olive oil, followed by cold-pressed sunflower oil (used to add enough linoleic acid and vitamin E within a lower amount of calories than would be needed when using only olive oil).There are many vegetable oils that are at least 6 times cheaper than the relatively cheap olive oil that I am using and at least 3 times cheaper than cold-pressed sunflower oil. Many people choose those cheaper oils even if they are less healthy.Similarly, I eat a decent amount of proteins with balanced amino-acid profile, but it is very easy to reduce the cost of the food by replacing ingredients with high protein content with cereals like maize or with potatoes, which have lower protein content and higher starch content.So if you plan a healthy diet you can save money in comparison with eating what you first see on the shelves, but eating an unhealthy diet can save significantly more money. reply EliRivers 15 hours agoparentprev> A healthy, nutritious diet is much more expensive than a calorie sufficient one.

Which isn&#x27;t surprising given the cavalier attitudes towards impoverished people that I&#x27;ve seen many tech workers hold. I&#x27;m very glad that you have access to fresh produce on a regular basis. That is not the reality for everyone around the world, let alone everyone in developed nations.Are vegetables still cheap when you need to travel miles and&#x2F;or hours away from your place of residence&#x2F;work? What about if you don&#x27;t have own a personal vehicle and depend on public transit? When you need to work 3 jobs in order to not become homeless and then still care for multiple children, is it as easy to justify spending several hours of transit back and forth?We aren&#x27;t just talking about people eating fast food. That&#x27;s only a percentage of the people who rely on \"junk food\" to survive. There are people who source 100% of their calories from a gas station because all the grocery stores, both small-bussiness and corporate, have closed due to crime and&#x2F;or economic hardship.There are places where even the local Dollar Tree shuts down. Leaving only gas stations or service stations some of which even keep many things behind bulletproof plexiglass to reduce theft. Would you really want to bus and walk around with a bag full of fresh produce when everyone else is just as hungry as you? That&#x27;s if the metro service even still runs in your area.Food deserts are a reality for many people and you have the luxury to live in an areacode that doesn&#x27;t deal with this due to your relatively high paying IT job. And before you say \"everyone can learn to code\", no, they can&#x27;t. Learning new skills requires free downtime that many don&#x27;t have the luxury of. Many people spend every waking hour working and even sleep less that is healthy in order to work more.This is only exacerbated when they don&#x27;t have the fundamental math&#x2F;science education that CS requires due to chronic underfunding of school districts in those same areacodes. Or even access to any computers besides mobile devices provided \"for free\" via a monthly service plan. Regardless of how difficult your upbringing was, it&#x27;s extremely evident that you don&#x27;t grasp many of the privileges you have had access to during your lifetime.I can&#x27;t find the exact statistics at the moment, but a larger than I would like percentage of the US pet food supply chain is consumed by humans. Are you really saying that people who need to eat dog food to get enough calories to not starve to death are just doing that because they are too lazy to go to a grocery store and cook vegetables into a soup? reply spywaregorilla 15 hours agoparentprevyou live near a local farmer that sells low cost produce. you have the time to prepare meals. you have either good refrigeration or the time &#x2F; accessibility to purchase produce on a frequent basis.Soups are great. But they take a long time to make. A lot of poor people&#x27;s situation is that they can only get groceries from the dollar tree that prioritizes non-refrigerated goods and they have a very limited amount of time to do any of this. So you can make your cheap carbs (ramen&#x2F;rice&#x2F;pasta) + condiment or instant foods which suck or you can get some fast food which is very rewarding. Neither are healthy. reply musicale 14 hours agorootparent> Soups are great.

If anything, we are likely to become more reliant on long-distance transport to deliver our food – a prospect no one, myself included, relishes.\"Having moved from an urban to a rural area, I disagree. There is far more food produced per person in rural areas. Although I&#x27;m in high desert, there&#x27;s probably a surplus of calories created here even with non-producers like me included. We are relatively protected from starvation in a disaster because of this and the often very very short transportation lines from yard to table. Someone that already has a rabbit hutch or chicken coop or vegetable garden can scale up quickly. And out here you can live off of small game if you can shoot or trap, as the natives did for thousands of years.But we&#x27;re highly dependent on gasoline.

Of course this only works if we also stabilize the global human population and eliminate fossil fuels from the energy mix to avoid increasing drought&#x2F;flood risk. Moving to a diet of no more than 5% or so animal products also makes sense as that means more primary production (direct photosynthesis) goes to humans instead of livestock, thereby reducing the pressure on agricultural land.As Monbiot implies, anyone claiming a return to pre-industrial subsistence agriculture is a good idea is either a shameless marketer or a lunatic who has never tried to grow their own food. reply analyte123 15 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t find the opposing argument convincing at all. If you look at the US for example, all direct energy usage for crops and livestock production (~800 Tbtu) plus energy used for fertilizer production (~350 Tbtu) adds up to about 1% of all energy consumption [1]. This includes all the energy used to farm crops for biofuels and for export. This does not suggest some sort of looming agricultural energy crisis. The basic formula of mechanized agriculture has been in place for at least 100 years, and what is generally still happening is steadily increasing yields, decreasing energy consumption, and more knowledge and concern for soil quality and sustainability.The argument that we all need to leave cities behind and \"return to the land\" is squarely in the horseshoe zone of radical politics. These days I associate contempt for modernity, industrial agriculture and cities more with far-right ideologues than the far-left ones he is targeting here, but to me they are on both sides borne out of a similar unrealistic, apocalyptic, and utopian mindset; and especially the desire (conscious or not) that such a destructive transformation would address their personal struggles or political grievances.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=18431, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;energyexplained&#x2F;us-energy-facts&#x2F; reply pfdietz 14 hours agorootparentAnd, there&#x27;s no reason why fossil fuels would be needed to provide the energy.The only argument I can see that might have some validity is accumulation of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere from denitrification of fertilizers.

He died this year at 82 years of age of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, almost surely caught due to his involvement with agricultural herbicides. His 90 years old brother that worked as a physics teacher is alive and kicking. Takes the bus from the village everyday to the city to have a coffee with his friends.Anyhow, I digress. Let&#x27;s get back to the original article.>> Much of the protein, insufficient as it was, came not from cheese and meat but from what we now call dhal. It had names (to give some English examples) like pease pottage, pease pudding, mushy peas and pea soupThe Romanian countryside was far better off in the rationalization period than the cities. I&#x27;ve visited my city-living aunt a few times and noticed the terrible queues to procure basically anything: bread, butter, meat. I don&#x27;t recall much of my meals as a 10 years old (I was 12 when Ceaușescu was shot and shortages ended) and with my parents might have been a bit atypical. As my father being chief engineer of the state farm we never lacked anything, of course :)But when living with my grandparents, I think my diet was a lot more what regular people ate. There was no lack of protein but it wasn&#x27;t the obscene frenzy I see in American movies (probably fake?): all beef chops meat and basically no bread or carbs or vegetables at all.I ate a serious amount of carbs from wheat bread and corn bread, lots of milk and derivatives, eggs, vegetables in salads and soups. Btw, a salad here is a mixture of vegetables that you eat with your main dish. It&#x27;s never the main dish, another habit of well fed people. Chicken was a rare treat, my grandma would sacrifice growing chickens but almost never a fully grown hen that would lay eggs. And how much can you split a chicken between 2 adults and 2 kids (my and my cousin)? It was always stew, I never ever saw fried chicken EVER during those times. Almost all meat came from pork. Occasionally beef but the penalty for having beef in communist Romania was straight prison. Peasants were supposed to hand over the calves to the state, but sometimes they were born \"dead\" (i.e. kept in the stables and fed a bit until slaughtered). Btw, it&#x27;s those times when I developed a less than today&#x27;s modern sensible view towards animals as opposed to humans. First time slaughtering a calf or bagging a litter of puppies into a sack before drowning them is the hardest. You get used to it and learn this is life if we&#x27;re about to live.Darn, I digress again.

Capital where it wasn&#x27;t compared to no capital, that is.Talking about 1900s Germany, that reminds me of a story my grandpa told me. He had a cousin that moved from rural Romania to urban Germany in order to work in a factory, after abandoning his pig trade that my grandma was doing (fattening pigs and selling them in an animal market). The idea was not to immigrate but to make enough hard $$$ as to buy here at home enough land that he couldn&#x27;t have even dreamed otherwise. An early IT-guy I guess :)Anyhow after he came back, the women of the village asked his wife who was at all times following him. \"How did you manage to buy things given you speak no German at all?!\". \"Well, unlike the backwards shop here where the seller sits behind a counter under the presumption that you&#x27;ll steal shit and asks you what you want, in Deutschland shops are open space. They provide you with a basket on entry, into which said basket you freely pick stuff from shelves in the store and all you have to do upon exit is show the basket to the clerk store and they will show you the number.

Sign in PETER GUEST BUSINESSOCT 26, 2023 8:44 AM The UK’s Controversial Online Safety Act Is Now Law The UK government says its Online Safety Act will protect people, particularly children, on the internet. Critics say it’s ineffective against dangerous misinformation and may be a threat to privacy. PHOTOGRAPH: PANORIOS/GETTY IMAGES Jeremy Wright was the first of five UK ministers charged with pushing through the British government’s landmark legislation on regulating the internet, the Online Safety Bill. The current UK government likes to brand its initiatives as “world-beating,” but for a brief period in 2019 that might have been right. Back then, three prime ministers ago, the bill—or at least the white paper that would form its basis—outlined an approach that recognized that social media platforms were already de facto arbiters of what was acceptable speech on large parts of the internet, but that this was a responsibility they didn’t necessarily want and weren’t always capable of discharging. Tech companies were pilloried for things that they missed, but also, by free speech advocates, for those they took down. “There was a sort of emerging realization that self-regulation wasn’t going to be viable for very much longer,” Wright says. “And therefore, governments needed to be involved.” The bill set out to define a way to handle “legal but harmful” content—material that wasn’t explicitly against the law but which, individually or in aggregate, posed a risk, such as health care disinformation, posts encouraging suicide or eating disorders, or political disinformation with the potential to undermine democracy or create panic. The bill had its critics—notably, those who worried it gave Big Tech too much power. But it was widely praised as a thoughtful attempt to deal with a problem that was growing and evolving faster than politics and society were able to adapt. Of his 17 years in parliament, Wright says, “I’m not sure I’ve seen anything by way of potential legislation that’s had as broadly based a political consensus behind it.” Having passed, eventually, through the UK’s two houses of Parliament, the bill received royal assent today. It is no longer world-beating—the European Union’s competing Digital Services Act came into force in August. And the Online Safety Act enters into law as a broader, more controversial piece of legislation than the one that Wright championed. The act’s more than 200 clauses cover a wide spectrum of illegal content that platforms will be required to address and give platforms a “duty of care” over what their users—particularly children—see online. Some of the more nuanced principles around the harms caused by legal but harmful content have been watered down, and added in is a highly divisive requirement for messaging platforms to scan users’ messages for illegal material, such as child sexual abuse material, which tech companies and privacy campaigners say is an unwarranted attack on encryption. Companies, from Big Tech down to smaller platforms and messaging apps, will need to comply with a long list of new requirements, starting with age verification for their users. (Wikipedia, the eighth-most-visited website in the UK, has said it won’t be able to comply with the rule because it violates the Wikimedia Foundation’s principles on collecting data about its users.) Platforms will have to prevent younger users from seeing age-inappropriate content, such as pornography, cyberbullying, and harassment; release risk assessments on potential dangers to children on their services; and give parents easy pathways to report concerns. Sending threats of violence, including rape, online will now be illegal, as will assisting or encouraging self-harm online or transmitting deepfake pornography, and companies will need to quickly act to remove them from their platforms, along with scam adverts. In a statement, UK Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan said: “The Bill protects free speech, empowers adults and will ensure that platforms remove illegal content. At the heart of this Bill, however, is the protection of children. I would like to thank the campaigners, parliamentarians, survivors of abuse and charities that have worked tirelessly, not only to get this Act over the finishing line, but to ensure that it will make the UK the safest place to be online in the world.” Enforcement of the act will be left to the UK’s telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, which said in June that it would begin consultations with industry after royal assent was granted. It’s unlikely that enforcement will begin immediately, but the law will apply to any platform with a significant number of users in the UK. Companies that fail to comply with the new rules face fines of up to £18 million ($21.9 million) or 10 percent of their annual revenue, whichever is larger.

Then It Got Weird ANDY GREENBERG Some of the controversy around the act is less about what is in it and more about what isn’t. The long passage of the legislation means that its development straddled the Covid-19 pandemic, giving legislators a live view of the social impact of mis- and disinformation. The spread of anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown messages became an impediment to public health initiatives. After the worst of the pandemic was over, those same falsehoods fed into other conspiracy theories that continue to disrupt society. The original white paper that was the bill’s foundation included proposals for compelling platforms to tackle this kind of content—which individually might not be illegal but which en masse creates dangers. That’s not in the final legislation, although the act does create a new offense of “false communications,” criminalizing deliberately causing harm by communicating something the sender knows to be untrue. “One of the most important things was tackling harms that happen at scale. And because it’s focused so much on individual pieces of content, it’s missed that,” says Ellen Judson, head of the digital research hub at the think tank Demos. The act includes strict rules forcing platforms to move swiftly to remove any illegal post—such as terrorist content or child sexual abuse material—but not on disinformation campaigns comprised of a drip-drip of misleading content, failing to understand that “when that turns into things going viral and spreading, then the harm can occur cumulatively.” Wright says that the exclusion of disinformation and misinformation from the bill was partly due to confusion between the remits of different departments. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport “was told that the Cabinet Office would be taking care of all of this. ‘Don’t you worry your pretty little heads about it, it’ll be done elsewhere in something called the Defending Democracy agenda,’” he says. “And then I think, subsequently, it wasn’t really. So I think … there still is a gap there.” Under the Act, bigger platforms will be expected to police potentially harmful, but not illegal, content by applying their own standards more consistently than they currently do—something that free-speech campaigners have decried as giving private companies control over what’s acceptable discourse online, but which some experts on dis- and misinformation say is a cop-out that means Big Tech will be less accountable for spreading falsehoods. Legal experts, however, say compliance with the law will require platforms to be more transparent and proactive. “They have to put all of those processes in place as to how their decisions will be made, or they risk actually being seen as a platform that is controlling all kinds of free speech,” says Emma Wright, technology lead at the law firm Harbottle & Lewis. That’s likely to become quite a significant burden. “It’s the new GDPR,” she says.

Then It Got Weird ANDY GREENBERG By far the most divisive clause out of the more than 300 pages of the Online Safety Act is Section 122, which has been widely interpreted as compelling companies to scan users’ messages to make sure that they aren’t transmitting illegal material. That would be incredibly difficult—perhaps even impossible—to do without breaking the end-to-end encryption on platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal. End-to-end encryption means that the sender and recipient of a message can see its content but the owner of the platform that it’s sent on cannot. The only way to comply with the law, experts say, would be to put so-called client-side scanning software on users’ devices to examine messages before they’re sent, which would make the encryption largely useless. The government said during the bill’s development that companies could find a technical solution to scan messages without undermining encryption; companies and experts countered that that technology doesn’t, and may never, exist. “That gives Ofcom, as a regulator, the ability to obligate people like us to go and put third-party content monitoring [on our products] that unilaterally scans everything going through the apps,” Matthew Hodgson, CEO of encrypted messaging company Element, told WIRED before the bill passed. “That’s undermining the encryption and providing a mechanism where bad actors of any kind could compromise the scanning system in order to steal the data flying around the place.” Companies whose products depend on end-to-end encryption threatened to leave the country, including Signal. Meta said it may pull WhatsApp from the UK if the bill were to pass. That cliff edge has come and gone, and both services are still available—albeit after an 11th-hour restatement by the government that it wouldn’t force platforms to adopt nonexistent technology to scan users’ messages—which was seen by some as a climbdown. However, the clause remains in the act, which worries privacy and free-speech activists, who see it as part of a spectrum of threats against encryption. If the Online Safety Act means companies have to remove encryption or circumvent it using client-side scanning, “it then potentially opens [data] up to being scooped up into the broader surveillance apparatus,” according to Nik Williams, policy and campaigns officer at the campaign group Index on Censorship.

The Online Safety Act has concerning overlaps with another piece of legislation, the Investigatory Powers Act, which allows the government to compel platforms to remove encryption. Williams says the overlap between the two pieces of legislation creates “a surveillance gateway between the OSB and the IPA in that this can give the security services, such as MI5, MI6, and GCHQ, access to data they previously could not access … I would say it’s probably an unprecedented expansion of surveillance powers.” The morning after the Online Safety Bill passed through the House of Lords, the UK Home Office launched a new campaign against encrypted messaging, specifically targeting Facebook Messenger. Former minister Jeremy Wright says that the question over encryption “is frankly not resolved. I think the government has sort of dodged around giving a concluded view on what it means for encryption.” However, he says, the answer is unlikely to be as absolute as the act’s opponents are making out. Encryption won’t be banned, he says, but platforms will have to explain how their policies around it balance safety with their users’ right to privacy. “If you can meet those [safety] duties by using encryption or with encryption as part of the service, you’re fine,” he says. If not, “you have a problem … it can’t be true, surely, that a platform is entitled to say, ‘Well, I operate encryption, so that’s a get-out-of-jail-free card for me on the safety duties.’” You Might Also Like … 📩 Get the long view on tech with Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter Watch this guy work, and you’ll finally understand the TikTok era The whole of the Whole Earth Catalog is now online Elon Musk mocked Ukraine, and Russian trolls went wild Job hunting sucks.

Of course this will be a privacy disaster and likely intentionally so.The Tories are obsessed with weakening privacy and data protection laws. It&#x27;s part pro-business&#x2F;anti-consumer ideology, part dislike of the EU and its goals and a large dash of corruption.

France Identité, that allows you to use NFC to communicate with your ID and generate a single use, verifiable proof of identity, as well as having a valid digital ID on your phone you can present to the authorities.I assume it will also be possible to provide a single use proof of age without revealing identity with this kind of system.I do not get at all why 3rd party companies would be allowed to do something like this.

I maybe not that good in British politics, but googling reveals that the bill&#x27;s text was prepared by a committee involving members of Conservative, Labour, LibDem, and Scottish National Party. The UK parliament&#x27;s website is an ugly mess, so I couldn&#x27;t find voting stats, but there are claims in media that it garnered cross-party support. Also it&#x27;s hard to buy \"pro-business ideology\" in this particular case when Facebook is against the bill. Bureacracy is by nature always tries to extend its power, I guess that&#x27;s what happening here. reply lozenge 20 hours agorootparentEvery bill is drafted in committee, but the ruling party(majority in the House of Commons) also gets to fill most of the roles in the committee- which makes sense because it would be wasted effort if the committee made a change that the ruling party would not support. reply broken-kebab 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s pretty trivial, and really doesn&#x27;t require much explanation. It doesn&#x27;t contradict to what I wrote: there&#x27;s no sign for the bill to be one party push over others opposing it (as stated by the comment I replied). reply oytis 20 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think EU goals are very much different - there is European legislation underway to make all messenger app providers scan all messages for signs if child abuse indiscriminately, effectively prohibiting end-to-end encryption reply anticensor 18 hours agorootparentThe EU one is on hold. reply hanniabu 19 hours agorootparentprev> They plan to have 3rd party companies that do verification.I&#x27;m sure this will be run by unqualified buddies of politicians with nice juicy contracts reply kleiba 21 hours agoparentprevAnd what kind of verification would a site like Wikipedia even need? Does it need to classify all articles with respect to a minimum reader age? Or generally allow all contents only for visitors that are over 18? Or what? reply ben_w 20 hours agorootparentAs I recall, Wikipedia insisted on HTTPS for all access well before it was fashionable precisely so that governments couldn&#x27;t decide which knowledge was OK and which was forbidden (and hence the whole site used to get regularly blocked by China because of e.g. the Tiananmen Square article).It doesn&#x27;t take much effort to find things the British establishment won&#x27;t want kids seeing even though kids talk about them in school playgrounds (or at least we did when I was last in a school a bit over 23 years ago).For example, I was given a summary of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by some girl in the same class as me when I was 8 or 9.And even as an adult, you really don&#x27;t want to see a real photograph of a newborn with anencephaly, which Wikipedia did have when I was first looking up the condition.The point of Wikipedia — that it can be edited at any time — absolutely makes it impossible to survive any age rating system other than \"adults only\". reply ekianjo 20 hours agorootparent> The point of Wikipedia — that it can be edited at any time — absolutely makes it impossible to survive any age rating system other than \"adults only\".Oh but when it&#x27;s news at dinner time showing dead children and weapons firing on and on it&#x27;s all fine, I guess? reply rzwitserloot 19 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not of course. But &#x27;screening&#x27; news casts for &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; content is easy and it is easy to point fingers when it doesn&#x27;t meet &#x27;standards&#x27;.Whereas with wikipedia, unless a dedicated team of editors who are contracted or liable to vet _every_ change. Possibly only for the UK, who get a special &#x27;only with vetted edits&#x27; version or some such, I don&#x27;t think wikipedia would be interested in making such a thing.Separate from that, wikipedia has various pages on (conditions related to) our sexual organs, as well as lots of articles about politically contentious things. I don&#x27;t think they are particularly interested in filtering that either.In contrast to news channels, most of which would have no particular complaints about a bunch of rules about content. As a rule your 9&#x27;o clock news isn&#x27;t going to just casually show frontal nudity (except e.g. Germany because they&#x27;re fine with it).One obvious problem is all those words in single quotes: Who gets to decide? Evidently you aren&#x27;t happy with whomever decided how far you can go with the content shown on the news, and I concur that it goes quite far. But the point isn&#x27;t about the current standards being applied. The point is whether _any_ standard can be applied at all.To news: Yes. To wikipedia: Not in a way wiki foundation would accept. reply anticensor 18 hours agorootparent> Whereas with wikipedia, unless a dedicated team of editors who are contracted or liable to vet _every_ change.A few other Wikipedias including the Turkish one work in that exact manner. reply ben_w 20 hours agorootparentprev1) When that comes up in UK news, it does get prefixed with \"this report has some scenes that viewers may find disturbing\".2) I don&#x27;t know what the rules are for broadcasts at different times of day, but I do know they exist3) I have always been perplexed as to why violence is considered so much more acceptable than, for example, sexuality. Outright murder? Apparently a suitable topic for children&#x27;s shows. Nipples, which are the defining characteristic of the class Mammalia to which we belong? Hide them all! Unless it&#x27;s a famous statue (then it&#x27;s Classical Art), or a man&#x27;s vestigial ones (then it&#x27;s so unremarkable nobody even says anything). reply rpastuszak 19 hours agorootparentRe 3) FYI this is a relatively US&#x2F;UK centric approach. In most of the countries I lived in, besides the UK, the bias was against violence, in this context.Edit: there was an IG account posting solely picture of nipples, male and female, cropped so it was hard to ascertain the sex of the photographed person.It existed purely to mess with the IG censorship rules. I don’t recall the name of the account but I think it was a genius idea. reply aziaziazi 20 hours agorootparentprevShouldn’t we also make encyclopedias usage prohibited for children? Perhaps technically easier to just forbid both encyclopedias and children within libraries. reply mdp2021 20 hours agorootparentCareful with that irony Eugene,there have been displays on the news even recently of people who find the Arts unacceptable because they may depict genitals (Greek Urns, Renaissance Statues etc.),so easily you will find around voices that could respond recommending that children be protected from exposure to the Arts.(And - ironically - not from the obscenity of those very voices.) reply ben_w 19 hours agorootparentThere was a Simpsons episode about that, wasn&#x27;t there? reply ben_w 20 hours agorootparentprevSometimes people un-ironically say such things about dictionaries.I would note that there are such things as \"children&#x27;s encyclopaedias\"; I might have had an earlier edition of this one myself as a kid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Childrens-Illustrated-Encyclopedia-DK...(I wonder if they still put in the cartoon of the Aztec Blood Sacrifice?) reply contravariant 20 hours agorootparentprevI mean this is a very good argument, so what I&#x27;m about to say is not much of a counterargument and more of a feeling.But fuck that shit. Sure some information is unpleasant (and frankly an image-free wikipedia would be very convenient for some queries), but trying to prevent this with age restrictions is just not the way to go. Trying to prevent this from reaching the school playground is like restricting kids to keep them from scraping their knee, it&#x27;s futile and likely more harmful than beneficial. reply ben_w 20 hours agorootparentI kinda agree with your vibes, though only kinda.Our world is a big complex mess and people have uglier souls than I&#x27;d like; the transition from innocent childhood to the adult realisation of this should be… kind and sympathetic, not just the equivalent of throwing someone in the deep end of a pool to teach them to swim. reply Arch-TK 17 hours agorootparentprev>like restricting kids to keep them from scraping their kneeExtremely on-brand for the UK. reply didntcheck 21 hours agoparentprevIt should be possible to have a third party IdP provide the site with a trustworthy claim that the user is an adult without any more information, shouldn&#x27;t it? I think people are a little too quick to claim victory because something is \"technically impossible\" when it actually isn&#x27;t (efficacy of public sector IT projects notwithstanding) reply MarcusE1W 21 hours agorootparentI don’t think that it is technically impossible and I don’t think that’s what most people have a problem with. It might be possible, just very high effort, for in most cases (e.g. Wikipedia) very little gain.I think the problem is exactly that one possible solution is a third party that everyone has to trust with their personal data.The way thinks work in this country that might mean that a friend of an influential MP sets up a new company as we speak that then will be chosen as the one and only service provider for this verification. For a considerable fee of course. This friend will then find an acquaintance who has worked for a consultancy at some point who will then hire a (maybe British) company to implement the service, they will outsource it to a much cheaper (probably not British) company to implement it. Provided that no one except for the outsourcing company has any idea what they are doing and the money is siphoned off to the Virgin Islands already it might take a while to get the service started and then it does not work.At this time the government will notice that not only their money is gone, they have to pay more to even get it started and from then on the long chain of contractors need a lot of money on a yearly basis to keep it running.This is the moment where they turn and explain to the public that from now on they have to pay to use the internet.Remind you this is a country that only since one year requires identification to vote in elections. But everyone is now supposed to register with a third party probably non government institution to access the internet. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯They only consolation is that they probably won’t get it off the ground in the foreseeable future. reply throwaway290 54 minutes agorootparent> But everyone is now supposed to register with a third party probably non government institution to access the internet. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯Wait, you could have internet connection (land line or mobile) without IDing yourself in the UK before?

The original white paper that was the bill’s foundation included proposals for compelling platforms to tackle this kind of content—which individually might not be illegal but which en masse creates dangers. That’s not in the final legislation, although the act does create a new offense of “false communications,” criminalizing deliberately causing harm by communicating something the sender knows to be untrue. [...] The act includes strict rules forcing platforms to move swiftly to remove any illegal post—such as terrorist content or child sexual abuse material—but not on disinformation campaigns comprised of a drip-drip of misleading content, failing to understand that “when that turns into things going viral and spreading, then the harm can occur cumulatively.”In the article, \"other conspiracy theories\" is a link to an article discussing people who oppose 15-minute cities, apparently because they regard that level of city planning as excessively authoritarian. It definitely seems to be true that the \"opposition\" here is complaining this bill did not yet give the government remit to ban \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\", which is indeed depressing.

The author is not writing in good faith in the first place by taking the weakest and most conspiratorial arguments and holding them up as \"the\" opposition, and they think it is a shame this Online Safety Act did not make disagreeing with them illegal.I caveat this with the statement that, were I dictator, all cities would be 15 minute cities, and I would bulldoze all subdivisions and American-style suburbs, which I regard as ridiculous encroachments on my preferred rural home. reply didntcheck 18 hours agorootparentExactly. If one wants to make the point that people are mixing up 15MC with ULEZ and other traffic-restricting measures, sure, any pertinent point of fact is welcome. But instead there&#x27;s been a fairly transparent attempt to take advantage of a contemporary political moral panic, and go with the lazy option of insinuating that anyone with fairly pedestrian (heh) objections to current council and government policy is a dangerous QAnon alt-right anti-vaccine... whatever other completely unrelated folk devils you want to throw in. Politicians have realized that they can drag the most random topics into the \"culture war\", declare that disagreeing with them is a \"conspiracy theory\", and enjoy free repetition of that thought-terminating cliché by allegedly \"anti-establishment\" journalists desperate to find a new frontier to declare their moral superiority inAnd for the record, I tend to agree with the majority of the proposals anyway, but I can still object to the extremely bad faith response to locals exercizing their democratic right to question them.

For many years LeaderSSL sponsored us with a code singing certificate but they are no longer able to do so. Since June of 2023 the CA/B Forum requires that OV code signing private keys be stored on a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Common Criteria Level EAL4+ certified device. This means we are no longer able to export our code signing certificate with its private key and use this in GitHub actions. We would now either need to have our own GitHub agent and hardware token or use a cloud solution (e.g. digicert). Our preference would be to use a cloud solution that integrates with GitHub. Digicert seems to be our only option now but a certificate there would cost $629 (tax excluded) for a single year.

DV certificates for HTTPS are trying to attest to control of a name in the DNS, which is verifiable by automated technical means, and which is not necessarily related to offline identity. (ICANN says it should be ... in an indirect way ... which isn&#x27;t always complied with, and which, following increased pressure from European privacy law, is often not visible to the public.)A Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate would confirm that a certain key is apparently controlled by someone who apparently also controls a certain DNS name. But a code signing certificate would supposedly go further and confirm that it&#x27;s apparently controlled by someone acting on behalf of a certain named legal person existing in a certain jurisdiction. This is much more expensive to verify usefully, although maybe some governments will eventually have a way to automate it.This isn&#x27;t to say that either kind of certificate is necessarily ideal for all of the different uses to which relying parties end up putting it nowadays, but just that what they&#x27;re attesting to, and how you would verify it, is pretty different.Edit: There seems to be a longer discussion about related points in this thread already at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38056024 reply leosarev 2 hours agorootparentI think it would be fine to have code signing certificate ensures that signer controls a certain DNS name.I&#x27;m fine with \"installer have been signed with somebody who owns imagemagick.org\" reply 3c6bYDXLMj 1 hour agorootparentYes, but most people aren’t. It also significantly reduces the usefulness of code signing for the vast majority. And your justification for that is that it personally wouldn’t be a big deal to you, someone that has an abnormal understanding of the technologies at play. reply Rodeoclash 1 hour agoparentprevAnother pain point with this that I just remembered is that Chrome will also complain about the download if it isn&#x27;t signed.

When binaries aren&#x27;t signed Windows will throw up a warning that it isn&#x27;t signed which makes users hesitant to install. reply tsimionescu 3 hours agorootparentprevHow could it not? It is adding software to the system software set, accessible by all users of the system.And many programs require some kind of integration into the OS, such as file type associations or context menu entries, which even a single user shouldn&#x27;t have access to do. reply Too 3 hours agorootparentThis way of working should have been left behind in the previous century.Sandboxing should be default. Associating file endings should be a suggestion to the OS, accepted by the user, not something only configurable by delegating full super admin to third party app.Slow loading context menus where every app tries to claim its presence. Thank you for reminding me why I don’t use Windows since years ago.A image editor should only need to load and save images I ask it to, no other system integration. iOS, Android and the browser has proven it is possible. Now the desktop needs a similar journey. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparent> Sandboxing should be default.Please no. There are valid reasons to NOT sandbox, and in Windows there is sandboxing in default (windows store apps) and there are often issues with those versions of the software. For example, Slack downloaded from the windows store uses 30-40% of your CPU while idle, but not when installed from their website.Even in Linux and using the Snap sandbox (ubuntu), there are significant issues when trying to access globally available software, which can be extremely hard to support and diagnose. reply nolist_policy 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is that sandboxing is an afterthought on these platforms. reply withinboredom 23 minutes agorootparentThat is obvious. Like saying the \"sun is yellow because it is about 4.5 billion years old.\"Even if sandboxing was thought about back when Linus was porting Unix, it would have been extremely slow as processors and ram was very limited back then. If we could go back in time and give them ridiculously fast processors and effectively unlimited ram like we have today, I&#x27;m sure Linux and Windows (er, DOS) would look quite different, and be much slower.Just look at how slow mobile OS&#x27;s are, despite being on ridiculously fast hardware. My Palm Pilot in 1998 felt faster and more responsive than most devices today. Android devices essentially require a human to manage the memory because starting just a few apps uses almost all of it. Even iOS devices can only run a few apps before it starts killing things. Sandboxing has an extremely high cost (with not much to gain), so high that even on modern hardware you start running into physical limits very quickly: memory, disk space, and processing power.Until we can properly share resources in sandboxed apps (or increase the physical limits of the hardware) to a certain point, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to only be able to run a few things on a desktop machine. reply fsflover 14 minutes agorootparentprev> Sandboxing should be defaultThis is exactly how Qubes OS works. My daily driver, can&#x27;t recommend it enough. reply doophus 3 hours agorootparentprevMost software installers on Windows offer the user a \"Install for this user\"&#x2F;\"Install for all users\" option, or will just install to the current user&#x27;s appdata, which doesn&#x27;t require admin rights. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentNot the case for ImageMagick, there are some things that cannot be installed for current user, like Windows services or specific kinds of shell extensions. reply vbezhenar 1 hour agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s HKEY_CURRENT_USER for a reason. reply system2 3 hours agorootparentprevUnrecognized publisher warning in blue box (not UAC) comes up no matter what the software is when trying to install or run. reply Rodeoclash 3 hours agorootparentThis is correct and it usually takes some combination of right clicking the installer or holding shortcuts to bypass. It&#x27;s not obvious how to do so without Googling around. reply Kwpolska 1 hour agorootparentRight clicking is a Mac thing. On Windows, most of the warnings can be bypassed without any special actions (there are two buttons), the SmartScreen warning requires clicking on \"More info\". reply oefrha 2 hours agorootparentprevMoreover, a warning pops up even for signed binaries, until that binary has been installed enough times (?) and Microsoft is satisfied. reply thangalin 2 hours agoprevMy desktop text editor, KeenWrite, uses Wine, rcedit-x64.exe, osslsigncode, and a shell script to sign the Windows binary.

My certificate expires in November 2024 and I&#x27;m undecided what I&#x27;ll do. It was hard enough to get a certificate as a solo developer and not a corporation.Still, though, it should just be a matter of money. The $629&#x2F;year cloud-hosted HSM mentioned in the OP will do it. If you pay that, you can use this procedure to make it work with GitHub Actions with the same sort of signtool or Set-AuthenticodeSignature command that you use now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.digicert.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;software-trust-manager&#x2F;ci-cd-in... reply jborean93 3 hours agorootparentI’ve found the easiest option available here is through using Azure KeyVault to store the keys. I use a custom module to sign my PowerShell scripts and dlls [1] for this because I can integrate it with OIDC to sign the code using the keys stored in the Azure HSM. While the builtin pwsh Set-Authenticode cmdlet can’t do this currently there are other options that rely on Window’s authenticode APIs like AzureSignTool [2] that I highly recommend.While I’m unsure if Azure is suitable for actual companies I think the risk is ok for what I need it for and the API quality as well as OIDC support make it quite nice to use with GHA.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jborean93&#x2F;PowerShell-OpenAuthenticode [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vcsjones&#x2F;AzureSignTool reply electroly 2 hours agorootparentI was looking into Azure Key Vault Managed HSM and it appears to be vastly more expensive than the $629&#x2F;year from Digicert. A Managed HSM Pool is $3.20&#x2F;hour. Am I missing something? reply veeti 2 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t need a HSM, just a HSM backed key. It costs like $5 a month. reply electroly 1 hour agorootparentCan you point me at some more information about the difference? This would seem to be a much better deal than paying Digicert, but I&#x27;m confused about how it can be so cheap? Isn&#x27;t the required for an HSM at all the reason it&#x27;s so much more expensive now at other CAs? reply veeti 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t know what happens under the hood, but presumably a HSM key is on a shared HSM with other people whereas what you&#x27;re talking about will get you a dedicated HSM.We have set up Key Vault for code signing using this and it does work. reply electroly 1 hour agorootparentThanks so much for this. I will dig into this option, and it seems the ImageMagick people have been clued into the same solution. replyjustinclift 3 hours agoprevHas anyone here tried out that SignPath (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signpath.org) thing mentioned in one of the responses?From their website: SignPath Foundation provides reliable code signing for Open Source projects.If it&#x27;s legit, then it could be a useful option. reply orra 2 hours agoparentIt appears legit, in that vim and transmission link back to it.Right now the \"foundation\" is run by the SignPath company. But TBF they say they hope the foundation will eventually scale, and become independent and community run. reply keepamovin 3 hours agoprevIt’s astonishing that a project as critical and widely used as ImageMagick can’t even scrape together $629 for something as essential as a software signature.It’s a glaring example of how the tech industry fails to financially support the very open-source projects that it relies so heavily upon.Despite offering incredible value, these projects often can’t capture enough of it to sustain themselves.It’s a sobering reminder that something significant needs to change in how we approach and value open-source contributions. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agoparent> can’t even scrape together $629 for something as essential as a software signatureI don&#x27;t think the $629 itself is the problem, but rather that they&#x27;re being forced to spend it on something that many people don&#x27;t agree is \"essential\" in any way. Is it about security, or is it about crying \"security\" to push through a pay-to-play market? reply keepamovin 17 minutes agorootparentIt’s a valid point you raise. Certainly conceivable. Whatever the security ramifications, however, the usability consequences are real and important.See my other comment for how i consider this may be cartel behavior: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38056460 reply Derbasti 54 minutes agorootparentprevAnd moreso for a cross-platform tool. Essentially it&#x27;s forcing devs to spend money on the Windows platform only, where they might prefer to spend it in a way that benefits all their users. reply rand846633 3 hours agoparentprevIt’s also not clear why the IM project should be paying MS and not the other way round… reply vasdae 2 hours agorootparentMS does not sell certificates. reply lodovic 3 hours agorootparentprevBut that&#x27;s a thin line. Free certificates negate security.Instead, there are various foundations that sponsor popular open source projects for costs like signing certificates and hosting. I&#x27;m sure one of these should be trustworthy enough to obtain a signing certificate themselves so they can issue and revoke certs to various projects without much cost. reply sime2009 2 hours agorootparentLook at it this way, why should a project like IM pay MicroSoft for the privilege of enriching and adding value to the Windows platform? reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentThe fee for code signing certificates doesn&#x27;t go to Microsoft. reply sime2009 1 hour agorootparentWho actually receives the money is not relevant to my core point. reply kergonath 1 hour agorootparentprevThis does not solve the problem at all, and does not improve security either. Microsoft themselves could perfectly well have the same analysis in-house and provide free certificates to properly vetted projects. Adding layers of middlemen to deal with is a pain in the backside and a consequence is that some projects will just not bother. It’s inefficient on all levels and still does not protect from bad actors. reply serf 3 hours agoparentprevyou see it as a failure of the tech industry to finance open source.I see it as a failure to provide security systems like this without the need for financial gatekeeping.$629.00 isn&#x27;t a trivial amount of money. reply keepamovin 2 hours agorootparentGood point about the size of fees. However, I don’t mostly view the problem as the tech industry failing to fund open source.I think that framing overly emphasizes an existing problem, which is the perception that OSS is sort of a charity. This misperception only reinforces the negative sense of entitlement that people have towards open source.A couple of ways that the sense of entitlement manifests itself is the expectation that OSS should be free and, if money is involved, then it should be in the form of pay-what-you-want donations, or subscriptions, not tied to a specific exchange of value. The concept of funding can encompass this vagueness.The word ‘Transactions’, I think, is a more precise and correct term, as it more clearly relates to desired and sustainable goal of a defined and measured exchange of value.So instead of the issue being merely the providing of funding, rather, I see it as an issue with the open-source community not fully recognizing that it’s an industry in its own right.This lack of awareness hampers its ability to participate effectively in the marketplace, including financial transactions to sustain itself.On another note, I share your view that these fees are troublesome. While I agree that small fees can serve as proof of identity—verifying that the software indeed comes from the claimed source, which seems to be one main intent of signatures—I don’t understand why these fees have to be exorbitant.It seems more like artificial price inflation, perhaps even a form of cartel behavior. reply megraf 3 hours agorootparentprevConsidering the scale of ImageMagick- $629 is a very, very small amount of money considering the value that IM has generated. reply kergonath 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is that available funding is not commensurate with value generated. And the value is in the hands of some companies that have very little incentive to give much of it to the upstream project. reply CogitoCogito 3 hours agorootparentprevHave you considered volunteering to pay for and run the signing infrastructure? reply pentagrama 1 hour agoparentprev$629&#x2F;year reply keepamovin 58 minutes agorootparentSure.

The actual selection and opening of files and other resources should be the job of the operating system. GUI programs should be able to call \"open\" \"save\" and other dialogs to get handles to files, not just their names. The OS should limit access to resources to those it provides (as capability tokens) and nothing else.For CLI programs, the shell should take care of managing parameters in a standard and trustable way, also returning tokens instead of file names.Collectively, we&#x27;re like chicken caught out in a rainstorm... looking up, frozen in panic.

I mean, it&#x27;s cool that you can get a sandboxed program with simple CLI comamnd. It sucks that it&#x27;s completely useless until you figure out how to give it access to the host file system, because guess what, most software that&#x27;s useful for anything other than entertainment needs to interoperate with other software using files.To be fair, Android does it better in that at least the apps can call into system file picker, which lets me simultaneously navigate the host FS and grant the app access to specific files or folders (and it explains what it&#x27;s doing).Still, I&#x27;m worried, because decisions about future OS and platform architectures are increasingly made by people who grew up in the \"apps era\", and likely internalized the misguided idea that \"data produced by a program belongs to that program\", further disempowering the users (including, ultimately, themselves). This is in opposition to the idea that made computing ubiquitous and a tool for people to improve their lives: the idea that data is independent of the software that produced it; that the data files are owned by the user, can be copied and moved around using generic means, and worked on in many different software tools. reply Ayesh 4 hours agoprevNow that GitHub has CI and MSFT money, it would make so much sense for GitHub to become a code signing CA!With npm, you can opt in to have your npm package releases signed, and it took less than five minutes for me to integrate.

The value is in actually asserting authorship & tying it to a legal identity.I&#x27;d assume creating a fake persona &#x2F; faking whatever is required to satisfy the identity checks that come with that $630 is the actual deterrent. If it was cheap to perform the actual identity checks it would still provide this effect. reply ImAnAmateur 4 hours agoprev [–] Any opinions on this tool? I&#x27;ve literally never heard of it before. Seems like it&#x27;s good for simple bulk editing. reply alkonaut 30 minutes agoparentIt parses complex payloads like images in code written using an unsafe language. It’s not an issue using it yourself with your own data but I’d be wary of putting it anywhere in a pipeline where it would be fed user provided data, e.g to generate thumbnails in a backend or similar. reply andreareina 4 hours agoparentprevWhat curl is for network requests, this is for image operations. It is ubiquitous and pretty much a de-facto standard utility. reply throwawaaarrgh 4 hours agoparentprevImageMagick is the most widely used open source image processing library and tool in the world. The source code kinda sucks but it does everything you could want, pretty much reply fodkodrasz 2 hours agorootparentIt is a common source of security vulnerabilities.Also the API is has silly names, uses globals, not really nice, and not really FFI friendly (overcomplicated).Also requires global installation, cannot be deployed side by side with projects.For me it is a solid red flag for any project if they are using ImageMagick&#x2F;GraphicsMagic. I don&#x27;t let it near my computers. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentToo bad it is already there... reply nwallin 1 hour agoparentprevImagemagick is like curl or openssl or ffmpeg or zlib. It&#x27;s almost certainly living as a shared library on your computer somewhere. reply syockit 4 hours agoparentprevTo explain it succinctly, I shall refer you to XKCD #2347 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2347&#x2F; reply prynhart 3 hours agorootparentIndeed! Remember to hover over the XKCD image to see the punchline. reply Lammy 4 hours agoparentprev [–] Try ‘convert’ in your CLI of choice — you might have it installed already. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
