If you want AppArmor or SELinux you still have to configure it yourself.If you want a sandbox on NixOS, your options are still bubblewrap/firejail, proot, or flatpak. Or of course full virtualization with libvirt.The NixOS \"containers\" are just systemd-nspawn which (if I understand correctly) doesn't really offer more security than a properly permissioned user.I suspect that if you installed a malicious binary in a NixOS package, you'd be just as compromised as you would installing something malicious from AUR.replymitchellh 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The Nix store `/nix` is readonly except by the Nix build users. So, if you\u2019re using Nix derivations for everything (the end goal), then rogue processes cannot interfere in any way with files outside of the chroot-like environment the build process creates.The writable directories (your home dir and var, as the parent stated) are still \u201cvulnerable\u201d and a program can run anything they want of course (bound by typical Linux/Unix rules).

But the hashes aren't routinely checked by some kind of hypervisor, and root can still overwrite things in the store.The \"fear of installing software overwriting files you wanted\" essentially comes down to config file management (unhappy accidents) and malware.You should have config file management in git already, so I don't feel like NixOS needs to solve that. I was hoping it would solve the problem of random software being able to obtain root and not ransomware me, but it practically doesn't solve that any better than any other distro.I want to be missing something. I've invested a lot of time learning about Nix for the last week and my system is finally working, but I just got to the sandboxing/security portion of my install and the threat model seems broken.replyxyzzy_plugh 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It seems like you misinterpreted the isolation that's advertised. There are security benefit but the isolation provided is predominantly about deterministic and reproducible runtime environments.There's nothing particularly novel happening at the OS level compared to, say, Debian, but the difference is in how you arrived at the current state. You're free to sprinkle whatever other security bits you are fond of.replythrowing_away 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> deterministic and reproducible runtime environmentsBut is there a point to having what you believe are deterministic and reproducible runtimes if the environment used to build them doesn't protect against malware in a build from escaping into the build system?replyzaphar 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There are multiple non security reasons to want deterministic and reproducible runtime environments.1.

Then even if you compromise a given nixos instance, they store stays isolated and intact.So then if you are doing things right, you should be able to optionally back up any mutable data you need and then blow away the entire instance from scratch, creating a new one immediately after.And bonus points if you can run a UEFI-over-HTTPS image on boot so that your boot image and config are always being delivered (and signed) fresh from a locked down server you control. That way if you want, on boot all nix-store content is validated with `nix store verify --all` before ever being loaded in any trusted context.replytripdout 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]\"rolling back\" an Ubuntu update? Considering how atomic rollbacks work on NixOS, what do you mean by this in the context of Ubuntu?replythrowing_away 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If you update ubuntu or arch and something breaks, you have to look at `dpkg.log` or `pacman.log` to see what updated, and then you might need to grab an old package from the archive and manually install it.replypxc 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> But the impression the community gives is very much that you can always rollback and everything is in its own sandbox, which is sort of true, but not at all true as soon as malware happens.I can see why if you do malware research or something like that, you might hear about the rollbacks capability and get your hopes up in a certain way, but that's not really the use case.NixOS is nice for running untrusted/suspect software in a few ways I can think of, though. (They don't exactly make NixOS a security tool, but I think maybe you could leverage them to build one.)1. If a NixOS system is compromised, blowing it away and installing from clean media is cheap compared to on other operating systems, since you can retain more of your special configuration. Reinstalling is a bit more like a snapshot restore, at least in terms of the systemwide setup (users, running services and their configurations, and installed packages).2. NixOS does make it really easy to spin up a clone of your running configuration in a VM instead of directly switching to that config on the local system.3. The Nix sandbox is a pretty nice place to perform builds from big repos where packages can run arbitrary hooks at build time, like PyPI and NPM, since you can have it build in chroots with temporary build users, no network access, and maybe some other nice things.There is also actually at least one Nix-based OS trying to achieve new things in security research out there, Spectrum: https://spectrum-os.org/> I'm surprised at the amount of effort people are expending for just this feature with no additional security.NixOS (and Nix more generally) doesn't have a singular feature like that driving its usage or development forward, even though rollbacks is a really nice one that will often come to mind when you ask NixOS users what they like about running NixOS.But if I had to name contenders for the top one or two 'biggest differentiators' from other tools/paradigms that let you achieve similar effects, like other configuration management systems or copy-on-write filesystem snapshotting, I'd say it's the totalizing way that NixOS integrates those features.Because NixOS generates the configuration of the whole system, it gets to avoid having to inspect most of the system's state, and generally handles the bits of transitioning between configurations that do require inspecting and reasoning about the state of the system quickly and pretty well. There's just a smaller surface area there.Similarly, you're just more likely to be able to easily roll back with NixOS because those features are built into all of the normal system/package management operations, and leveraging those things is generally the path of least resistance to changing the system. You end up being able to count on them more 'by default'\u2014 you're much less likely to make an important change and have a gap without a snapshot. The garbage collection system makes clearing the unused ones data easier (imo). The general reproducibility also gives you multiple sort of layers of intervention for rolling back\u2014 even if you do collect all your past generations, your version control system becomes another reliable way of 'rolling back'. Both of those ways of going back and forth through iterations of your configuration can be further combined with similar interventions at other layers, like dotfile management via Home Manager, snapshotting filesystems for unmanaged files, selective persistence via something like Impermanence, etc. These things can add up a system where the kind of ad-hoc changes that might leak through your state management tools (snapper, etckeeper, dotfile management, etc.) become a radical departure from the way you regularly work.Another differentiator here is maybe the generality: when you Nixify, you sometimes have to do a lot of work up front just to get things working on any deployment target, but the marginal work to go from a NixOS setup to some other kind\u2014 generating identical container images, preparing a VM for local use, running your config on macOS, partially sharing your desktop configuration with a server, letting a friend or colleague experiment with or debug your exact setup, preparing an AMI, etc.\u2014 is lower, and decreases with each further investment you make in the Nix universe. Different aspects of that inevitably end up being valuable, impressive, or delightful to different users. Taken alone, none of them might seem incomparably compelling over alternative approaches.replycookiengineer 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I can recommend reading the systemd manual entries (e.g. man systemd.exec).SystemD meanwhile has a lot of options for managing a seccomp based sandbox, e.g. various protect options for the filesystem, mounting critical things as read-only, simulating a chroot with its own fake-root user etc.pp.You can also manage the capabilities of a binary from there, so it's actually integrated down the kernel stack.However, as you mentioned, the lack of an official \"profile database\" for common packages/software makes it just as useless as the other tools.I wish we had a repo where all the things come together and people can just do something like \"autosandbox apache2\" and it will do the rest.replyD_Sam 43 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Sorry\u2026 I see no other way to contact you.

The user can then \"commit\" those changes (in which case I assume the command writes them from the overlayfs to the actual rootfs)Everything that does not happen on the filesystem (e.g. a network call) won't be \"tried\", it will just happen.Is that about right?replyevgpbfhnr 9 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]yes; the mount doesn't need root access because of user namespaces (which is one of the linux features with the most vulnerabilities next to BPF, but it's also quite handy...)the sandbox is just a directory with the overlayfs content (whole new files for modified files, whiteouts for removals); there's some bugs e.g. removing a directory will create a whiteout that the apply script will try to rm without -r, and there's a handful of other failure modes I can think of (really doing network etc), but for simple commands it's a nice idea.replyKRAKRISMOTT 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]What about the checkinstall command?

This is great if you already know that \u201cstateful disk access\u201d is the only thing the command does!It would be interesting to think about how/whether to extend this to stateful network access. What would happen if I used try on a command that does something like create a GitHub pull request? Right now I believe the pull request gets created regardless of whether I commit the file system changes at the end. Some alternatives:1. Block all network access, because the tool can\u2019t reliably reason about what could be happening.2. Block all network access, except accesses that look like HTTP GET requests (and maybe HEAD/OPTIONS requests).3. Attempt to build some sort of request replay mechanism, so that if a command\u2019s results aren\u2019t committed, but the command is ~immediately re-run with slightly different options, HTTP responses for requests identical to those from the previous attempt are re-used without making the request a second time.Obviously all three have downsides in terms of how useful/complex/brittle they make the command.

If you undo a configuration change and in the meantime a background process has acted on the new configuration, how do you roll that back? Rewinding the timeline is one thing, but maybe throwing out all the work that happened with the wrong configuration is even worse than the status quo.From the top of my head I am thinking about accidentally changing retention windows or bash history max size where the data loss is super indirect and you'd have to hunt down the undo button for a completely different process, or changing a log format so you end up with a file that's mixed json and plain text logs.(Of course, \"try\" presumably applying the changes in a completely synthetic way after the fact could be its entire own can of worms in a very dynamic system if there's a risk changes are applied in the wrong order or skipping some atomicity dance.)replyziml77 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Fully agreed on this. The simple, default way of doing anything should be able to be undone. Hell, years ago Google even figured out how to give people an undo button on email! Yes, it's just a simple time delay but it makes such a huge difference because of how your state of mind changes between typing an email and hitting send. Or hell, maybe you just accidentally hit the send button.Undo allows you to make the default behavior for every operation to be to just go and do it (or queue it up to be done). No need to have a confirmation that the user is going to quickly become conditioned to pressing yes on while also being just an annoyance 99% of the time.replyarcanemachiner 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]We should also build a space elevator and figure out nuclear fusion.

If I had a magic wand and I could create an ideal shell experience, I'd love it if you could soft-execute a script in a notebook style environment where each command can be inspected and tweaked before committing the change. It feels like shells are still incredibly constrained and that they haven't evolved that much since the 90s.The defaults are kind of crazy as well. Every OS should ship with a `trash` binary that puts a file in the Trash without actually deleting it, rather than recommending `rm`. I get some people are perfectly happy to play without guard rails, but I'm sure some of us would like a few more guard rails which we can tweak.I think another similar innovation is how with NixOS you're supposed to be able to diff system changes between upgrades with ease. Which makes sense, since your OS config is usually based on the vendor default with a bunch of changes applied on top.replykzrdude 11 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Linux/Gnome has \"gio trash\" as the trash command.

Better have backups before \"trying\" anything you can't undo or has side-effects. You generally should have backups, configuration management, monitoring, and minimize attended commands issued and log them. Attended fiddling is the path to entropy and problems.replySzpadel 3 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]oh,I actually implemented something similar few days ago, I was doing rpm build script to make repository on s3. repo is mounted with rclone and I'm using overlaysfs to make staging area where I can add new rpms while those are build and update repo metadata, but without risking that if at one point something fails to build i get inconsistent state (eg build succeeds for x86 but failed for aarch64). i when whole build process succeeded then I'm using rclone sync to commit changes back to s3replythrowawaaarrgh 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]It's certainly a neat idea, I like where it's coming from. I think it might be better if we just had an easier way to checkpoint and restore systems, so you don't have to \"try\" anything, you just \"do\", and ideally we have a very reliable way to just... Go back 2 minutes in time if something goes wrong. Something that isn't painful or slow and does work intuitively.Filesystem checkpointing/snapshotting can take care of most of the ability to restore a system after a big problem. The next best thing is something like process checkpointing, and after that would be checkpointing a whole system's processes, which would be much more complicated and perhaps not worth it.replyquesera 8 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Filesystem checkpointing/snapshotting is one of the nice things about ZFS.If the OS supports ZFS on boot drives, you can do checkpointed full system/kernel upgrades.I like your idea about process checkpointing.

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36457557",
    "content": "alexharriWhy doesn't TypeScript properly type Object.keys?June 24, 2023If you've written TypeScript for a while, you've probably run into this:interface Options { hostName: string; port: number;}function validateOptions (options: Options) { Object.keys(options).forEach(key => {  if (options[key] == null) {    Expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type 'Options'.         throw new Error(`Missing option ${key}`);  } });}This error seems nonsensical. We're using the keys of options to access options. Why doesn't TypeScript just figure this out?We can somewhat trivially circumvent this by casting Object.keys(options) to (keyof typeof options)[].const keys = Object.keys(options) as (keyof typeof options)[];keys.forEach(key => { if (options[key] == null) {  throw new Error(`Missing option ${key}`); }});But why is this a problem in the first place?If we visit the type definition for Object.keys, we see the following:// typescript/lib/lib.es5.d.tsinterface Object { keys(o: object): string[];}The type definition is very simple. Accepts object and returns string[].Making this method accept a generic parameter of T and return (keyof T)[] is very easy.class Object { keys<T extends object>(o: T): (keyof T)[];}If Object.keys were defined like this, we wouldn't have run into the type error.It seems like a no brainer to define Object.keys like this, but TypeScript has a good reason for not doing so. The reason has to do with TypeScript's structural type system.Structural typing in TypeScriptTypeScript complains when properties are missing or of the wrong type.function saveUser(user: { name: string, age: number }) {}const user1 = { name: \"Alex\", age: 25 };saveUser(user1); // OK!const user2 = { name: \"Sarah\" };saveUser(user2);     Property 'age' is missing in type { name: string }.   const user3 = { name: \"John\", age: '34' };saveUser(user3);     Types of property 'age' are incompatible. Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.   However, TypeScript does not complain if we provide extraneous properties.function saveUser(user: { name: string, age: number }) {}const user = { name: \"Alex\", age: 25, city: \"Reykjav\u00edk\" };saveUser(user); // Not a type errorThis is the intended behavior in structural type systems. Type A is assignable to B if A is a superset of B (i.e. A contains every property in B).However, if A is a proper superset of B (i.e. A has more properties than B), thenA is assignable to B, butB is not assignable to A.Note: In addition to needing to be a superset, property-wise, the types of the properties also matter.This is all quite abstract, so let's take a look at a concrete example.type A = { foo: number, bar: number };type B = { foo: number };const a1: A = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };const b1: B = { foo: 3 };const b2: B = a1;const a2: A = b1;   Property 'bar' is missing in type 'B' but required in type 'A'.  They key takeaway is that when we have an object of type T, all we know about that object is that it contains at least the properties in T.We do not know whether we have exactly T, which is why Object.keys is typed the way it is. Let's take an example.Unsafe usage of Object.keysSay that we're creating an endpoint for a web service that creates a new user. We have an existing User interface that looks like so:interface User { name: string; password: string;}Before we save a user to the database, we want to ensure that the user object is valid.name must be non-empty.password must be at least 6 characters.So we create a validators object that contains a validation function for each property in User:const validators = { name: (name: string) => name.length < 1  ? \"Name must not be empty\"  : \"\", password: (password: string) => password.length < 6  ? \"Password must be at least 6 characters\"  : \"\",};We then create a validateUser function to run a User object through these validators:function validateUser(user: User) { // Pass user object through the validators}Since we want to validate each property in user, we can iterate through the properties in user using Object.keys:function validateUser(user: User) { let error = \"\"; for (const key of Object.keys(user)) {  const validate = validators[key];  error ||= validate(user[key]); } return error;}Note: There are type errors in this code block which I'm hiding for now. We'll get to them later.The problem with this approach is that the user object might contain properties not present in validators.interface User { name: string; password: string;}function validateUser(user: User) {}const user = { name: 'Alex', password: '1234', email: \"alex@example.com\",};validateUser(user); // OK!Even though User does not specify an email property, this is not a type error because structural typing allows extraneous properties to be provided.At runtime, the email property will cause validator to be undefined and throw an error when invoked.for (const key of Object.keys(user)) { const validate = validators[key]; error ||= validate(user[key]);      TypeError: 'validate' is not a function.    }Luckily for us, TypeScript emitted type errors before this code had a chance to run.for (const key of Object.keys(user)) { const validate = validators[key];          Expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{ name: ..., password: ... }'.         error ||= validate(user[key]);           Expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type 'User'.     }We now have our answer for why Object.keys is typed the way it is. It forces us to acknowledge that objects may contain properties that the type system is not aware of.With our newfound knowledge of structural typing and its pitfalls, let's take a look at how we can effectively use structural typing to our benefit.Making use of structural typingStructural typing provides a lot of flexibility. It allows interfaces to declare exactly the properties which they need. I want to demonstrate this by walking through an example.Imagine that we've written a function that parses a KeyboardEvent and returns the shortcut to trigger.function getKeyboardShortcut(e: KeyboardEvent) { if (e.key === \"s\" && e.metaKey) {  return \"save\"; } if (e.key === \"o\" && e.metaKey) {  return \"open\"; } return null;}To make sure that the code works as expected, we write some unit tests:expect(getKeyboardShortcut({ key: \"s\", metaKey: true })) .toEqual(\"save\");expect(getKeyboardShortcut({ key: \"o\", metaKey: true })) .toEqual(\"open\");expect(getKeyboardShortcut({ key: \"s\", metaKey: false })) .toEqual(null);Looks good, but TypeScript complains:getKeyboardShortcut({ key: \"s\", metaKey: true });          Type '{ key: string; metaKey: true; }' is missing the following properties from type 'KeyboardEvent': altKey, charCode, code, ctrlKey, and 37 more.              Ugh. Specifying all 37 additional properties would be super noisy, so that's out of the question.We could resolve this by casting the argument to KeyboardEvent:getKeyboardShortcut({ key: \"s\", metaKey: true } as KeyboardEvent);But that could mask other type errors that may be occuring.Instead, we can update getKeyboardShortcut to only declare the properties it needs from the event.interface KeyboardShortcutEvent { key: string; metaKey: boolean;}function getKeyboardShortcut(e: KeyboardShortcutEvent) {}The test code now only needs to satisfy this more minimal interface, which makes it less noisy.Our function is also less coupled to the global KeyboardEvent type and can be used in more contexts. It's much more flexible now.This is possible because of structural typing. A KeyboardEvent is assignable to KeyboardShortcutEvent because it is a superset, even though KeyboardEvent has 37 unrelated properties.window.addEventListener(\"keydown\", (e: KeyboardEvent) => { const shortcut = getKeyboardShortcut(e); // This is OK! if (shortcut) {  execShortcut(shortcut); }});This idea is explored in this fantastic post by Evan Martin: Interfaces generally belong with users. I highly recommend giving it a read! It changed how I write and think about TypeScript code.This post generated a lot of interesting discussions on Hacker News. If this post was interesting, I recommend taking a look.",

The majority of our code is oriented around JSON-serializable discriminated union types. In my benchmarking, transcoding to/from Map<K, V> to Record<K, V> doesn't seem worth the effort.So, we Map for in-memory only data organization and some framework stuff but most engineers tend to interact much more with persisted data and thus Record types.replyrcfox 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Does it catch if you attempt to use a more complex type as a key?

Then union types don't quite work as expected anymore either.I'm pretty happy with the status quo: Object.keys() is unsafe, so either cast your way around it and let the cast be the signal that you're doing something unsafe, or handle unexpected keys explicitly.replywilliamdclt 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Having a generic, easy way to strip off the extra attributes (immutably), that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.

For sum types it seems to be the opposite (co-variance), so structural typing is easier.Which reminds me of an idea I've had for a while regarding object oriented inheritance. Why is inheritance always approached in a contra-variant manner? I have frequently wished that inheritance could be conceptualized as a narrowing, rather than expansion, of type. For example, consider an \"Animal\" object class, which has a \"numLegs\" attribute. Then \"Dog\" could inherit from \"Animal\" by having exactly 4 legs, as a special case.I'm not sure whether this concept has been implemented in any language, but I've encountered situations where it would have been the perfect way to model entities, frequently enough, that I believe it could be very useful.replycomex 12 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I'm not an expert in type theory, but something like Scala's path-dependent types might work. In the following example (which I copy-pasted from [1]), every object of type Foo has some associated type Bar. You can have multiple objects that are all of type Foo, and they might have different Bar types. Therefore, to refer to a Bar type, you have to reference the specific variable you're talking about \u2013 such as in \"f1.Bar\" below, where f1 is a variable name, not a type name.  trait Foo{   class Bar   def doNothing(b: Bar){}  }  val f1 = new Foo{}  val b1 = new f1.Bar()  val f2 = new Foo{}  val b2 = new f2.Bar()  f1.doNothing(b1) //fine  f1.doNothing(b2) //won't compileApplying the same idea to TypeScript, you could imagine using 'keyof' on values instead of types. So instead of  keys<T extends object>(o: T): (keyof T)[];it would be something like  keys(o: object): (keyof o)[];And the keys returned for an object would only let you index into that specific object, not any other object even if it had the same type.[1] https://wheaties.github.io/Presentations/Scala-Dep-Types/dep...replyconsilient 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> For those that are well versed in type theory, what is the neatest solution to this in language design, if there is one at all?Row-polymorphism instead of structural subtyping.The idea is that instead of treating `Record<,>` as parameterized by two ordinary types, you parameterize it with a single type-level collection of key-value pairs, and then write functions which are generic over parts of that collection. So the equivalent of a typescript function that works fine over open records would look something like this `<Rest>(obj: { SomeRow, Rest }) => { SomeRow, Rest }`, whereas `(obj: { SomeRow }) => { SomeRow }` says you can't have any extra entries and `<Rest>(obj: { SomeRow, Rest }) => { SomeRow }` says you can have extra entries but they're getting thrown out.This also lets you reuse machinery between records and sums more easily, since sums are also realizations of rows.Purescript and OCaml have good row type support.

Coming from other languages you might think TypeScript can add a `throws` type annotation so caller can expect the type of error in the `catch` block. Something like this:  function parse(input: string): string, throws SyntaxError {}However in JavaScript we can not guarantee that when calling `parse` the only error you might get is the error that this function throws. So there is no point in adding type annotationreplyasynchronous 20 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]If typescript had better errors then I probably would support it more as a development language.

Non-ennumerable properties and Symbol-keyed properties aren't included (on the off chance that's even relevant). That's it. It's not rocket science.This article is complete nonsense. \"What if there's no e-mail validator!\", then write one? Or don't try and validate an e-mail? Like ?????? How do you not know what properties the object you're validating can have? Is this seriously how these devs operate? Just write some code with no idea what data is coming into it and no desire whatsoever to iron that out before continuing?6 months with a dynamic language, if you actually bother to learn how to code, and you'll start reading and writing code in such a way that it's blatantly obvious what every type is. I cringe when I see people say stuff like \"Typescript forces you to think about types!\", in practice it's the complete opposite. There's a basically perfect correlation between devs I've worked with that like TS and those that have no idea what's going on with their code and constantly need to bug the other developers for help.I was gobsmacked the first time I looked over a TS dev's shoulder and saw them trying to make changes without actually reading any of the code first.

Gotcha.As to your problem: Use \u02cb... as HTMLInputElement\u02cb if Typescript wasn't able to narrow your type sufficiently, or you believe that the value of typing this case isn't worth the effort. This should be somewhat rare.Use \u02cb... as unknown as HTMLInputElement\u02cb, if your idea of the variable is completely different from Typescript. But at that point you likely _have_ made a mistake somewhere.Use \u02cb...: any\u02cb if you want to completely turn off checking. In most projects, this has to be explicitly specified for each parameter and declaration.It gets more verbose, the more unsafe your code is.replyrcfox 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's impossible to try to debug your problem with so little to go on. Maybe the type was unioned with something incompatible. At some points, you need to resort to runtime type checking: `if (x instanceof HTMLInputElement) { // TS will know it's a HTMLInputElement at this point } `Enabling Typescript on an existing, untyped project is going to be rough to start. You'll need to gradually increase the strictness levels and perhaps work on typing one module at a time. With an entirely new project, start with maximum strictness, and things will come together much easier. You might need to learn to do things in new ways to make it easier to work with TS, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.Certainly, 1 hour to attempt to use any new technology is way too little time. I'd say a minimum of a week of honest effort with a new toy project is warranted before deciding whether it's not for you.replyexplaininjs 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev [\u2013]Just type (\u2026 as HTMLInputElement) and be done with it.

Several frontends, including extremely lightweight clients exist for this API.Mastodon furthermore implements the whole server-server ActivityPub standard, which can be used for some actions, like following someone, just fine. This is a very well described standard.Mastodon doesn't implement ActivityPub server-client standard, instead it has the aforementioned selfbrewn \"rest\" API. Which, IMO is a shame, and has caused all clients (mobile, web, etc) to rely on this nonstandard API.Edit: the point being:there are several ways to get content from Mastodon, depending on usecase and needs.

By which I mean, the client, like an e-mail app, has to download and manage most data from the server. From my understanding that's the only way to make anything like search or username autocomplete or even a notifications tab to work with the C2S at all. In my experience, app developers are generally not excited to do that kind of legwork, and we're entering the kind of P2P territory which comes with its own challenges like the ease of hopping from one device to another, or the fact that to have the same functionality in iOS, Android, and Web, you would need to recreate the heavy-lifting fundamental boilerplate in each separately.

It's only a small subset that existed under the FIDO name before webauthn was designed and was basically grandfathered in. But it's not really what webauthn is about.In full passwordless mode you insert the token, enter its pincode and touch it to login. No username nor password needed. It's a bit like a bank card.Not many sites support this method, for example Paypal only supports normal old FIDO1 2FA (and only one token which is ridiculous).

If the allocation is bigger than the offset to the guard page, and the start of the allocation is accessed before the end, you get this. An attacker might even be able to generate a non-faulting memory access pointing at somebody else's buffer.I think it's on the language implementation to understand what that offset might be and generate benign memory access on large stack allocations, allowing the kernel to fault and intervene.

That's why the feature and the protocol were removed and they haven't been added back.I think it's rather silly to first ignore the calls to opt into the protocol popup, then remove it completely because there were too many complaints about the protocol popup, and now refuse to add it back because of \"bad UX\".replyfdgdd 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Open With, although it's no longer maintained: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/open-with/reply2Gkashmiri 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]https://ibb.co/v4pw6rw This URL actually resolves in my android fedilab app so don't know if this has hardcodrd instances or uses regex.

One other possibility: if you use spread syntax to call a function with a large array (eg `foo(...Array(20000))`), then all those arguments will be pushed on the stack.(I didn't dig into the specifics of the Google code because, as weird as it is to have 20000 stack values, we really should be able to handle it.

This has been an issue in the last two months and I don't know what's wrong...Also, does anybody known why Firefox still depends on the deprecated libdbus-glib-1-2 [1] in Debian and based distros?For example, try to uninstall the package. Then download the latest Firefox from their website [2]. Extract the archive, launch the executable inside it from a terminal.

It only happens after I've had the browser open for weeks, with at least 3 windows open at once, and literally hundreds of open tabs with hundreds more come and gone since Firefox was restarted. I have about:memory bookmarked, and hitting everything in the Free Memory box seems to delay the inevitable a bit while allowing Javascript seems to make it worse.

I realise there is a bit of tongue in cheek in there and Firefox is an amazing product, but although it's certainly not normal for a function to declare 20k variables it is not outside the realm of the language. Furthermore, 20k is not that much if you take the amounts of RAM current devices have.Don't get me wrong. I don't think assigning blame is the most important thing to do when troubleshooting. I'd rather not, but when that process starts it should be factual.So, sorry, its not Google's fault... Then we also throw Linux under the bus. \"it's not our code, it's Linus\" here is the code. But, that Linux kernel code that kills a process if it accesses too far from it's stack pointer has the following comment:\"Accessing the stack below %sp is always a bug (...)\"I haven't got time to look at the history how it was changed and why in the Linux kernel and it became \"not a bug\". If someone knows more, please do explain.So is it a \"bug in Firefox\" Or \"bug in old Linux\"? I can't say with absolute certainty without researching how exactly the stack allocation in old Linux kernel works, how is it documented etc.So if anything I'd thank Google for exposing the bug ;-)On a side note, I've recently experienced a similar JS/firefox/web site bug. There is this open-source ecommerce software called shopware. They use symfony (yes, PHP i know...) and the most recent major version simply freezes Firefox when one goes to the admin interface and looses connectivity. Not just freezing one tab, no, freezes entire Firefox, multiple open windows. This is on up to date Arch with a new Linux kernel so it's definitely not this issue,but it does happen in Firefox and not in Chrome.JavaScript bugs like this are hard to find. I think AI may be one tool that will help us find them faster (intentionally or not).replyoutwit 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]It does seem to me that Google is intentionally refusing to test their websites in anything other than Chrome. Even without AI... It can afford to pay a handful of people to test in Firefox and Safari. But will it?replydb48x 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]To be fair this crash is only happening with older kernels. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to test their website in every version of Firefox running on every version of the Linux kernel. Not even Mozilla does that.replyjacquesm 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]No, it's Google's fault. You test for compatibility if you serve 100's of millions of users with all major browsers, including those of your competitors.replyRoark66 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If a tab crashed I would be sympathetic to this point of view, but the entire browser is killed. So no, it's not google's fault in my book.As for testing. Really, you expect them to test against Linux Kernel 4? If so, how about 2 as well?Just in case you didn't realise. Kernel 4.20 (the one that changes this behaviour so it wouldn't show the Firefox bug) was released in December 2018. That's 4.5 years ago.replyrvz 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Exactly. That's even worse since the entire browser is crashing. Its not Google's fault if Firefox was unable to prevent a crash or display the page when Safari, Chrome, etc can load and run it without crashing.Once the user sees this crash constantly, switches to Chrome and it doesn't crash, then they blame the crashing browser which is Firefox. Rightly so.Really says a lot about these Firefox developers and users immediately blaming Google for their JS code when Firefox was supposed to protect or handle against cases like this without crashing.replydb48x 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Mozilla isn\u2019t blaming Google here, or they wouldn\u2019t have bothered to fix the bug. When you drill down to the root cause of something, you have to carefully note down all the proximate causes that you found along the way, otherwise you won\u2019t have a complete understanding of the problem. In particular, noticing that Google\u2019s machine\u2013generated javascript is doing something allowed but out of the ordinary is important for explaining why you only just now found out about this bug in code that has been working just fine for years.replydb48x 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Notice that this only crashes on an out\u2013of\u2013date kernel. No matter how much money Google has, you cannot expect them to test their websites in every combination of browser and kernel version. Not even on a handful of carefully\u2013selected kernel versions. Maybe Mozilla should test Firefox on more kernel versions (an argument could perhaps be made for testing the older kernels from various distros with long\u2013term support, for instance), but really the whole reason Firefox has crash reporting is to catch the really weird combinations that happen in real life but are hard to continuously test for.replyBenjiWiebe 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Oddly enough, I've had a lot of issues with Firefox on Windows crashing with OOM issues in spite of having GBs of free memory.

It was required in Windows 95 for 32-bit applications, and you'd do that on a page (4k) granularity.I am still in the dark as to what the bug was here. Did Firefox stop doing probes for JIT code? Not do them at all, because most JS stack frames are small?replydb48x 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]Firefox was probing ahead in increments of 2048 bytes in order to ensure that the stack was allocated, but it left the stack pointer at the end of the stack for that whole time. This usually worked ok, but certain versions of Linux will bail if the stack probe is greater than 64kb+256b away from the stack pointer. The new code moves the stack pointer incrementally so that the probe is never more than a single page from the stack pointer.https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/rMOZILLACENTRAL304d...replygigel82 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Interestingly, Mozilla openly talks about their telemetry telling them not only about the spike in crashes but apparently also about the specific website and activity users are doing at the time of the crash (Google Image Search).That's pretty wild, I need to look deeper into how to disable telemetry reporting in Mozilla. I'm pretty sure even Microsoft is sanitizing their crash reports to exclude as much information as possible that could identify the user.replymsla 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]I use the Firefox from the Ubuntu Mozilla Team's PPA and I haven't seen any crashes at all.https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/ubuntu/ppareplypb82 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Using Google Maps causes Firefox (114.0.2) and the whole OS to completely freeze within minutes on my Laptop.

Older versions still work but all new (post 97) versions freeze up at the drop of a hat.replyim3w1l 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]This sounds like blameshifting to me. Javascript is untrusted code, so it's on Firefox to make sure to handle any craziness gracefully.Stack probing is kind of a weird thing though. I'm kind of surprised C++ compiler isn't doing that properly. Are they using inline assembly for speed?replydb48x 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]It would only be shifting the blame if they weren\u2019t going to work around the problem in Firefox itself.The C++ compiler may or may not implement stack probing correctly, but this bug is in the Javascript JIT compiler. The fix is to make the JIT compiler update the stack pointer register each time through the loop so that if a page fault happens the kernel won\u2019t see a huge amount of stack get allocated all in one go. Instead it\u2019ll see several page faults each asking for a smaller amount which it is happy to grant.See https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/rMOZILLACENTRAL304d...replyfathyb 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Agreed that the problem here is Firefox, untrusted JS code should not cause a crash.For the probing, according to the code:  // Can't push large frames blindly on windows, so we must touch frame memory  // incrementally, with no more than 4096 - 1 bytes between touches.  //  // This is used across all platforms for simplicity.https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c936f47f3a629ae49a...replyusr1106 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Technically of course Firefox failed to live with an old kernel and insane JS code.Morally it's Google. Google is like Bitcoin. A huge natural ressource hog for a questionable benefit. Here the benefit is tracking users to make advertising billions. For that goal a billion of smart phones need several extra GB of memory an significantly larger batteries. What is the ecological footprint of that?Typing on a seven year old smart phone with 2 GB (SailfishOS, so yes it is maintained. Maybe not perfectly, but better than many Androids half as old). It works quite well on reasonable pages even without add blocking. Of course super heavy pages won't work and for Google search I haven't even consented. Occasionally I get reminded of that when some site embeds it. Well, a good reminder for me not to use them.replyfathyb 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This does not appear that crazy to me. In fact, today it's almost a recommended practice for large web applications and it's called \"tree shaking\". ECMAScript modules are inlined into the same scope. It makes the JIT work easier because it now works with symbols instead of `require(foo).bar` calls to speculate on. It makes most web apps run better, both in bandwidth and compute.It's very likely to have affected users on other websites, but Google is a common denominator for debugging.My uneducated guess: they're using the Google Closure Compiler to make smaller JavaScript bundles. It saves some bandwidth and allows for better optimizations. It seems like a reasonable engineering decision to ensure product decisions don't affect the user experience too negatively, something a lot of us are familiar with..replyIzkata 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> In fact, today it's almost a recommended practice for large web applications and it's called \"tree shaking\".

Technically and especially economically this makes sense for Google. But the environmental footprint is outsourced to client devices. Greenwashing in a way. Avoidance of computing is a better solution than all types of optimizations. Not everything that is technically feasible is good for the planet and mankind.replyveave 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Nice rant. Absolutely unrelated to the technical article at hand, but nice rant.replyim3w1l 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah I got that far but then I wasn't sure what exactly that was doing. Normal C++ doesn't directly move stack pointers around and do manual probing, so I was idly wondering whether those calls hid some inline assembly or how they worked.Edit: Or perhaps that is not the stack of the C++ program but rather than stack of the Javascript program.replyIainIreland 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]In general, there's no difference between the stack of the C++ program and the stack of the JS program. When SpiderMonkey just-in-time compiles a JS function, the result is native code that creates a stack frame on the same stack as the C++ code that implements SpiderMonkey. JS code and C++ code can be semi-arbitrarily interleaved on the stack: JS calls C++ calls JS calls C++...The one exception about sharing the same stack is that the first few iterations of a function run in an interpreter implemented in C++, and that interpreter has its own stack that we heap-allocate. This particular bug occurred during the transition from the C++ interpreter to JIT code.replyfathyb 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It does hide some assembly. Those calls are calling an assembler to generate native code at runtime for JIT compilation. The C++ compiler compiles an assembler, but this assembler runs at runtime. `MacroAssembler` itself is architecture independent, and calls into functions implemented in back-ends such as `MacroAssemblerARM` and `MacroAssemblerX64`.So the code in this function is not performing the stack-probing, it generates code to perform it instead.replyjandrese 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm curious what Firefox could have done in this case beyond just killing off the tab. The issue was a check in old kernels that was being triggered by some insane code.This example had me remembering the discussion from earlier today about why modern code is so slow even though the machines are so fast. I doubt there were many Win32 programs that attempted to pass in 20,000 parameters to a function.replyclassified 1 day ago | prev [\u2013]They're probably rolling out a new ad engine.

    "content": "Take action! Protect end-to-end encryptionby Miriam Bastian \u2014 Published on Jun 21, 2023 06:12 PMHow do we counter the dangers resulting from the ongoing, worldwide legislation like Chat control, the EARN IT Act, and the so-called \"Online Safety Bill\" that threatens end-to-end encryption, and privacy in general? Take action! Write a letter to the appropriate agencies to let them know that you value your privacy and the privacy of the people around you, and remind them of their duty to protect it.In our introduction to this series of articles on privacy, we highlighted how, although we may have nothing to hide, we do have everything to protect. We asked you to help strengthen end-to-end encryption by using it, and we listed various free software tools that you can use and share. This article is the second part of this series, and it targets the question of how to counter the dangers resulting from the ongoing, worldwide legislation that threatens end-to-end encryption, and privacy in general. The list is long: Chat control in the EU, the EARN IT Act in the US, and the so-called \"Online Safety Bill\" in the UK all require a backdoor that would allow companies and governments to monitor end-to-end encrypted communication. The STOP CSAM Act, introduced in the US Congress in April, tries to hold end-to-end encryption providers liable for the hosting of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and opens the door for civil lawsuits against platforms for facilitating the distribution of CSAM if they refuse to give law enforcement the keys to decrypt user communications.Meanwhile, India's new cybersecurity order CERT-In is driving VPN services and other privacy-concerned internet service providers out of the country because it requires the providers to keep logs of users. In Australia, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act (TOLA) from 2018 already allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies to request or demand assistance from communications providers to access encrypted communications. The fact that the TOLA Act provides the legal standing to decrypt messages led to a collaboration between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police and thereby granted the FBI power it has long desired to have in its domestic territory. In 2021, the Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Act added even broader powers to this which allow the Australian Federal Police to modify data on accounts or devices of suspects, no matter if they are encrypted or not. But departmental representatives still claim end-to-end encryption is detrimental to public safety. The example of Australia shows that giving way to the claims of those who prioritize illusory safety over privacy is no option. They won't stop after passing one bill. On the contrary, they will demand you to surrender your fundamental right to privacy bit by bit, more and more.Take actionIt is important to let the representatives of your government know that end-to-end encryption is vital even if there is no ongoing legislation threatening end-to-end encryption in your area or even if your country has already passed a bill that weakens it. Write a letter to the appropriate agencies to let them know that you value your privacy and the privacy of the people around you, and remind them of their duty to protect it. Below are sample letters that you can adapt to your needs.Post your letter on social media to inspire others to do the same. Others might especially benefit from letters that are adapted to the specific legislation of your country and/or translated into your mother tongue. If you email such letters to campaigns@fsf.org, we may attach them to the blog article as a template for others citing your name, if you give us permission to do that.Sample letter to members of the European ParliamentChat control (2022/0155(COD)) just passed the council of the European Union and will soon be read in the European Parliament. Essentially, this proposal aims to introduce an \"obligation for providers to detect, report, block and remove child sexual abuse material from their services.\" The problem is that this would make chat control mandatory for all messenger and e-mail providers including end-to-end encrypted services. Now is the perfect time to appeal to members of the European Parliament to amend the proposed regulations. Here is a sample letter that you can adapt to your needs:Dear [Name of Member of the European Parliament],Thank you for all the work you do representing people like myself in the European Parliament. Today, I am appealing to you to uphold the right to privacy and to safeguard end-to-end encryption. Only with encryption can we guarantee rights as fundamental as privacy, freedom of the press, and freedom of opinion and expression. Free societies like the countries of the European Union need end-to-end encryption! At their current state, the proposed regulations to prevent and combat child sexual abuse in the European Union (2022/0155(COD)) would force encrypted services to insert a backdoor in their services because there is no other technical solution to comply with the detection obligations that the proposal would impose on providers of encrypted services. Inserting a backdoor would destroy end-to-end encryption! The text of the regulations even recognizes this risk when it warns: \"When executing the detection order, providers should take all available safeguard measures to ensure that the technologies employed by them cannot be used by them or their employees for purposes other than compliance with this Regulation, nor by third parties, and thus to avoid undermining the security and confidentiality of the communications of users.\" This is not possible. Once a backdoor is installed, it will be abused by criminals and state actors. And this means the encryption can no longer protect the users' privacy. As Matthias Pfau, entrepreneur and privacy advocate, rightfully said: \"Encryption is either securing everyone or it is broken for everyone.\" In addition, backdoors do nothing to serve the stated goal of preventing and combating child sexual abuse. One reason is because criminals are simply able to use cryptographic tools that don't comply with the law Please urge the European Commission to either drop the European Union (2022/0155(COD)) or radically amend the proposed regulations to keep unmediated end-to-end encryption legal. Please also prevent any future law that try to insert a backdoor in end-to-end encryption.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,[Your name and signature]Select from the list of current members a Member of the European Parliament to whom you want to write the letter. We recommend selecting someone from your region because they are in the Parliament to represent you. Address your letter to:Parlement Europ\u00e9enB\u00e2t.

Sections 8, 9, and 16 of the Bill would mandate providers of user-to-user services that have links with the United Kingdom to detect, report, and assess the risk of illegal text, images, or videos on their platforms.On their homepage, the government lists software and platforms that are supposed to help providers of user-to-user services to \"identify and remove known illegal content [...] which features child sexual exploitation or terrorist activity\" and to \"detect potentially harmful content.\" Most of this software is proprietary and a serious concern to privacy. This shows how the government intends to implement the \"Online Safety Bill\" if it passes: Proprietary software or SaaSS providers scan chats and thereby eventually \"detects, categorizes and evaluates child abuse content with no human interaction.\" Because it's proprietary software, the user has no control over the process and can't look into the workings of the algorithm. This makes it effectively impossible to detect false flagging, not to mention the privacy implications of feeding all communication of a platform to a centralized instance.In order to comply with the duties set out in the \"Online Safety Bill,\" providers of encrypted services would have to insert a backdoor in their services. But installing a backdoor would abolish the benefits of end-to-end encryption and dismantle digital privacy.The \"Online Safety Bill\" started in the House of Commons and is now in the House of Lords. This is your chance to contact members of the House of Lords and let them know that you value end-to-end encryption.Here is a sample letter that you can adapt to your needs:Dear [Title of a member of the House of Lords],Thank you for all the work you do as a member of the House of Lords. Today, I am appealing to you to uphold the right to privacy and to safeguard end-to-end encryption. Only with encryption can we guarantee fundamental rights as privacy, freedom of the press, and freedom of opinion and expression. End-to-end encryption is vital for a free society like the UK. The Online Safety Bill threatens to destroy end-to-end encryption. In order to comply with the duties about illegal content risk assessments set out in section 8, the duties about illegal content set out in section 9, and the duty about content reporting set out in section 16, providers of encrypted services would have to insert a backdoor in their services. But installing a backdoor would abolish the benefits of end-to-end encryption and dismantle digital privacy. As Matthias Pfau, entrepreneur and privacy advocate, rightfully said: \"Encryption is either securing everyone or it is broken for everyone.\" Please either drop the *Online Safety Bill* or radically amend the proposed regulations to keep unmediated end-to-end encryption legal. Please also prevent any future law that try to insert a backdoor in end-to-end encryption.Thank you for your consideration.Yours sincerely,[Your name and signature]Select a member of the House of Lords to whom you want to write the letter from the members of the House of Lords section of the parliament. In the same section, you can find the email address of each member. Alternatively, you can send an email to contactholmember@parliament.uk. We recommend addressing the Lords Member in accordance with the guidance on addressing Lords Members.Sample letter for the United StatesThis April, Senator Lindsey Graham re-introduced the EARN IT Act for the third time, after the bill had been successfully defeated twice in 2020 and 2022. The bill is now with the House and the Senate for consideration. Fight for the Future sponsored a petition which can unfortunately only be signed using nonfree JavaScript. But you can write your senators urging them to reject the EARN IT Act.In addition, the STOP CSAM Act, introduced in the Congress in April, tries to hold end-to-end encryption providers liable for the distribution of child sexual abuse material although it is not clear how providers should detect child exploitation conduct in encrypted text.There was also the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act that aimed at requiring \"certain technology companies to ensure that they can decode encrypted information on their services and products in order to provide such information to law enforcement.\" Luckily, this bill died 2021 in Congress but it could be re-introduced or included in another bill any time.Furthermore, there is reason to fear that the Kids Online Safety Act, which was reintroduced in the US Congress at the beginning of May, will prompt platforms to require all users to upload identity verification documentation or biometric information to validate their age because the bill lacks guidance on how else platforms shall predict if the videos, pictures, or text on the platform might have a negative impact on minors. This is not related to encryption, but it is definitely a bill we should watch, as it would impact our privacy if it passes.Let the representatives of your government know that end-to-end encryption and privacy are vital. Here is a sample letter that you can adapt to your needs:Dear Chairman Jordan, Ranking Member Nadler, and members of the Committee,Thank you for all the work you do as senators. Today, I am appealing to you to uphold the right to privacy and to safeguard end-to-end encryption. Only with encryption can we guarantee fundamental rights as privacy, freedom of the press, and freedom of opinion and expression. End-to-end encryption is vital for a free society like the US. I am deeply concerned about the re-introduced *EARN IT Act* and the *STOP CSAM Act*. Section 5(7)(A) and (B) of the *EARN IT Act* encourage courts to deem providers of encryption services guilty of acting recklessly or negligently and not preventing CSAM crimes only because they offer end-to-end encrypted services. Similarly, the *STOP CSAM Act* tries to hold end-to-end encryption providers liable for the distribution of child sexual abuse material. In order to prevent this accusation, providers would have to insert a backdoor in their encryption service to screen messages en masse. Once a backdoor is installed however, it *will* be abused by criminals and state actors, and the encryption will no longer protect user privacy. As Matthias Pfau, entrepreneur and privacy advocate, rightfully said: \"Encryption is either securing everyone or it is broken for everyone.\" Neither the *EARN IT Act* nor the *STOP CSAM Act* will serve the goal to prevent and combat child sexual abuse because criminals are simply able to use cryptographic tools that don't comply with the law I urge you to oppose both the *EARN IT Act* and the *STOP CSAM Act* and to prevent any law that will try to insert a backdoor in end-to-end encryption.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,[Your name and signature]For an alternative text, see this sample message from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Action Center.Send your letter to:Chairman Jim JordanCommittee on the JudiciaryUnited States Senate711 Hart Senate BuildingWashington, D.C. 20510andRanking Member Jerrold NadlerCommittee on the JudiciaryUnited States Senate135 Hart Senate Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20510{/if }Illustration Copyright \u00a9 2014, Johannes Landin.

Only Chuck Schumer sent me back a reply, and I can't actually tell what his position is. He summarized the bill, then said he worked on making Big Tech more secure (\"I have worked to have these sites deploy more secure internet protocols\"; must have had some help from Al Gore there) and that he values privacy (\"I voted in favor of H.R.2048, the USA Freedom Act, which became law on June 2, 2015. This bill provides additional safeguards for individual privacy in our surveillance rules and ends bulk metadata collection. Moving forward, I will continue working to strengthen privacy protections under the law.\").For whatever reason, my first reading of this email was \"fuck you, I'm outlawing encryption TOMORROW\" but after re-reading it, I'm actually less sure about that. This one is a nail-biter; outlawing encryption is probably the end of the iOS and Android ecosystem, because we'll have to use OSes from outside the US. Or let random low-level NSA employees read all your illustrated love letters to your partner. Feels a little gross just thinking about it.replymonksy 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Tammy duckworths emails on encryption always results to hysterical claims that it literally harms a child for every character you encrypt.Durbans response is 3-4mons later and just says thank you for your feedback.replyjrockway 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I used to live in Illinois and wrote a lot of letters to Durban on tech issues. His responses were consistently awful. Above average awful.I feel like tech is the most underrepresented demographic in politics. Neither party cares about us at all. We hear cries of \"defund the police\", but we want to give the police the right to read all of our thoughts? It's so hypocritical; if you think the government is abusing its citizenry and that removing their source of funding is your political goal, why give them spying tools?Meanwhile, the country's tax plan seems to hinge on one strategy: \"software engineers should pay for everything\". We make enough money to pay a ton of taxes (I paid the AMT every year before 2017), but we don't make enough money to afford lobbyists. It does get a little better as you get older; mortgage interest and dependents are nice deductions. But really, a lot of our money is being taken to make the country objectively worse. It doesn't feel great.That said, you can't vote for Republicans because of their hot takes on social issues. They would have half of my friends killed just for existing if they had their way. At least the Democrats kind of let people exist and even get married. (It's also not clear to me that they would ever meaningfully reduce the tax burden on people that work for a living; Trump's supposed tax cuts which removed the state tax deduction increased my taxes!)It's a mess out there.

Probably not, but then neither will exclusively communicating using some fully open source cellphone with full root access that doesn't actually exist. The benefit of Signal on an iPhone is that people will actually use that and it will help against a lot of things that aren't the Mossad pulling out all the stops coming after you personally.Honestly a lot of security discourse feels like calling airbags and seat belts useless because they won't help if you drive head on into a bullet train.

The ability to dynamically boot into any of several operating systems on the same phone could be useful for testing new OS versions without fear of bricking the device. This should make vendors less apprehensive about updating devices by removing the risk of bricking them. Get rid of internal storage and have a slot for an OS card with multiple boot partitions and a slot for multimedia. Add to this every phone OS must have a proper file manager and terminal shell by default.Adding to this the lack of open source hardware and firmware is problematic for e2ee. I believe there is a lack of transparency around attestation and chain of custody in the entire build process and not just for the SoC but also the modular baseband modems.I would personally like to see entirely modular, upgradable and serviceable phones similar to FairPhone but even more open and easier to swap parts. 6G deprecates 5G?

Per noyb, BICS operates in more than 200 countries around the world and \"gets detailed information (e.g. the regularity of completed calls, call duration, long-term inactivity, range activity, or successful incoming traffic) [on] about half of the worldwide mobile phone users.\"That data is regularly shared with TeleSign, noyb alleges, without any notification to the customers whose data is being collected and used.\"Your phone provider likely forwards data to BICS who then forwards it to TeleSign. TeleSign generates a 'trust score' about you and sells phone data to third parties like Microsoft, Salesforce or TikTok \u2013 without anyone being informed or giving consent,\" Schrems said.Spot the GDPR violationsIn its complaint, an auto-translated English version of which was reviewed by The Register, noyb alleges that TeleSign is in violation of the GDPR's provisions that ban use of automated profiling tools, as well as rules that require affirmative consent be given to process EU citizen's data.But that's not all, and to understand why we need to dig a bit deeper into TeleSign's corporate parentage and the history of its behavior.When BICS acquired TeleSign in 2017, it began to fall under the partial control of BICS' parent company, Belgian telecom giant Proximus. Proximus held a partial stake in BICS, which Proximus spun off from its own operations in 1997.That Meta GDPR fine is \u20ac1.2B. Plus biz must stop sending EU data to USMeta facing third fine of 2023 for mishandling EU user data under GDPREU-US Privacy Framework could make life easier for a data biz, if it survivesFresh GDPR ruling says even 'minor anxiety' could mean payouts for EU folksIn 2021, Proximus bought out BICS' other shareholders, making it the sole owner of both the telecom interchange and TeleSign.With that in mind, noyb is also leveling charges against Proximus and BICS. In its complaint, noyb said Proximus was asked by EU citizens from various countries to provide records of the data TeleSign processed, as is their right under Article 15 of the GDPR. The complainants weren't given the information they requested, says noyb, and claims what was handed over was simply a template copy of the EU's standard contractual clause (SCC), which has been used by businesses transmitting data between the EU and US while the pair try to work out data transfer rules that Schrems won't get struck down in court.In addition to that article 15 allegation, TeleSign, and ultimately Proximus by virtue of its ownership of the company, are also accused of violating the GDPR's SCC rules \"by carrying out a subsequent transfer that does not comply with its contractual obligations,\" noyb alleges in its complaint.Noyb also asserts that BICS violated the GDPR by transferring data without appropriate safeguards to protect it. Schrems and other EU privacy advocates have long argued against the transfer of data to the US on the grounds that the States lack a federal data protection regulation, and as such federal authorities have free rein to access data protected in the EU.Noyb is seeking cessation of all data transfers from BICS to TeleSign, processing of said data, and is requesting deletion of all unlawfully transmitted data. It's also asking for Belgian data protection authorities to fine Proximus, which noyb said could reach as high as \u20ac236 million ($257 million) \u2013 a mere 4 percent of Proximus's global turnover. According to the noyb complaint: \"TeleSign considers that it processes data on the basis of legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6.1.f of the GDPR, for reasons of 'fraud prevention, protection against spamming, phishing, promotion abuse, fake accounts, unlawful account takeovers and any other attack entailing costs.'\"TeleSign told The Register it was compliant with the law, saying: \"Telesign has in place a data privacy program, which encompasses global law and regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA). The company constantly reviews internal policies and practices to maintain compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape.\" \u00aeWhitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE JourneySimilar topicsGDPRMax SchremsPrivacyMore like these13 COMMENTSTIP US OFFSend us news",

I have to pay cash, because going bankrupt at the literal beginning of your life, follows you for life.Sure, the inputs are gone, but the evidence is there. When you go bankrupt and finally get back on your feet and can get credit again, there are only certain types of credit you can get. Eventually, the original negative inputs go away, but the types of credit still tell the same story. It can take decades before you are able to wipe away most of the evidence and get treated with some modicum of trust.replydnissley 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]What do you make of these findings?https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/are-...As shown in the three panels, credit scores are distributed over the entire support for all three income groups, and, apart from the distribution of the high-income group having a larger mass at the high end of the distribution support, the shapes of the histograms of high- and middle-income groups are broadly consistent.

And that\u2019s how poor people get to have nice things.replywhimsicalism 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Because there are lots of factors that are unjust as criterion for moneylending. (This is how you get redlining, for instance).For instance, if people in location X tend to be bad at paying back their loans, I still don't think it should be legal to purchase location data from some weather app and then incorporate the amount of time someone's phone spends in location X into some creditworthiness score. One might argue that allowing this practice makes credit more accessible for everyone else because we don't have to comingle with all the people in location X, but I still think it should be a prohibited practice (and it is - in the US).In developing countries with little regulatory sophistication, the law is simply not ready to deal with these things - they are busy dealing with murders, drug dealing, etc., not consumer finance.replyxwdv 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You state that it makes credit more accessible to everyone else yet don\u2019t really cite any reason why discrimination based on location is inherently bad.The truth is it isn\u2019t. Anything that helps the lender feel they are reducing their risk in lending will allow them to accept lower interest rates.Of course, for a person that has no choice but to be in location X, this sucks as the data will suggest lending money to them at a higher rate due to greater perceived risk, but it\u2019s tough to argue with data.replyThiez 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You realize location can easily be a proxy for protected classes such as race?And suppose a location has been found with above average risk.

It may be correct as to \"the letter of the law\" that these companies shouldn't have to abide by freedom of speech or association, but the fact on the ground is that there are nearly no other options if the 4 main CC companies decide they don't want to allow you to take payment (please don't let this devolve into a discussion about crypto...)The US already recognizes this when it comes to credit bureaus - the 3 major bureaus are highly regulated and the types of information they are allowed to collect, use and share is explicitly detailed.

The government can't revoke them because they are, by nature, God-given and inalienable and don't come from anyone but Him.Then there are rights which can be granted as concessions from the government, whether it is Federal, State, or other. I'm not sure; perhaps the right to vote is one of these \"non God-given\" rights because voting itself stems from the nature of democracy and not an inborn trait of mankind. There seems to be the right of privacy, but I'm not sure if this could be described as \"God-given\"; it's rather a new concept, and Christian doctrine doesn't make a particular pronouncement on whether this is a thing to be protected.And other entities besides governments can grant rights, of course.

An inaccurate score might have to be massively off the mark to make a person worse off than no score at all. In the US for example, people with no credit history often get interest rates as high or higher than people with a relatively low credit score.Of course from a privacy & data protection standpoint this doesn't make silently and secretly profiling customers okay. The solution is probably something more like a transparent opt-in system that has easy access for the customer to review their data and decide which pieces of it are included.In the US, the balance is skewed a bit more towards secrecy, and it's not opt-in either.

When I buy booze in Germany on Amazon for example this is already how it works, you verify your age with your national ID (which has support for a \"eID\" schema).The big advantage is that the dedicated company doing the processing is by law required to delete all data after verification, so no commercial third party actually ever gets or can sell your identification data. That's way more secure and private than handing TikTok or other foreign companies your means of identification.We would be living in a vastly more secure world if random companies only ever got a yes/no that you initiate by a dedicated, audited actor on your soil. And it basically eliminates fraud as well.replyGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",

    "content": "Common Bugs in WritingPreface (suggested by Bob Briscoe)Be clear what you're trying to say before you write it.Don't get attached to words you have written; be prepared to scrap what you wrote while you were thrashing around trying to work out what you wanted to say, even if its a whole paper.Like almost all rules, there are cases where breaking them is a good idea and seasoned writers may well object with \"but\" responses for some of these. Thus, consider the rules below as mental rumble strips - you should probably slow down and think if you encounter these cases.Avoid use of passive tense if at all possible. Example: \"In each reservation request message, a refresh interval used by the sender is included.\" reads better and shorter as \"Each ... message includes ...\"Use strong verbs instead of lots of nouns and simple terms rather than fancy-sounding ones. Examples:verbose, weak verbs, bad short, strong, goodmake assumption assumeis a function of depends onis an illustration illustrates, showsis a requirement requires, need toutilizes useshad difference differedIf you find yourself saying \"In other words,\" it means you didn't say it clearly enough the first time. Go back and rewrite the first attempt.Avoid filler words, e.g., by converting sentences into a simple actor-action-object phrasing.Check for missing articles, particularly if your native tongue doesn't have them. Roughly, concepts and classes of things don't, most everything else more specific does. (\"Routers route packets. The router architecture we consider uses small rodents.\") Don't use articles in front of proper nouns and names (\"Internet Explorer is a popular web browser. The current version number is 5.0. Bill Gates did not write Internet Explorer.\") [NEED POINTER HERE]Each sentence in a paragraph must have some logical connection to the previous one. For example, it may describe an exception (\"but,\" \"however\"), describe a causality (\"thus,\" \"therefore,\" \"because of this\"), indicate two facets of an argument (\"on the one hand,\" \"on the other hand\"), enumerate sub-cases (\"first,\" \"secondly\") or indicate a temporal relationship (\"then,\" \"afterwards\"). If there are no such hints, check if your sentences are indeed part of the same thought. A new thought should get its own paragraph, but still clearly needs some logical connection to the paragraphs that preceded it.Protocol abbreviations typically do not take an article, even if the expanded version does. For example, \"The Transmission Control Protocol delivers a byte stream\" but \"TCP delivers a byte stream,\" since it an abstract term. (\"The TCP design has been successful.\" is correct since the article refers to the design, not TCP.)Note that abbreviations for organizations do take a definite article, as in \"The IETF standardized TCP.\"Since the \"P\" in TCP, UDP and similar abbreviations already stands for \"protocol,\" saying the \"the TCP protocol\" is redundant, albeit common. (LCD, Liquid Crystal Display, is another common case where many are tempted to incorrectly write LCD display. Indeed, Google references 2,060,000 instances of that usage.)Use consistent tense - present, usually, unless reporting results achieved in earlier papers.None: None can take either singular or plural verbs, depending on the intended meaning (or taste). Both none of these mistakes are common and none of these mistakes is common are correct, although other sources only lists the singular and The Tongue untied makes finer distinctions based on whether it refers to a unit or a measure.Use hyphens for concatenated words: \"end-to-end architecture,\" \"real-time operating system\" (but \"the computer may analyze the results in real time\"), \"per-flow queueing,\" \"flow-enabled,\" \"back-to-back,\" ...In general, hyphens are usedadding prefixes that would result in double vowels (except for co-, de-, pre-, pro-), e.g., supra-auditory;all-: all-around, all-embracing;half-: half-asleep, half-dollar (but halfhearted, halfway);quasi-: quasi-publicself-: self-conscious, self-seeking (but selfhood, selfless)to distinguish from a solid homograph, e.g., re-act vs. react, re-pose vs. repose, re-sign vs. resign, re-solve vs. resolve, re-lease vs. releaseA compound adjective made up of an adjective and a noun in combination should usually be hyphenated. (WiT, p. 230) Examples: cold-storage vault, hot-air heating, short-term loan, real-time operating system, application-specific integrated circuit, Internet-based.words ending in -like when the preceding word ends in 'l', e.g., shell-likeDon't overuse dashes for separation, as they interrupt the flow of words. Dashes may be appropriate where you want to contrast thoughts very strongly or the dash part is a surprise of some sort. Think of it as a very long pause when speaking. In many cases, a comma-separated phrase works better. If you do use a dash, make sure it's not a hyphen (- in LaTeX), but an em-dash (--- in LaTeX).Avoid scare quotes, as they indicate that the writer is distancing himself from the term or the term is meant to be ironic.Numbers ten or less are spelled out: \"It consists of three fields,\" not \"3 fields\".Use until instead of the colloquial till.Use. Eq. 7, not Equation (7), unless you need to fill empty pages.Optimal can't be improved - more optimally should be better or maybe more nearly optimal.Avoid in-line enumeration like: \"Packets can be (a) lost, (b) stolen, (c) get wet.\" The enumeration only interrupts the flow of thought. (There are exceptions, e.g., when you later refer to these cases.)Avoid itemization (bullets) in most cases, as they take up extra space and make the paper read like PowerPoint slides. Bullets can, however, be used effectively to emphasize key points, if used sparingly. If you want to describe components or algorithms, often the LaTeX description environment works better, as it highlights the term, providing a low-level section delineation.Avoid bulleted lists of one-sentence paragraphs. They make your paper look like a slide presentation and interfere with smooth reading.Instead of \"Reference [1] shows\" or \"[1] shows,\" use \"Smith [1] showed\" or \"Smith and Jones [1] showed\" or \"Smith et al. [1] showed\" (if more than two authors). \"et al.\" is generally used for papers with more than two authors. (Note that \"et al.\" makes the subject plural if the authors are the subject of the sentence rather than the paper, so it is \"Smith et al. [1] show\" not \"shows\". Some authors prefer to treat the article as the, singular, subject, but this may sound peculiar to some readers, so the construction is probably best avoided or rephrased to make the article more clearly the subject. For example, \"Section 3 of Smith and Wesson [42] claims that...\" or \"Smith and Wesson claim that ... [42]\" or \"In [42], Smith and Wesson claim that...\".) Or, alternatively, \"the foobar protocol [1] is an example ...\". This keeps the reader from having to flip back to the references, as they'll recognize many citations by either author name or project name. No need to refer to RFC numbers in the text (except in RFCs and Internet Drafts). Exception for very low-level presentation: \"RFC822-style addresses\". While there is no firm rule, it seems preferable to include the reference immediately after the author name, rather than at the end of the material describing the citation. This keeps the reader from having to look ahead on encountering the reference and avoids inconsistent phrasing and guessing when multiple papers are cited for a single fact, as in \"Hertz [1] and Marconi [2] worked on radio waves\", rather than \"Hertz and Marconi worked on radio waves [1,2].\"Use normal capitalization in captions (\"This is a caption,\" not \"This is a Caption\") unless your style guide requires heading-style capitalization.All headings must be capitalized consistently, either in heading style, capitalizing words, or sentence style, across all levels of headings.Parentheses or brackets are always surrounded by a space: \"The experiment(Fig. 7)shows\" is wrong; \"The experiment (Fig. 7) shows\" is right.Avoid excessive parenthesized remarks as they make the text hard to read; fold into the main sentence. Check whether the publication allows footnotes - some magazines frown upon them. More than two footnotes per page or a handful per paper is a bad sign. You probably should have applied to law school instead.The material should make just as much sense without the footnotes. If the reader constantly has to look at footnotes, they are likely to lose their original place in the text. As a matter of taste, I find URLs better placed in the references rather than as a footnote, as the reader will know that the footnote is just a reference, not material important for understanding the text.There is no space between the text and the superscript for the footnote. I.e., in LaTeX, it's text\\footnote{} rather than text \\footnote{}.Check that abbreviations are always explained before use. Exceptions, when addressed to the appropriate networking audience: ATM, BGP, ftp, HTTP, IP, IPv6, RSVP, TCP, UDP, RTP, RIP, OSPF, BGP, SS7. Be particularly aware of the net-head, bell-head perspective. Even basic terms like PSTN and POTS aren't taught to CS students... For other audiences, even terms like ATM are worth expanding, as your reader might wonder why ATM has anything to do with cells rather than little green pieces of paper.Never start a sentence with \"and\". (There are exceptions to this rule, but these are best left to English majors.)Don't use colons (:) in mid-sentence. For example, \"This is possible because: somebody said so\" is wrong - the part before the colon must be a complete sentence.Don't start sentences with \"That's because\".In formal writing, contractions like don't, doesn't, won't or it's are generally avoided.Be careful not to confuse its with it's (it is).Vary expressions of comparison: \"Flying is faster than driving\" is much better than \"Flying has the advantage of being faster\" or \"The advantage of flying is that it is faster.\".Don't use slash-constructs such as \"time/money\". This is acceptable for slides, but in formal prose, such expressions should be expanded into \"time or money\" or \"time and money,\" depending on the meaning intended.Avoid cliches like \"recent advances in ...,\" \"exponential growth,\" and \"paradigm\". You do not want readers of your work to play buzzword bingo. Other words should be banished.Don't use symbols like \"+\" (for \"and\"), \"%\" (for \"fraction\" or \"percentage\") or \"->\" (for \"follows\" or \"implies\") in prose, outside of equations. These are only acceptable in slides.Avoid capitalization of terms. Your paper is not the U.S. Constitution or Declaration of Independence. Technical terms are in lower-case, although some people use upper case when explaining an acronym, as in \"Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\".Expand all acronyms on first use, except acronyms that every reader is expected to know. (In a research paper on TCP, expanding TCP is probably not needed - somebody who doesn't know what TCP stands for isn't likely to appreciate the rest of the paper, either.)Each paragraph should have a lead sentence summarizing its content. If this doesn't work naturally, the paragraph is probably too short. Try reading just the first lines of each paragraph - the paper should still make sense. For example,There are two service models, integrated and differentiated service. Integrated service follows the German approach that anything that isn't explicitly allowed is verboten. It strictly regulates traffic, but also makes the trains run on time. Differentiated service follows the Animal Farm appraoch, where some traffic is more equal than others. It seems simpler, until one has to worry about proletariat traffic dressing up as the aristocracy.$i$th, not $i-th$.Units are always in roman font, never italics or LaTeX math mode. Units are set off by one (thin) space from the number. In LaTeX, use ~ to avoid splitting number and units across two lines. \\; or \\, produces a thin space.For readability, powers of a 1,000 are divided by commas.Use \"kb/s\" or \"Mb/s,\" not \"kbps\" or \"Mbps\" - the latter are not scientific units. Be careful to distinguish \"Mb\" (Megabit) and \"MB\" (Megabytes), in particular \"kb\" (1,000 bits) and \"KB\" (1,024 bytes).It's always kHz (lower-case k), not KHz or KHZ.It's Wi-Fi, not WiFi (or wifi), since this is a trademark.Operating systems such as Android, (Mac)OSX, Linux or Windows are typically capitalized.It is not common to use the trademark symbol \u00ae (or its country cousins SM and TM) unless you are the owner of the mark and then only on first use.Units and Measurements, Taligent style guideUse \"ms,\" not \"msec,\" for milliseconds.Use \"0.5\" instead of \".5,\" i.e., do not omit the zero in front of the decimal point. (Words into Type recommends that \"for quantities less than one, a zero should be set before the decimal point except for quantities that never exceed one.\")Avoid \"etc.\"; use \"for example,\" \"such as,\" \"among others\" or, better yet, try to give a complete list (unless citing, for example, a list of products known to be incomplete), even if abstract. See also Strunk and White:Etc.: Not to be used of persons. Equivalent to and the rest, and so forth, and hence not to be used if one of these would be insufficient, that is, if the reader would be left in doubt as to any important particulars. Least open to objection when it represents the last terms of a list already given in full, or immaterial words at the end of a quotation. At the end of a list introduced by such as, for example, or any similar expression, etc. is incorrect.If you say, \"for example\" or \"like,\" do not follow this with \"etc.\". Thus, it's \"fruit like apples, bananas and oranges\". The \"like\" and \"for example\" already indicate that there are more such items.Avoid excessive use of \"i.e.\". Vary your expression: \"such as,\" \"this means that,\" \"because,\" .... \"I.e.\" is not the universal conjunction!Remember that \"i.e.\" and \"e.g.\" are always followed by a comma.Do not use ampersands (&) or slash-abbreviations (such as s/w or h/w) in formal writing; they are acceptable for slides.\"respectively\" is preceded by a comma, as in \"The light bulbs lasted 10 and 100 days, respectively.\"Therefore, however, hence and thus are usually followed by a comma, as in \"Therefore, our idea should not be implemented.\"Never use \"related works\" unless you are talking about works of art. It's \"related work\".Similarly, \"codes\" refer to encryption keys, not multiple programs. You would say \"I modified multiple programs,\" not \"multiple codes\".Use \"in Figure 1\" instead of \"following figure\" since figures may get moved during the publication or typesetting process. Don't assume that the LaTeX figure stays where you put it.Text columns in tables are left-aligned, numeric columns are aligned on the decimal or right-aligned.Section, Figure and Table are capitalized, as in \"As discussed in Section 3\". Figure can be abbreviated as Fig., but the others are not usually abbreviated, but that's a matter of taste - just be consistent.Section titles are not followed by a period.In LaTeX, tie the figure number to the reference, so that it doesn't get broken across two lines:Fig.~\\ref{fig:arch}Do not use GIF images for figures, as GIFs produce horrible print quality and are huge. Export into PostScript. At that stage, you'll learn to \"appreciate\" Microsoft products. xfig and gnuplot generally produce PostScript that can be included without difficulties.Only use line graphs when you are trying to show a functional or causal relationship between variables. When showing different experiments, for example, use bar graphs or scatter plots.Figures show, depict, indicate, illustrate. Avoid \"(refer to Fig. 17)\". Often, it is enough to simply put the figure reference in parenthesis: \"Packet droppers (Fig. 17) have a pipe to the bit bucket, which is emptied every night.\"If you quote something literally, enclose it in quotation marks or show it indented and in smaller type (\"block quote\"). A mere citation is not sufficient as it does not tell the reader whether you simply derived your material from the cited source or copied it verbatim.Do not refer to colors in graphs. Many people will print the paper on a monochrome (black and white) printer and will have no idea what you are talking about when referring to the red or blue line. Also, 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women are color blind. Thus, make sure that graph lines are easily distinguishable when printing on a monochrome printer. \"Use both color and shape to convey the same meaning; for example, solid and dashed lines or different fill patterns can help readers understand the figure without relying solely on color. Each line of your line graph should be a thick line with a unique data point symbol. Connect the data label to the data line rather than relying on a color key.\" (IEEE)Avoid numbers with artificial precision. Unless you have done enough experiments to be sure that the value measured is indeed meaningful to five digits after the decimal point, you're overstating your results.Do not forget to acknowledge your funding support. If you do forget, you may not have any to acknowledge in the future.All references must use consistent capitalization for the paper titles, i.e., either all title-case or all sentence-case.Technical report citations must have the name of the organization such as the university or company. Conferences must cite the location.Check your references to make sure they are up to date. For example, Internet Drafts might have been replaced by RFCs and technical reports or workshop papers by conference or journal papers.References should be consistent: all authors should either be given with their full name (John Doe) or abbreviated (J. Doe), but not combinations.Conference references should contain the location of the conference, the month and some indication such as \"Proc. of\" or \"Conference\". Journal references always contain the volume, issue number and pages. It must be obvious from the citation whether an article was in a journal or in a conference.Only include the year of the publication once, rather than multiple times in different contexts. For example, avoid something like \"A. Doe, \"Performance of IEEE 802.11ac in a Rayleigh channel,\" in Proc. 2015 ACM Intern. Conf. on Mobile Computing, Rome, Italy, May 2015. ACM Press, 2015.See also University of Minnesota Style Manual. Many of these issues are also described in more detail in the US Federal plain language guidelines, humorously, and, with a UK origin, The Complete Plain Words, dating back to 1954. Similar points are made also by John Owens.Thanks to Christian Bettstetter for contributions.Last updated 01/12/2021 03:52:17 by Henning Schulzrinne",

    "content": "\"...the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day.\"\u2013 Charles DickensJuly 2009One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you're done.Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no problem for someone on the manager's schedule. There's always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own case. Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.Each type of schedule works fine by itself. Problems arise when they meet. Since most powerful people operate on the manager's schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their frequency if they want to. But the smarter ones restrain themselves, if they know that some of the people working for them need long chunks of time to work in.Our case is an unusual one. Nearly all investors, including all VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule. But Y Combinator runs on the maker's schedule. Rtm and Trevor and I do because we always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten into sync with us.I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago they started to be able to resist switching from jeans to suits.How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule? By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule within the maker's: office hours. Several times a week I set aside a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded. These chunks of time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours are clustered at the end. Because they come at the end of my day these meetings are never an interruption. (Unless their working day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to them.) During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called \"business stuff.\" I never thought of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative meetings. You can meet someone just to get to know one another. If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not? Maybe it will turn out you can help one another in some way.Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that matter) have speculative meetings all the time. They're effectively free if you're on the manager's schedule. They're so common that there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you want to \"grab coffee,\" for example.Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's schedule, though. Which puts us in something of a bind. Everyone assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule. So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or send us an email proposing we grab coffee. At this point we have two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably offend them.Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source of the problem. We just took it for granted that we had to either blow our schedules or offend people. But now that I've realized what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something explaining the two types of schedule. Maybe eventually, if the conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a problem.Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise. We know we have to have some number of meetings. All we ask from those on the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.Related:How to Do What You LoveGood and Bad ProcrastinationTurkish TranslationFrench TranslationKorean TranslationGerman Translation",
    "summary": "- There are two types of schedules: the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses and operates on one-hour intervals, while the maker's schedule is preferred by people who make things (like programmers and writers) and operates in units of at least half a day.\n- Meetings are disruptive for those on the maker's schedule, as they can break up valuable blocks of time and change the mode of work. This can be detrimental to productivity and ambitious projects.\n- Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, operates on the maker's schedule and uses office hours as a way to simulate the manager's schedule within their preferred schedule. This allows for focused work time while still being available for meetings with founders.",

You end up either being a good team leader and a bad IC, a good IC and a bad team leader, or doing something unsustainable like being a good team leader from 9 AM - 5 PM and then filling in IC work until 9 PM.Please - just don't hire for this position to begin with.replysiliconc0w 16 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I'm in a 'TL' role and my current schedule is:* quick dog walk/sunlight* meetings* dog walk/sunlight/lunch/exercise* focus work* dog walk* personal development/curiosity/light work* dinner/etcI actually really enjoy breaking up the day with walks and exercise. I usually try to have at least one day with no meetings for two focus blocks but I found there is definitely diminishing returns there. I think ideally I'd do the meetings in the afternoon but the timezones involved prevent that. I'm not the highest-volume IC but I'm reasonably good at identifying high-value targets since I have a lot more context so in the one focus block a day I can do some damage. If it's a bigger project I might just try to start it/find the shape of it and then shop it around to get it on the appropriate teams roadmaps.It's pretty crazy to me that the people making most of the resourcing decisions in companies were maybe once technical but haven't actually pushed a line of code in years so that muscle has atrophied and this leads to a complete lack of nuance in decision making. So I definitely think you need at least few 'blended' roles who keep their technical chops a bit honed but still participate in the 'command'/resourcing discussions (but of course I'm biased).replysheepscreek 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]While I appreciate this perspective, it can\u2019t happen in isolation.

Almost no actual work is getting done because of all the interruptions and endless technical bikeshedding because nobody has either the authority or understanding to call the shots. The ICs compensate for this by working overtime for free.replysolatic 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> I think it works quite well when they focus on architechture, mentoring, product planning, estimation, cross team communication, code review, devops and small feature/config requests.

You can't slot an MBA with no engineering experience into a TL position, to serve as some kind of bureaucrat. When the team's stuck in the weeds, a good leader rolls up their sleeves and helps.

There are still managers scattered throughout - some of the tech leads, and some people who are otherwise ICs - but they are always from other teams.This is an interesting model, because it means when someone disagrees with their tech lead they are explicitly not disagreeing with their manager but with a peer.The managers also can't assign work (explicitly or implicitly) because they're not even on the same team. This stopped a bunch of non-planned work, such as when a manager said something like \"it would be nice if you built x\" or asked questions that required a lot of research, as it's too easy for an IC to take that as a directive to actually do it.

I\u2019m not sure how popular this idea was elsewhere in the company, but our team had all meetings on Wednesday (minus the daily scrum). We were remote Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Came in only on Wednesday for the meetings. Wednesday was the perfect day because it was hump day, and it went by quickly typically, because of all the meetings (and coworker conversation). As a software engineer, it was hard to get anything done on Wednesday because coworkers would ping me (in person of course) with questions about the software and so on. Like how can I test this feature, has this feature been pushed to the QA environment, etc. I won\u2019t say that part was necessarily ideal, but being remote 4 days/week allowed me and the other devs to concentrate free of the \u201cannoying\u201d coworkers.This was in 2015, and they\u2019d been doing it for some time prior.replyKnobbleMcKnees 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Interesting article that makes some good points but this part>They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least.

Some does, so there's a small nugget of truth, but this is far too great a generalisation.I do agree with the difference in schedule though.

That happens all the time, as you say.The point is that, when beginning the task, it is entirely unknowable whether it's definitely going to fit within an hour or not. Any of the 3 examples you gave \u2014 updating a test, fixing some automation, or fixing a bug \u2014 are things that can easily blossom into all-day (or all-week) tasks.And so, with 60 minutes and 3 tasks that might be doable within the time, it becomes that much more difficult to justify investing the time to get into flow exactly because of that unknown ROI. Plus, you need N minutes to get into flow and M minutes on the other side to prep for the meeting, so you only have 60 - N - M minutes to invest anyway.There's a guarantee of an interruption to flow within the hour, but there's no guarantee the probably-small-but-possibly-enormous task will be done by the time that interruption arrives.replyKnobbleMcKnees 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This seems to imply that the length of all tasks is unknowable until undertaken, which isn't really true.

Each ticket may require number of required steps to be completed, such a coding, testing, integration testing, documenting, reviewing, CI, QA, pushing to production, in production monitoring, reporting,etc. Nobody, except junior developers, will write a unit test out of blue sky. The simplest ticket: a \"fix\", may require reproduction, automatic test case, debugging, fix in the code, testing, update of documentation, review, CI, QA, push to production, reporting. You can do all that in one sit (half a day), keeping details in the head (harder, but faster), OR you can write off details from the head to the ticket, and then do tasks step by step in small bites, hour by hour, in multiple days (easier, but order of magnitude slower).replyxigency 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Not everything needs to be grandiose.

We programers are a naive and innocent bunch that take things at face value. When business people say they want to increase productivity, we take that literally and work accordingly.The dynamic hasn\u2019t changed because managers do not actually want productivity from their developers. They want legibility and alignment. They want to see what their programmers are doing and they want to know they aren\u2019t doing anything extraneous because they want to see that their schedule is on track. Productivity is a developer problem. If there is a problem with getting things done, it\u2019s a problem with individual developers and not the environment.The real solution to this problem is to give developers control over their work environment. If developers are in a position to reject meetings and avoid interruptions they are more productive. We\u2019ve seen this happen with WFH and hybrid work environments. This has increased productivity and worker satisfaction. This has also taken away management legibility and alignment and is driving companies to require workers to return to the office despite the benefits.replygymbeaux 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The status quo as you describe it has persisted, it seems, for about as long as the role of \u201csoftware engineer\u201d has existed. I\u2019ve often said that management treats software engineering as an assembly line and software engineers as assembly line workers- for example, most seem to expect us to be typing, and not typing == not working. Working remote helps this, but we only have these companies being full-remote because a global event literally forced them to give it a try. It wasn\u2019t all the studies that proved the fruitful outcome of remote work that had any of them consider or adopt it, it was a pandemic. So of course now the same issue lies with the 4-day workweek. They won\u2019t do it unless they\u2019re somehow forced to, either by law (unlikely) or something that\u2019s even outside of lawmakers\u2019 control (strikes?). Anyway, for this reason, I pose that the 4-day workweek is even less likely to gain mass adoption than remote work. To be brash, today\u2019s American workers are pussies, ever-placated by material things and the conveniences of modern society so as to never be too upset with the \u201carrangement\u201d with Bossman to do something as bold as strike or attempt to form a union.So I guess my point is that many seem to focus discussion on remote work, when really we should be aiming higher. Working remote is the shit, doing laundry during the day is nice, but we all know we can\u2019t go yellow on Teams or lose our green bubble on Slack lest there be hell to pay.replyryandrake 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Software company managers want assembly-line-like predictability out of a process that is more like artwork: Good programming output requires discipline and process, but it also relies on creativity, inspiration, luck, the ability to explore and dabble, following roads down dead ends, and so on.If you ask most high-ups in your software company whether they would rather a 100% guaranteed release date of Sept. 1, 2023 or a 75% confidence sometime between July and October, if they are honest with themselves, they will admit they would rather have the 100% date. So much other stuff needs to happen on fixed dates. Marketing campaigns need to ramp up, sales teams need to get started, maybe your project is part of a bigger product which has a known release date, maybe your project gets flashed onto hardware that goes on a boat on some fixed date.It would be so much easier for software companies if making software was like making a bolt or a screw: Raw material go in -> machines do their machining -> product come out a known time later, at a known rate, with a known yield.replysokoloff 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]As a now-manager/ex-maker, when I\u2019m setting a meeting with an engineer, I will always try to make mine adjacent to an existing meeting on their calendar, meaning their interruption is longer but at least it\u2019s not an additional interruption.

Email or slack and no expectation on response time. Been doing that for 5 years with no problems.replycebert 20 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I want to work where you work. We have so many pointless meetings, such as daily standups that can take up to an hour each day.replyorzig 23 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I\u2019m inclined to agree with all this but when I\u2019m conversation with someone who has only ever been in a Manager schedule, what would you recommend I point to as actual evidence?Specifically on the cost of meetings to developers.replyIzkata 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Skip the conversation entirely?I don't really have this problem, but my co-workers often put several-hour meetings on their calendar with the meeting name and participants hidden. Seems to work to prevent others from inviting them to meetings during that time.replygregwebs 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Survey or talk to all the developers and get their opinion on the matter. An objective survey is best along with representative direct quotes.replyWastingMyTime89 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I have been both an engineer doing engineering work (I hate the word \u201cmaker\u201d) and a manager. I found this article infuriating and still do.This article is a pure product of this period when software developers thought themselves as extremely special and above such petty issues as having to attend meetings. It\u2019s entitlement masquerading as wisdom. The truth is everyone has to balance their time between obligations and slots they can allocate to do longer work. Writers have to meet their editor. Artists have to plan for the logistic of their exhibitions. That\u2019s part of life.You can work for a bit do something else and get back to what you were doing. If you can\u2019t that\u2019s an issue with you, not the nature of your work.replybob1029 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I don't know about infuriating but I share your perspective.At the end of the day, most of us expect to get paid for the code we write. At some level, there is a customer who is ultimately paying for this code. You need to communicate with them via some means or you won't be able to do your job effectively. Either you talk to your team on some recurring/ad-hoc basis, or you get to talk to the end customers directly.Which one would HN prefer? Filtered internal comms channels where you get to whine and moan about basically everything, or the direct fire of the actual customer where everything is on their terms always? What would ruin your \"flow\" more? A boring 30 minute call where you were informed the customer is \"not happy\" or a 2 hour, unfiltered rant session from the live customer?replysylens 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I don't think anybody is suggesting elimination of all synchronous meetings from a workday. There should just be preference given to long, uninterrupted blocks of time where deep work can be done. Many teams even have a single day of the week dedicated to \"no meetings\" now to provide makers with at least one guaranteed day for deep work.replyafarrell 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]At the end of the day, what matters is getting your job done. If you hire someone, would you rather they be unproductive and avoid talking about this for fear of appearing entitled? Or would you rather they tell it like it is and get stuff done?replyWastingMyTime89 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Attending meetings is part of doing your jobs. Meetings exist for a purpose. The whole attitude that all meetings are somehow a waste of your precious time show that you both are unable to grasp what\u2019s happening and are strongly entitled. I\u2019m not surprised to see it fully on display here considering the readership but you have to understand that it\u2019s why people who interact with developers find them hard to work with and is largely responsible for the stereotype of the software dev as some kind of eternal adolescents you see on display in most business.replyafarrell 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There is a difference between:A) \u201cAll meetings are a waste of time.\u201dB) \u201cThere are productivity tradeoffs between a managers schedule and makers schedule.\u201dreplyWastingMyTime89 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The article is pretending that having a meeting not only waste half a day but actually waste a full day. Your point B is not reflective of the actual content we are discussing.replyBryanBeshore 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The article suggests that makers tend to take on ambitious projects that take large blocks of time to complete. This is objectively true; even today. Most of what is built is ambitious or takes large chunks of time.Editing some text or repositioning a button or something trivial is 30-min and does not require thought, but most everything is not this. Most everything involves large chunks of time and interrupting this chunk is certainly a disaster.replyBryanBeshore 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Most meetings can be done async with a few bullet points. So much time wasted on idle talk that is not productive.- both a maker and managerreplynavbaker 22 hours ago | prev [\u2013]Our group of about 65 is split 2/3 researchers and developers and 1/3 project managers/leads. Since our offices are all along one long hall, we\u2019ve had to be extremely proactive about making sure meetings that involve \u201cmakers\u201d are kept to a minimum and they are only allowed to be in the morning to allow for guaranteed blocks of work time. We\u2019ve also gotten really intentional about putting our status on whiteboards on our door so we don\u2019t get pop-ins from managers.replyvegetablepotpie 20 hours ago | parent [\u2013]> 1/3 project managers/leadsThat seems quite top heavy. I wonder if your need to be proactive is less driven by the structure of your office and more by the number of bosses you have.replynavbaker 20 hours ago | root | parent [\u2013]We have people from a bunch of other groups working on our projects, we aren\u2019t the only onesreplyGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",
    "hn_summary": "- \"Tech Lead\" positions in many startups can result in individuals being pulled in different directions, leading to ineffective performance in both their managerial and technical responsibilities.\n- Maintaining a balanced schedule as a Tech Lead involves finding a rhythm that includes a combination of meetings, focus work, personal development, and exercise.\n- It is beneficial to have team leads who can contribute technically while also participating in resourcing discussions to maintain a nuanced decision-making process."
