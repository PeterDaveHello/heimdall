        "hn_content": "Stability.AI has released a new open-source language model called StableLM, with models ranging from 3B to 65B parameters. The model has a context width of 4096, which is more than other models such as Llama and GPT-J. It can also use flash attention. The results of model evaluation have been criticized as being underwhelming, and the license is restrictive. However, this is a good option for developers who want to improve the model since it's open source. Future open-access models are expected to be more accurate and have less restrictive licenses.StableLM alpha model is being tested, expected to outperform Pythia 6.9B, and will be trained on up to 1.5 trillion tokens. It uses flash attention and has 7B parameters. Other LLM models with significantly more tokens, such as GeoV 9B, already outperform StableLM. GPT-4 API access is limited and expensive. Sparsity techniques may be useful for reducing the number of parameters. There is no free lunch when it comes to computational resources or data.StableLM, a language model from Stability AI, has released alpha versions of a 3B and 7B model trained on 800B tokens. Plans to train up to 65B parameters on 3T tokens and beyond have been mentioned. The current models ran into an overfitting issue due to duplicated data in their 1.5T-token dataset. No corpus for 10-100T tokens exists, and the internet's publicly available data maxes out at 1.5T tokens total. There is debate about whether to train a single large model or multiple small models. StableLM has been trained on a new experimental dataset built on The Pile, which is three times larger than the previous dataset.- Larger models learn faster but are prone to overfitting\n- Text modeling has enough data to support using larger models without overfitting\n- LLMs (language learning models) do not need data persistence or distributed databases\n- LLMs are expensive to make but once made, can be used to make more relatively cheaply\n- Companies make consumers pay for computation power up front in the form of a device\n- ChatGPT works fine as a website but there may be downsides to using AI language models as a website\n- LLMs can be run on consumer devices but there is a tradeoff between capability and speed\n- LLMs have low memory footprints but require high compute power\n- High compute power is needed for GPT-3.5 level of performance, which is where it becomes interesting-AMD 7000 laptops have fast memory and Intel is rumored to bring back eDRAM cache\n-Top-end consumer GPUs have faster memory than dual-channel DDR5/quad-channel LPDDR5 systems \n-Dense transformers may not benefit much from V-Cache, eDRAM\n-New architectures could potentially replace transformers in the near future\n-Apple's M series has a functional NPU and GPU for ML but is still far behind Nvidia's A100 chip \n-NN architecture is currently not suitable for putting models in silicon \n-ML on smartphones could potentially improve in the next 5 years \n-The approach and architecture for NNs change over time so predicting what we won't have in 5 years is difficultNvidia has been working on an AI chip since 2019, with models meant to run on 8 Nvidia A100 on smartphones in the next five years, but it is unlikely as the A100 is about the size of a brick; there is no way we're fitting eight bricks in a phone in the next 5 years, without even thinking about heat management. The human brain is heavily interconnected, three-dimensional, and has thermal management at every scale, which is difficult to replicate in chips. True connectivity without tons of matmuls can massively cut computational demands of models. The explosion of AI has highlighted how limiting the future is to have this just be another big tech controlled thing, with corporately-driven restrictions. Alignment is an unsolved problem, with none of the current stronger models being aligned. Apple has been positioning to leapfrog everyone after a decade+ of M1 chip design, with dedicated AI chips and integration into an operating system, but Microsoft has better ARM optimization than Apple's own Pytorch patches, and their collaboration with OpenAI places them pretty far ahead of the research curve.- Serving Language Models through APIs allows for highly optimized inference.\n- Local computation enables more privacy in AI applications.\n- Optimized ML frameworks are becoming more accessible on consumer hardware.\n- The deciding factor in the use of AI models may not be chip speed or efficiency but scale and mindshare.\n- Small and medium-sized companies may not get into acquiring hardware for AI.\n- Cloud providers may replace API companies in charging for AI services.\n- Reinforcement learning benefits from having more users, but some users want unaligned AI.\n- Good Language Models currently require expensive GPUs that make cloud APIs the only option.\n- Future computation may only make sense monetarily if everyone shifts to a thin client.\n- All software is sold as SaaS today because it is more profitable.\n- Stability is one of the few organizations that cares about free and open-source software licensing for AI.Stanford researchers have released StableLM, a large-scale language model akin to OpenAI's GPT-3, but with an open-source license. Developers are free to use, inspect and develop the StableLM base models for commercial and research purposes under the CC BY-SA-4.0 license. However, other fine-tuned models are for research use only, released under a non-commercial CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Response on Hacker News to the announcement revolved around the ease of auditing this kind of technology, the importance of \"ethical\" licenses, the difficulties surrounding AI alignment, and the mixed potential use cases of open models.- Company aims to develop AI tools for everyday people and firms\n- Some view this as a refreshingly positive alternative to tech alarmism\n- Others criticize the company's marketing tactics and potential job loss resulting from AI advances\n- There is debate regarding the validity of concerns about superintelligent AI taking over the world\n- OpenAI and StabilityAI both discussed, with varying opinions on their impact and potential for innovation and stability\n- Open-source technology is both praised and criticized for its role in innovation in the tech industrySummary: \n- The text is a list of links and resources related to Y Combinator's Summer 2023 program. \n- Y Combinator is a startup accelerator that provides funding and mentorship to early-stage companies. \n- The guidelines, FAQ, and lists pages provide information for prospective applicants on program requirements, application deadlines, and past companies that have participated. \n- The API page may be relevant for software engineers interested in using Y Combinator's data in their own projects. \n- The Security and Legal pages likely provide information on Y Combinator's policies and procedures. \n- Contact information is available for those who want to reach out to Y Combinator directly.",

        "content": "An article details how to configure a home server running Ubuntu Linux to automatically sleep on idle and wake on demand, primarily for hosting Time Machine backups. The solution involves enabling Wake-on-LAN to wake the server via unicast packets and configuring network services, including ARP Stand-in and Avahi, to maintain network connectivity while the server is asleep. Additionally, the article shares code to determine idle/busy state and automate suspension to RAM via a cron job. The article notes the need for a separate always-on Linux device and a network interface device that supports Wake-on-LAN with unicast packets.A new solution called ARP Stand-in allows a network device (such as a router) to respond to ARP requests on behalf of a sleeping server, triggering its wake-up. The author implemented it using Ruby and libpcap, with a filter for ARP request packets targeting the sleeping server's IP address. The author also encountered and solved unwanted wake-up issues caused by AFP packets and NetBIOS queries. Additionally, the article explains how to disable IPv6 and use port mirroring to capture packets from an intermediary device between the server and the rest of the network.- A Mac failed to resolve its IP address, causing it to not send any packets to the server.\n- The author used Avahi, a main mDNS implementation for Linux, as a stand-in service for the ARP.\n- Using .service files to configure Raspberry Pi didn't work, so the author experimented with avahi-publish, which worked.\n- The author created a systemd service definition that automatically runs avahi-publish on boot.\n- The setup has worked well for over a month, and the author hopes it works for others too.",

        "hn_content": "A user on Hacker News shared an article about setting up a Linux home server to sleep on idle and wake on-demand. The setup requires a Raspberry Pi, which one user thinks is not performant enough during restores or browsing the backups. However, another user suggests using the RPi as a stepping stone that syncs its files to the 'real' backup server on a daily/weekly timer instead of an on-demand setup. There are suggestions for low-power server operation, including using wifi or configuring ethernet for low-power operation. Some users suggest alternative mini PCs like the Beelink and Topton NAS boards. ChatGPT is recommended as a quicker means for figuring out approaches for tech projects.The post discusses ChatGPT and its usefulness for troubleshooting with old technology. Some commenters share their experiences with using ChatGPT, while others discuss their struggles with backups and sleeping Raspberry Pi. The post does not offer any new information or exciting developments.- The shortage of RPi is apparently due to companies snapping them all for industrial uses.\n- RPis are incredibly reliable pieces of equipment for their gentle price, with few cases of sudden death.\n- Setting up an RPi might be a pain, but once set up, the maintenance is minimal.\n- RPis are popular for their low energy consumption.\n- It is possible to remotely wake up a PC using a Raspberry Pi or microcontroller. \n- Raspberry Pi can run the OS on an SD card and mount the disk for backup storage, utilizing power-saving modes for spinning down unused HDDs.\n- The post engages in a discussion of the feasibility of power-saving features and the difficulties surrounding the definition of \"idle.\"A discussion thread on HN covers a variety of topics around power usage and backups, including the reliability and practicality of Wake on LAN setups and self-hosted backups versus cloud services, as well as concerns around privacy and surveillance. Some participants also discuss their personal experiences with minimizing power usage in their own setups, including using CLI tools to keep machines awake or disabling proprietary management interfaces that prevent deep suspend modes. Additionally, some users report difficulties seeing diagrams on HN due to dark mode compatibility issues on the site.Readers discuss options for building low-power home servers, including using mini PCs, smartphones with custom firmware, and low-power desktop CPUs. They also share tips on how to optimize power usage, such as spinning down hard drives and using power-efficient power supplies. Some readers express interest in a low-power chip with high PCIe and RAM capabilities, while others caution against the lack of market demand for such a product. One reader laments the lack of support for ARP in IPv6.- IPv4 and IPv6 can be run simultaneously, but the issue is that some packets may not be sent\n- An ND proxy server can be used for wake-on-LAN with IPv6\n- A Raspberry Pi can control wake-on-LAN with an SSH command\n- IPv6 can function as a primary with IPv4 as a fallback, although there may be a few quirks\n- CGNAT may break TCP, which is why some people prefer IPv6\n- Roughly 40% of Google users use IPv6Discussion on the slow adoption of IPv6 technology and its benefits, such as simplified configuration and removal of address scarcity. Some users have unique situations that require IPv6 for easier connectivity, and there are debates on the best methods for powering on and off machines to save energy. Some users recommend using OpenWRT or home automation tools to manage machine power more effectively. ARP Stand-in and Proxy ARP are also discussed as solutions for exposing services.A discussion thread on Hacker News features different strategies for minimizing power usage by home servers. Some contributors suggest using a power-hungry NAS controlled by PiKVM, while others recommend setting up a USFF PC with 2 external HDDs as NAS and using a Raspberry Pi as an always-on device. Some users reported difficulties with the suspend and resume function in Linux for laptops. The users suggest that magic packet and solid-state tech can help to minimize power usage. Finally, to prevent unwanted wake-ups, ensure no device on the network is sending extraneous packets to the server.A post on HN describes how to wake up a sleeping server with ARP spoofing by adding another device, like a Raspberry Pi, to the network. The post goes into detail about configuring the Pi to listen for incoming TCP connections and tell the server to wake up. While some commenters recommend alternative methods, such as using a smarter router or leveraging cloud providers, others appreciate the detailed write-up and the opportunity to learn from it. The post includes helpful diagrams and a list of necessary components.",

        "content": "Offline Is Just Online With Extreme Latency2023-04-18I just finished watching \u201cLocal-first Software\u201d by Peter Van Hardenberg and loved it!He talks about changing the paradigm we\u2019re currently in where a program runs in the cloud and we look at it when we\u2019re online, to one where the program runs on the device in our hands and we send data to the cloud for \u201cdurability or accessibility\u201d. In other words, leverage the cloud without being dependent on it.It almost sounds like a form of resilient design (i.e. progressive enhancement) if you think about it \u2014 the cloud as an optional, layered enhancement of your application. Now that\u2019s a paradigm shift!It\u2019s kind of absurd when you think about it, almost like \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do this easily yet?\u201d Two computers in the same room can\u2019t talk to each other directly. Instead they must talk through the AWS server farm in Virginia. Here\u2019s Peter:You want to work with a co-worker on a piece of software? If you're in the same room, sitting at the same table, looking at screens side-by-side, any communication between those two computers is actually happening [by sending signals] across the ocean to some data center, to some other server and then coming back to you. One: that's crazy. But two, it's also very slow and expensive and it doesn't have to be that way.Peter actually starts his talk by comparing the enterprise-level software and cloud services we build today to building a billions-of-dollars aircraft carrier. Somehow, because the tech behemoths are building aircraft carriers, the rest of us are all modeling everything we build as an aircraft carrier too.A lot of the time we're using the techniques to build aircraft carriers when what we really need is a bicycle: something simple, something personal, something that can take you where you need to go and that responds to you alone (and is a heck of a lot easier to maintain and operate).Unfortunately, some of the open technologies for building more local-first, p2p applications just aren\u2019t there yet. Like Peter\u2019s point on webRTC.In the case of webRTC, I've seen so many projects do this where they\u2019re like, \u201cIt\u2018s peer-to-peer! You just connect to the signaling server and then the things talks!\u201d That\u2019s not really peer-to-peer cause you've got a server. If you've already got a server...my advice is: don't mess around with peer-to-peer stuff, just use that server.I really loved the shift of perspective Peter provides around \u201coffline\u201d vs \u201conline\u201d. Don't think of them as two different things, because then you create software that splits experiences into two different modes: 1) \u201conline\u201d which gets all the support and attention, and 2) \u201coffline\u201d which gets little to no thought at all.Instead, you can think of online/offline as part of the same continuum just different measurements of latency. There are gradations of latency when you\u2019re \u201conline\u201d, and \u201coffline\u201d is merely at the slowest end of that spectrum. For example:Wifi: < 300ms latency3G: 1s latencyOffline: 30 seconds to days of latency (until you sync back online)I love that! Again, it feels like an incredibly resilient way to approach building for the web \u2014 even an internet connection is an enhancement! Here\u2019s a slide from Peter\u2019s presentation:This kind of idea would move you away from a product full of API calls to one based on data synchronization.The generalized principle underlying in this idea, as Peter points out, is that when you shift the way you think about building things you open new doors to building different things. So, even if you don\u2019t like the idea of data synchronization over API transactions, it\u2019s at least worth entertaining and imagining what\u2019s possible in a paradigm that\u2019s different than what you\u2019re used to.I love the notion of shifting the idea of two binaries, online/offline, to a spectrum of latency where \u201coffline\u201d is merely the most extreme form of latency. It makes you think differently. You even begin to realize that \u201coffline\u201d has its own gradations: latency of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or more! They\u2019re not all the same and represent a more accurate, all-encompassing picture of the kinds of environments real-world users live in.Reply via: Email, Twitter, Mastodon",
        "summary": "- Peter Van Hardenberg advocates for local-first software where programs run on devices and leverage the cloud for \"durability or accessibility\" without being dependent on it.\n- Traditional enterprise-level software and cloud services are like building expensive aircraft carriers when simple, personal, and easy-to-maintain tools are needed.\n- Online and offline should be thought of as a continuum with different levels of latency.\n- Offline is merely the most extreme form of latency and has its own gradations of seconds, minutes, hours, days, and more.\n- Shifting the idea of online/offline binaries to a spectrum of latency opens new doors for building different things.",

        "hn_content": "\"The Tech Times\" reports on a discussion among Hacker News users regarding the concept of offline versus online applications. Users debate whether offline should be considered simply as online with extreme latency or a distinct category with its own requirements. The conversation delves into the differences between pessimistic versus optimistic UI and data locality versus data ownership. Many users agree that conflict resolution is a complex issue when dealing with offline apps. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of designing solutions that can handle both the online and offline environment.The article discusses the concept of optimistic UI, which allows for seamless updates when working with slower sync states. The text highlights limitations to using optimistic UI, such as the need for immediate consistency in certain transactions. The article also touches on the importance of planning for offline communication phases and surface online resources and actions for users explicitly. Finally, it proposes a move towards a data synchronization-based approach to products, as opposed to one based on API calls.This post discusses the challenges of offline-first applications, particularly conflict resolution. The design guideline \"Offline Is Just Online with Extreme Latency\" reflects event-driven architectures and state transitions, and the complexity of multi-user apps. Optimistic UI, although less familiar, is argued to be less complex to build. Offline-first experiences have to be carefully designed to treat everything as a source of truth and handle schema and business logic migrations. The complexity of online infrastructure is often overlooked, with emphasizes placed on UI. Ads continue to be a problem in online experiences.Tech industry insiders discuss the frustrating slow-down of online applications, caused by a range of programming issues across React, Electron-based applications and Controlled Input Components. Examples of common issues are keyboard shortcuts triggered by fast typing, deleted text and the cursor moving to the beginning of a string. Discussions on the topic extend to a preference for more peer-to-peer applications, rather than needing to rely on online connectivity to function.- The move from local P2P to internet-based services was driven by simplifying configuration, state, and discovery processes.\n- Internet-based services offer more reliability, flexibility, and simplicity in deployment and management in any environment.\n- The move to cloud-first paradigm offers benefits such as easy data migration and easy access to software that was previously inaccessible due to pricing models.\n- However, some users prefer locally executing software with local persistence over cloud-based services because of privacy and control concerns, and change in software behavior without direct opt-in.\n- To each user, the choice of either approach depends largely on their needs, preferences, and what they find most effective for their workflow.People prefer software that enables them to invent and do nice things over pre-designed processes. They want to use software that doesn't seek access to their personal information without consent. A plug-and-play box with a well-defined API for storage and sync is not an insurmountable engineering problem. Most companies don't want to operate all the infrastructure they need to run their core workloads. Managed cloud services are a boon to small to medium-sized companies. Collaboration is a niche, but collaboration software is often in demand in businesses. Most people use their phones for almost everything, which is almost all local execution, local persistence and huge amounts of cloud-based collaboration.The conversation revolves around the benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing and the push for offline-first solutions. Some commenters prefer cloud services for their flexibility and accessibility, while others argue for the advantages of offline-first models, particularly in terms of data security and privacy. The conversation touches upon various technical challenges, such as NAT and discovery systems, and discusses potential solutions, including federated standards and mesh networks. Some commenters also share anecdotes about older collaboration tools and contrast them with modern systems.- Spotty internet can cause software to not work properly\n- A printer that is compatible with multiple protocols can make choosing one difficult\n- A WiFi direct printer may work well with Linux out of the box\n- The author enjoys having physical copies of things in the digital age\n- The proliferation of chat platforms has made it difficult to get everyone on the same service\n- IPv4 exhaustion and CGNAT have negatively impacted the internet\n- Linux and Windows have different approaches to updates and reboots\n- The reality of the internet has changed since the 90s, leading to changes in product design such as DRM-locked printers and carsNo meaningful content found.The article argues that offline-first applications are important for data ownership and privacy. It highlights that the tech community is more focused on building online applications and infrastructure, relegating offline functionality to edge cases. The comment section discusses the challenges of building offline functionality, such as conflict resolution and security concerns. The importance of offline tolerance in apps like Google Maps, iMessage, and weather apps is also mentioned. The discussion centers around whether shifting problems onto users is acceptable and whether offline-first is a viable solution for collaborative tools.Several contributors sparked a discussion about the limitations and advantages of offline and online connectivity, and ways to bridge the two. Specifically, this includes\u00a0approaches to building offline-first applications, the strengths and weaknesses of different metaphors for offline/online functionality, distributed file systems, and more. The conversation is nuanced, ranging from general critiques of online-centered software development to specific suggestions for bridging the gap between offline and online functionality. No significant new tech or products were mentioned.Various HN commenters discuss the pros and cons of offline vs. online communication and the importance of resilient design. Some commenters highlight the benefits of local, offline-first design and others argue that online communication has its advantages. A few commenters discuss the challenges of DR, Business Continuity, and resiliency in cloud environments, as well as the cost of cloud infrastructure. One commenter even coins the term \"CLIFMO\" to describe their approach to software design (defaulting to CLI, monolithic, local-hosted, and offline-only).",

Users share their experiences, noting that while the AI can provide accurate and helpful answers, it can also be confidently wrong on more complicated or obscure topics. Some suggest that the quality of ChatGPT's answers could be improved by training it on a higher quality corpus. However, others warn against relying too heavily on the AI for learning, as it could lead to overconfidence and mistakes.- ChatGPT may be useful for writing simple glue code Python scripts, but it is generally not useful for complex tasks.\n- ChatGPT gives incorrect information frequently and it is not reliable for difficult tasks.\n- ChatGPT provides basic information that can be useful for non-experts.\n- Large language models are not reliable due to the lack of source materials in certain areas that have not been covered in a few different ways. \n- The ability to interact with ChatGPT and ask questions, request feedback, and challenge mistakes can be helpful. \n- Plugins and similar techniques may improve the reliability of large language models.Individuals are discussing their experiences with ChatGPT, an AI language model. Some find it helpful for providing references, though it can sometimes generate false information. The AI sometimes lacks an understanding of niche or exotic topics, but it is useful in directing research towards relevant information. It may be necessary to validate information, and some individuals may spend more time verifying information than learning from it. ChatGPT can learn from corrections, and GPT-4 may be more accurate. It was trained on Stack Overflow responses.The post discusses the limitations and effectiveness of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot created by OpenAI. The author shares their experiences using ChatGPT to solve a variety of technical and non-technical problems, including networking and programming tasks. Some commenters compare the chatbot to an excitable intern, while others emphasize the potential time savings it can offer. However, many note that ChatGPT can sometimes provide misleading or incorrect information, particularly with more complex tasks. Overall, the post serves as a useful exploration of the capabilities and limitations of existing chatbot technology.Several individuals discuss using ChatGPT for various applications, including understanding bookkeeping, language learning, and technical literature. Some express concern about the model's potential to hallucinate responses, while others emphasize the importance of critical thinking and checking the information provided. Despite the potential challenges, users appear impressed with ChatGPT's ability to teach, translate, and provide understandable explanations. Additionally, there is discussion about democratizing highly technical content with simplified prose, as many students and novice engineers find some academic writing to be obtuse and difficult to understand.A student describes using ChatGPT as a tutoring tool to understand quantum information science concepts for work. ChatGPT offers intuitive justifications for complex mathematical problems, correcting misconceptions and providing examples. Some commenters express concern about hallucinations and false understanding. However, others say that ChatGPT is a game changer for learning and provides access to expert information. The use of AI for learning has the potential to benefit those who currently lack valuable skills, regardless of economic output.Developing country workers have minimal value capture despite being able to create value; one potential reason is branding and advertising. Globalized flattening could lead to poverty for a vast majority, as the rich own the means of production, real estate, intellectual property, and influence government systems to maintain it (regulatory capture, dirty campaign financing). The number of people living in poverty in the US has decreased, but poverty has taken different forms with different effects. Capitalism values skills based on market value, which can lead to low value for those in poorly functioning economies. People may be valued independently of economic output in other economic frameworks, but they may not be common. Middle-class generation can occur through modernization and education in poor countries.The raw text content does not have any meaningful technical or industry-related content. It primarily consists of discussions on societal issues and opinions on economic value and personal responsibility. Some comments include dark or sarcastic humor, which may not be suitable for all readers.Experts debate the pros and cons of population control measures in a discussion on Hacker News. Suggestions include economic incentives, female education, and access to contraceptives. The debate extends to the role of farmers and hunter-gatherers in the global economy and the misunderstood nature of writing and software development. Participants express concern about the limitations of language and machine-generated writing. There is little new or exciting news in this post.Experts debate if generative models will revolutionize writing the way smartphones changed photography\n\nPhotography has become a hobby accessible to almost everyone with their smartphones, but it hasn't advanced the art of photography. AI-generated writing could follow a similar path, leading to a massive volume of average content.\n\nGenerative models could democratize writing and help people generate more text, but skeptics believe it would lead to a new form of illiteracy rather than a beneficial process. AI-generated text could lead to the elimination of lower-paying writing jobs, but not necessarily middle or high-salary ones.\n\nSome argue that generative models won't affect good writers and writing, but only those with low writing skills. Others believe that it could help those unable to afford writing lessons or people whose language is not their forte.\n\nAI chatbots can generate poor code, and similar issues may arise with AI-generated text. Lawmakers and judges adopting generated text is a big concern. However, the demand for high-quality creative writing may stay unchanged, while the supply will also stay relatively the same.The article discusses the potential for AI to write content and replace human writers. It cites examples of commercially successful authors with poor writing and highlights that writers are often seen as a brand. The conversation includes arguments for and against the idea that AI will replace writers, with one argument being that AI will make a gap between good and poor quality content wider. Others argue that AI writing tools will enhance human productivity, but will not replace human writers entirely. The article concludes that AI threatens the middle and will force all writers to change strategy.The rise of AI has raised concerns about job security for writers, photographers, and graphic designers. However, it is unlikely to replace those whose work centers around graphic design as it is their core competency. Similarly, while the number of professional news photographers has decreased, the overall demand for professional photography remains. The AI tools' capabilities need to expand significantly to replace web designers and logo makers' already existing tools and Fiverr contractors' requirement. The emergence of AI may make the barrier to entry for writing lower, but gaining enough experience to become a specialist in the field is still challenging. It is unlikely to replace specialists' established brand/style, and centralized institutions emphasizing quality criteria could be successful.- C++ with templates eliminated the need for manual collection creation, leading to increased productivity in programming\n- Technology has repeatedly made old ways of doing things obsolete, including human computers in banks and spreadsheets\n- ChatGPT can help with transforming abstract ideas into well-written text for non-native English speakers\n- ChatGPT is not a replacement for unique, top-notch professional writers but can augment the vast majority of people who struggle with effective and efficient communication\n- Lazy SEO spammers are poor writers, but the best writers pore over their writing more than others\n- Fast writing is not particularly important or difficult, though hunting for strong, crisp verbs is the minimum standard for writing for mass consumption\n- ChatGPT could potentially generate a high quantity of low-quality articles, adding to the already existing problem of books with little to sayAI-powered language models are improving productivity for writers and editors in commercial and creative fields. The tool can help writers start their works or can be used for brainstorming and organizing. The emergence of AI\u00a0tools is not expected to make writers more interesting or better at creating content that is not mainly commercial. Writers with broader or latter domain knowledge can leverage the tools, separating them from those turning out low-value content. Despite\u00a0their efficiency, AI tools still cannot replace a good writer's work entirely. Writing might soon become a significant part of everyone's job, while many writers and editors might need to change careers.N/A",

        "content": "A debate between social scientists on whether social media is the primary cause of the teenage mental illness epidemic has emerged. Critics believe that while social media is not harmless, the evidence is not strong enough to support claims of harm. However, proponents argue that something significant is happening to the mental health of teenagers that began around 2012, and that no alternative explanation exists. Teenage girls in multiple countries began reporting higher rates of anxiety and depression around this time, and the rate continued to rise throughout the decade. The search for the cause of this epidemic continues.Proposition 1: Rates of mental illness and social media usage don't have a clear cause-and-effect relationship, with even falling rates coinciding with rising social media use. Skeptics are challenged to present an alternative theory that can explain the epidemic as neatly as the SSM theory.\n\nProposition 2: Skeptics demand a high level of skepticism grounded in \"beyond reasonable doubt,\" which is appropriate for criminal cases, but not for civil cases that only require a preponderance of evidence. Skeptics require clear evidence of large effects, which is currently lacking in social media and mental illness studies.\n\nProposition 3: The skeptics' skepticism is rooted in the small effect sizes of social media usage and mental illness studies, with correlations between the two variables being typically below 0.10. Skeptics should remember that the dataset is not reality and that small effect sizes don't rule out the possibility of an epidemic.- Correlational studies in social sciences are limited by imperfect measurement, leading to a crude proxy of questions that cannot capture the nuanced reality of social media use and mental health outcomes.\n- Disagreement between scientists over the size of the correlation between social media use and mental health problems exists, but recent research suggests the key correlation is somewhere between r = .15 and r = .20.\n- Social media may be particularly harmful to girls, leading to correlations larger than those for boys.\n- Researchers often focus on one causal model when turning a question into variables they can measure, but this may obscure other potential causal pathways.- The most common model for social media research is a \"dose-response\" model that treats social media as a chemical substance, but there are other causal models that should be considered.\n- Two of the causal models that could explain the rise in teen mental illness are the sensitive period model and the loss-of-IRL model.\n- The author recommends measures such as delaying smartphones until high school, having phone-free schools, and raising the age of \"internet adulthood\" to 16.\n- If these measures are enacted and later proven unnecessary, there is minimal harm, but not taking action could lead to continued suffering among young people.The federal government has done nothing to reduce underage use of smartphones, which seem to be harming millions of teens. The age at which children get their first smartphone continues to drop while rates of mental illness continue to rise. This calls for a national and global discussion about whether smartphones and social media interfere with healthy adolescent development. Skeptics are needed to raise counterarguments against alarm ringers and to point out weaknesses in evidence. Age verification can be done through innovative methods already offered by companies like Clear for purchases of alcohol at sporting events.",

There is a debate on the need for support for marginalized groups, increased connections, and the link between population density and suicide rates. The conversation also touches on the difficulties of parenting teenagers in the age of social media and the need for finding a balance between online and real-world activities. Overall, the post highlights the complexity of the topic and the need for a nuanced discussion on the effects of social media on mental health.Due to helicopter parenting and limited opportunities for teenagers to be truly independent, kids are spending less time free roaming and more time on screens, which could limit their development of independence. Some argue that communication tools and multiplayer video games like Minecraft can allow for a degree of independence and social interaction away from parental supervision. However, the lumping of video games and social media together might obscure the impact of social media on mental health outcomes, especially for boys. The shift towards never-ending, always-online video games that encourage addictive behavior is concerning, and some argue for measures to protect people under 18 from feeds without restricting messaging. Suburbanization and stranger danger have also contributed to a lack of outdoor activity for kids.Social media has affected the lives of children; thanks to mandatory hobbies, children's free time has decreased, and social media has intruded into every aspect of their lives. Growing up in a dense city highlights the need for public shared spaces and mom-n-pop stores that promote a sense of community. Pressure to fill their time with activities from an early age, helicopter parenting, and the increasing lack of tolerance for failure has led to increased mental health issues in teenagers. The lack of teenagers roaming outside for playtime, as seen in earlier generations, is a problem that needs addressing. Male use of social media in the form of gaming is categorically different to Instagram/Snapchat/Tiktok-type social media use.&nbsp;The post discusses the difficulty in understanding the human mind and its causes of depression. The author argues that the psychology field relies too heavily on data, which can be unreliable due to the complexity of the human mind. However, other commenters argue that population-level data has been used to establish the correlation between adverse childhood events and the development of depression. They suggest that researchers can identify causes of depression by supplementing self-reports with objective data. The post raises questions about the reliability of self-reporting and the replicability of psychology studies.This post includes a discussion about social media and its potential effects on mental health. The author argues that studies on \"social media\" are too broad and fail to distinguish between different platforms. They note that girls who spend more than four hours a day on social media have increased rates of depression. Some commenters push back on this argument, suggesting that there are other factors that could be contributing to the rise in depression globally. One commenter questions why people would adopt cognitive dissonance by acting as if they believe in free will when they do not, and another agrees with the need for a justice system that is not cruel.Social media causes mental health issues, not the other way around.\nThe available evidence supports this claim.\nTeen mental health issues have skyrocketed since 2012, and social media emerged around that time.\nThe direction of causality is difficult to establish.\nStudies are difficult to conduct on long-term behavior adjustments like social media use and mental health.\nParents are becoming aware of the harms of social media but struggle with containing their children's use.\nThe argument for raising the age of \"internet adulthood\" to 16 is questionable.\nHaidt's rebuttal of the climate change hypothesis is unconvincing as climate change fears are not energizing, and public sentiment is that we are already doomed.The comment thread discusses the impact of climate change on the mental health of young people. Anecdotes are shared about individuals seeking help for anxiety related to climate change, while others argue that the impact is overstated. The conversation also touches on the role of social media in spreading alarmist messages about climate change. Overall, the discussion highlights the complex interactions between personal psychology, culture, and technology as they relate to our perception of climate crises.The comments discuss the lack of activism surrounding climate change and the difficulty of convincing individuals to change their lifestyles to combat it. The root of the issue is attributed to people's unwillingness to cut consumption habits or make lifestyle changes, such as eating less meat, driving smaller cars, or traveling less. The reality is that the majority of greenhouse emissions come from corporations and collective change would be necessary to make a significant impact on reaching net-zero emissions. The comments also point out that blaming only corporations and governments is not fair as individuals can make a difference by making conscious choices about what they buy and consume.70% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the top 100 fossil fuel producers; the largest being state-owned companies. Capitalism prioritizes profit, making less harmful means less profitable, and corporations are not going to change without legislation. While activism is important, it often stops short at raising awareness and lacks the essential coordinated effort, lobbying, and donations that drove the Civil Rights movement. Blaming individuals for not doing enough is ignoring the significant outsized impact that the 100 companies have on the environment. Social media has a role in climate catastrophism but renewable energy sources are not ineffective.Energy consumption is a significant issue as there is no ideal alternative to fossil fuels, which serve as the four pillars of modern society. Wind and solar power are seen as regressive technologies that require fossil fuels to even become a reality, and only breakthroughs like fusion and molten salt generators can work at scale. The public is successfully manipulated by fossil fuel industries to equate \"renewable energy\" with not being capable of providing base load. Social media may be a poor substitute for social connection, and poor parenting practices reinforce this unhealthy relationship.No meaningful content.The discussion revolves around the effects of smartphone use and social media addiction. A comparison has been made to the previous habit of reading newspapers on public transport. Thalidomide's use in cancer medication during pregnancy is discussed.

        "hn_content": "GTK+3 port of GIMP is officially completed, according to the developer. Developers discuss the importance of backwards compatibility for user space, Linux's success, and breaking user space, mentioning Windows' level of compatibility in making an operating system. Microsoft's extensibility of APIs is noted, as well as the trend throughout the tech industry of rewriting components from scratch and not bothering to shim over old interfaces. Discussion continues regarding the importance of a good interface and the difficulty of engineering one for new projects.Windows backward compatibility is a point of praise for Microsoft and a crucial factor in retaining users. Microsoft has invested substantial resources to maintain backward compatibility, which shields users from having to replace their old software. Despite the challenges with backward compatibility, a few users have implemented workarounds such as running 16-bit Windows binaries on 64-bit platforms. The compatibility approach of Microsoft seems to focus more on individual applications rather than the larger framework. The win32 API is generally stable, and its longevity is attributed to minimal tinkering from developers, leading to fewer glitches.- Old Linux stuff can be made to work by finding and installing relevant libraries.\n- Windows backwards compatibility is better because new stuff tends to be backwards compatible with old stuff.\n- Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a Windows game that uses the Quake 3 engine.\n- Wine is sometimes better for running old games than modern Windows.\n- There is an open source multiplayer version of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, which is kept updated and backward compatible.\n- Glade has issues with Gtk4 libraries and Cambalache is its successor, which has issues of its own.\n- GNOME lacks a good UI builder with IDE integration and no current plans to fill this gap.\n- Qt and GTK do not frequently ignore backward compatibility.Debian 12 (\"Bookworm\") will continue to include GTK2, even though it is EOL and no longer receiving updates, which will allow apps written for GTK2 20 years ago to still work. However, some distributions are trying to remove GTK2, so it's only a matter of time before it breaks. GTK3 broke themes but not API or ABI, and while some attempts have been made to create a common markup format to generate UI code, it is difficult due to variations in widget availability and behaviors across platforms. Building a high-quality GUI toolkit is a massive undertaking and requires maturity, completeness, and a lot of effort.Many newer UI toolkits, including those by giants like Microsoft, don't have common widgets like tableview/datagrid, which forces developers to use third-party widgets that are often half-baked and lack battle testing or create their own widgets. Third-party widgets are often commercially licensed, making it especially problematic for broke programmers. Motif Window Manager (MWM) is similar to twm but comes with regular-sized color icons, and after updating GTK's original toolkit, Motif may become post-modern-ish.QT is a commercial and proprietary product, while GKT has no customers, and GNOME deliberately sabotaged the free and open-source ecosystem. GNOME broke API twice and declared widely used APIs as \"internal interface\" and broke backwards compatibility.A developer proposes a way to enable seamless binary compatibility in APIs and interfaces, using an Abstract Syntax Tree to create a deterministic structure and hash symbols to correspond to in-memory layout index offset, which would allow refactoring of logic and code without breaking the data structure. Some readers discuss their experiences with GIMP and GTK, including complaints about toolbar hiding and lack of aesthetically pleasing themes in the latest version. It is noted that while GTK 3.24 is now up to the 29th point release, it is frozen at 3.24 and only receives bug/security fixes. A reader mentions implementing some of the ideas in Unison.GTK3 has been around since 2011, and with the move to GTK4, developers hope to achieve consistency in theming and improved HiDPI support. However, some users don't think the changes are worth it, and others criticize the backward compatibility issues with Gtk devs. GIMP, one of the oldest open-source apps, has been continuously developed and now wants to move to GTK4 for better Wayland compatibility, support for HiDPI, and a cleaner look. While its developers are dedicated to the project, some users have experienced data loss using GIMP.A user experienced data loss after failing to save/export using GIMP, despite ignoring a warning. The issue was caused by not knowing which images were exported. Non-destructive editing is planned for introduction in GIMP 3.2, and GIMP is currently working on migrating to Gtk4. The possibility of GIMP porting to Qt was jokingly suggested. The post elicited comments on GIMP's naming, and GIMP was compared to Krita. Overall, the post highlights issues GIMP faces with data loss and competing against other image editors.GTK2 has been deprecated, and users are encouraged to switch to GTK3 or GTK4.\nSome users prefer to stick with GTK2 for better results.\nOpinions on switching to GTK4 are mixed, with some preferring to wait for GTK5 or switch to Qt instead.\nKDE and its accompanying applications are a potential alternative to GTK.",

        "hn_content": "An article on \"farawaytimes.blogspot.com\" explores ways to make good small games and avoid perfectionism. Many developers get caught up in the details that block their ideas, like worrying about multiple resolutions, framework management, menu systems, data representations or entity component systems. Prioritizing ideas, establishing playable game loops and incubating multiple game ideas are measures to combat perfectionism. Additionally, the article recommends sharing designs with others to get feedback that could foster growth and increase chances of success. Ultimately, the article asserts that balance lies in making the game seem balanced and fun, not necessarily rigidly balanced.Game developers discuss the importance of playtesting and designing small, iterative versions of games before expanding upon them. Balancing games for fairness and strategically limiting project scope are also important considerations. A variety of game jam competitions are recommended for honing these skills. However, some game genres, such as FPSRPGs or simRTSs, may be difficult to distill into simpler, smaller games without fundamentally altering them. Already-popular games such as Uno may benefit from intentionally unbalanced gameplay if it enhances the overall experience.Engineer-types drawn to game development often lose themselves in code and tech, rather than focusing on the game's objective. Making small games is essential to start, and there is a lot of benefit in doing so. Minecraft evolved over time and gained immense popularity, with the addition of the infinite world, powerful features like redstone, slimeblock machines, complex farms, gear progression, and new environments. But even an early iteration of the game was cool from the start, and game development needs to be appreciated from that perspective.The post is about the benefits of making small games, and how to conceptualize the process. The post includes advice on game design and technical implementation. Readers recommend other small games and give their own experiences of game development. The post highlights the difficulties and rewards of game development and satisfaction of creating something unique. People should know that creating small games requires more critical taste and an understanding of the medium.

        "hn_content": "Researchers have developed Zero-shot speech and singing synthesizers, which enables synthesizing new voices and singing styles without any training data. The new technology, discussed on Hacker News, has raised concerns about the potential abuse of deepfake voice spoofing techniques, which can be easily accomplished by smart script kiddies with ML expertise. The discussion led to a debate on AI alignment and the complexity of human values, as they have not yet been meaningfully formalized, leaving room for deviations that can lead to unexpected tragedies. The exchange also raised ethical questions about the vast amounts of personal data contributed to massive datasets.The post discusses how to identify an imposter by asking about a fictional person or event. It also includes a conversation using GPT-4 to explain how the T-800 in Terminator 2 deduced that John's foster parents were dead. There are discussions about GPT-4's emotional intelligence and how to access it. The post also includes an example conversation from Seinfeld to test GPT-4's response to a non-sequitur prompt. Despite confusion about the Seinfeld reference, GPT-4 provides possible explanations for George's conclusion that something was wrong with Jerry.A recent experiment has shown that GPT-3 can create deepfake voices that are hard to distinguish from real ones, raising concerns of how the technology could be used to spread misinformation. Researchers have urged practitioners to develop tools that detect AI-synthesized voices and to not abuse the technology. Moreover, transfer learning seems to make these models learn general properties that could apply to very different tasks. Similarly, humans can sometimes fail at logic puzzles due to a lack of context, but changing variables or avoiding common priors could help avoid errors.Experts discuss the nature and mechanics of Language Learning Models (LLMs), specifically in terms of how they represent knowledge. LLMs are able to encode relationships between tokens as proximity in one or more dimensions in absurdly high-dimensional vector spaces, allowing them to learn concepts and not just recognize individual words. There is speculation that LLMs could therefore be used as universal translators. The discussion touches upon future concerns of digital identity authentication and the potential for cyber criminals to misuse the technology.Experts debate the benefits and challenges of authenticating whether a user is speaking to a human or an AI over the phone, mainly on detecting if the speaker has malicious intent. It's challenging to distinguish between humans and machines, and some experts suggest using other solutions to the underlying problem. Other discussions revolve around the technical aspects of voice authentication and synthesis technology, such as NaturalSpeech and diffusion models, which are seeing significant progress. These changes could have implications for music composition, speech recognition, and other related technologies.Microsoft's NaturalSpeech 2 can synthesize speech that mimics human voices, with potential for misuse, prompting an ethics statement from the company as a caution against misuse. The code for NaturalSpeech 2 is not yet published, and it is currently deployed exclusively for use on Microsoft Azure. The model is an example of zero-shot learning, where the AI is given no direct examples of the synthesized speech.

How do you get one going after three years?ByAmelia McGuireAPRIL 17, 2023SaveShareNormal text sizeLarger text sizeVery large text size84When thousands of long-haul aircraft across the globe were grounded at the onset of the COVID pandemic in 2020, airlines were faced with the question of where to store them.At 73 metres long, 24 metres high and with a take-off weight of up to 560 tonnes, the Airbus A380 is the largest and heaviest passenger aircraft in the world and responsible for a significant chunk of international flying. Aircraft of this size require lots of space and arid conditions, making the world\u2019s deserts the opportune (and arguably the only) place to keep them.Qantas was criticised for slipping standards after flights resumed following the end of COVID-19 restrictions.Aircraft boneyards have stored retired and damaged planes since the end of the Second World War and are vital to keeping the industry afloat, but the COVID-19 pandemic was the first time the world\u2019s deserts were tested by so many simultaneously.This month, the last Qantas Airbus A380 embarked on its long voyage home after close to 1000 days in Victorville boneyard within California\u2019s Mojave Desert. Qantas was Australia\u2019s only long-haul carrier during the pandemic and although its planes may be close to back in action, the airline does not expect its international flying to return to pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024.RELATED ARTICLEOpinionAviationWhy the promised airfare price relief looks like a mirageElizabeth KnightBusiness columnistThis is partly because of the complexity of returning an aircraft of such magnitude to service. Reviving an A380 requires 4500 hours of manpower, where its 22 wheels, 16 brakes and internal furnishings are replaced. Tasks including replacing all oxygen cylinders, fire extinguishers and inflatable slides have derailed the process for some airlines by months, due to the ongoing global supply shortage of crucial parts.For Qantas engineers, reviving an A380 meant two months of work per aircraft in the sweltering Mojave Desert. Some lucky engineers were tasked with whacking the wheels of each plane to rid them of rattlesnakes or other unsuspecting foes.The airline\u2019s executive manager of engineering, Scott McConnell, said 100 of his engineers found themselves working through extreme weather \u2013 ranging from snow and icy cold storms to unforgiving heat. The only constant was the dust that enveloped everything.A Qantas A380 in one of Victorville\u2019s storage hangars.\u201cThe entire aircraft is wrapped to protect it from moisture, dust and insects. Every opening, panel and crack is taped up \u2013 and that\u2019s just the outside. There\u2019s plastic covering everything from the carpets to the seats inside. And there\u2019s desiccant everywhere. Picture unwrapping a new shoe, except bigger,\u201d McConnell said.RELATED ARTICLEAviationAirline competition monitoring ends as fares stay high, new entrants take offBefore the aircraft can be inspected, it needs to be unwrapped, a process that takes considerable time.\u201cThe plane isn\u2019t even on the rack yet. Then there\u2019s a whole series of tests we need to perform from things like fluids to the actual nitrogen and oxygen systems. We store the fuel in the wings to eliminate the water and condensation that would accrue otherwise,\u201d McConnell said.Qantas chief Alan Joyce didn\u2019t mince words about the gruelling nature of this task last October when quizzed about why the airline was taking so long to return to pre-pandemic capacity.\u201cThey jack the aircraft up in the middle of the desert where all of its gear is tested, meaning aircraft\u2019s engines are running around in the desert for months to make sure that it\u2019s functioning. All that work is just to get out of the desert to Los Angeles or to another maintenance facility,\u201d Joyce said.The planes then went through about 1000 additional hours of maintenance testing before returning to service.When global lockdowns eased, cash-strapped airlines were faced with millions of people who\u2019d been deprived of travel for the better part of two years and weren\u2019t prepared to tolerate further delays. Instead, travellers were met with industry-wide staff shortages, confused border control, COVID testing and vaccination requirements, high airfares and supply chain shortages that prevented aircraft from returning to service.Planes in California\u2019s Mojave Desert.CREDIT:GETTY IMAGESSome airlines weathered this storm better than others. Qantas was heavily criticised in 2022 for slipping standards as it failed to juggle the demands of premium-paying customers. Much of the anger was directed at Joyce, who responded with public apologies and promises of improved performance on behalf of the carrier he has led for the past 15 years.Qantas stored 12 of its A380s in Victorville. There are now seven servicing the airline\u2019s London, Los Angeles and Hong Kong routes, with another three expected to return next year following the completion of an extensive maintenance check and cabin reconfiguration process. The remaining two jumbos were left in Victorville to be broken up into parts.Returning existing aircraft to service is not the end of Qantas\u2019 fleet challenges. Although magnificent, Qantas\u2019 fleet of A380s are ageing and the airline is yet to announce a plan to replace them.The carrier\u2019s management have been heavily criticised by some current and former executives, as well as broader industry experts, for downgrading the importance of average fleet age, a metric used by airlines to help determine when to invest in new aircraft.The carrier\u2019s average fleet age now sits at its oldest ever \u2013 15.4 years.Qantas will receive about 80 aircraft over the next four years to replace some of its domestic and international fleet. So far, it\u2019s signed for a dozen A350-1000s. These are expected to service the long-awaited Project Sunrise routes, which will involve direct flights from Melbourne and Sydney to London and New York.RELATED ARTICLEFlashbackFrom the Archives, 1993: End of an airline as Qantas moves inDespite a higher average fleet age than many of its long-haul competitors, Qantas expects to spend $US5 billion ($7.4 billion) over the next four years on fleet investment. UBS research analysts recently downgraded Qantas stock, estimating the carrier would need to invest $12 billion over this period in order to replace expired aircraft and meet its deliveries, as first reported by The Australian.A380s are not very fuel efficient. This is a hurdle for carriers such as Qantas or Emirates that choose to continue to rely on them while striving to meet their emissions-reduction goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. This is part of the reason Qantas has invested heavily in kick-starting Australia\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel industry.Qantas\u2019 investment strategy means those travelling on long-haul flights until at least the end of the decade will be carried by one of the 10 wide-body aircraft that were painstakingly revived after up to 1000 days in the desert.The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

The A380 is a magnificent plane with a smooth flying experience, despite its expensive costs and reduced market demand. ETOPS regulations have lifted, making twin-engine planes more popular and efficient than the tri-jet A340. Emirates, the largest owner of A380s, is asking for a bigger plane to meet the high demand for flying. However, none of the engine manufacturers are interested in developing new engines for the A380, putting the future of the plane in doubt. The windfall of profits due to supply and demand imbalances could lead to manufacturers passively colluding to enjoy profits.Summary:\n\n- China's C919/C929 planes use western avionics and engines, but are playing the long game with a massive domestic market, government support, and over 1,000 orders for the C919.\n- Starship launches could disrupt the airline industry with the potential for point-to-point suborbital flights reducing travel times.\n- Passive collusion in markets is known as \"tacit collusion\" and can lead to higher prices and reduced competition.\n- Engine problems have limited the capacity of the A380 and reduced its competitiveness compared to other wide-body planes.\n- Boeing 737 Max MCAS issue is not the first time the aircraft has had issues.\n- 747 was a success due to accidental product market fit, while the 737 wasn't particularly expensive to design or build.The 737 and 707 planes are classic examples of airplanes, but Boeing's takeover of MCD has been a disaster. The 737 MAX is certified as nearly identical to the 737 NG, 737 Classic, and 737 Jurassic; the only major changes were new flight deck instrumentation, new engines, new wingtips, and a re-lofted tailcone. The MCAS system would have been fine if only it had been based on redundant sensors, had a system that was part of the flight manual, and pilots were trained on it; however, the FAA's failure to blame the code enabled Boeing to cover their mistake.- Airbus changed their focus from successful routes to the \"we are the biggest\" crown with the A380\n- Airbus now has competitors for these routes with planes like A350, A321-XLR, and neo planes\n- The A380 decision was made two decades ago, but Airbus has gone back to what made them successful with mid-range, single-deck two-engine airframes like the A350\n- Boeing will not have a 737/757 replacement for another 10-15 years, and Airbus is getting more of the order book\n- Airbus was able to snag the A220 for next to nothing after Boeing nearly killed the project\n- Hub airlines won't disappear, as stopping mid-flight can be more fuel-efficient and cheaper and offer more options for passengers\n- Hub airlines offer more frequency of flights, but passengers prefer airlines with multiple flights at varying times throughout the day\n- Some airports like ATL and DFW have been extremely busy for decades, making the A380 not likely to compete for domestic traffic\n- Demand for flying is not higher than ever but is close to pre-pandemic levels and ticket prices are highTicket prices are high because of low demand in the front of the plane; other factors are also at play, such as revenue loss from the pandemic and fluctuating market prices. The Airbus A380 has a unique flight feel due to its cruising style, and the Boeing 787 is preferred for its long-term comfort. The A380 wings were built with potential for a longer fuselage variant, but airport restrictions limit its aspect ratio and fuel efficiency. The A380 may still be used as a cargo plane for outsized loads, but it lacks necessary features for general cargo use.- IAI is modifying older 777s to add reinforced floorbeams and side cargo doors.\n- The A380 is not likely to be a significant player in freight due to door loading efficiencies.\n- The A380 is more fuel-efficient than some other models per passenger but less so per seat.\n- The A380 is considered advantageous for lowly economy passengers because of its cabin headroom.\n- Qantas resumed A380 flights in January 2022, with seven serviceable planes and three more expected to return next year after maintenance checks and cabin reconfigurations.\n- Victorville was chosen as a storage location for Qantas A380s because of lower humidity, but Alice Springs is also used for shorter-term storage.The Tech Times comment section features a discussion about storing A380s in Alice Springs, Australia, with some personal anecdotes and opinions on the plane's design and legacy. Lufthansa is reportedly bringing back A380s, while Qatar Airways continued to fly during the pandemic. The A380 is seen as an interesting case study, with some bad assumptions going into its design, including the need for 4 engines and infrastructure upgrades. Additionally, the North American market is ill-suited for the A380 due to smaller airports and direct flights being preferred.Qantas is bringing its Airbus A380s back into service for a limited time, with flights from Sydney and Melbourne to Dubai, due to continued demand for flights from Australia to Europe. Qantas has long sought to fly directly from Sydney to London and New York without stopovers, and the increased ultra-long-range (ULR) capability of the A350 and 777 in 2025 may enable this goal. Meanwhile, Qantas is striving to meet its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 by investing in Australia's sustainable aviation fuel industry; however, such fuels' overall carbon reduction impact is complicated by production costs and second-order effects.Experts discuss the net zero carbon concept and solutions for aviation fuel. One commenter suggests growing and burning trees as a solution, while another raises concerns about the economic feasibility of the idea. Biofuels are considered a possible near-future solution, despite being an \"economic hack.\" No new technology or product releases are discussed.",

He was a co-organiser of the recent Royal Society meeting \"Astronomy from the Moon.\"PartnersUniversity College London provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK.View all partnersWe believe in the free flow of informationRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.Republish this articleEmailTwitter22Facebook123LinkedInPrintLunar exploration is undergoing a renaissance. Dozens of missions, organised by multiple space agencies \u2013 and increasingly by commercial companies \u2013 are set to visit the Moon by the end of this decade. Most of these will involve small robotic spacecraft, but NASA\u2019s ambitious Artemis programme, aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the middle of the decade.There are various reasons for all this activity, including geopolitical posturing and the search for lunar resources, such as water-ice at the lunar poles, which can be extracted and turned into hydrogen and oxygen propellant for rockets. However, science is also sure to be a major beneficiary.The Moon still has much to tell us about the origin and evolution of the solar system. It also has scientific value as a platform for observational astronomy.The potential role for astronomy of Earth\u2019s natural satellite was discussed at a Royal Society meeting earlier this year. The meeting itself had, in part, been sparked by the enhanced access to the lunar surface now in prospect.Far side benefitsSeveral types of astronomy would benefit. The most obvious is radio astronomy, which can be conducted from the side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth \u2013 the far side.The lunar far side is permanently shielded from the radio signals generated by humans on Earth. During the lunar night, it is also protected from the Sun. These characteristics make it probably the most \u201cradio-quiet\u201d location in the whole solar system as no other planet or moon has a side that permanently faces away from the Earth. It is therefore ideally suited for radio astronomy.Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic energy \u2013 as are, for example, infrared, ultraviolet and visible-light waves. They are defined by having different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.Radio waves with wavelengths longer than about 15m are blocked by Earth\u2019s ionoshere. But radio waves at these wavelengths reach the Moon\u2019s surface unimpeded. For astronomy, this is the last unexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it is best studied from the lunar far side.Observations of the cosmos at these wavelengths come under the umbrella of \u201clow frequency radio astronomy\u201d. These wavelengths are uniquely able to probe the structure of the early universe, especially the cosmic \u201cdark ages\u201d \u2013 an era before the first galaxies formed.At that time, most of the matter in the universe, excluding the mysterious dark matter, was in the form of neutral hydrogen atoms. These emit and absorb radiation with a characteristic wavelength of 21cm. Radio astronomers have been using this property to study hydrogen clouds in our own galaxy \u2013 the Milky Way \u2013 since the 1950s.Because the universe is constantly expanding, the 21cm signal generated by hydrogen in the early universe has been shifted to much longer wavelengths. As a result, hydrogen from the cosmic \u201cdark ages\u201d will appear to us with wavelengths greater than 10m. The lunar far side may be the only place where we can study this.The astronomer Jack Burns provided a good summary of the relevant science background at the recent Royal Society meeting, calling the far side of the moon a \u201cpristine, quiet platform to conduct low radio frequency observations of the early Universe\u2019s Dark Ages, as well as space weather and magnetospheres associated with habitable exoplanets\u201d.Signals from other starsAs Burns says, another potential application of far side radio astronomy is trying to detect radio waves from charged particles trapped by magnetic fields \u2013 magnetospheres \u2013 of planets orbiting other stars.This would help to assess how capable these exoplanets are of hosting life. Radio waves from exoplanet magnetospheres would probably have wavelengths greater than 100m, so they would require a radio-quiet environment in space. Again, the far side of the Moon will be the best location.A similar argument can be made for attempts to detect signals from intelligent aliens. And, by opening up an unexplored part of the radio spectrum, there is also the possibility of making serendipitous discoveries of new phenomena.Artist\u2019s conception of the LuSEE-Night radio astronomy experiment on the Moon (credit: Nasa/Tricia Talbert)We should get an indication of the potential of these observations when NASA\u2019s LuSEE-Night mission lands on the lunar far side in 2025 or 2026.Crater depthsThe Moon also offers opportunities for other types of astronomy as well. Astronomers have lots of experience with optical and infrared telescopes operating in free space, such as the Hubble telescope and JWST. However, the stability of the lunar surface may confer advantages for these types of instrument.Moreover, there are craters at the lunar poles that receive no sunlight. Telescopes that observe the universe at infrared wavelengths are very sensitive to heat and therefore have to operate at low temperatures. JWST, for example, needs a huge sunshield to protect it from the sun\u2019s rays. On the Moon, a natural crater rim could provide this shielding for free.Permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles could eventually host infrared telescopes. LROC / ASU / NASAThe Moon\u2019s low gravity may also enable the construction of much larger telescopes than is feasible for free-flying satellites. These considerations have led the astronomer Jean-Pierre Maillard to suggest that the Moon may be the future of infrared astronomy.The cold, stable environment of permanently shadowed craters may also have advantages for the next generation of instruments to detect gravitational waves \u2013 \u201cripples\u201d in space-time caused by processes such as exploding stars and colliding black holes.Moreover, for billions of years the Moon has been bombarded by charged particles from the sun \u2013 solar wind \u2013 and galactic cosmic rays. The lunar surface may contain a rich record of these processes. Studying them could yield insights into the evolution of both the Sun and the Milky Way.For all these reasons, astronomy stands to benefit from the current renaissance in lunar exploration. In particular, astronomy is likely to benefit from the infrastructure built up on the Moon as lunar exploration proceeds. This will include both transportation infrastructure \u2013 rockets, landers and other vehicles \u2013 to access the surface, as well as humans and robots on-site to construct and maintain astronomical instruments.But there is also a tension here: human activities on the lunar far side may create unwanted radio interference, and plans to extract water-ice from shadowed craters might make it difficult for those same craters to be used for astronomy. As my colleagues and I recently argued, we will need to ensure that lunar locations that are uniquely valuable for astronomy are protected in this new age of lunar exploration.AstronomySpaceMilky WayCosmologyMoonAstrophysicsHubble Space TelescopeSolar systemRadio astronomyRoyal SocietyLunar explorationGalaxyFar side of the moonArtemis programJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST)Educate me",
        "summary": "- Building telescopes on the Moon could transform astronomy\n- Lunar exploration is undergoing a renaissance with many missions planned, including NASA's Artemis program which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the middle of the decade\n- The Moon offers advantages for observational astronomy with its stable surface and craters that receive no sunlight\n- The far side of the Moon is particularly attractive for radio astronomy as it is permanently shielded from radio signals generated by humans on Earth, making it probably the most \"radio-quiet\" location in the whole solar system\n- The lunar far side is also an ideal location for low-frequency radio astronomy, which can probe the structure of the early universe\n- The Moon's low gravity also enables the construction of much larger telescopes than is feasible for free-flying satellites\n- The cold, stable environment of permanently shadowed craters may also have advantages for instruments to detect gravitational waves and for studying solar wind and galactic cosmic rays\n- However, there is a tension between human activities on the lunar far side and unwanted radio interference, and plans to extract water-ice from shadowed craters might make it difficult for those same craters to be used for astronomy.",

        "hn_content": "The potential of building telescopes on the moon could revolutionize astronomy by allowing for higher sensitivity and spectrographic resolution. The author questions how astronomers decide what dimension of incremental learning is worth spending money on. The high cost of building these telescopes is justified in the hopes of making groundbreaking scientific discoveries, inspiring future generations, and driving technical innovation. Other fields like particle physics also share this high-cost, high-reward approach. Most of the money is spent on funding generations of new theorists and engineers. The value of scientific discovery cannot be quantified by $/unit. Military spending has historically driven scientific advancements.Despite apparent skepticism towards government spending on scientific research, there are tangible benefits to funding such research, including providing the framework for how technology operates, benefiting society through discoveries from unexpected research, and cultivating a highly-trained workforce. A proposed telescope called FOCAL could potentially provide otherwise impossible scientific measurements and is touted as being overall more important than settling on Mars. The U.S. has a long history of building and funding space telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, which, despite being publicly heralded for its gorgeous imagery, was originally budgeted for military surveillance purposes.The Voyager probes were designed to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto using gravity assists, with no expectation of survival beyond interstellar space. The alignment of the planets allowed the probes to take a long and wandering path, making their journey remarkably slow compared to what's possible with existing technology. The Decadal Survey and funding decides priorities for astronomy research. There's no point in history where poverty hasn't been a problem, and research work can still provide employment opportunities rather than just going into someone's bigger superyacht. Navel staring is not the solution to the world's problems.NASA's Artemis program aims to build a radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which has a radio-quiet environment, obscured from the radio signals generated by humans on Earth. The scope\u00a0can produce higher-quality images than any observatory on Earth regarding the Big Bang's cosmic radiation. Location\u00a0also overcomes one of the biggest difficulties of space-based telescopes because the rock at the dark side (polar regions) of the Moon shields against most sources of high-frequency noise from satellites, man-made or natural. However, space engineers need to solve several technical complications related to the Moon's environment, such as\u00a0fine dust covering the hardware,\u00a0thermal control, and communication with Earth.\u00a0\nExperts discuss various options for improving communication with Mars, such as using modern storage technology, Venus satellites, or a halo orbit at earth-moon L2, L4, or L5, rather than satellite or lunar communication. The moon is difficult to orbit due to the unevenness of gravity, although it could serve as a shield for telescopes in theory. Additionally, the moon's unique orbit offers a long and stable orbit for spacecraft that doesn't require excessive fuel. Despite speculation, the actual existence and detection of \"dark\" matter and energy remains elusive, and using planets or asteroids for a gravity lensing effect is impractical due to the large focal point.Several Lunar Orbiters discovered mascons, which are massive concentrations beneath the surface caused by past impacts that can cause a lunar orbit shift.\n\nStudy of mascons effect on spacecraft led to the discovery of \"frozen orbits\".\n\nJWST telescope is too far for Hubble to observe it, and telescope on the Moon presents more access and less risk for maintenance.\n\nThe comment section debates the likelihood and cost of a proposed lunar telescope project and the tendency to search for water in celestial bodies.\n\nApplications are open for YC Summer 2023.",
