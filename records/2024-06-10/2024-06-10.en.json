    "originBody": "Designing a Lego orrery June 1, 2024 I've always been a fan of the Lego Technic series, especially those models that have gears and cranks and moving parts. But it seems that Lego is shifting the focus of the Technic series away from functional models, so I had to take matters into my own hands. I think an orrery is the perfect project to build out of Lego Technic parts as it makes for a cool display set and is functional at the same time. Introduction An orrery is a scientific instrument that models the motion of the celestial bodies. These are typically the orbital period and the period of the rotation around the axis of a body. For example, the time it takes the moon to travel around the earth once is ~27 times the time it takes the earth to rotate around it's own axis (a day). This relation is accurately modelled in an orrery. However, the orrery does not model distances or the relative sizes of the celestial bodies. I was very excited when I saw this Earth, Moon and Sun Orrery design by JK Brickworks in 2016: This inspired me to build my own orrery with the same spheres for the sun, earth and moon, but my own custom designed mechanism: While working on this, I experimented with 3D printing custom fixtures to put Lego gears in, but eventually moved on to building an orrery out of Lego parts only. This orrery is special in the sense that it was designed by me, but it doesn't have any features beyond what the design from JK Brickworks has to offer. It models the orbit of the earh around the sun, the orbit of the moon around the earth, and the spin of the sun, earth and moon. The moon is tidally locked to the earth, meaning it rotates once per orbit. One half of the moon always faces the earth and the other always points away from it. (This also means that if you're on the surface of the moon, the earth always stays in the same spot in the sky.) The tidal locking means that the rotation of the moon easy to implement in an orrery, since the moon will move correctly as soon as it is attached to an arm that goes around the earth at the correct orbital period. You only model the orbital period and get the rotational period for free. To improve upon my first model, I wanted to add two more features: The axial tilt of the earth and the inclination of the orbit of the moon. Axial tilt The rotational axis of the earth is tilted 23.5° relative to its orbital plane. For the orrery, this means that the rotational axis of the earth is not pointing straight up. To make matters worse, the axis always points in the same direction. It does not rotate relative to the stars or the table that the orrery stands on, but it has to rotate relative to the main arm that holds the earth. So not only does the earth itself rotate, the part that holds the earth also needs to rotate to cancel out the rotation of the arm. Modelling this feature allows us to use the orrery to explain the origin of the seasons. To construct the actual tilted holder for the earth sphere, I used an angled connector with a 22.5° angle, which is only one degree off the correct angle. Inclination of the orbit of the moon The second pehonomenon I wanted to model in my orrery is the fact that the plane of the moon's orbit is inclined relative to the plane of the earth's orbit. The real inclination angle is 5.15°, which you would barely notice if it was modelled accurately. But the inclination of the moon's orbit plays in important role in explaining when eclipses occur, so I think it is useful to model an exaggerated orbital inclination. In the orrery, we need to make the moon go up and down along its journey around the earth. My mechanical solution for this problem is inspired by this video. The moon arm has a wheel that rides on a tilted circular gear rack. A parallelogram linkage keeps the moon vertically aligned. Just like the attachment point for the earth, this assembly rests relative to the stars, meaning it needs to rotate relative to the main arm. In summary, there are four parts on the earth arm that need to rotate at the correct rate: the earth, the base for the earth (to ensure the correct direction of the axial tilt), the moon, the inclination ring for the moon. In theory, the earth base and the moon inclination ring could be a single part (both should rotate at the same rate). But making a tilted ring out of Lego parts is difficult enough and I didn't manage to do it in a way where the moon \"rides\" on it while it is driven from the outside. Thus, the solution to this is to make the moon inclination ring a separate assembly. Being able to move the tilted ring independently allows us to implement an additional astrodynamic phenomenon, the precession of the nodes of the orbit of the moon. It turns out that the direction in which the upper and lower parts of the orbit are pointing isn't fixed after all. They slowly rotate around the moon, once every 18.6 years. Concentric axes One problem specific to building an orrery in Lego is achieving concentric rotation. In a traditional orrery, you can have an unlimited number of parts rotating around the same axis just by placing tubes of increasing size inside each other. But these tubes don't exist as Lego pieces. For the earth-moon system, I need four assemblies rotating independently around the same axis. Here is how I achieved it for the earth-moon subassembly: The first axis (1) is a regular Lego Technic axle. It drives the rotation of the earth. The second axis (2) is built using a Lego Technic turntable. It is responsible for the orbit of the moon. The third axis (3) is a circular gear rack. It fulfills the same role as a turntable, just with an inner radius large enough to fit another turntable inside it. This part is the tilted ring that is needed to model the orbital inclination of the moon. Now there is only one axis missing, which is the rotating holder for the earth (4). Remember, it needs to rotate relative to the main arm of the orrery so that the rotational axis of the earth points at a constant direction. This is done with a second turntable stacked on top of the first one. To drive it, I'm using this trick: The Differential Gear Casing has a round hole and gears at both ends. That means an axle can be placed inside it and rotate independently. This can be used to transmit torque by connecting gears at both ends. This serves the purpose of the aforementioned tubes that don't exist as Lego parts, with the exception of this gear casing. The gear casing drives some gears on the first turntable, which in turn drive the second turntable. Gear sequences The earth-moon subassembly has four axes that need to rotate at the correct period, namely the earth, the moon, the earth's base and the moon's inclination ring. The entire orrery has two more: the rotation of the sun around its own axis and the rotation of the main arm, which makes the earth travel around the sun in 365.25 days. The sun is not a solid body and spins at different speeds depending on the latitude. For orrery design, that means that any rotational period between 24 and 38 days can be argued to be correct, since there is a latitude of the sun where the surface rotates at this period. This gives rise to the problem of finding a gear sequence for a given transmission ratio. In my orrery, one rotation of the crank corresponds to one day. So to get the main arm to rotate once every 365.25 days, it needs to be connected to the crank using a gear sequence with a transmission ratio that is as close as possible to 365.25. The gear ratio of a gear sequence is the product of the fractions of tooth numbers for each pair of gears in the sequence. To find a sequence of Lego gears, there are some additional constraints. Most importantly, we are limited by the gears that Lego actually makes: Notice the worm gear in the above image. It's special because it behaves like a one tooth gear, i.e. paired with a 24 tooth gear, it will create a transmission ratio of 1:24. But it can only be the driving gear in a pairing, not the driven gear. Suppose we want to achieve a transmission ratio of 17:23. This could be done easily with a pairing of a 17-teeth and a 23-teeth gear in a traditional orrery. But these teeth numbers aren't available as Lego gears, so we have to find another way. I made a tool to find Lego gear sequences for a given transmission ratio. For our example of a 17/23 ratio, the app finds plenty of solutions with slightly different ratios, for example a ratio of 20/27, which is only 0.22% off from the target ratio: The problem of finding a gear sequence for a given transmission ratio is connected to some interesting ideas from number theory. It is closely related to prime factor decomposition. In fact, an exact solution is only possible if all the prime factors in the target ratio are also available as prime factors in the available gears. The tool will start from the target fraction (or slightly different fractions when searching for approximate solutions) and go through a list of expansions of that fraction that are possible with the prime factors given by the available gears. For each fraction, it will calculate all sequences of gears that have the numerator or denominator of that fraction as their product. Given such a pair of sequences of driver gears and follower gears, the app still needs to decide which driver gear is paired with which follower gear. This is important in the context of Lego gears because some pairings are more practical than others in a Lego project. In particular, if a pair of gears has a tooth sum that is divisible by 16, the distance between the axles is a whole number of Lego units. This combination is the easiest to build. Here is an example of pairing a 24 and 40 tooth gear. The tooth sum is 64 = 4 * 16, which tells us that the gears will be four Lego units apart. If the tooth sum is divisble by 8, the distance can be achieved by placing the axle at a half unit offset, which is possible with various building techniques: The app has a \"Fit gears\" tab which will show you possible ways of connecting any given pair of gears. For example, this is what I call a \"2D connection\". These gears fit together if you offset them 1 unit in one direction and 2 units in the second direction, since their distance is quite close to sqrt(1² + 2²): In addition, there are also gears that Lego calls \"bevel gears\", they have n * 8 + 4 teeth and can be connected perpendicularly, allowing you to change the plane of the meachnism. So for any pair of a driver and follower gear, there are potential ways to connect them, but some combinations are easier to build and some are harder. My app assigns a \"cost\" to each possible pairing of driver and follower gear based on how they can be connected. If the teeth numbers add up to a multiple of 16, they are the easiest to connect, meaning the cost is the lowest. Once the tool has a set of driver gears and follower gears, it uses the Hungarian algorithm to generate a matching with minimal cost. Here is an example of a result when searching for a sequence with a ratio of π: There is one more interesting mathematical curiosity I want to mention. Lego's differential gears have the property that the differential casing rotates at a rate that is the mean of the rates of the two connected axles. For example, if one axle rotates onces per second and the other axle three times per second, the casing will rotates twice per second ((1 + 3) / 2). We can exploit this to achieve prime factors that are otherwise impossible with Lego gears. For example, there are no Lego gears with a tooth number that is a multiple of 13, so transmission ratios that include 13 as a prime factor are not possible with the standard approach. To achieve a transmission ratio of 13, the gear ratio calculator gives us this sequence: The inputs axles spin at a rate of 1 and 25 and the resulting rate is (1 + 25) / 2 = 13. This how this sequence could be built: In this example, the blue axle spins 13 times as fast as the red axle. This brings us to the end of the digression about gear sequences. The app is available here if you want to try it out. The Typescript source code is also available. Here are all the gears in the final orrery design: These are the rotational and orbital periods in the orrery, comparing them to the real-world values: The mechanism was mostly designed using physical parts and my gear sequence app. This is a work in progress photo: One of the main challenges during the design of the orrery, besides making it work at all, was to get the orrery to run smoothly. The final design has 70 gears and each additional gear adds a little bit of friction. Another source for resistance is the weight of the earth as it spins relatively fast and thus contributes a lot to the torque needed to run the orrery. I put a lot of effor into making the orrery run smooth. But the mechanism can easily get stuck, for example if any moving part is assembled too tight or if the orrery gathers dust. During assembly, it is important to make sure that every moving part has a some slack. One way to work around this problem is to apply a little bit of silicone spray. This will make the orrery run effortlessly without any problem. But arguably a Lego set should be judged by how well it works on its own and purists will say this is like gluing parts together. Designing the foot I took this photo when I first managed to get the entire mechanism to work. This contains the first version of a foot I designed, which has a Lego motor to drive the orrery. It turns out that this motor is really loud when it runs and it ruins the experience of using the orrery. I envision it as a piece that you can use to explain and demonstrate astrodynamic phenomena to someone. But this doesn't work when the motor noise makes it impossible to have a conversation, so I decided to remove the motor. Designing the foot turned out quite tricky, it's an artistic challenge more than a technical one. I went for a 12-segment design, which is a nod to the twelve months and has a tradition in orrery design. I designed most of the foot digitally using Bricklink Studio. This part lends itself more to digital design since it doesn't move. Due to the 12-fold symmetry, testing any idea requires a large number of parts. Here are some iterations on the foot design: You can see that each design has a little lever to disengage the driving mechanism from the main arm. This allows you to move the arm freely, which is quite useful in practice. Here is a video of the final orrery design in action: Instructions I used Bricklink Studio to make a digital model of my orrery. During the design process, I switched back and forth between buildig with physical parts and designing digitally. I also used this program to create digital building instructions. My takeaway from this is that it works really well for small models, but it has serious usability problems on larger models. When you make changes to the model or change an early step in the instructions, it will often break the layout of the instructions in many places so that most of it needs to be redone. This was a lot of tedious work, but I ended up with a 264 page, 436 step instructions PDF. I'm selling the digital instructions for 20€ on Rebrickable. On Rebrickable, you get a parts list and some really useful tools to help aquiring the parts (even without buying the instructions). For example, you can tell it which Lego sets and parts you own and based on that it will know which of the required parts of the orrery you already have. It also helps you with buying the parts you don't have. Rebrickable estimates that the total cost of the required parts is 260€. Together with the cost of the instructions, this makes the whole project quite expensive for potential buyers. I ended up selling a few instructions, but ultimately this project wasn't a commercial success. In hindsight, it might have been a better idea to give the instructions away for free. To promote the listing on Rebrickable, I made an animation that shows the movement of the gears in the orrery. I used Mecabricks to convert the Bricklink Studio design into a scene file that contains 3D meshes of all the parts. This could then be opened in Blender, where I created all the animations and the camera movement. Just like making the instructions, this is realtively straight forward, but it became quite complex due to the large number of parts in the design. Here is the resulting animation (at 45 seconds, the structural parts fade out to reveal the mechanism): Lower partcount design The above design aims to make the best possible Lego orrery with few compromises. This is at the expense of having a high part count and some parts that are hard to get. I made a modified design with a lower part count by redesigning the foot. The foot in this version is much lighter, has less ornaments and uses Technic parts instead of traditional bricks. It has one crank instead of two. To make it easier to get the parts for this orrery, I changed the design so that it uses as many parts as possible from Lego's Rough Terrain Crane. I chose this set because it was well reviewed, had a low cost per part, and many people own it. Unfortunately, Lego has now stopped selling it. Many parts in my first orrery design use a \"traditional\" color scheme where gears, pins and axles are mostly gray and black. This color scheme was used by Lego in the past and is often preferred by fans. In the new design, I use the same colors that Lego uses in its current products, which means the parts are easier to get and more of them can be taken from the red crane. The new, more colorful palette makes the building instructions easier to follow, but the colors can look out of place in the orrery. Other orreries I released the instructions for my orrery in September 2021. A few months later in 2022, CaDA released an orrery designed by JK Brickworks. This is the designer behind the \"original\" Lego Orrery from 2016, which got me interested in this hobby in the first place. The feature set of this orrery is similar to mine, with the exception that it doesn't model the inclination of the orbit of the moon. As you can see, omitting this feature lowers the complexity considerably and allows for a much simpler and more reliable design. The lower part count makes this orrery more accessible to a wider audience. I'm very impressed with this design and I think it's the best product to get for anyone interested in building an orrery. Two years later in 2024, Lego released their own orrey design. I was quite excited at the prospect of an official Lego orrery, but I was disappointed by the execution. This orrery has the same feature set as the one from CaDA, it has the earth's axial tilt, the moon's orbit but not its inclination. Compared to the CaDA design, it has less parts but is more expensive. I think Lego were too aggressive in reducing the part count. The orrery is very fragile and wobbly. For the sun and earth, they went with custom hemisphere pieces. I like the idea, as it allows the bodies to be perfectly spherical. But the parts have very prominent connection holes, which are unneccesary and ruin the look. The earth has the continents printed on it, which is a nice idea but the prints were poorly aligned in my model. All in all, I would recommend the CaDA orrery over this one. But I'm excited to see that building block orreries are reaching a bigger audience and I hope that companies like CaDA and Lego will offer more elaborate designs in the future. Outlook This is a mockup of an idea to model all the planets in the solar system without vertical stacking (well, except for the inner planets, but it's mostly a flat design). The four outer planets would move on four tracks of chains that are held in place by the vertical poles (the chains are not shown in the render). The chain would be driven by a gear attached to the base and the planet would be attached to one of the chain link pieces. Note that in this setup, the planets only travel around the sun, but don't spin around their own axes. This concept is inspired by a design for a clock from Akiyuki. It's hard to tell if the chain could handle the weight of a brick-built planet. Either way this build would be crazy in terms of dimensions, part count and cost. At the moment, I'm not planning to continue working on this concept. If you remove the constraint of no vertical stacking, the problem becomes only slightly easier, but possible as demonstrated by Chris Orchard and Brent Waller in their Lego Ideas campaign. My next project is to build an orrery using laser cut acrylic sheets instead of Lego parts. This removes a lot of constraints on the gears and parts that can be used, but has the added difficulty that I need to manufacture these parts myself.",

We're up against a population boom enabled by access to fossil fuels. Our nigh-insatiable appetite for energy conversion has serious consequences for life on earth. I'd far rather teach basketry & other fiber arts, foraging for food & medicine, land stewardship, how to hunt kill and process animals for food, and other primitive (using this word non-pejoratively) skills done as a tight-knot group (such as what a classroom can be with good leadership- not saying I provided that to the degree I value now, but if/when I go back to teaching, I will). LEGO is a distraction, a luxury enabled by the Industrial Revolution. We don't have plastic interlocking bricks without coal and petroleum and long (and easily-disrupted) supply chain.

If you’re submitting a product idea based on a discontinued LEGO theme or brand (for example Blacktron or Octan), it must be your own new, creative work. simply because this design predates the official re-release... but given that the official one is from this year, it seems really unlikely they'd run with it this soon anyway. reply dolmen 8 hours agoprevSee also this older LEGO orrery produced by the University of California as an educational project for NASA Kepler mission: https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-top_tr... https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-top_tr...

The one part that isn't quite right, and I'm not even sure I've ever seen a model that does this right, is the moon's orbital tilt, so the earth isn't blocking the moon for full moon, and the moon isn't blocking the sun for new moon.

(For example: LLM-assisted forum presence, combined with profiles with oh, hey there, I have an OF, lol, combined with tech industry disposable incomes... I'd guess would pick up a couple new whales worth the effort. Now that Reddit presumably has been picked clean.) reply lja 2 hours agoparentAny OF models would be met with HN users over-explaining their own economics to them and how it's a terrible business that'll never work. These models will also learn they don't even have a moat to differentiate themselves from other offerings and should keep their development jobs. :) reply derefr 1 hour agorootparentI don't think people discovering these profiles on HN is the concern here. The true problem with OF models is due to an iterated mutual tit-for-tat strategy between OF models and popular groups on social media platforms: 1. OF models (or people acting on their behalf) want to promote themselves using popular groups/pages/channels on social-networks — they spam posts to these places, seeming to be authentic engagement, in ways that get people curious to look at their profile; and where their profile on the social network then directs those people to their OF profile. 2. The popular groups/pages/channels on social networks are inundated by spam from these OF models, and so attempt to use automated measures to detect and block posts from posters who link to OF on their profiles. 3. OF models/their agents try to work around this by indirecting their OF profile behind \"make an About You page with links\" services like carrd.co. 4. The popular SN groups respond by also blocking profiles containing links to these \"About You page\" services (because, keep in mind, the SN profile already works as an \"About You page\", so there's no need to link to one of these, when you could just past in the contents from it instead. The only people who link to these pages from SN profiles are OF models.) 5. And OF models/their agents try to work around this, by finding ever-more-obscure \"About You page\" services, and/or profile pages on other social-media services, to get ahead of the moderation. This at.hn service looks great, but it would sadly be exactly the kind of service referenced in step 5. reply sizzle 14 minutes agorootparentI used to enjoy setting link.tree to support content creators but now it’s a way to disseminate their OF spam reply mistrial9 23 minutes agorootparentprevagree completely except the last sentance.. smells like a cheap backdoor to auto-profiling plus shenanigans immediately following that reply EGreg 2 hours agorootparentprevI can see both groups working with models and curves Just different types https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AE4IxYq4nig reply SkyPuncher 1 hour agorootparentThis is a punny comment reply jjmarr 1 hour agoparentprevAella already has a stranglehold on the HN demographic. reply rmbyrro 1 hour agoparentprevI think the median HN user is a lot healthier than you suggest. reply deadbabe 3 hours agoparentprevAround here I think you’d have better luck selling tiny cute looking computers with tiny screens and open source hardware. reply jpmattia 3 hours agorootparentTastes around here definitely vary.

My devices have so few apps, that it could almost be mistaken for a clean install. In coding, I use very few libraries because I don't trust anyone.

Between bad packages including malicious/bad dependencies in an otherwise acceptable package or flat out devs pushing something that looks useful for the sole purpose of pushing bad code, it's just not worth my time.

Article 9 has section e) which says that information 'manifestly made public' relating to 'special categories' is excluded. What's weird is there seems to be no such exclusion for personal information which does not relate to special categories. Having this 'opt-in' certainly seems to tick the box for consent. However, if reproducing information from a publicly available bio would fall foul of GDPR requirements, then I think there are bigger fish to fry than a hobby project made by a guy who at least seems to trying to respect people's preferences. reply Symbiote 4 hours agorootparentAlthough I wrote \"it's something to consider\", from what I can see the developer has already considered this sufficiently for the scale of the project. reply jdiez17 4 hours agoparentprevNo action is needed if OP doesn’t store unnecessary info or use spyware reply d1sxeyes 4 hours agoparentprev [–] Usual note that IANAL, but looks like this service is opt-in, and only relists data which is already public on a user's HN profile. If a user removes the reference from their bio, then the user's profile will be essentially inaccessible through the service (although technically the cached version would still be on the server. Adding a check to delete the file which matches the user's hashed ID here[0] would take care of profile deletions on subsequent accesses. Failing all that, a user could request deletion and OP could delete the user's file manually. There's nothing that seems overly onerous to implement to be (at least) GDPR compliant.

Instead it is mapped into the address space of a newly started process automatically by the kernel. It's an optimization feature to avoid syscall overhead for function like gettimeofday. See https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html reply Joker_vD 7 hours agorootparentOh, so it's like kernel32.dll on the Windows side of things? reply mrspuratic 6 hours agorootparentlinux-vdso.so is mostly about sharing a data page so syscalls can be optimised away. It's not for all the kernel API entry points (and it's userland specific so the VDSO varies with the libc version according to which features it optimises in this way). For the specific example above gettimeofday() - each process can read the clock value straight out of the shared VVARS page mapped into its space, no expensive context switch. reply account42 7 hours agorootparentprevNo, kernel32.dll is a real library that is referenced in the import section of executables and libraries that need it. reply Joker_vD 6 hours agorootparentWell, yes, it is a real file, but it is always mapped (at least it used to) into every process' memory space, even if you don't import it explicitly, and it provides a user-space layer above the low-level syscalls. reply userbinator 20 hours agoprevBasically the Linux CLI version of depends.exe. reply PreInternet01 11 hours agoparentNote that that particular tool doesn't work very well for modern Windows versions anymore.

[1] https://www.dependencywalker.com/ reply dooglius 19 hours agoprevWhat does \"why a library is found or not\" mean? It is either in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or it isn't? The screenshot doesn't make it clear to me what this refers to. reply georgyo 18 hours agoparentI don't know what it means in the context of this tool, but library searching is much more complicated than a single environment variable. There is the system search path, runpath, rpath, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH as just a few different distinct methods library searched on directories. Libraries are also usually linked just by the short name, IE foo.so, but they can also be dynamically linked to the full path of the library. Side note, as a general rule if you can avoid setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH you'll be much off. It's not always possible, but setting puts it at the top of the search for all executions. Even if something dynamically links the full path to a library, LD_LIBRARY_PATH will take precedence. It completely flattens the search. reply wpollock 17 hours agorootparentOn top of that, libraries can be linked by their SONAME and not the file name. (This is rarely done however.) reply account42 6 hours agorootparentThe SONAME is the filename used for runtime linking. On the filesystem it may or may not be a symlink but that does not concernt the linker. It may not be (and usually isn't) the same filemame used when bulding the binary. This is because the SONAME is meant to specify a specific ABI version of the library. reply cylemons 10 hours agorootparentprevI thought dynamic linking always uses the soname reply bregma 4 hours agorootparentStatic linking uses the DT_SONAME of a linked library to create an entry in the DT_NEEDED table. The name in the DT_NEEDED table is used by the dynamic loader to search for a matching filename to load in. So in a very indirect sense the dynamic loader always uses the SONAME that was supplied at build time, but it also uses a search algorithm to find that filename at load time. reply cryptonector 17 hours agoparentprevA library need not be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order to be found. The point of the title is to say that libtree makes it easy to find the paths from an executable to all its direct and indirect dependencies, one of the uses of which is to help figure out what's up with missing dependencies. In reality if you're using a packaging system then you likely won't have missing dependencies, so you'd use libtree for other reasons. reply duped 17 hours agoparentprev> It is either in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or it isn't Or RPATH, which is evaluated at load time per each library. The bigger point is that dependencies form a graph (which can be displayed as a tree) and its useful to know why a library wasn't found because of the library that required it. reply rdtsc 2 hours agoparentprevI think it wanted to say that is it shows how it found the dependency: LD_LIBRARY_PATH, rpath, etc. reply almostgotcaught 15 hours agoparentprev> It is either in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or it isn't? at minimum you have RPATH, RUNPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH. this tool is based on ldd and thus also (presumably) resolves DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH, DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH, @executable_path, @loader_path and @rpath. reply rurban 13 hours agorootparentNope, only elf, no macho support. reply wakawaka28 15 hours agoparentprevLD_LIBRARY_PATH is not the only way libraries are found. The loader considers several other sources to find libraries. Assuming a sane setup, this will be a combination of ordinary ELF fields in each binary that gets loaded and other paths known to the loader. Relying on LD_LIBRARY_PATH can be very short-sighted on systems with many versions of the same library or multiple libraries with the same name. The loader must search the paths in LD_LIBRARY_PATH for each binary in order, and it will pick the first library that matches (unless you have other higher-priority paths set by other means). That may not be the one you really want. This can lead to unexpected errors at runtime. The better way is to set RPATH for the affected binaries to the location that has the libraries that it requires. It is possible to end up loading multiple versions of the same library as well, if your environment and RPATH settings are not consistent. This tool will help you figure out if you have problems and why. reply jononor 20 hours agoprevHaving to recursively and iteratively hunt missing dependencies with ldd can be pretty tedious.

They produce art from their own funding. Then a company leeches them off and trains models without compensating them. I am okay at training models on arXiv papers. The authors consented to spread the knowledge publicly. With such dumb-logic comments, you make it hard to take your point-of-view seriously. Edit: The copyright of the paper _authors_ isn't being protected. They are being blood-sucked. And, before the Hub, if you emailed an author for a free PDF, if you couldn't afford it, most, if not all emailed you a free PDF. Harvard famously said that they couldn't afford Elsevier anymore.

I send my research to Elsevier for free, and surrender all my publishing rights & copyright to Elsevier to be able to publish it.

At the end, it's a paper which bears my name, but I have none of the rights attached to it, and Elsevier gets literally millions of dollars from each country which licenses its publications. Their expenses are a mere rounding error for what they charge, and they are doing this to protect their income, not my research. Copyright infringement / ethical issues in AI is something else: Crawlers reap & providers sell my data without my consent, and I get nothing in return, except the ability to poorly imitate my writing/art style, making my work, blood, sweat and tears I shed over these years to create that style worthless. Both parties earn exorbitant amount of money with my work, for free, and suck me dry in the process.

Rather than journals, people take conferences more seriously. Now, some companies like DeepMind like to publish in Nature for prestige's sake. That's a different thing. reply Staple_Diet 3 hours agorootparentprevHa. It's kind of like saying; 'Shit, why are people paying 6 figures for college degrees in US when they could just learn most of that for free'. Because no one gives a shit if you don't have the expensive piece of parchment. Academic publishing is similar. The impact factor and 'prestige' of the journal matters to your University, your peers, your grants panel, and yourself. However this results in 2 scenarios, when you publish in a top tier journal, a) the journal charges you a small fee and also pay-walls your work so your reach is lessened, then actively polices you sharing YOUR work without permission b) the journal charges an exorbitant fee (Nature wants $11,000 USD) for open-access publishing that allows wider distribution (but still has stipulations in some cases). HOWEVER, some editorial boards of big for-profit journals have flipped the table and started their own not-for-profit journals with blackjack and hookers. The big one in my field was NeuroImage board creating Imaging Neuroscience - with a public letter to the owners (Elsevier if I'm not mistaken) calling out the bullshit publishing fees. reply xhkkffbf 3 hours agorootparentprevUh-- no one is forcing you to send anything to Elsevier. Or any other publisher. If you don't like the terms, self-publish. The Internet makes it easier than ever. The reason so many people use Elsevier is because they realize it's a better deal than self-publishing. Copyright is a right that's given to YOU, the creator. If you don't want to sign it away, find your own way to distribute your work. Copyright will protect YOU from big companies stealing your hard work. reply __rito__ 21 minutes agorootparentCompanies like Elsevier are a force of the old world.

In practice, for maths papers I look on arXiv, for crypto papers on iacr and so on - academics generally want their work to be read (and cited) so they're usually happy to make it available for free.

    "originBody": "“How people fall apart”: Yale faculty discuss the impact of burnout on the brain Understanding the neuroscience behind burnout could help people accept their resulting behavior and thought patterns as natural responses of the brain. Kayla Yup 10:45 pm, Mar 29, 2022 Staff Reporter Alice Mao Burnout can make one feel helpless, incompetent, emotionally exhausted, isolated and cynical. Yale faculty provided insight into the neurobiological basis behind symptoms of burnout — and what can be done to reverse it. Professor of neuroscience and psychology Amy Arnsten’s decades of research on the effects of stress on the brain were inspired by seeing “how people fall apart,” she said. When her father was very ill, Arnsten witnessed the process by which people who are normally “very rational” can suddenly become “emotional tornadoes.” Through volunteering in her local state psychiatric hospital, she further witnessed how even small stressors had immediate effects on thought patterns. Arnsten found that understanding the effects of stress on the brain would provide vital clues as to how higher brain functioning is regulated. “A lot of my own research is on how uncontrollable stress affects the prefrontal cortex, which is the most recently evolved part of our brains,” Arnsten said. “It does higher cognition, abstract thought, working memory, the executive functions — so being able to concentrate, multitask, plan and organize, all these things you ideally need to thrive at Yale, for example.” Arnsten highlighted that a person’s perceived ability to control a stressor is a key determinant of its effect on their brain. For example, if someone is overwhelmed by what is being asked of them, believing it to be beyond their capabilities even if it is not, they will view the task as something to be afraid of and such fear will prevail. The stress signaling pathways engaged will then weaken the prefrontal cortex and strengthen more primitive parts of the brain. According to Arnsten, this phenomenon may have had survival value over the course of human evolution. Arnsten recounted walking in the woods in Vermont, when suddenly along the path, a bear appeared in front of her. Luckily, the bear was facing the other way. Rather than consciously reasoning that most mammals lack a ventral stream, and therefore would not be able to recognize a still object, she froze. In this moment of fear, her reflex of freezing was engaged. When the bear turned around, it did not notice her because of her lack of movement, and ended up wandering off. “Freezing is a reflex that can be mediated by the brainstem,” Arnsten explained. “So you can see that there are many instances where having this rapid switch to more primitive brain circuits can save your life. But there are others where the stressor really demands that you need your prefrontal cortex online. For example, during COVID, being able to imagine an invisible virus, you can’t see it the way you see a bear.” Human neuroimaging can help researchers study the prefrontal cortex’s specific response to stress, such as the stress students experience before an important exam. Arnsten pointed to a Cornell study that analyzed the brains of medical students after a month of preparation for a major board exam. The month of study for the exam can be characterized as “psychosocial stress,” an imbalance between adverse life situations and one’s ability to cope with them. Brain imaging revealed that the stressor of studying for the major exam weakened the connectivity of the prefrontal network, leading to impaired prefrontal function and impaired attention regulation. “We can see symptoms of breakdown when we begin to lose our ability to concentrate,” clinical assistant professor of psychiatry Mark Rego said. “We have the tip of the tongue phenomenon, we lose things easily — these are both from working memory breaking down — and our emotions escape their confines into harsh speech. Eventually the system will break down and we will need to rest to focus at all.” The Cornell study found that after a month of reduced stress, these effects disappeared. In healthy individuals, the plasticity of the prefrontal cortex allowed for such cognitive impairments from stress to be reversed. However, this cycle could threaten long-term mental health. In Rego’s book “Frontal Fatigue” he hypothesized that if this cycle of mentally breaking down and resting is repeated enough, the prefrontal cortex can become vulnerable to dysfunction, possibly leading to mental disorders. Rego terms this vulnerability “frontal fatigue,” defining it as a background condition caused by the “unique pressures of modern life” overwhelming the prefrontal cortex. Rego said that if frontal fatigue represents a state of vulnerability, then burnout is the next step before stress overwhelms an individual into a state of depression. Rego quoted Arnsten’s conclusion that if something is deemed “mental illness,” then it likely involves the prefrontal cortex. “[The prefrontal cortex] does not function well under stress,” Rego said. “Virtually all imaging and injury studies have found that mental illness always involves the [prefrontal cortex]. Change the [prefrontal cortex] and changes in personality and behavior follow.” According to Rego, without the prefrontal cortex, humans would be unable to control any action compelled by emotion. The prefrontal cortex’s numerous connections to the limbic system, where emotions form, explain its vital role in dealing with “our emotional lives,” he explained. Professor of psychology Laurie Santos said that burnout consists of three different phases. The first is emotional exhaustion, characterized by feeling worn out and drained, with not even a good night’s sleep seeming to help. The second phase is known as depersonalization or cynicism. This stage causes a person to be annoyed with others, have a shorter fuse, become more cynical of people’s intentions and become more distant with people. “The final feature is a reduced sense of personal accomplishment,” Santos said. “You never feel like you’re doing things effectively and so you feel ineffective and like the work you do doesn’t matter. If you notice signs like this, it’s important that you pay attention early on and make some changes in order to feel better.” Because it is the prefrontal cortex that helps control emotions and thereby avoid panicking, this continual stress cycle can cause a person to spiral downwards. Meanwhile, primitive circuits like the amygdala are strengthened, becoming enlarged as a result of burnout. “The amygdala’s job is to look for threats,” Arnsten said. “And it’s something called the aversive lens, where people who are depressed, their amygdala actually views neutral faces as sad or threatening. So, yes, by being in chronic stress, you’re setting up your brain to be concentrating on the negative and interpreting things in a negative way.” Arnsten advised people to have a low threshold for reaching out for help. She observed that many students may not be aware that help is available, and may view asking for help as a personal sign of weakness. She noted the importance of a balanced diet, deep breathing, exercise and good sleep. Rego emphasized the need to lean into life “with your hands, senses and via others.” To allow the prefrontal cortex to rest, he suggested doing hands-on activities, such as arts and cooking, and indulging the senses — especially in nature — and talking to people often. Rego also recommended quieting the mind, whether through sports, long walks or yoga. “Understanding the neuroscience can give you perspective to say ‘it’s not that I’m stupid or weak,’” Arnsten said. “This is how our neurobiology is built. This is a natural response of my brain, and I need to do things that will help me feel more in control.” Students can schedule meetings with counselors at Yale Mental Health & Counseling by calling (203) 432-0290, or access the expanded mental health services through Yale College Community Counseling.

The care needs are intense; the burnout is real. But I can't employ usual burnout mitigation techniques like taking time off or making career / lifestyle changes. The world relentlessly marches forward. However, I've learned human resilience is AMAZING. You'll be surprised at what you are capable of when life asks for it. Here are a few big insights that have really helped me: - You never have to feel like doing something to start doing it. This insight is so strangely freeing. It really got me out of my head and the loop that I was in berating myself about motivation. - The act of doing something is usually what creates motivation to continue. Tell yourself you'll spend 30 minutes on whatever it is. No matter what it is, I always know I can survive 30 minutes of it. However, 90% of the time, the timer goes off, but I don't feel like stopping. I've found my grove and I keep going. - Procrastination isn't poor time management; it's poor emotional management. Be gentle with yourself. Know that you can be scared, frustrated, or angry but don't have to let those emotions define you. CBT works really well here. Don't define emotions as \"good\" or \"bad\". Define them as \"useful\". If the emotion you feel isn't useful, acknowledge it, but realize it's fleeting and let it pass on. Some people like to visualize emotions as clouds drifting by. \"And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

In this moment of fear, her reflex of freezing was engaged. When the bear turned around, it did not notice her because of her lack of movement, and ended up wandering off.

Something she describes in this book is that these factory spaces were still very much in use by light manufacturers, and that it was the rich real estate interest specifically targetting this area for redevelopment that pushed a narrative that it \"lay empty\" so that they could more easily get the neighborhood rezoned and push out the manufacturers for more lucrative residential tenants. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, wasn't the apartment in \"Friends\" on rent control?

This stuff occurs in smart people more than it should, usually with some sort of anxiety disorder or ADHD. Some of the best public info on this is from Dr Jessica Eccles who examines the relationship between cognition, emotions, and the autonomic nervous system.

There are effective psychopharmacological treatments for dysautonomia which is usually the underlying mechanism. reply zero-sharp 5 hours agoparent>much of burnout is really chronic fatigue (ME/CFS) Sorry, I don't see how that could possibly be true. People with CFS have fatigue to the point where they can't get out of bed. The fatigue from burnout is usually driven by workplace conditions. Like sure, they both have some kind of environmental trigger. But CFS can almost become a disability, whereas burnout is much more narrow and temporary. reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentThat is certainly what people think and why I feel I need to pipe up whenever these threads get started. While certainly some with ME/CFS are so bad that they cannot get out of bed the vast majority have good and bad days and you don't see them on their bad days and they look just like everyone else on their good days. One of the reasons it's considered an invisible disease. It's a spectrum and some people manage it better than others. Sometimes the burnout isn't so temporary - even this article talks about how repeated burnout becomes an problem with the person entering a state of depression which bares a lot of similarities to ME/CFS. Most people with ME/CFS will never be diagnosed and those people will often think they just have issues with burnout. That's what I though for over 20 years and I have a severe form of it. I though I was managing burnout and then graves disease. It never occurred to me that I would have something like ME/CFS until I stumbled on a random twitter comment that linked ME/CFS with hypermobility which I also have a severe form of.

Symptoms vary from patient to patient and the number of physician is really lacking. Individuals can have symptoms like fatigue, GERD, poor circulation, neurological problems, psychological effects. There are many causes too, certain antibiotics, chemo drugs, covid, autoimmune. It is extremely unrecognized. A specialist in my area used to have a 1+ year waitlist. Now, he moved to a different state. There is an exciting treatment in the pipeline. WinSanTor is developing a cream with pirenzepine. In clinical studies there was a systemic recovery of nerve damage. I have spoken to a chemist who had nerve damage from flouroquinolone antibiotics, which caused his dysautonomia and he recovered using oral pirenzepine. Keep in mind WinSanTor is targeting diabetic neuropathy in their studies but it should work for other neuropathies. reply cableshaft 2 hours agorootparent> nerve damage from flouroquinolone antibiotics That's exciting. I got blind-sided by that. A doctor just said he was prescribing 'an antibiotic' like it was no big deal, and I had never had issues with any other antibiotics. I was told by the pharmacist do not exercise while taking these (found out a few days later it can damage your tendons, several people ended up with snapped achilles tendons) but otherwise nothing else. Took a single pill and within a few hours I felt fairly strong neuropathy all over my body. Took a few more days and a few more pills before I determined for sure that it was caused by the pills and not something else, and got the antibiotic switched to doxy. I continued to get neuropathy in my limbs quite often for years after that. It's mostly reduced now but I think it might have caused damage in other parts of my body, and may have helped lead to me getting the Tinnitus I've been dealing with for four years now (there's a causal link between the two). Since they prescribed it to me the surgeon general has slapped big warnings on the pills, but I was shocked a doctor didn't think to warn me about the possibility that there could be any serious side effects (it was also the first medicine I took where I had serious side effects by it, took me by surprise). Seems it's actually not that uncommon that people have bad reactions to flouroquinolone antibiotics, it just wasn't recognized for many years. Wish I was given an appropriate warning. I might not have risked it, or asked for a different antibiotic I know didn't have issues at least. reply avgDev 2 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, your story is quite common. I am a mod and veteran on r/floxies, it is a subreddit dedicated to helping sufferers of these drugs.

It is extremely common doctors even fail to accept that these drugs can cause side effects listed on the drug label. reply cjbgkagh 4 hours agorootparentprevIt can be really hard to even get diagnosed with dysautonomia, and absolutely it's hard to treat. A total zoo of seemingly unrelated symptoms made all the more difficult with things like brain fog and psychological impairments. Interesting, pirenzepine is a antimuscarinic agent (M1 selective antagonist). Neatly in the class of psychopharmacological drugs. I predominately use Amitriptyline and Modafinil as well as Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) and a very strict diet. Modafinil is a no-go for anyone with gut issues and I don't know the alternatives very well. Modafinil in the morning and Amitriptyline at night help push my autonomic system into the sympathetic and parasympathetic states respectively. I have a very complicated rational around choosing these meds which is not fully fleshed out yet, but they worked for me and work for some others in the long covid cohort. So for now it is good enough and what I'm sticking with. As I understand the science better I might consider switching up the meds and seeing what happens.

If my memory serves me right, half of all flouroquinolone drugs have been taken off the market due to adverse reactions. Generally, this family of drugs should no longer be used as first line treatment. Doctors still often use it as first line for UTI though. It carries a very high risk of damage to tendons and neurological system.

I don't know how much of it is a purely psychological sense of resilience you build up by regularly putting yourself through difficult physical stressors in small doses, and how much of it is from physical changes that (presumably) improve your autonomic function and balance... but whatever it is, it's been life changing, going on about 10+ years now, depending how I count it. reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentJust want to add, for some there is the issue of post exertional malaise (PEM) when cardio becomes counter productive.

Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is probably the most used and widely accepted med within the patient communities and due to having a rather mild side effect profile is a great place to start. Such side effects include really crazy dreams, insomnia, and nausea. The stronger the side effects the more likely it'll work and the negative side effects will go away in time. I predominately use amitriptyline and modafinil but I don't have the gut comorbidities that would preclude the use of modafinil. I'm not familiar with alternatives to modafinil but a friend who previously had success with modafinil, until the gut issues became too much for him, switched to levosulpiride and he says that worked great. This appears to be counterintuitive for me but psychopharmacological meds are a tough one because they almost always have more than one receptor binding affinity and there is the interplay between ligands of different types and strengths as well as how the brain and body reacts with it. In general I prefer the weaker ligands than the stronger ones and don't try to over-optimize such that every day is good, I target 80% of them. I basically looked up what books are used in that field and read a bunch of those; Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology being one of the better ones. There are also books on dysautonomia but I don't know if there is a particular one I would recommend - the whole dysautonomia space is rather nebulous. My big takeaway from that is that is dysautonomia is super complex and hardly anyone understands it. reply rednerrus 1 hour agoparentprevIs it related to HSV?

It also appears with toxic mold syndrome and heavy metal stuff. I suppose it’s theoretically possible for someone to get a IQ bump from HSV I think the correlation is more from selection criteria biased on severity.

What is hypermobility in this context? reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentThe official criteria is based on the Beighton score, I think the official thresholds are too high so this test has a bunch of false negatives. I think people can be only mildly hypermobile, especially men, and still show up in the long covid cohorts much more often than they should. It's considered a spectrum, hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), where on one end you have Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hEDS and on the other end you have generalized joint hypermobility (GJH).

I thought it was a coping mechanism for managing the regret of taking the vaccine AND then getting covid and/or injured. Is there a proper differential diagnosis? reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentLong covid is no longer a thing the same way ME/CFS is no longer a thing. The world moves on without you (me). I did have an adverse reaction and I knew before taking it that I was in a high risk category for adverse effects, i.e. I already knew I had ME/CFS. My main consideration was that I'm also in the high risk category for adverse effect from covid. I'm open to the idea that the pericarditis that I got from the vaccine I would not have gotten from covid but I really don't know. I wish this was something that society would talk about openly and honestly. Not something I particularly wanted to get into but the genetic predispositions for long covid do seem to appear most frequently in the more intelligent. And since our society is so stratified by intelligence a large portion of the population does not directly interact with intelligent people and are truly sincere when they report that they don't personally know anyone with long covid. My experience is quite different as 1/3rd of my friends that I knew prior to my own issues have developed such long covid/ME/CFS issues of their own. I went through the whole gifted / magnet schooling system so my peer group is substantially biased. reply richrichie 3 hours agorootparent> genetic predispositions for long covid do seem to appear most frequently in the more intelligent I am not surprised, since many of them were easily manipulated into a pretty bad risk trade off that even a plumber would not take. Regret is bound to be high for that kind of people. Historically speaking many of the brief episodes of strange psycho-somatic “illness” with vague descriptions were found among the equivalent of the laptop class and suburban wine moms. reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentI believe the word you're looking for is 'credulous'. Yes, there is a general question of why do otherwise smart people believe ridiculous things. There is a common refrain that because they're smart they can more easily rationalize their beliefs but I don't believe that is true. I think diminished ability to ameliorate stress leads to stress aversion behaviors and a strong attraction to rules, structure, and authority. I think when the effect of that is greater than their intelligence they become prone to believing many untrue things but once intelligence goes over a certain threshold that effect is lost. I think that's why a lot of the bell curve memes ring true to many people where both the very smart and the very dim share the same beliefs but for different reasons. Historically speaking most of those people, generally considered hypochondriacs, did have the conditions they complained of. Historically medicine has been literally blowing smoke up peoples asses, draining their blood, and feeding them mercury. I think it's a bit weird that you're using evidence from the same medical system you don't trust to get covid and the vaccines right to unwittingly gaslight on their behalf. You are simultaneously dismissing others personal anecdotes while providing your own as evidence. I believe you are reporting honestly of your observations, just as I believe these wine drinking suburban moms do have the conditions they complain of. This stuff does affect women worse than men and for the aforementioned stratification reasons those affected are more likely to be in the upper middle class and above. reply vouaobrasil 7 hours agoprev> “The final feature is a reduced sense of personal accomplishment,” Santos said. “You never feel like you’re doing things effectively and so you feel ineffective and like the work you do doesn’t matter. If you notice signs like this, it’s important that you pay attention early on and make some changes in order to feel better.” I wonder if this had to do with the fact that in modern society, we often have to go through great mental loops to convince ourselves that our jobs are meaningful. After all, they are very far away from doing things like obtaining food and shelter or even learning things we are curious about. At some point, I feel like the illusion cannot be held for long: it starts in school when the learning is onstensibly about curiosity but then the gradient between curiosity-driven learning and being a cog slowly eats away at the facade that we have constructed in our minds of actually doing something useful in society until burnout becomes inevitable.

I'm not saying this or that _is_ sustainable, just that the point people declare it \"unsustainable\" is often only the beginning. It's a (mis)perception David Goggins speaks of a lot - about just how much deeper an organism can dig in crisis, or how low our pain/risk thresholds are set. Maybe we unconsciously factor that in.

I think toys are meaningful. They encourage exploration and fun. That's certainly meaningful and fun is a basic human instinct. What isn't meaningful is that which does not contribute to an increase in human happiness in the long-run, such as the creation of new iterations of phone models that last only a few years just so people have to upgrade. It's difficult to define meaningful, but I would include that which allows people to enjoy their life in a sustainable world that is compatible with creating opportunities for freely exploring all aspects of human existence, while maintaining respect for other living beings.

Cynicism is considerably less marketable, and stoicism isn't really observable at all: you're probably thinking of expressions of woe implying great burden and suffering.

We seem to be losing things that anchor our communities together, and I wonder if being directly dependent on other people in the community, as opposed to indirectly through layers of bigger, abstract businesses, isn’t one. There are obvious myriad and complex reasons we’ve arrived where we are, but it’s an interesting topic to ponder. I’ve also thought this shift could be responsible for other societal phenomena: it’s fairly well known that some portion of people are pretty awful to the people working in shops or restaurants. Is this perhaps a behavior that only really develops in a world where people rarely visit owner-operated businesses (where they might face consequences for treating the owner poorly)? reply JackMorgan 5 hours agorootparentIt's helped me a lot to move to a small town that is thriving near a big city, then volunteer on ambulance and firefighting.

It helps to feel like I'm doing something valuable to society and not just fixing the validation on an input form for the 1000th time.

I am doing a PhD and this is so true in so many levels. reply vouaobrasil 6 hours agorootparentI got a PhD myself. And I think it's definitely at least partially true: I was told flat-out that I should stick to big-business style research (i.e. research areas with large, complex and directed research plans) and forget following my own curiosity. Of course, once you get tenure in places where it exists or you make it, you can deviate from that. It's even worse in industry, where I worked after academia. I felt like I was using 5% of my brain to do things I was bored to death with. This isn't just me either: many of the people I've worked with feel the same, including virtually all my fellow PhD students. I feel like the only thing keeping it going is the novelty of working in new places, meeting new people, and getting new projects. It's almost as if we have a basal attraction to novelty because it's a survival instinct, but we have distilled life so that novelty is the only thing left, stripped of substance long ago when we traded thought for automation. Of course, it's even harder to see it because we have \"propagandists\" (i.e. then 1% of people who have carved out a protective bubble for themselves due to a combination of luck, ingenuity, and gaming the system) that say that amazing things are happening. reply FredPret 6 hours agorootparentIf you think: - only 1% of people are happy - they are happy because they are lucky - every happy person is a propagandist You need immediate recalibration of your worldview. You only live once, and you ought to be happy. People managed to be happy throughout human history because it’s a skill. EDIT: I wanted to add that I meant the above in good faith and not as an attack. I used to be unhappy too. But I learnt: - every moment doesn't need to be hedonic bliss - life doesn't have to be easy - one's work doesn't need to meet all of one's needs ... and you can still be happy. Human beings are extremely tough and adaptable, but that is a capability that has to be exercised. reply noodleman 5 hours agorootparentI think a lot of people aren't necessarily happy because they're highly skilled at it, but because its a default state of being. If it was purely a skill then environmental or biological factors wouldn't play any role. If anything, we learn to be unhappy. It's no secret how toxic academia can be - I would say the original commenter's personal observation that only 1% of people are happy is probably because many people around them are deeply unhappy. I know I felt this way when I was in a different career. Once I moved out of that field, I was astounded to find out that people are actually not depressed most of the time. I won't lie, the improved financial situation that followed was a big factor - it's definitely easier to be happy when you're not poor! So, I agree, a recalibration is in order. But that might involve removing yourself from certain social groups as much as it requires a thought pattern adjustment. reply vouaobrasil 5 hours agorootparentprevI never claimed that only 1% of people are happy. You are reading my comment far too literally. People can find meaning in their lives independent of their work, even if they hate their job. Nor do I think that people are happy because they are lucky, or that people who are happy are true propagandists. I only meant that not many people can find true meaning in their work only, and that this phenomenon is far from a theoretical optimum. Of course, people that find meaning in their work aren't literal propagandists.

Because people trying to sell us on voting this way or that (illegal immigrants are ruining the country! big bad corporates are ruining the environment!) or spending our money a certain way first have to convince us that the status quo is unacceptable and that they alone can effect change. Get rid of these ideas and watch your well-being skyrocket. reply coldtea 3 hours agorootparent>Why do these ideas exist? Because people are not blind. And while happiness needs the \"inside yourself\", it also needs the outside. Especially the outside that affects the inside, like reduce socialization and spaces to meet causing loneliness, social media and \"personal highlight reels\" posts from thousands that one sees causing feeling of inadequacy and missing out, an economic climate that brings precarity and uncertainty, etc. Of course if you e.g. make $200+ plus stock bonuses and such a year in a cushy IT job you might dispute the latter is a thing, and if you're an introverted \"hacker\" type, you might dispute the former is a thing as well. It's like billionaires saying \"everybody can succeed, just look at my and my unicorn 1 in 1000000 company\". And while we can be happy even with bad external conditions (e.g. third world poverty) it's very possible that we cannot be happy with all kinds of bad external conditions, e.g. a damaged social fabric, widespread atomization of society, meaningless work, status and income uncertainty in a consumerist (not a third world, where everybody is poor anyway) society, and so on. reply ericjmorey 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't think they made the claim that only 1% of people are happy, but 1% are \"propagandists\" as defined by having carved out protections for themselves.

It would also be hard to create them via some state intervention, because it's very hard to create \"meaningful, high impact, high autonomy\" via bureucratic process. reply sentimentscan 4 hours agorootparentI don't mean state intervention as most programmers are quite privileged, but a company that creates something like skunk works for people for burned out people reply picometer 3 hours agorootparent*If* such a thing could be done under typical corporate incentives/behavior, then I suspect the “high impact” part would need to be scrapped. Because when something is important to a corporation, it turns its eyes that thing (so to speak), which disrupts the other properties. Or, “high impact” could be spread over the long term. So, unknown-payoff R&D. It would need to be an “invest and ignore” strategy and require a lot of institutional trust. reply badpun 3 hours agorootparentprevAs Steve Jobs put it, \"we're in a business of making phones, not hiring people\".

You'll get there. reply me_me_me 6 hours agoparentprevCould you give an account of how it started and how are you dealing with it? reply bowsamic 6 hours agorootparentIt would take too long to explain all the details. Basically I started my postdoc after my PhD, and my boss was/still is completely absent and left me alone. For specific reasons pertaining to my psychological history as I uncovered in the therapy, this caused a very strong reaction in me of abandonment, and I found it impossible to continue to work. My boss refused to do anything to help me, he would not give me more help or attention. However, my contract is fixed at three years, I am not in my home country, I live in Germany with my wife who I brought here with me who has a \"real job\", and I get paid a lot. Therefore, I can just remain at home doing nothing (no one cares if I go in or not) and get paid, which also has not helped. Of course, now I am going to abandon academia, which is very painful, since it is my entire life so far, but I clearly cannot make it work even though I have tried extensively. I need to be in work where you actually are a part of a team, getting feedback, talking to people. As my contract comes to an end I will be forced to look for a job, but of course I'm completely terrified because of the burnout: I've never had a \"real job\", and when I tried to do some programming work for my stepdad, even though it went well, I felt terrible when doing it and I felt burnt out with that too. My strategy was of course to seek mental health services, since at the beginning of the burnout my mental health was much worse (suicidal ideation, depression, etc.) and I found my therapist. I won't go into detail about the therapy because it is a kind of psychotherapy that is common and supported by insurance in Europe but that is controversial in the US. Of course, the therapy has helped hugely. I no longer have thoughts of suicide and I don't have depression anymore. However I am still terrified of work and am almost completely convinced I will have all the same feelings of apathy, disappointment, and lack of motivation when I try. First step, I need to convince a company that I don't have these fears, and lie to them about my motivations, and hope they believe me.

And it was fascinating because they had all these zany, really distinctive guns like four-barrelled shotguns and revolver-rifles. Unfortunately they ran out of such weapons pretty quickly and the channel devolved into a lot of \"this gun that looks and works just like every other AK-47 is interesting because it was made in Hungary, and most Hungarian AKs received an upgrade but this one didn't\" which I personally felt was a bit of a snoozefest. But if you're interested in seeing a great many very minor variants of mundane items, you might like gun history. reply backspace_ 19 hours agorootparentI wonder if you are talking about forgotten weapons with Ian McMullen. I could understand if you would get tired of seeing 50 different iterations of the same rifle. I take it as it is interesting to see how each country in the Warsaw pact or countries that the Soviet union supplied technical packages to, such as North Korea, China, or Vietnam, iterated on the design. How did they improve the design or what were there limitations in manufacturing. What can be learned from the changes they made. For such, to each their own. reply patch_collector 19 hours agorootparentprevThere’s an interesting museum in Cody, Wyoming that has thousands of guns, including some very interesting ones like whaling guns from the 1800s.

You can definitely tell a compelling story and keep going for a good while. The problem is that collecting often devolves into obsessing over insignificant details, simply because there's more of them - and if you run out of, you can invent new ones.

You would get large stores that carried everything, so if you went there for one thing, you would find all the other stuff in the middle.

I heard that they are important and I put them where the instructions tell me / where i found them, but i wouldn’t know why. I hope others have a more intuitive understanding of them and not everyone is just cargo culting like I do. reply aetherspawn 17 hours agoparentWashers are designed to spread out the force of the bolt head over a larger area so that the bolt can be done up to a tighter torque without damaging the contact area. They are actually quite malleable, which is kind of required because the contact area could be imperfect or ever so slightly angled. A bolt on the other hand, there is almost no malleability there at all. Most bolts are rigid and inflexible because of their geometry and because the tiny threads need to be very strong. In recent years, washers have evolved a little further and now many washers also include a locking feature to prevent the bolt from coming undone. You also see thicker washers and spring washers which are designed to regulate the bolt force even if the temperature varies a lot and the bolt expands or contracts. Finally, the washer material might be important. Steel bolts corrode against everything, so most washers that you find are probably zinc plated or similar and designed to insulate the bolt head material from the contact surface material. reply analog31 17 hours agoparentprevI deal with washers, in the development of precision mechanisms. They can serve a lot of useful purposes. For instance nuts and bolts can gouge into the parts that they're holding together. A washer provides a sort of sliding bearing between the two, that takes the brunt of wear, and is easily replaced. It can spread out a load on a hole, including if the holes are made oversized to make up for tolerance variations in the parts. This is useful for bolting together wooden structures, or softer materials like aluminum. Stocking a variety of washers could be cheaper than stocking multiple types of bolt heads and nuts. It can be a spacer. There are specialized washers that can take up small angular tolerance variations, such as the spherical washers in some bike brake pads. You don't see them everywhere, and using them by habit isn't necessarily the right thing to do in all cases. reply Duanemclemore 20 hours agoprevWhile the physical form of this is wonderful, the thing I would really want to do is sit down with her and discuss the characteristics and uses of each washer. reply ozten 17 hours agoparentYes, I think that is the point? reply Luc 20 hours agoprevThere's some interesting shaped ones in the pile closest to her, not really washers I think. I wonder how they were collected/selected - picked up from the streets perhaps? (I have an extensive collection of hard drive platter spacers) reply bbarnett 19 hours agoparentThe drice spacers make me think of my favourite stick of RAM. In the 90s, I repaired Commodore Amigas, and I do mean repaired. Back then you'd de/solder replace chips, caps, anything borked on a motherboard. In one case, it wasn't the motherboard, it was a stick of RAM that seemed borked. Wouldn't even boot with it in place, so I swapped it for a new stick, problem solved. One day I was opening boxes of product, and my utility knife was MIA. Seeing as it was dead RAM, and it was sitting on the table, I used it to cut the tape on the box. It became my new box opener. This went on for months, with hundreds of boxes cut open. Typically I'd just leave it my pocket. All day, home to work, just hanging out in my pocket. One day at home I needed the pocket space, and threw it on a table. It sat there for months, got wet (spilled beer, drinks), was looked at, touched by 100 people, and then I moved. Months later, in another city, I had RAM die in my machine. So I dug it out and tried it, and it worked! And I proceeded to use it for another few years in that machine. Was I mistaken in thinking the RAM was dead? Did the abuse fix it? Either way, that was strong RAM. Powerful RAM.

Simplest design ever, yet perform such a crucial service. reply heisenzombie 18 hours agoparentIf you're talking about split-ring lock washers, I would think again. They do not accomplish any kind of locking, and may make vibration-induced loosening _worse_ by providing a small opening force. They are useless for almost all purposes. If you mean something like a Nord-Lock washer, then carry on. reply jethro_tell 19 hours agoparentprevbut, not the service of enlarging the contact surface of the bolt or screw head. Actually, they only perform a tiny fraction of the crucial services performed by washers and can be replaced by loctite in almost all situations, so, I'd contend they are the most worthless of washers. reply suzzer99 19 hours agorootparentBut you don't always need more surface area, just something you don't want to wiggle loose, like say your cargo carrier on top of your car that's attached with hand wingnuts. I don't have enough experience with loctite to know if I want to spray it on that. reply jethro_tell 16 hours agorootparentSplit washers only work in a relatively narrow torque band. If I can't use a torque wrench, I'll use a lock nut or loctite. There are very few applications where a split washer adds much value. reply heisenzombie 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah, a split ring washer there is probably not doing much. Possibly even making things worse. Given it's more or less impossible to sufficiently torque a wing nut, there are actually not many great solutions... A dab of low strength loctite would definitely help, but that's one-time-only and you've got to carry the loctite around if you want to re-do the connection... At which point why not just carry a spanner instead and just use a properly-torqued normal nut? Probably the best would be to swap out the plain wingnuts for nylock wing nuts, which should at least help a bit. reply suzzer99 15 hours agorootparentI bought some split ring washers and they worked great.

We won't try to adjust computed font sizes if (visibleWidth >= width()) at RenderBlockFlow::adjustComputedFontSizes. On the first load, RenderBlockFlow::width is calculated to a value that allows TextAutoSizing to set new computed font sizes for the text nodes on the page. Width is much larger than visibleWidth, ultimately coming from WebPageProxy::textAutosizingWidth which returns WebCore::screenSize().width(). At refresh,RenderBlockFlow::width returns a value that is actually equal to visibleWidth (and screenSize().width()). There seems to depend on timing. I wasn't able to reproduce that when simulator CPU load was too high. Since the page where the bug manifests itself already has responsive CSS styling, we can quirk TextAutoSizing to skip adjusting for it, at least until we figure out why we are calculating RenderBlockFlow width inconsistently: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275223 * Source/WebCore/page/LocalFrameViewLayoutContext.cpp: (WebCore::LocalFrameViewLayoutContext::applyTextSizingIfNeeded): * Source/WebCore/page/Quirks.cpp: (WebCore::Quirks::skipTextAutoSizing const): * Source/WebCore/page/Quirks.h: Canonical link: https://commits.webkit.org/279788@main Loading branch information vitorroriz committed 1 parent b6db305 commit 84ae355 Showing 3 changed files with 17 additions and 0 deletions.

Other big players, such as Amazon, simply negotiate the Apple tax – instead of paying the 30%. Naturally, Apple doesn't tell you how often and for whom it breaks its rules. reply GeekyBear 2 hours agorootparent> Apple's guidelines are meant to be broken anyway. Bloomberg's app (Bloomberg Professional) is unusable without an account, which is 100% against iOS guidelines Any app whose purpose is to allow users to access subscription content works this way. Netflix would be another common example of an app that is used to access subscription content and is not useful without an account. If your app is free, but a subscription to your content is not, the most common practice is to not allow users to pay the subscription fee through your app at all. If users can't pay through your app, then Apple doesn't get a dime. reply bakje 7 hours agorootparentprevWhy are apps that require accounts against the guidelines? Don't lots of apps require accounts such as Google Calendar or 1Password?

Other big players, such as Amazon, simply negotiate the Apple tax – instead of paying the 30%. Both of the companies mentioned don't make money from the use of their app -- at least not directly. Sure, you can do all of your purchasing w/ Amazon through their app, but the website remains available if that is more to your liking. For free apps like Google Calendar, this is also the model. Bloomberg's app is a front-end to the Bloomberg Professional Service (colloquially, \"The Terminal\") and to read more than a few articles or access any of the data sources, you need to sign up. Tl;dr It's not cheap Free trials can be converted on iOS, but -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- require going to a web browser instead of it all happening inside of IAP, although, that could come along at some point...

I usually disagree with Apple's restrictions, but isn't this (rather clearly) under the Enterprise application exception (App Review Guidelines 3.1.3(c), and indirectly 4.8)? This is, clearly, an enterprise product (you can't even register with this version unless you're a company). Do you actually knows the rules or are you just spewing garbage out of your mouth? Actually, won't third-party mail applications also be in violation of the purported restriction because, by the nature of being a mail application, needs to log in before any use? You should actually point out which rule/s are being broken because despite honest attempts to find the alleged rule being broken...

They let me in, after a few hoops. This was in 2016-2019 (but now they are PWA) reply ryandrake 4 hours agorootparentHonestly, I wish they'd enforce the \"require no account\" rule more strictly. One of the most annoying things about using a mobile app is when they hit you with the \"Sign in or GTFO\" page on first run, as soon as you install the app. At the very least, if an application absolutely requires an account to function, this should be prominently displayed, and they should explain in technical details what functionality cannot be possibly achieved without logging in. App Stores should reject apps that gate basic phone functionality (like GPS directions or camera access) behind an online account. These things obviously don't require an account to work, because they work on the default apps without accounts. reply 1f60c 8 hours agorootparentprevI wish Apple had never abandoned the rule that you need to be able to subscribe in the app at the same listed price as on the web. reply zarzavat 7 hours agorootparentI don’t, it’s anticompetitive. Sellers should be able to pass platform fees on to consumers, otherwise there’s no incentive for Apple to decrease those fees, there’s no feedback in the system. Then if you don’t want to pay the Apple tax you can subscribe directly. This incentivizes Apple to keep the fees low. reply ryandrake 4 hours agorootparentTotally disagree. As a customer, I should not have to pay more or less for an application depending on what phone or computer I use to buy it. This would be like charging the customer more when they use an American Express card to buy your product, just because AMEX charges merchants more. At some point, you have to just admit that as a business you have certain costs that you have to pay to operate. This mentality, that business costs must be borne by customers, is what's leading to all these ridiculous hidden fees and charges at other businesses. reply dylan604 4 hours agorootparent> just because AMEX charges merchants more. There are many places that do not even accept AmEx specifically because of their fees. Charging more based on card use has always been a thing until the card companies used their cartel like persuasion to not allow that. However, I'm starting to see stores offer different prices for cash/debit than credit. I thought I remembered this being made allowed again, but it's early still. You as a user feel like you should be able to buy whatever whenever with whatever mode of payment. That's very convenient for you even though you're the one that has decided to use that particular mode of payment even though you know your mode of payment is an absolute pain in the arse for the merchant. Not having you as a customer is a perfectly valid point of view from the merchant. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentI'm actually OK with businesses deciding to not take a certain kind of credit card or them going cash only. Fine, go ahead and lose me as a customer. Just don't nickel and dime me because you're too cheap and stubborn to accept the tiny gross margin difference between one card and an another. reply codewiz 2 hours agorootparentHidden fees remove any consumer-side pressure on credit cards to lower their costs. It also creates perverse incentives for cards to pass part of the merchant fees back to the consumer as rewards or even cash. Here in the US, 2-3% cash back is typical, driving consumers to prefer credit over other payment methods. Meanwhile, merchants are forced to bake the fees into the retail price, causing the paradox that those who pay upfront end up spending more for the same goods. reply recursive 2 hours agorootparentprevThink of it as a discount in the other direction. reply kemayo 3 hours agorootparentprevI agree up to a point. Credit card fees are pretty low, overall, so a business deciding to charge me a few percent more if I pay with AmEx vs Visa feels like they're just being petty. But with the App Store, it's a significant chunk of the purchase price -- a business wanting to pass on a 30% increase in their costs seems reasonable. reply NorwegianDude 2 hours agorootparentIt's a ~43 % increase, not 30 %. Apple takes 30 %, so you would have to increase the price by ~43 % to cover it. reply lmz 4 hours agorootparentprevIf Amex started charging 30% fees you'd definitely see people charging customers more. reply talldayo 2 hours agorootparentprev> At some point, you have to just admit that as a business you have certain costs that you have to pay to operate. Alternatively, you could take Apple's example and charge people an arbitrary amount for the privilege of accessing your business and leave the certainty of certain costs for the shmucks. reply adra 3 hours agorootparentprevYou absolutely will eat the extra charges, the question is will you bear the brunt directly with a behavior targetted at you uniquely or will the company just raise the cost of the product for everyone and have everybody pay more even if they get a fat pay day when they don't end up paying the platform overhead tax. reply ladberg 2 hours agorootparentprev> This would be like charging the customer more when they use an American Express card to buy your product, just because AMEX charges merchants more. I 100% believe this should be the case. It's unfair to merchants to take away an arbitrary percentage of their profits depending on which card you want to use. reply lililililililll 7 hours agorootparentprevThis would be fine if apple would either waive their tax, or allowed the seller to list for the (base price) + (apple tax). As it was, sellers would earn 30% less for sales gouged by apple Interesting that this post got flagged. Y'all are showing your biases. Nothing about this post violated any HN rules. reply its-summertime 9 hours agoprevLooking at the html of HN's pages, can't blame them really.

Almost all of the warning and errors are related to using obsolete Element attributes and invaliddefinitions. Those shouldn't need any larger rework to clean up. I don't say this trying to imply that HN needs to fix these or are being lazy in not doing it. YC has priorities and provide HN for free. It's totally up to them whether fixes are worth it, I just wouldn't expect it to be a huge lift. reply Narretz 9 hours agorootparentprevAll this has nothing to do with outputting standard conformant CSS+HTML. reply sharpshadow 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd no JS needed for most of the functionality. reply bastawhiz 7 hours agoparentprevThe HTML is immaterial.

A semantically correct HTML would be something like a frontpage with anand the comment section would be a series of nestedeach with acontaining the author aand an extra bonus if the parent/context/sibling links can go under a . And the separators between the header elements should not be a text content pipe character `|` but rather a CSS border-inline-start: 1px solid currentcolor; A minimal and semantically correct HTML does not only offer superior experience for users of assistive technology, it also make your page machine readable, so users can install browser plugins to e.g. do something useful with theelement, and ultimately makes your page much easier to style with CSS. reply arp242 9 hours agoparentprevPretty much all of the HTML validator \"errors\" warnings for outdated attributes and the like. The \"No space between attributes\" one is pretty much the only real error. reply debugnik 7 hours agorootparentPointing the validator at this submission and filtering out obsolete elements/attributes and all warnings/info messages, I still got 221 errors: No DOCTYPE, an script element after closing the body, duplicate element ids, and invalid attributes (not obsolete, they must be be using them like data-*). reply arp242 6 hours agorootparentNone of which are serious errors. Certainly not the type that introduce rendering errors. reply fallingknife 7 hours agoparentprevIf you remove trivial errors for no space between attributes, table formatting, and use of \"obsolete\" inline styling instead of CSS it really isn't many.

Turns out that the WebKit team in their infinite wisdom had added some sort of change to how this worked several months back, realized it broke Twitter, then committed a change to restore the old behavior specifically for us. Of course, they also didn’t want to keep this around forever, so they also checked the iOS version to disable this behavior after 14.5 (?). Which is all well and good, except they never told us about this at all. So of course we find out about it when I, being well acquainted with Apple’s stupid quirks process, find the Slack thread where everyone is confused what is going on, identify where the bug is coming from, then do a search in WebKit for where they hardcoded the behavior for us. So thanks, WebKit team.

They even have emulators now. Undoubtedly a change forced on them by the EU. reply jraph 8 hours agorootparentApparently you are right, they do since around February on iOS 17.4. In the EU only. https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engi... reply tjoff 7 hours agorootparentNeat, question is if any of the browsers actually have had time to make use of it though? reply input_sh 6 hours agorootparentIt's not as simple as that, you're basically asking browsers to target a completely different platform, just for the EU users, where iPhones are nowhere near as popular to begin with. Google might at some point maintain two completely different Chromes targeting iOS, but I doubt anyone else will (including Firefox). Even with Chrome, I wouldn't bet on it. It's a very difficult technical problem with no clear, easily-marketable benefit to most people. Apple knew what they were doing, they've \"complied\", but in a way where nobody would bother. reply YmiYugy 5 hours agorootparentAs far as I know a native Chromium port to iOS is well under way. Whether Google will release Chrome is a different question, but I think it's likely. I think Google would love to bring Blink Chrome on iOS everywhere and there is a decent amount of momentum with developers and regulators to pressure Apple into allowing third party browser engines even outside the EU, but that completely goes away, if no actual engine get's ported to iOS. Blink Chrome on iOS probably gets a lot of enterprise web apps to drop WebKit support. That would probably that Chrome gets way more market share on iOS and with it lot's of telemetry for Google and also less money to Apple for default search engine placement. It's not great for the web as a standardized platform, but it will probably happen anyways. reply tjoff 5 hours agorootparentprevNo I agree, that was exactly my point. It's not like iOS users care anyway, or they wouldn't use iOS in the first place. reply galad87 7 hours agorootparentprevNo. reply fallingknife 7 hours agorootparentprevSo Microsoft got dragged through anti-trust hell for just bundling IE with Windows and letting you install whatever browser you wanted after that, but Apple gets away with literally banning you from installing the browser you want on your own device, but that's ok? Make it make sense. reply qingcharles 4 hours agorootparentThey didn't totally get away with, the EU has set them to rights at least. It's just a shame they didn't use it as an opportunity to do the right thing globally at that point rather than sharding the market. reply dspillett 6 hours agorootparentprevMS went through anti-trust investigation for more than just bundling IE, and at the time commanded a much larger market share¹ of desktop computing than Apple do of the mobile market now. But while your comparison is flawed, I agree with the assertion² that Apple should not be locking user choice like this. The EU agree too, hence Apple's immature little hissy fit nearly breaking their (already \"not quite there\") offline-first app support for EU users when they were told so. -- [1] Avoiding the word \"monopoly\" to pre-counter the sort of \"well actually\" responses I got about dictionary definitions last time I said something like this. [2] Unless I'm reading you backwards and you are saying MS should have been able to like Apple currently do! reply fallingknife 2 hours agorootparentYou are not reading me backwards. And MSFT is worse today. I had to make changes at the BIOS level in a new Windows laptop to make it let me install Firefox without creating a Microsoft account. Was an ordeal just to get it to let me log in in the first place with a local only account. reply kalleboo 5 hours agorootparentprevThe Microsoft ruling in the US was that Microsoft was forcing third-party OEMs (Dell, HP etc) to ship Internet Explorer, not that they shipped it themselves. As for the EU, they have already forced Apple to allow third-party browser engines under the DMA, as well as are forcing Apple to show a \"browser ballot\" like they made Microsoft do. reply revscat 6 hours agorootparentprevThe market shifted, and two decades passed. Most importantly the courts have been packed with jurists from the Federalist society, who are libertarian. As a result there are far more judges willing and able to throw out consumer protection cases such as what happened in the 90’s with Microsoft and IE. reply hhh 9 hours agorootparentprevwhat’s wrong with ios/safari? i don’t really ever have issues reply flessner 7 hours agorootparentSafari on MacOS is really nice, fast and offers everything I need... but every 3 months or so I stumble on a website that refuses to work at all - rendering looks off, buttons don't work etc... Switching to Chrome usually fixes it - but I always question my sanity for about 10 minutes until I try it in Chrome. reply SassyBird 5 hours agorootparentIt’s the opposite for me. I keep finding dumb bugs in Chromium, when it comes to correct website rendering and event handling (always regressions). Safari and Firefox on the other hand never have those issues. The only problem is: Safari has piss-poor ad blockers. Firefox blocks custom system-wide keyboard shortcuts (on Mac). reply tyho 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's an odd way of saying the third most popular browser. reply Terretta 8 hours agorootparentIf you click link, look at chart, you'll see they mean second. reply stavros 7 hours agorootparentThat's always confusing. They should have said \"the second most popular browser (after Chrome)\", or something like that. reply DANmode 1 hour agorootparent\"blah blah blah, *second only to Chrome.\" reply lapcat 8 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about quirks specifically, but often it takes many, many months before a WebKit commit actually ships to end users in Safari. Anyway, Apple engineers aren't known for their outreach. reply mort96 6 hours agoparentprevI hate CORS. Garbage like this is a large reason why. CORS works differently in every browser and every website. I don't hate CORS when writing my own stuff, to be clear. Adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to my own website's headers is easy enough. I hate when I'm using a website and something doesn't work and I look at the console and see CORS errors. Opening the same website in Chrome usually works. I hate CORS. reply rnicholus 3 hours agorootparent>CORS works differently in every browser and every website. Do you have some examples of this? reply mort96 3 hours agorootparentNot anything concrete, just memories of things not working, me looking at the JS console, seeing CORS errors, and seeing it work in Chrome, as I described. And the comment I replied to showed that it works differently between websites, namely: if (host == \"tripadvisor.com\"_s || host.endsWith(\".tripadvisor.com\"_s)) m_needsRelaxedCorsMixedContentCheckQuirk = true; reply orphea 7 hours agoparentprevI guess a similar thing is happening with GPU drivers and games. reply CapsAdmin 7 hours agorootparentyes, and drivers (used to at least) check the filename of the exe causing unexpected behaviour like performance degradation or even gains in some cases reply wruza 6 hours agorootparentIn cases like benchmarking software, I guess. reply easyThrowaway 8 hours agoparentprevI wonder if any of those rules could be (mis)used to workaround or defeat iOs/macOs security features? reply nottorp 9 hours agoprev> we can quirk TextAutoSizing to skip adjusting for it, at least until we figure out why we are calculating RenderBlockFlow width inconsistently: Looks like it's a bug on their side and this is a bandaid? That will presumably live forever. reply maybevain 8 hours agoprevInterestingly there seems to be a few quirks for twitter.com, but none for x.com. I assume that'll lead to some regressions? reply saagarjha 8 hours agoparentProbably. But I doubt the engineers care about X as they did for Twitter. reply influx 7 hours agorootparentWhy is that? reply manuelmoreale 6 hours agorootparentI guess because Twitter used to be the place where all the tech people were hanging out and so there was an incentive to make it work properly while now is a bit of a cesspool in free fall and people have moved on to other platforms? That’s my guess. reply tomduncalf 2 hours agorootparentI don’t get the impression that many people have moved on, though I could be wrong as my usage of Twitter has decreased “post-X” - but more because the site is so frequently broken! No need for rendering workarounds in browsers if the site breaks itself lol. reply lapcat 8 hours agoprevUnfortunately these hacks last forever and can cause other problems. My web browser extension had to add a hack to work around WebKit's YouTube hack: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245612 reply onion2k 9 hours agoprevThis feels like a poor solution to the problem. As much as I like HN, browsers changing to maintain the status quo is a terrible idea. At the very least there should be a user controllable array of domains to apply this to in the config rather than a single magic string for one website. reply bob1029 9 hours agoprevI am confused. What part of the hacker news web source was more difficult to change than the source code for my web browser? reply glonq 1 hour agoprevTIL that it's not just me who finds the default text size on HN to be excruciatingly tiny. I'd presumed that it was just an unfortunate side-effect of aging and poor vision! reply Thorrez 1 hour agoparentThat's not what this is about. This is about fixing a bug in WebKit where HN's font is too large on the first load, then normal on subsequent loads. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275221 reply emursebrian 6 hours agoprevDo other browser vendors add special cases in their codebase for specific sites? It seems like a really bad idea. Since around 2020, I've been working on an app that makes heavy use of audio playback and recording. I feel like I am frequently making Safari specific updates because something related media playback or recording stopped working on Safari. I don't recall this kind of regression ever happening with Chromium-based browsers or Firefox. It feels weird in 2024 to be adding work-arounds and hacks specific web browsers and anecdotally, it seems to be getting worse. See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40134383. On BrowserStack, still no Safari dev tools on iOS 17.4+ reply phrz 6 hours agoparentThis has existed for every web engine since time immemorial, calling out Safari is misleading. Firefox calls them \"site interventions\" and Chrome calls them \"patches\" rather than Safari/WebKit's \"quirks\". reply nightpool 33 minutes agorootparentDo you have a link to the Chrome site-specific patches directory? As you can imagine, it's pretty hard to search for :P reply kalleboo 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd beyond web engines, operating systems have them too - both Windows and macOS have workarounds for popular apps. reply kmlx 5 hours agorootparentgpu drivers with patches for individual games. reply rob 8 hours agoprevAwesome, time to submit a ticket to WebKit to auto-adjust HN's default text size to 16px like everybody else instead of 12px. It made sense in 2007 when your resolution was 1024x768. reply zachrip 6 hours agoparentI am visually impaired so take this with a grain of salt but HN is so much better to read at 200% for me. Every time it reverts back to 100% I wonder how people spend so much time reading that small text. reply coldpie 3 hours agoparentprevThere's no one-size-fits all. Use your browser's Zoom feature. It will remember your settings. I find most websites have too big text, so I zoom to 66% on a lot of sites. reply wruza 6 hours agoparentprevThis breaks my workflow. reply account42 7 hours agoparentprev> It made sense in 2007 when your resolution was 1024x768. Yes and so it makes sense today because CSS pixels are resolution independent. If something worked on 1024x768 monitors in 2007 but is too small on your monitor today then the problem is with your settings not the website. reply rwalle 7 hours agorootparentSo why does HN text look so small under default settings on the desktop, and I always need to zoom to 133% to match the font size on other websites (that require no special treatment)? Am I using the browser wrong, or something is not quite right with HN? I am inclined to think the latter. reply wruza 6 hours agorootparentI always need to zoom 125-130% on all sites on top of 125% desktop system zoom and HN needs no special treatment. E.g. wikipedia is basically the same. Anyway, you can set [default] zoom once and enjoy. Unless you’re in a browser in which no one uses that per-site zoom feature cause it’s not implemented cause no one uses it. In this case, you can embrace the simplicity or use StyleBot. reply rob 6 hours agorootparentprev2560x1440 and ~12px on HN looks incredibly small. I just switched the resolution to 1024x768, and now the same ~12px is \"larger\" and easier to read without needing to increase my browser zoom. There's an obvious visual difference between the two. reply SassyBird 5 hours agorootparentWithout HiDPI (sic!) scaling that means that a correctly-sized display for that resolution would have a 30\" diagonal on Windows (standard PPI: 96) and 40\" on Mac (standard PPI: 72). If you don’t have HiDPI (sic!) scaling enabled in your system and your display is smaller than that, then you’re basically browsing everything zoomed out. reply account42 5 hours agorootparentprevThen your setup is not compliant with web standards. Most likely you need to enable DPI scaling somewhere. reply louis-lau 6 hours agorootparentprevThe font site is 9pt. It's just small. Not sure where someone got 12px from. The measurement is resolution independent, yes. reply SassyBird 5 hours agorootparent9pt == 12px on the web. You can check that in Web Inspector in computed styles. Alternatively: 1px = (1/96)in 1pt = (1/72)in = (1/72)*(96/72)*(72/96)in = (96/72)*(1/96)in = (4/3)*1px = (4/3)px 9pt = 9*1pt = 9*(4/3)px = 12px https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_... reply Kiro 8 hours agoprevOT but what's up with the spam comments? What's the purpose? reply syngrog66 3 hours agoprevA quick glance at the title made me hope HN would finally allow screen-responsive auto-wrap of text lines. Its 2024 now and we know a thing or two about good vs bad UX. reply formerly_proven 9 hours agoprev [–] Is this triggered by HN being a table-based layout?

In the original Text Twist, the shorter words were all in a specified order relative to the word order in the final word. For example, if the word was BIOPIC then TOP comes before TOPIC comes before TIC comes before OPT comes before POT. BIT would be the first word, and COT would be the last. (technically it was exactly opposite that, they were sorted in reverse of the order in which they appear in the final word, but that's harder to explain) With Text Twist 2 I guess they decided that was a bug not a feature (it was definitely a feature not a bug) and the order of the smaller words is now randomized. That one small change took the game from something I'd spend hours on to not even a little bit fun. Anyway to me this was pretty easy, I got all 23. I thought the letter order was very revealing on some of the later clues (like KINGDOM was almost entirely in order already) but maybe that was deliberate, anagramming a 7-letter word in 30s can be a bit hard One big piece of feedback, though: pressing enter should always clear your current letters (as in text twist) reply catapart 3 hours agoprevFun!

Edit: didn't find it yet, but there are variations on appliance vs. general purpose hardware where things like smart TVs and android phone bootloaders are used as similar examples. I wish I had a better timeline search for threads. reply linguae 16 minutes agorootparentThere are other reasons to buy an iPhone. I loathe the App Store’s restrictions, and this is a showstopper for me regarding the iPad, which would’ve been Alan Kay’s Dynabook if it weren’t for being limited to the App Store. However, I’m willing to tolerate a restricted app environment on a phone, though I wouldn’t mind a less restrictive experience. Ignoring the App Store, I find iOS to be more polished than Android, and I also like how Apple provides OS updates for its iPhones for roughly five years. I’m on my third iPhone (a 14 Pro) after using an SE and a 7; I switched to the iPhone SE after two years of using a Google Nexus, which I loved and was disappointed when Google discontinued it. reply shaan7 32 minutes agorootparentprevThat is an interesting take, so basically in your opinion the main thing that makes iOS better than Android is that Apple has tighter control over the apps? What I've heard from most iOS users is other things like smoother interface, better battery life, great camera etc. I've never heard \"I like iPhone because Apple moderates the App Store\" from laymen (i.e. non-HN crowd). reply katbyte 19 minutes agorootparentI’ll chime in as one of them (and in every thread about this many more people do as well) - it’s one of the many things I like about an iPhone, the tighter control and gate keeping Apple does on the App Store. I like not having to worry so much on the App Store or wade through scams etc (I know there’s not none but seems less and it’s easy to find the apps I want) and for my parents and less tech savvy friends it’s great But personally it comes down to it’s a phone not a computer to me and I don’t want to or care if I can run “anything” on it. reply Suppafly 6 minutes agorootparentThe lack of scam apps and crappy clones is the only real advantage that appeals to me.

Do people not get cause and effect? Ability to deny crap apps and ability to control what can run in background surely helps! reply shaan7 15 minutes agorootparentI'd argue that your latter point (optimizing background apps) is majority of the improvement and this is something you can do in the OS regardless of where an app comes from (excluding rooted/jailbroken devices from scope). This would've been a reasonable argument if Apple only ever denied apps because they did stupid things, not because they offered a payment gateway that did not pay Apple commission. Lets not pretend that Apple's control is only about curating an experience for the user, it is very significantly about maximizing profit as well. As a side note, I've always understood that just stock iOS is way more optimized than stock Android simply because of better engineering.

I don't live in a tech bubble or work in a tech job. My rants against apple are notorious, and I have largely stopped, because I can see how ignorant yet still apathetic people are about it. Just a short story to encapsulate it: On a recent trip with lots of friends we ended using my phone for most group shots and other nice pictures. The Pixel's camera really does shine. However when it came time to share those pictures, I informed everyone it would be best to get google photos where we could all dump the hundreds of pictures into one communal album.

    "title": "IRS Permanently Adopts Direct File for Federal Tax Returns Starting 2025",
    "originLink": "https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-makes-direct-file-a-permanent-option-to-file-federal-tax-returns-expanded-access-for-more-taxpayers-planned-for-the-2025-filing-season",
    "originBody": "IR-2024-151, May 30, 2024 WASHINGTON — Following a successful filing season pilot and feedback from a variety of partners, the Internal Revenue Service announced today that it will make Direct File a permanent option for filing federal tax returns starting in the 2025 tax season. The agency is exploring ways to expand Direct File to make more taxpayers eligible in the 2025 filing season and beyond by examining options to broaden Direct File’s availability across the nation, including covering more tax situations and inviting all states to partner with Direct File next year. The IRS plans to announce additional details on the 2025 expansion in the coming months. The decision follows a highly successful, limited pilot during the 2024 filing season, where 140,803 taxpayers in 12 states filed their taxes using Direct File. The IRS closely analyzed data collected during the pilot, held numerous meetings with diverse groups of stakeholders and gathered feedback from individual Direct File users, state officials and representatives across the tax landscape. The IRS heard directly from hundreds of organizations across the country, more than a hundred members of Congress and from those interested in using Direct File in the future. The IRS has also heard from a limited number of stakeholders who believe the current free electronic filing options provided by third party vendors are adequate. The IRS will continue data analysis and stakeholder engagement to identify improvements to Direct File; however, initial post-pilot analysis yielded enough information for the decision to make Direct File a permanent filing option. The IRS noted that an early decision on 2025 was critical for planning and programming both for the IRS and for additional states to join the program. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel recommended to Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen to make Direct File permanent. He cited overwhelming satisfaction from users and improved ease of tax filing among the reasons for his recommendation, which Secretary Yellen has accepted. “The clear message is that many taxpayers across the nation want the IRS to provide more than one no-cost option for filing electronically,” said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel. “So, starting with the 2025 filing season, the IRS will make Direct File a permanent option for filing federal tax returns. Giving taxpayers additional options strengthens the tax filing system. And adding Direct File to the menu of filing options fits squarely into our effort to make taxes as easy as possible for Americans, including saving time and money.” State and eligibility expansion Building on the success of the limited pilot – where taxpayers with relatively simple tax situations in 12 states were eligible to use Direct File – the IRS is examining ways to expand eligibility to more taxpayers across the country. For the 2025 filing season, the IRS will work with all states that want to partner with Direct File, and there will be no limit to the number of states that can participate in the coming year. The agency expects several new states will choose to participate. The IRS is also exploring ways to gradually expand the scope of tax situations supported by Direct File. Over the coming years, the agency’s goal is to expand Direct File to support most common tax situations, with a particular focus on those situations that impact working families. Announcements about new state partners and expanded eligibility are expected in the coming months. “User experience – both within the product and integration with state tax systems – will continue to be the foundation for Direct File moving forward,” Werfel said. “We will focus, first and foremost, on continuing to get it right. Accuracy and comprehensive tax credit uptake will be paramount concerns to ensure taxpayers file a correct return and get the refund they’re entitled to. And our North Star will be improving the experience of tax filing itself and helping taxpayers meet their obligations as easily and quickly as possible.” Direct File’s role in the tax system During the agency’s review, many taxpayers told the IRS they want no-cost filing options. Millions of taxpayers who did not live in one of the 12 pilot states visited the Direct File website to learn more about this option or asked live chat assistors to make Direct File available in their state. As a permanent filing option, Direct File will continue to be one option among many from which taxpayers can choose. It is not meant to replace other important options by tax professionals or commercial software providers, who are critical partners with the IRS in delivering a successful tax system for the nation. The IRS also remains committed to the ongoing relationship with Free File Inc., which has served taxpayers for two decades in the joint effort to provide free commercial software. Earlier this month, the IRS signed a five-year extension with industry to continue Free File. As the IRS works to expand Direct File, it will also work to strengthen all free filing options for taxpayers, including Free File, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE). Pilot analysis and feedback In the six weeks following the close of the Direct File pilot, the IRS closely analyzed pilot data and gathered feedback from diverse groups of stakeholders, including Direct File users, state officials and representatives across the country’s tax community. While data analysis and partner engagement are ongoing, the IRS’ post-pilot analysis has yielded three conclusions that support making Direct File a permanent tax filing solution: 1. Taxpayers overwhelmingly liked using Direct File As detailed in the IRS Direct File Pilot: Filing Season 2024 After Action ReportPDF, more than 15,000 Direct File users participated in the General Services Administration’s Touchpoints survey, which collects comprehensive user feedback about government systems: 90% of respondents ranked their experience as Excellent or Above Average. When asked what they particularly liked, respondents most commonly cited Direct File’s ease of use, trustworthiness and that it was free. Additionally, 86% of respondents said that their experience with Direct File increased their trust in the IRS. 90% of survey respondents who used customer support rated that experience as Excellent or Above Average. For the primary quantitative measure of taxpayer opinions of Direct File, the IRS selected the Net Promoter Score (NPS) customer sentiment metric, which asks users, “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Direct File to a friend or family member?” NPS scores range from -100-+100. Direct File has a NPS of +74. If compared to benchmark scores from financial services companies, Direct File would lead in eight of nine categories. 2. Direct File made the tax filing experience easier Direct File’s users reported saving time: Filing taxes with Direct File generally took less than an hour, and many reported filing in as little as 30 minutes. Nearly half of Direct File users reported paying for tax preparation the previous year, and the Treasury Department estimates that Direct File users saved $5.6 million in tax preparation fees this filing season. 3. Direct File helps catalyze the IRS’s digital transformation To build Direct File, the IRS assembled a team of experienced tax experts, digital product specialists, engineers and data scientists from across the federal government. The agency partnered with the U.S. Digital Service and GSA’s 18F, as well as private sector partners, who all brought critical agile technology expertise. Working side by side at IRS headquarters and collaborating with remote team members across the country, the Direct File team developed and delivered a strong technology product. The Direct File pilot also gave the IRS the chance to test customer service innovations on a large scale. Live Chat served as Direct File’s primary customer support channel because it could be integrated directly into the product. This allowed customer support to gradually expand in concert with the overall number of users in each phase of the pilot. The IRS is exploring how this approach could impact taxpayer service overall as the agency works to provide taxpayers with more choices in how they can interact with the IRS. “We’re mindful that the most important decision we made during the pilot was to focus on executional certainty,” Werfel said. “We took the time to get it right. We found the right first step to test the demand and the user experience and build a strong product. We will apply that same critical lesson for next year as we take a strategic approach to expanding Direct File’s availability and capabilities.”",

It was so clean. So simple. I could understand every single step of it, even the helpful breakdowns along the way. Bonus: No bullshit screens holding you up while it \"checks the accuracy\" or \"finishes things up\" like other tax prep software does if only to make you feel like you're getting your moneys' worth out of it when it already computed those numbers 5 hours ago. I had one (major) snag with the NY filing side which was fixed revolving around data transfer (and I suspect I was filing early enough in the program I caught it 'first' so it took a little longer to fix), so I hope that helped everyone else in NY that got to use it! I legitimately cannot wait to file my taxes again next year with this system.

I hope this improves people’s understanding of their taxes. There are so many posts on /r/personalfinance where people claim they “paid $0 on taxes this year”.

One of my big pet peeves around TurboTax is the way is intentionally pauses my multi-core, hyper-threaded, zillion gigahertz computers from doing 1960's level calculations (IF user checked off option A, then multiply by whatever)... so that it can look like it's busy.

Amazingly fast. For the state side it's a little more complex (because of Events), but essentially the flow is to wait for the IRS to accept the Direct File first (which took only 2 minutes). Which also meant - holy hell, the IRS has already signed off on my tax return, basically, which kicks off the refund flow. Once that happened, I was invited to continue the data transfer and approve an IRS Oauth-esque flow to send data onwards to FileMyStateTaxes. I assume now that I fixed the snags this time around next year the state side should also only take about 10 more minutes. reply LorenDB 3 hours agoprevAbout time. I'm tired of all the tax filing sites that lure you in with claims of \"Free!\" but then tell you 90% of the way through that \"oh, you are a special case, so you need to pony up $100 or so to continue\".

I tend to pay a little bit extra for services I don't necessarily need but whatever. Like Deluxe. It's way cheaper than what I would pay for a professional to do it, and still less than I'd pay for Turbo Tax or similar. As long as the quality of the app keeps going up and the price gouging stays out, I'll keep using it. reply crazygringo 3 hours agoparentprevAnother big gotcha I've run into is that the federal return is free... but then you have to pay $$ to file your state return. Which you only find out after you've done 100% of your federal return. Which is just infuriating, because obviously (nearly) everyone has to file both. It's like a restaurant telling you all their soda is free, but then it turns out they charge $3 for the paper cup it comes in, and you're required to use their paper cups. reply morpheuskafka 3 hours agorootparent> their soda is free, but then it turns out they charge $3 for the paper cup it comes in, and you're required to use their paper cups. You're not required to use their software to file the state return though. You can file the federal return and do the state return yourself. Many states like NC rarely have any steps beyond copying the federal AGI and multiplying by the state tax rate for common situations. reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparentYou're not required to use it for federal filing either though, so that's missing the point. You're signing up to file your taxes for free and spend a couple hours inputting all the info, and then discover you'll have to pay or else now do your state taxes separately on paper and mail them in, taking another hour. It's bait and switch. That's the problem. reply radicality 3 hours agorootparentprevWho is the one actually charging for the state-filing, where is the money going? Is it the state, or the service provider? This also reminds me of my apartment building, which has an “amenity fee” of $100/month for rooftop+gym usage, on top of the normal advertised rent. In the leasing office, I asked for details about it, and was told it’s a “non-optional” required fee which everybody has to pay. Stuff like that should be illegal - the only reason they would do that is to advertise lower rent. reply gbear605 3 hours agorootparentIt’s the service provider. You can file directly (paper forms, some states digital forms) with your state for free, but TurboTax et al charge you for it. reply NovemberWhiskey 3 hours agorootparentprevYou can always file your taxes for free - you just get the forms and fill them out.

Would also be great if they expanded to support state tax filing. reply radicality 3 hours agoparentSince it says it’s “federal taxes”, how are state taxes filed when using it?

In the upcoming years the week-kneed government is going to work with more states and gradually expand the complexity of returns. It's not useful at the moment, and looking over the press release won't be for a few more years. And then there's the state return, which is not free.

It's because they want you to look at your paystub and get mad at all the deductions.

These days with most payroll being direct deposited I don't think many people look at their pay stubs anymore anyway. At least I know I don't; maybe I would if I were paid by the hour, just to verify that all the hours were counted. I'm just saying, if anyone wanted to keep taxes \"painful\" they would not have implemented withholding in the first place.

    "originBody": "“Confidential” 988 Conversation Records Shared with Corporations Recordings of 988 callers’ voice, text, and chat conversations are being shared with researchers, AI developers, and corporations without consent. By Rob Wipond - June 8, 2024 8302 2 Editor’s Note: This story is the second in a two-part series on 988. This piece addresses issues around privacy and the sharing of the contents of conversations for AI development. The first part addresses the increase in unwanted or coercive police and EMS interventions after 988’s implementation, and can be found here: Dramatic Rise in Police Interventions on 988 Callers. People who call, text, or chat to the new national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline are regularly greeted with a generic disclaimer that conversations may occasionally be recorded for quality assurance or training purposes. What callers are not told, however, is that their ensuing “confidential” conversation with a counselor in a time of crises may become part of an ever-growing cache of millions of recordings and transcripts of intimate conversations—and be shared, without caller consent, with researchers, AI developers, and corporations for their own undisclosed purposes in a rapidly growing AI industry. Privacy experts and users themselves are increasingly concerned—and critical of the lack of transparency from 988Lifeline administrators Vibrant Emotional Health (Vibrant), and of the lack of appropriate oversight from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Indeed, call-center privacy policies range from sparse or non-existent to contradictory and downright deceptive about what’s actually occurring with 988 conversation data—and Vibrant and SAMHSA are refusing to even publicly discuss the evident problems. While aggregated data such as numbers of calls, reasons for calls, and demographic information about callers is generally uncontroversial, the recorded or transcribed content of people’s conversations is much more personal. 988 privacy policies—and the dubious lack of them As part of her work for a forthcoming Trans Lifeline report on crisis hotlines, Liz Latty researched the terms of service and privacy policies for 988Lifeline and many of its participating call centers. Her conclusion about their data sharing practices? “At every turn, they distance themselves from clear, direct, concise, concrete communication on any of this,” said Latty. “There’s a huge, willful effort to obscure anything and everything that they’re doing. It’s not an accident.” Reviewing more than fifty call center websites randomly for this article, and investigating other sources of information, it was difficult not to reach similar conclusions. The 988Lifeline involves 200 call centers, and conversation recordings and transcripts are apparently being stored in numerous places—with Vibrant and each call center, and/or with innumerable third-party software platforms that each call center may be using for managing calls, texts, or chats, including iCarol, RingCentral, Coastal, and Vibrant’s own “unified platform.” Yet many call centers had no visible privacy policies at all, while others were operated by health care companies that outlined their Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy obligations but didn’t mention 988 data. Others had policies covering only website visitors—and even those were misleading. The Markup uncovered that dozens of 988 websites covertly included tracking tools, such as buttons for 988-chat that also sent users’ personal information to Facebook. Contradictory claims were common. For example, Vibrant promoted 988Lifeline as “a leader in… mental health crisis care” offering “confidential” conversations with trained counselors. However, Vibrant’s less prominent Terms of Service—copied by many 988 call centers—emphasized in large capital letters that talking to a 988 counselor “DOES NOT CONSTITUTE” either “MENTAL HEALTH CARE” or “CONFIDENTIAL” communication. Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) counsel Chris Frascella called these latter claims a “red flag” that Vibrant wants to avoid HIPAA’s confidentiality requirements for mental health care records. “The fact that they’re saying it suggests that’s what they’re trying to do,” said Frascella. Chris Frascella SAMHSA’s 988 FAQ claimed that calls are recorded for internal “quality assurance” and “training” only, and Vibrant’s website stated, “Any information provided by you or collected on you will not be shared or disclosed with any third party.” Yet elsewhere on its website, Vibrant was openly offering access to 988 data to third parties “for research purposes” that could involve secretly listening in on conversations, reviewing masses of recorded conversations, or cross-linking datasets “that could potentially identify individuals who contacted the 988 Lifeline.” The “Crisis Services Policy” for South Carolina 988 also confirmed that “content of conversations” might be shared with “partners, researchers, or third parties.” 988 page on “Access & Requests to Collaborate on Research” In a joint response to Mad in America, SAMHSA and Vibrant provided assurances that access to personally identifiable information of 988 contacts, such as full names and device numbers, is carefully restricted. But both declined to directly answer any of a dozen other submitted questions about 988 privacy policies and Vibrant’s or any call centers’ sharing or selling of audio or text records of conversations. Some call centers are definitely profiting. Sharing conversation data—the scandal that’s worsening In 2022, Politico exposed that the nonprofit Crisis Text Line (CTL) had created Loris, a for-profit arm developing commercial customer-service software, and had shared with Loris millions of transcripts of conversations with people in crises. An FCC Commissioner urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether CTL had obtained proper informed consent from texters. CTL claimed the conversations were “anonymized.” However, while device numbers can be removed, during such crisis conversations people share many intimate—and potentially identity-revealing—details about themselves and their activities, workplaces, schools, family, and relationships. Amid public outrage, CTL turned off the tap to Loris and published more transparent policies. Today, though, CTL is a 988 backup center and still shares records of conversations with third parties. Tim Reierson was the person who originally drew media attention to CTL’s commercial data-sharing. Since then, he’s spent much of his spare time researching and advocating for better privacy practices at crisis hotlines. “It’s a calling, that I’m unable to leave or walk away from,” he said. Tim Reierson Reierson loved volunteering at CTL. He was profoundly affected by texters who were struggling through much more oppressive or abusive circumstances than he’s ever lived through. “The situations that I listened to would keep you awake,” he said. “And it did keep me awake.” At the same time, Reierson became inspired by the power of connection—how a fellow human simply “being there,” like hand holding, could help people find their own way to a better place. Over time, within him grew feelings of respect, responsibility, and even protectiveness towards these people he’d never met. Then he learned how these same people were secretly being used by CTL. Reierson said he found it “deeply offensive” and “felt sick, physically so ill” about their being exploited as fodder for commercial machine-learning products—such as in eCommerce customer services and AI feedback on “agent effectiveness” at crisis call centers. Reierson believes the much-touted notion that AI can learn “techniques” of compassionate human connection—and help or replace call-attendants—is “pseudoscience” and dangerous. “That is where a door is open to the loss of humanity,” said Reierson. “Analyzing a transcript, they are just words or letters put together in a certain order… The ‘being there’ is important. The warmth coming through.” Even more, he criticizes crisis lines’ “betrayal” and exploitation of users. Reierson described circumstances that can make people, including children, desperately reach out for the one-to-one privacy that crisis hotlines promise—such as threats of domestic abuse, feelings of shame, or fears of public exposure. And then 988Lifeline secretly records these difficult, intensely personal, private confessions and shares them with others for their own purposes. “I have no tolerance for deception,” said Reierson. Since the CTL scandal, though, these practices have actually—if somewhat surreptitiously—expanded and become embedded within 988Lifeline. Intimate conversations make the richest AI The for-profit company Protocall runs the New Mexico Crisis and Access Line 988 service (NMCAL) and, in partnership with Lyssn, a for-profit developing AI tools for behavioral health, received $2.1 million from the National Institute of Mental Health in 2023. Protocall and Lyssn are using recordings of 988 calls to create software that will purportedly “evaluate the quality of crisis counseling” and teach call-attendants how to “sharpen their skills.” When I pointed out to Protocall Privacy Officer Laura Schaefer that NMCAL’s privacy policy didn’t disclose how the company handles 988 conversation data, Schaefer said, “We’ve got to do better at that.” Schaefer said that Protocall’s controls on personally identifiable information abide by HIPAA. However, the company doesn’t believe HIPAA applies to recorded conversations. Nevertheless, Schaefer later emailed that Protocall would add a “disclaimer” about using recorded conversations “for research” and would allow individual callers to request that recording be stopped. The 988 call center Georgia Crisis and Access Line (GCAL) appeared to be operated by the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (GDBHDD). GCAL’s website provided no terms of service or privacy policy. It also wasn’t disclosed that, in fact, Georgia’s 988 system is operated by the for-profit company Behavioral Health Link (BHL)—which I discovered only thanks to a tip from Reierson. GCAL, GCAL’s Steering Committee, GDBHDD’s public affairs office, BHL, and BHL’s privacy officer all did not respond to many messages over months asking about GCAL’s privacy practices. However, BHL’s own privacy policy said the company is “not a Covered Entity under HIPPA” (sic), and shares data it gathers with “Business Associates”—including Carelon Behavioral Health, subsidiary of the even larger corporate giant Elevance Health. Carelon also directly operates New Hampshire 988 and has research divisions using crisis conversations in AI tools to help deliver telehealth. BHL described using caller data for developing voice analysis technology to assess the “emotional state” of callers, to “predict potential relapses,” and to link call center data with people’s electronic health records. Elevance media liaison Tina Gaines confirmed via email that Carelon has access to GCAL “data systems” with which the company is doing unspecified “work.” She did not answer questions about Carelon’s uses of New Hampshire conversation recordings. BHL’s research and development lead is John Draper, Vibrant’s former 988 director—and so perhaps a barometer for this burgeoning industry. While acknowledging in a recent talk that rampant nonconsensual privacy invasions fueling AI development could “break down public trust,” Draper nevertheless called himself a “huge fan” of Lyssn’s work and expressed enthusiasm about the role that AI can play in the future of crisis care. In a Report to Congress, SAMHSA said “new technologies” would soon be monitoring calls in “real time” and helping call-attendants flag which callers might be at “imminent risk” of taking their own lives and therefore require police/EMS interventions. Ironically, people who’ve been subjected to such unwanted interventions and have asked for recordings of their calls to mount complaints against 988Lifeline have been told by Vibrant that all recordings are “confidential” and they must obtain court orders to get copies of their own calls. (See part one: Dramatic Rise in Police Interventions on 988 Callers.) For one of those callers, Elle, learning subsequently about 988Lifeline’s data-sharing practices has been one more way that calling 988 has left her feeling used and abused. “I think it’s vastly inappropriate for them to monetize people’s pain and suffering,” said Elle. “And it feels extremely dystopian, and violative and disgusting.” Simple Solutions Is Reierson worried about what he sees in 988Lifeline’s privacy policies? “It’s what I don’t see,” Reierson answered. “We have a basically unregulated environment. There isn’t any restriction on the secondary uses of those conversations. And I feel that SAMHSA and Vibrant Emotional Health, they both are negligent on this issue.” Jason Kelly of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was also critical. “If I’m a caller of a helpline, I don’t expect that data from the call to be used to create an AI product. These [uses] are just totally off bounds, or should be, and should be very clear in any policy that an organization would have.” Kelly raised questions about the risks of calling 988 for people seeking abortions or supporting a child’s gender transitions, especially if calls or recordings get transferred to states where those practices are now illegal. “It really makes me nervous,” said Kelly. “That data privacy issue really matters.” Asked about such cross-state scenarios, Vibrant and SAMHSA declined to respond. There would seem to be a solution: A brief, straightforward, highly visible privacy policy covering all 988 call centers that actually does what 988Lifeline advertises it does—protect the absolute confidentiality of all callers. Routinely delete recorded conversations within a very limited time. And implement a process for gathering clear, informed consent from both callers and call-attendants for their conversations to be shared for any research projects. EPIC’s Frascella believes that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could have cause to weigh in. “If you don’t say something in a privacy policy that you should say, then that is an unfair, deceptive act or practice,” he said. “It’s possible that the FTC might have authority to go after some of these [988] service providers.” Reierson is especially disturbed by how Vibrant and SAMHSA are characterizing 988Lifeline as not a mental health service—thereby removing public legal protections that exist with health services even as 988Lifeline operates like a health service by providing counseling, keeping records on callers, and instigating police wellness checks and mobile crisis team visits with or without consent. “That makes 988 dangerous,” he said. “If we continue on as we are, these problems of accountability are just going to entrench further.” Previous articleDid Something Happen?!

A great deal of legal strategic maneuvering these days is about challenging who gets to make such definitions or demanding courts admit obscure/specious ones, in order to then insist on rigid, mechanistic (and often draconian) interpretations of law incorporating the 'preferred' meaning. The Constitutional requirement for a common-law legal system only works to the degree that there is common agreement on basic premises. Once linguistic definitions come to be viewed as strategic legal territory to be captured, the system is bound to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. reply ryandrake 17 hours agorootparentTitle II of HIPAA should just be extended to apply to all data about all people, so it doesn't matter whether it's ackshually health data or not. Then, all the lawyers arguing about who's a \"covered entity\" and who isn't, what's \"protected health information\" and what isn't, can go get bent. The data protection rules provided by HIPAA are actually pretty good, especially for a privacy-hostile country like the USA. I'd love see something like HIPAA act as the model for a generic (non-healthcare) data privacy protection law, if Congress could get their shit together and propose it. reply eru 15 hours agorootparentprevArguing about definitions isn't new. Have a look at the history of the definition of 'contract' in common law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract#Common_law_contracts is a good starting point, I guess). It's full of such nitpicking around definitions. reply anigbrowl 13 hours agorootparentNo disagreement here. I'm not fond of contract law because of teh sort of adversarial legalism it imho promotes. But that's a much bigger discussion than comfortably fits here. reply eru 12 hours agorootparentWell, a contract it something you draft up in good times, when you understand each other, to provide an enforcement mechanism in bad times (if/when you have disagreements). The ideal contract has enforcement mechanisms that are really easy to predict, so that both parties can just settle around that predicted outcome, instead of actually having to go to court. The actual mechanisms aren't that important, as long as they are predictable. If eg bankruptcy law in your jurisdiction predictably benefits creditor (or debtor) more, then the original agreement (when people still agree with each other) can adjust for that. reply zer00eyz 17 hours agorootparentprev> I'm super-tired by how much of the US legal system consists of bullshit arguments about definitions.

The term \"illegal alien\" isnt hate speech, nor is \"resident alien\". There are acts named with this term. The public has it rather twisted. If you mutate the language of the law then it breaks down: \"... I went to the Supreme Court three times trying to get a writ of mandamus, and they kept sending it back, the clerk, they kept saying what the language said append the copy of order in respect of which the writ is sought. And I keep sending this copy of the lower court, they keep sending me back in respect of which the writ is sought. Then I dug, in respect of which, They use the word “of” like I use the word “to”. And ‘respect of’ means this kind of respect. In respect “of it”.

    "originBody": "BUSINESS Gainax, known for 'Evangelion' anime production, goes bankrupt A Neon Genesis Evangelion statue on display at small worlds miniature museum in Odaiba.GETTY IMAGES JIJI SHARE Jun 8, 2024 Gainax, known for producing the popular anime series \"Neon Genesis Evangelion,\" said Friday that it filed for bankruptcy at Tokyo District Court on May 29. Founded in 1984, the Tokyo-based company produced hit anime titles, including the Evangelion series by film director Hideaki Anno and \"Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water.\" Its business conditions began to deteriorate around 2012, due to careless management by executives, and the company lost its anime production capabilities following an exodus of its creative staff. In addition, its representative director was arrested in 2019 for alleged sexual abuse of a minor. Gainax tried to rebuild itself with the support of Khara, which currently owns the rights to the Evangelion series and of which Anno serves as president. However, Gainax was sued over unpaid debts in May and concluded that it was difficult to continue its business. Gainax released a statement on its website, saying that it feels very sorry for fans, while expressing its heartfelt gratitude for their support over the past 40 years. The total amount of liabilities left by the company is unknown, according to credit research firm Teikoku Databank.

Also, financial troubles is probably the most Gainax thing possible reply creamyhorror 2 hours agoparentAlongside their general mismanagement under their President Yamaga[1] e.g. giving their management unsecured loans of company funds[2], they've been doing random crap like tomato farming.[3] They wouldn't have lasted so long without Hideaki Anno's (Eva) support for old times' sake.[1] They've been a deadbeat since 2012; it's just been a long downhill road to the inevitable end.

The fact that they can't name a newer hit anime for them is the problem. I don't know about the economics but from a creative standpoint the anime industry seems quite healthy having recently produced a lot of great shows like Sousou no Frieren, Oshi no Ko, and Konosuba Season 3 in the last year or so. reply dragontamer 2 hours agorootparentRanking of Kings is the underrated gem people need to go and watch. And is my pick for best anime of the last 5ish years. Its a bit of a shonen, but hitting shonen tropes isn't necessarily a bad thing. And Ranking of Kings does it in a relatively fresh way, and absolutely nails the \"Brothers Grimm\" style to fairy-tale magic and lore. (Yes, kid-friendly on the surface, but then deep blood-magic involving the grinding of bones and drinking of blood to infuse deep magicks into the story and lore). Bonus points that the battle scenes are done by the venerated Studio Wit. ------- With regards to Gainax: their last big hit was Gurren Lagaan in 2007 IMO. But even Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 was Studio Khara, not Gainax. You're not wrong, but Gurren Lagaan is a great work, even if all those particular animators left Gainax shortly afterwards and started Studio Trigger. Most people consider Gurren Lagaan to be Studio Trigger for some reason but remember that group was still technically employed by Gainax when Gurren Lagaan came out. reply PaulHoule 1 hour agorootparentOn one level I liked Gurren Lagann but on another level it seemed frequently stupid to me and not covering any ground that wasn’t covered in other anime (I think Martian Successor Nadesico) ten years before. But it was a real success for Gainax but the authors of article don’t mention it. reply jmcgough 1 hour agorootparentYeah, that was Imaishi though who left to found Trigger - since then has directed Kill la Kill, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, some other great but lesser known stuff like Promare reply dimmke 2 hours agorootparentprevYes but Evangelion is so massive and popular it'd be enough to sustain a studio. Gainax does not have the rights to NGE though. They only produced the original series back in the 90s. Hideaki Anno literally setup a brand new studio specifically to do the rebuild films: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khara_(studio) reply PaulHoule 1 hour agorootparentDoesn’t have the staying power of Gundam which has survived postmodernism by producing spin-off shows about people who build Gundam models. (Gee I gotta build that Haro I have sitting around…) reply fendy3002 1 hour agorootparentGundam is usually a recycled stories (teenager ride an ace robot to war) with new toys. How can Evangelion recycle their stories? Nobody want to see depressed, horny teenager forced to ride a robot so everyone can be turned into orange paste every two years. reply PaulHoule 44 minutes agorootparentExactly, Evangelion is about the end of the world which can only end once. That may make it poignant but it doesn't have the staying power of Gundam or Macross or Pretty Cure where they can keep telling variations of the same story in different places and times indefinitely. (Funny to think how they weren't sure if they'd finish the first season of Futari Wa Pretty Cure so their budget for writing and direction was zero for a few episodes in the middle that were mostly incomprehensible scenes of people being corrupted, turned into monsters, and walking around doing things Kung Fu masters would do out of Dragonball Z until suddenly the show started making sense again... And of course they went on to make another 20+ seasons) reply jeffwask 48 minutes agorootparentprevIt's always felt like a stretch them trying to turn this story into a franchise. It's like a Death Note franchise it just doesn't make sense. reply Shank 11 minutes agorootparentprevEva is pretty sustainable, just not for Gainax. Studio Khara has been selling Eva merchandise and related materials through brands like Radio EVA for a while. Gainax just kind of doesn’t have any of the IP anymore, for various reasons. reply shagie 1 hour agorootparentprevAdam Savage did a build on Tested back in the lockdown period...

Anime studios rarely make money off their work. The only exceptions that I can think of are KyoAni and A1 since they have IP ownership, or have financial backing from a bigger company like Sony, respectively. reply astrobe_ 1 hour agoparentprevWhen I look at the credits of popular animes, very often I see what looks like Korean names, as if most of the animation has been outsourced. Could it be related? reply jmcgough 1 hour agorootparentAmerican animated shows have been outsourcing to Korea since at least the 90s reply jbm 1 hour agorootparentDefinitely before that; The Transformers had a lot of their work done in their 3rd season by Korean Studios and that was 86. reply michaelt 2 hours agoparentprevYeah the fact the reporter decided Gainax's headline achievement was an anime from 1995 kinda says it all. reply jcranmer 1 hour agorootparentNot necessarily. Studio Ghibli's headline achievement would likely be considered to be Spirited Away (although I prefer Princess Mononoke), which is nearly as old, but they've still put out some solid work since then. As dragontamer pointed out, Gainax has also produced Gurren Lagann in 2007, which is definitely a pretty big hit, even if it wasn't the phenomenal success of Evangelion. reply radicalbyte 1 hour agorootparentGurren Lagann is rated #1 series of all time by many anime fan, myself included. It's a masterpiece, although the cultural impact isn't of the same level as Evangelion. reply throw4847285 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's all been downhill since Daicon IV!!! reply bee_rider 53 minutes agorootparentprevThat’s Ghibli though. The company that somehow can do Disney style mass appeal and contemplative art films, often at the same time. Gainax makes fantastic, often quite out there, shows that play with anime tropes. Their addressable market is people who are already at least somewhat anime fans. reply karmasimida 1 hour agorootparentprevI mean that anime is Evagelion, it is like using Star Wars to showcase Lucasfilm, there is most accurate representation of the studio's accomplishment, as well as assets (used to be). reply ordinaryradical 3 hours agoprevThe real talent left to form Studio Khara, I think it part because of this kind of mismanagement. Gainax has a long history of financial follies despite having created one of the most successful anime in history. reply isk517 3 hours agoparentAlso Studio Trigger. reply Cyph0n 3 hours agorootparentMostly Trigger. They are currently working on Delicious in Dungeon, which starts off slow but evolves into an amazing story. reply dragontamer 2 hours agorootparentDelicious in Dungeon, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, Little Witch Academia, and Kill la Kill. Trigger is knocking it out of the park. Clearly a top-tier animation studio of the last decade. reply dimmke 2 hours agorootparentCyberpunk: Edgerunners is such a killer anime, it's honestly one of my top all time favorites even though you can tell it had a small budget. Even their less popular stuff I dig. I just watched Darling in the Franxx and I'm about to start Kiznaiver. reply dragontamer 1 hour agorootparentI dunno if you can call Darling in the Franxx \"less popular\". At least in my circles it seems like a hugely popular work. A lot of people like it but I do consider it a bit of a waifu-trash anime, lol. So I didn't think it was as critically good writing as the other stuff I listed. Kinznaiver is on the less popular side. As is BNA (Brand New Animal). The Tokusatsu community seems to like the SSSS.(Gridman/Dynazenon) anime, but arguably taking the Gridman name makes them more into Tokusatsu than the anime community anyway. reply jandrese 1 hour agorootparentIt's really hard to take an anime seriously when the girls outfits have butt handles. Darling in the Franxx got a lot of attention, but a lot of that was the meme crowd have a field day with it. reply GaggiX 1 hour agorootparentNot really everyone watches anime \"seriously\", you can watch them in a more light-hearted way. I'm a big fun of Kill la Kill really because of how silly and over the top it is, same for the second season of JoJo. reply Akronymus 45 minutes agorootparentprevCan't forget about stuff like the gridman series of series, BNA and even a movie, promare. reply lukan 33 minutes agorootparentprevI watched the beginning of Delicious in Dungeon. Interesting weird and funny concept, but seemed too shallow and I do not like the overly dramatic anoying way of talking, or rather screaming all the time by the female character (I know it is characteristic to some Anime). But if there is an actual story to be found, I might have to give it another shot.. reply 12345hn6789 23 minutes agorootparentThere is a story and decentish world building. It's just slow. Most of it happens from off handed comments the characters make. It's there! I can understand not wanting to watch 3 hours of anime to get background information though. reply quink 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd, thanks in no small part to the final collapse of GAINAX, they've announced a second season of Panty and Stocking after getting the rights. reply GauntletWizard 3 hours agorootparentprev\"Gainax Bounce\" and \"Gainaxing\" just had a flow to them, though. The world just won't be the same if we have to rename them... \"Trigger Bounce\" and \"Triggering\" draw up very different images. reply Akronymus 43 minutes agorootparentSadly, tvtropes removed the link to the video [1] from the page on gainaxing[2] [1] https://vimeo.com/512552697 [2] https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing reply archgoon 2 hours agorootparentprev> Trigger Bounce Mostly makes me think of some EE effect you'd see with a o-scope. \"Yeah, that's not real, it's just Trigger Bounce\" reply dmoy 2 hours agorootparentI have an EE degree. Trigger bounce is a real thing. But it's not an EE thing, it has to do with a firearm malfunctioning in a way such that a normally semi-automatic firearm fires more than once per trigger press, due to some internals on the trigger that I'm forgetting about / don't know about. Now that I put my EE hat on though, there is a significant parallel to \"switch bounce\", which is an EE thing. reply ihuman 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd Gaina reply quink 2 hours agorootparentAoki Uru will never get made and even if Top o Nerae 3 gets made, one can consider TRIGGER's entire early catalogue and Gurren Lagann spiritual sequels of sorts already. And that's it for any of GAINA's projects that have been announced 5 years ago now that might have given a hint of them carrying GAINAX's torch. reply zdw 3 hours agoprevThe entire anime industry is built on labor that is not compensated well, from many sources: This whole substack, but in particular: https://news.animenomics.com/p/nafca-anime-worker-survey-lon... NHK video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5AR2X6R4TM From what I can tell, the production does a lot of Hollywood-style accounting where the production companies take most of the profits and most of the actual work is contracted out. reply Levitz 2 hours agoparentI think this happens when people have a dream of doing a specific job. As you mentioned, Hollywood does the same thing, as does the videogame industry in general. One could also look at a certain company which name starts with \"T\" and ends with \"esla\". In a way, the work itself turns into part of the compensation so people are willing to have a worse everything else as long as they do the thing. reply segasaturn 1 hour agoparentprevWhen you look at the end credits for a lot of anime series, you'll see many Thai, Vietnamese and Cambodian names credited for animation. Most animation that doesn't come from a \"prestige\" studio like Kyoto, Ghibli etc. is outsourced to Southeast Asia. reply jacoblambda 2 hours agoparentprevAn good video on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDEIPa9b3OU However in this case with Gainax, the failure isn't due to anime production committee style accounting or anything like that. It's entirely because gainax hemorrhaged all their talent to offshoot studios and then gainax has done effectively nothing other than contract work out and milk IP in the ~15-20 years since then. reply slillibri 2 hours agoparentprevNot the entire industry. Kyoto Animation, for example, pays its animators a salary rather than the piece rate many houses do. Sadly, they are the exception not the rule. reply kvemkon 2 hours agoparentprevPrevious discussion on HN: Anime is a $25B industry that pays its animators pennies https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39074062 reply JumpCrisscross 2 hours agorootparentWhat is the distribution bottleneck that keeps artists from self organising? reply rincebrain 1 hour agorootparentSort of the same problem as game testers. If there are so many people willing to work for pennies _for the sake of working there_ that even a significant fraction of you organizing a stop-work won't make a dent other than a one-off blip if you arrange so much disruption it hiccups production visibly, there's only so much leverage to exert, since you have nothing they can't just source elsewhere. reply rightbyte 1 hour agorootparentprevBurning passion? reply bongodongobob 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat prevents any group of workers from self organizing? reply segasaturn 3 hours agoprevThe Gainax of the 1990s was not the Gainax of the last decade. Gainax died in the Great Recession and became a hollowed out shell of a studio that only existed to collect royalties on their past work. So this is not a major loss. reply LarsDu88 19 minutes agoprevI remember watching the final episode of Evangelion several years ago. A few minutes into it, it's as if they simply ran out of animation budget and it went full slide show.

I'm not an expert in anime but the article basically says it started to die in 2012-2014 or however long it took for the artists to leave, right? reply kipukun 2 hours agoparentGainax's financial troubles are well documented in an interview with Hideaki Anno, where he detailed how the company was pretty dysfunctional from the start. The company's president was arrested for tax fraud in 1999, for example. This has been a long time coming. reply p_l 2 hours agorootparentAsk not why GAINAX bankrupted, ask how the hell it survived so long. Memes about GAINAX running out of money to finish series go all the way back to Gunbuster, which was their fourth production, and second under the name GAINAX. The second production, Daikon IV, survives thanks to piracy because they didn't license them music used :V reply jandrese 1 hour agorootparentGunbuster ran out of money to pay colorists by the end of the series, which was only 4 episodes. Evangelion also clearly ran out of budget by the end of the series, and that was after some blatant cost saving scenes repeatedly appearing in the show, like very very long elevator rides where nobody moves and the only action is a floor counter ticking down, or watching the counter on a Walkman slowly tick by. Almost taunting the audience with the counters on the obvious padding scenes. reply p_l 42 minutes agorootparentThe funny thing is, the studio claims last episode of Gunbuster was done black&white on purpose - in fact, that black&white was more expensive the way they did it than otherwise. Unfortunately I suspect that outside of the people directly involved we won't ever hear properly. The rumours flew around since early 1990s, and there is the part that Gunbuster was originally supposed to be a TV series (AFAIK), and as result the plot was extremely compressed into those 6 episodes that we got ultimately. And it's not like the studio was not known otherwise for wild swings even when they didn't run out of money... (anyone remembers how Mahoromatic ended?) reply karmasimida 1 hour agoprevAs for Evagelion series, most of the creatives and copyright itself have moved into khara. GAINAX had been in the vegetative state for many years now. reply Something1234 3 hours agoprevSeems like the franchise is safe just a bunch of executives at some subsidiary squandered everything. reply atomicnumber3 3 hours agoparentThat's my takeaway too. \"Gainax tried to rebuild itself with the support of Khara, which currently owns the rights to the Evangelion series and of which Anno serves as president.\" So all the actual franchise stuff was with Anno in Khara, and Gainax was the creative staffing for the anime/movies? reply noirscape 3 hours agorootparentGainax was bought in 2019 by Studio Khara, Studio Trigger, Kadokawa Group and Studio Gaina (a former subsidiary) after the previous CEO got arrested for inappropriate behaviour around teenage VAs. Khara and Trigger are the successor studios to Gainax as in that those are the studios made by their biggest creatives, and it's to my understanding that all relevant IPs from the creatives behind Khara and Trigger during their time at Gainax were transferred to them after the buyout. The only Gainax IP that's not owned by the creative behind it is FLCL, since Gainax sold the rights for it to Production I.G. in the late 2000s. Another, more indirect, successor studio to Gainax is Studio Cloverworks at A1 Productions, although that one was mostly general staff. That said, it's not like Gainax did much in the ~5 years between the formation of Studio Trigger and the buyout; they released exactly one anime and one OVA. There was pretty much nobody creative left at the company to make anything, specifically because the CEO got cold feet on approving creative projects. reply dragontamer 2 hours agorootparentSounds like the bankruptcy system is working correctly then. All the valuable assets are going to the people who matter: Cloverworks, Trigger and Khara. Its a bit sad for Gainax as an entity to be collapsing, but the individuals who bring us these stories (through producing, acting, animating, or other skills) still exist out there. I'll definitely say that Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 from Studio Khara lost a lot of the mech-design that made Gainax great... but its clear that all the \"mech designers\" are alive and active over at Studio Trigger. Its sad to see the team split up, because nothing like Evangelion (90s) will ever come out again. But on the other hand, these other studios are clearly active and seemingly successful. So the show goes on... reply noirscape 21 minutes agorootparentYeah, it's sad in that they're a pretty massive name that's going away (and one of the few studios mostly known for doing original work rather than adaptations), but it's been a long time coming and the actual losses are minimal (it's really only FLCL but that happened years ago). One small correction though: no IPs will be transferred to Cloverworks as far as I know. Cloverworks didn't really get any specific creatives from Gainax, moreso just that a lot of the intermediate staff that you usually don't hear about ended up at Cloverworks. (Which to my understanding was largely a coincidence: A1 had formed Cloverworks, put out hiring ads and in the next month, Gainax basically declared they weren't ever going to make any experimental anime again, causing a mass exodus from the company.) reply chc4 3 hours agoparentprevSquandered, along with things like \"commit massive tax fraud that caused several executives to go to jail and be forced to pay millions of dollars of fees\" reply xg15 2 hours agoprevI guess Gainax finally got its own Gainax Ending. reply schaefer 35 minutes agoprevEnd of Evangelion, indeed. reply harimau777 2 hours agoprevI'm not an expert in this area, but a friend who is into anime said that the company that the rights to these series are being sold to is owned/operated by the same guy that made many of them. So he felt that in this case we were lucky that this is almost \"Gainax went bankrupt and sold their properties to Gainax\". Again, I'm not an expert so I can't verify, but this seems like one case where maybe things are ending up alright. reply fareesh 2 hours agoprevone might say they achieved instrumentality reply slillibri 2 hours agoprevAs a side note, the small worlds museum (from the article image) is pretty cool. I spent a couple of hours there on a rainy day in Tokyo. I assume they are going to keep the Tokyo-3 part of the exhibit after this. reply GrumpyYoungMan 3 hours agoprevOuch, now that really stings to wake up to. Eva aside, Nadia, Gunbuster, FLCL all stand out among the great anime of the '90s00s. Even lesser known series, like KareKano, which Anno had a hand in, really have a vivaciousness to them to them that just isn't that common. RIP Gainax. reply pachouli-please 3 hours agoparentIt stings a little, but most of the Good People have gotten around to other studios anyways. As I understand it gainax was really just an IP holding company for the most part in recent time reply jacoblambda 2 hours agoparentprevHonestly I'm super excited for this. An important detail of note is that Studio Khara will be responsible for selling off and distributing IP to interested parties. Realistically most of these properties will go to Khara themself, Trigger, and studios like SHAFT that worked closely with gainax in the early days. So if anything this is how many of those beloved projects will get out from under Gainax's death grip and get something new other than a pachinko machine. reply noirscape 17 minutes agorootparentThey announced that, but all major IPs they had were already transferred to Khara and Trigger a couple years ago (that's why the TTGL movies reappeared in cinema a couple years ago). It's likely just some of the older/less popular stuff that's not easy to assign owners to that will need to be redistributed. reply MisterBastahrd 1 hour agorootparentprevWell, their biggest success is pretty much done to death now. NGE has had a series, multiple OVAs, multiple movies, multiple revamp movies... there's really not much else to get out of it unless you want to tell the story of how they got into that mess to begin with, which might be the most interesting part of all of this to its core fanbase given their age.

    "originLink": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html",
    "originBody": "At a time when employee retention should be of a top concern, some companies are using questionable ways of enforcing return-to-office mandates. Credit: Thinkstock The battle royale for the future of workplace culture continues as companies and employees square off over the right to work at home and the return to office (RTO) movement. A sizable list of companies elected to order employees back to the office earlier this year. Many directed workers to return to three, four, or five days a week. How’s that turned out so far? Not so well. Companies that think they’ve won the battle by issuing strict return-to-office (RTO) mandates could lose the larger war. RTO mandates are causing senior-level employees, women, and millennials among others to push the eject button and find other jobs with companies that have more liberal remote-work polices. If, by some miracle, the Federal Trade Commission’s move to strike down most existing and future non-compete agreements takes effect this year, an increasing number of employees looking for new work could wind up at competitors. Finding AI talent, which more and more companies are going to need, is already a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Adding strict RTO policies to that scenario won’t make the talent search easier. And while RTO policy pronouncements have slowed in recent months, there have been numerous reports of affected employees searching for new jobs, refusing to comply, and even taking legal action. Gartner research released in early May found that 36% of senior-level job seekers who have received an RTO mandate from their current employer are leaving their jobs as a result. Plus, 64% of the HR leaders surveyed by Gartner fear onsite requirements will increase attrition. A study made public last month by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago showed substantially increased attrition of more senior personnel at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX (all of which had invoked RTO requirements). At SpaceX, which required workers back in the office five days a week, the study showed that senior employees as a share of the company’s overall workforce declined 15%. A new study by ResumeBuilder.com found that eight out of 10 companies have lost talent because of their RTO mandates. And yet, the same study found that 70% of companies plan to increase or maintain the number of days employees are required to be in the office in 2025. Who will blink first? Keeping track of employees It hasn’t helped that some companies, including Amazon, Dell, Google, JPMorgan, Meta and TikTok, have reportedly begun tracking employees’ badge swipes. Dell is also using VPN (virtual private network) monitoring, and has created a badge color-coding system to categorize employee onsite presence. According to Business Insider, Dell also told workers who work remotely full time that they won’t be eligible for promotions. It’s difficult to comprehend why some top execs at companies with RTO mandates seem more focused on making their employees suffer with commutes, added costs, lost productivity, and in some cases invasive tracking than they are with making a profit. At some organizations, there’s almost a vindictive quality to the RTO policies and the tone of communications. What possesses CEOs and other leaders to create such a toxic environment at their companies? What is this obsession with making employees work in the office when research has shown that employees are more productive when working where they choose? The cost of doing business in the office One motivation behind employees’ desire for the freedom to work at home involves the financial costs of going into the office. RTO means some sort of commute for employees, which means time and money, especially if you’re a two-income family and two adults have to commute by car. Gas, maintenance, insurance, parking, public transportation, and toll roads are just some of the possible added commute expenses. Working at home could lead to potentially less expensive, less stressful, and more flexible childcare options. (Many parents with older children are able to drop before- and after-school daycare programs when they work remotely, for example.) With the likelihood of buying more lunches in the office, and less time to cook dinner after a long commute home, food costs go up, too. All of these considerations add up to a significant drag on work-life balance. The desire to improve that balance is the single most important reason why remote work is so highly prized by employees. The COVID-19 pandemic gave many workers a good long taste of it — and they don’t want to let it go. It makes employees more productive on the job and gives them more control over their personal lives. This is playing out now in companies around the globe. And with neither side willing to give in, the fight will continue to bubble up this year and perhaps even next, leaving employees frustrated and on the hunt for new jobs — and companies in danger of undermining their best assets: their workers.

    "commentBody": "Senior employees, ordered back to the office, are jumping ship (computerworld.com)152 points by rustoo 7 hours agohidepastfavorite247 comments Aromasin 6 hours agoMy company recently spun out of a much larger corporation and has just implemented a 4-day week policy after nearly 5 years of flexible work (ie. come in when you need to be in to do your job). Since then, my team has halved and the senior leadership at the site have almost all left to competitors except for a couple of people closing on retirement anyway. We're struggling to get the bare minimum done and have to ZBB almost everything that isn't core work. It's miserable. It's just the most baffling time to force such a radical shift, and the executive team were pretty much entirely against it; except for the new CEO who was a transfer from the bigger corp. During the midst of a spin-off where everything needs migrating from systems the wider organisation used - HR and legal, our internal Wikis, product tracking systems, Salesforce, customer comms, forums, documentation, the whole bloody lot - this new CEO decides to make their mark by hamstringing the company in the middle of one of the most important projects of the companies history potentially. They've had to cut a couple of things off the product roadmaps that have been worked on for years simply because we now don't have the staff to drive them to completion. Just madness. reply p_l 6 hours agoparentIt's part of \"hostile environment\" tactic to force reduction in headcount without appearing to be firing anyone. That it results in more experienced people leaving is just a bonus to the all-governing excel chart that gives orders to the CEO. reply llm_trw 5 hours agorootparentStop assuming that these people are competent. I've been in the c-suite meetings where these things are decided and it boils down to \"In my day the office was good enough for me, so it will be good enough for everyone else too\". reply diggan 5 hours agorootparentEqually, stop assuming that their intent is good. Unless we have internal details, we can argue either way, but assuming anything at all seems wrong. Just as likely as they're just stupid, it feels as likely they're doing it to reduce costs/headcount. reply otherme123 5 hours agorootparentBeing disconnected from reality, or not being able to adapt is not the same as being stupid. One of my bosses while being absurdly smart for work related things, has no clue about how to deal with millenials and younger. He still lives in the world of loyalty to the corporation, and it works with X-gen and above. The younger laugh and leave reply _heimdall 5 hours agorootparentThat's really nothing new. Most people get to a point where they don't quite understand the generations behind them. You grow up in a different time with different norms. It may be easy enough to understand at a more surface level what younger generations seem to care about, how they talk, etc but it's much harder to deeply understand what it's like to be that younger generation and how, therefore, to fundamentally adjust the way you work and interact or even view the world yourself. reply nilkn 4 hours agorootparentAnother angle that makes this even more complicated is that younger people can and do get things wrong too. A fresh perspective is not automatically a correct perspective. A leader would be rightfully wary about letting someone experiencing their first transition into the workforce make major decisions about workplace design, etc. Of course, this leads to the opposite problem of never trusting the younger generations, which is equally if not more problematic. Because a fresh perspective may not always be correct, but often it does have some kind of value that needs to be extracted and acted on. reply otherme123 3 hours agorootparentOf course a fresh perspective is not always correct. In fact, they usually get things wrong for lack of experience. And they tend to dismiss good old tech (like SQL) and adore the latest hype. But we seniors should be open to their opinions, and we should be open to mix with them and \"exploit\" their strength. E.g. our social media (Twitter, Insta and Facebook mainly) are handled by a ~50 y.o. woman who volunteered. People younger than 35'ish laugh about how lengthy the posts and the videos are, and the general tone of \"Buscemy: how do you do, fellow kids?\", lack of social networks that are actually used, and so on. But nobody asked them for advise, because nobody wants to be told how old and out of the loop they are. On a more serious note, they can't take seriously they have to be available on weekends or holidays, so they prefer to change jobs rather than confronting or negotiate with their manager. It looks that our future is one of overworked seniors training short term juniors for our competition: extintion in 10-15 years. Recently one of our juniors asked for a day per week working from home, and was denied because \"team building\" or something like that. Since them, I have the impression he's on a quest on how many days per week he can go without talking to anyone (avoiding team building), and I'm 100% sure he's now hunting for a fully remote job. reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentprevI've also seen it go the other way, with leads trusting more junior engineers way more than they probably should have. I wasn't too surprised when most (all?) of the concerns that senior engineers raised and were overruled on came back to bite them 6 months later. In that instance it seemed like leadership was focusing too hard on making sure the more junior members had their voices heard and, I think, expected that the team would be able to just figure out how to handle the concerns raised later. Pros and cons to everything, but at least in that one instance it was really odd to see senior engineers' proposals and reasoning be thrown out with a focus almost entirely on protecting team dynamics or something similar. reply neilv 3 hours agorootparentprevAlso, diversity more broadly, not just generation. Scenario: Say you're a Zoomer, affluent parents, everything material you could want, security and opportunity, all the college prep and application angles covered, Stanford, Leetcode, FAANG, substantial war chest, now founder, family seed money and connections and safety net... designing a consumer tech product targeted foremost at \"other\" Zoomers in general... In that scenario, you're going to have huge cultural blind spots, among your generation. You might be best off throwing away the well-to-do fratbro culture-fit hiring funnel, and hopefully get a diversity of perspectives. reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentDiversity of thought should have always been the goal. That's really hard to do though, especially when you can instead focus on easily noticed external traits and claim that's diversity. Throwing away the well-to-do fratbro hiring funnel would actually be a mistake though, wouldn't it? We should be adding more, different hiring funnels to try to better capture diversity of thought and background. Throwing out one funnel entirely and replacing it with another would still have a blindspot, it's just the opposite blindspot that they had before. reply HumblyTossed 1 hour agorootparentprev> He still lives in the world of loyalty to the corporation, and it works with X-gen and above. That only barely worked when corporations were a little bit loyal to employees. There's not one of those left now. reply vundercind 5 hours agorootparentprevChatting with some major-firm management consultants was enough to remove any lingering “… but surely they’re smarter than I’m giving them credit for” doubts I had about the C-suite. Their view was way less favorable and more comprehensive than mine, and they’ve seen more of them and from bigger companies than I have. They talked about them like they’re toddlers. reply p_l 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is how some of it spreads.

We're talking about a company that just spun out on its own and has an enormous amount of work ahead of it and presumably a window of time where the investors expect things to be bumpy financially—why would a CEO intentionally try to reduce headcount in that situation? A year in when things have settled down, sure, but right after the split? reply p_l 5 hours agorootparentOr they might have whatever indicators, real or imagined, saying that they should be shedding costs as much as possible. I've even seen once spinning off a new company as a way to avoid the word \"layoff\" or \"firing\" for cultural reasons. Every few years the company would spin out a new one, moving all the parts they wanted to keep, then liquidate the old. reply jack_riminton 6 hours agoparentprevEven more bizarre considering that there have been numerous studies showing that remote working is more productive and less costly reply zeroCalories 6 hours agorootparentCan you link these studies? I often feel like people greatly misrepresent what these studies find. Anecdotally, we've been happy to cut remote senior engineers and bring in local people, sometimes at a significantly higher total comp, just because they play such an important role in coordination, which is far more important than their trivia knowledge about our system. reply jack_riminton 5 hours agorootparentHere are some: 1) https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal... 2) https://www.nber.org/papers/w28731 3) https://scholar.harvard.edu/eharrington/publications/working... reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevJust a note that from your anecdote it sounds like you're a company that is partially (and decreasingly) remote. My experience has been that that kind of hybrid—where some employees are always colocated and others are always not—doesn't work because the organization's culture stays synchronous and in-person-oriented, so the remote employees are hamstrung in ways that don't happen in an organization where remote is evenly distributed. reply zeroCalories 4 hours agorootparentI think it's the opposite, remote workers are not reliable teammates. When we need ad hoc help from a remote engineer, we need to grab a 30 minute slot on their calendar, or we need to send them a long async email or DM chain. Eventually the conversation slows down, and they start responding once a day. When our senior engineers are physically available I can put myself in their office or at their desk and demand they help me. More remote-more slow. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentWhat you're describing is exactly the kind of problematic culture difference that I'm warning about. This is what I said earlier: > because the organization's culture stays synchronous and in-person-oriented Asynchronous does not mean slow, but it is different and requires structuring your work differently. Remote works much better asynchronously, but at an organization that has too few remote employees will never learn to do that. It's not that you're doing something wrong or that they are, it's that your organization is designed to be incompatible with remote workers. If you're not willing to adapt, then you're absolutely on the right track by phasing out remote, but don't take your anecdotes from working in an organization that refused to change as evidence that remote doesn't work. > When our senior engineers are physically available I can put myself in their office or at their desk and demand they help me. Slight tangent, but this is exactly why a lot of people like myself will never go back into an office. I don't want to be paid to be at someone's beck and call whenever they want to interrupt me, I want to be given a large chunk of work that I can work on independently without interruption unless I'm specifically designated to be on call as part of a regular rotation (at which point you can interrupt me just as well on slack as you could in the office). reply zeroCalories 3 hours agorootparent> Asynchronous does not mean slow, but it is different and requires structuring your work differently.

If you're not willing to adapt, then you're absolutely on the right track by phasing out remote, but don't take your anecdotes from working in an organization that refused to change as evidence that remote doesn't work. This is wishful thinking. Not all work can be done asynchronously, and often the most important work is important because it's a blocker for other things. In practice this kind of mindset simply increases the critical path of the project, which is the most important part, and in many cases senior engineers are on the critical path. But hey, if you're able to be productive at scale with remote work, guess you'll have a large pool of talent to draw from, so I'm hoping to see many successful companies replace FAANG. > Slight tangent, but this is exactly why a lot of people like myself will never go back into an office.

Yes, this is what YOU want. It's not for the benefit of the company, no matter how remote people try to frame it. But hey, if that's my only choice, then we should hire top talent in Bangalore or Warsaw instead of remote mid talent from high cost areas. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparent> Not all work can be done asynchronously, and often the most important work is important because it's a blocker for other things. This sounds like a project management failure. One of the cardinal rules of the remote programs I run is: Never let the critical path be blocked by one person having to physically do some synchronous task. If Task X requires Person Y to approve it by Date Z, then you obtain that approval asynchronously, waaaaay before Date Z, where you would otherwise become blocked. > In practice this kind of mindset simply increases the critical path of the project I mean, I think that's what you're getting at here, so design your business processes just like you'd design a multi-threaded program: such that there are no locks and mutexes. reply zeroCalories 1 hour agorootparent1.

Wow, this seems like a horrible way to manage your people. A decent engineer will not accept this kind of treatment, remote or not. They will quickly move to better managed environments and you will get stuck with subpar engineers. I never had a boss who did this. Even when I worked in office, all my managers were respectful and almost always they scheduled meetings ahead of time even when they needed to ask minor questions. Only time they would swing by my desk would be if it was truly an emergency (rare) or if they they just wanted to chit chat. reply zeroCalories 1 hour agorootparentYou have it backwards. I'm not a manager, I'm an IC. I make demands of my senior engineers(and managers) because their job is to enable me to actually make the product.

All you need is a single manager in a single year who doesn't understand the benefit of something for its budget to get gutted with ZBB, and once that happens it can take years to rebuild. ZBB starts from the premise that employees are fungible and can either be freely replaced or freely reassigned, which is not very realistic. reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentI don't know much about how companies really implement a ZBB, if anyone even does, but I'd argue that if organizational changes are om the table every year that's an unnecessary recipe for disaster. Budgeting doesn't have to mean asking the question of whether you need all the people you have, it's just asking what the priorities are and how to allocate capital. Priority number one should always be maintaining the best team possible, any other priority is going to fail anyway if there's no trust and everyone at the company is worried about getting fired just for budget. If that's the main issue with ZBB for a company, budgeting really is the least of their problems in my opinion. Employees need to trust leadership and leaderhsip needs to both earn that trust and trust their employees as well. This is actually really similar to a problem I have with how OKRs are done. They should be done from the bottom up not the top down. The idea of OKRs, and agile, sound great but they're just used as a mechanism for top down control because the company is fundamentally lacking trust. reply KineticLensman 5 hours agorootparentprevOne issue I can see is a massive performance hit at the year boundary as everyone goes into 'justification' mode to ensure their jobs and projects persist. Or just dusts off the forecasts and justifications they used last year, which sort of defeats the whole point. reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentThats a fair point. Trust would definitely have to be a requirement for a functional zero-based budget. Employees would need to know their jobs are secure and the company is just going through a regular process of deciding where to invest. As long as the perception, whether true or not, is that companies are always willing to fire employees to save a buck then no one really has incentives to honestly propose budgets and priorities. reply cdchn 5 hours agoparentprevDoes 4-day week policy mean you have to be in the office 4 days a week, or that your work week is 4 days long? reply JR1427 5 hours agorootparentI was also momentarily confused by this, but I assumed they meant 4 days in the office. reply georgeburdell 6 hours agoparentprevLet me guess: Sandra Rivera reply matsemann 6 hours agoparentprev> 4-day week policy You mean 4 days in the office, not a 4-day work week, right? reply formerly_proven 6 hours agoparentprevSounds like someone got drunk on power on day one. reply Spivak 5 hours agoparentprevOh hey, our new CEO did the same exact \"hybrid 4\" bullshit so he technically didn't violate our employment contracts that said we were hybrid employees.

The article plays tricks like saying 36% of seniors are leaving their jobs due to RTO, but then you click the link and realize it’s from a survey where people claimed they planned on leaving their job, not that they had or were actively doing it.

I don't know what the overall numbers are, but I know that some employers have mandated return to office (at least 3 days a week). My employer has not mandated that people be in a specific number of days a week and has instead chosen to reduce the office space they're renting. Unfortunately this means the days that many people need to be in the office can be pretty horrible due to there not being enough desks for everyone. reply matsemann 6 hours agoparentprevI (in Oslo, Norway), like going to the office most days. Maybe 1-2 days at home during the week now. It's a nice bike ride, which is the main reason for going, heh. And it's nice to just be a part of things. But since I go often, I don't feel I miss out on the days I don't. Also, I do it in a sense so that I can then go live/work in a cabin for long stretches during the winter, without people really \"noticing\" my absence as they think of me as someone mostly in the office. I did about 10 weeks of this this winter, skiing during the middle of the day when the sun was up etc., was great. So I like the flexibility, and WFH is important for me in the job I choose, but I don't mind going to the office when I don't need to be home. I feel I get the best of both worlds this way, the connections of being in the office, but also the freedom of being remote.

One of my friends has done it four times with different companies. The results are always the same: 1) The good ones are confident of their futures and go with you. 2) The people with dubious futures (and their wives) don't have to face the fact that they've been fired. \"The company left town,\" they say. They get job offers quickly, usually from your competitors who think they're conducting a raid. 3) The new people at Destiny City are better than the ones you left behind and they're infused with enthusiasm because they've been exposed only to your best people.\" — Up the Organization I think \"RTO to make people leave\" has the same idiotic thinking at its base. reply willcipriano 5 hours agorootparentSounds like tips a narcissist would offer on life. \"Pack up and leave once people are on to you, only the true believers will follow and the people at the new city will only interact with them so they will think you are great as well!\" reply bluGill 6 hours agorootparentprevfire (as opposed to lay off) is something companies avoid - if you don't show good cause to fire someone they can sue you for wrongful dismissal. If a company has reason to fire you they will often tell you verbally to quit or they will fire you - quit meaning that you did it of your own will. If this ever happens to you consider carefully taking their offer - you can't quit, but when someone asks they will say you left in good standing which looks better than being told you were fired for cause (but of course you can't sue them anymore as you quit) Layoff is what a company wants to do, but they need to do at least something to show the layoff was random. They can't just lay off one person who is bad, they need to get rid of a lot of people. reply AnimalMuppet 6 hours agorootparentprevThe ones you want to leave also may have a clue that they'd have a hard time finding a comparable job somewhere else.

Six out of eight of the board members are involved with companies located not just in the same state but clustered around the same area. Three of these companies have buildings in the same business park. All these companies have inflicted similar RTO mandates on their employees. I went through our financial statements -- commercial leases were set to expire this year, they've renewed them for another thirteen (!) years and committed $100M to office space improvements. They've frozen hiring, they're cutting costs wherever they can, but they found it reasonable to dump $25M each quarter on leasing costs? Whenever something like this is \"difficult to comprehend\" as the article obediently avoids scratching the surface, my first guess is that someone's making money off it.

At this point, why not all three? reply EPWN3D 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the whole commercial real estate thing is overblown. I think it's simpler: executive-level positions attract people who don't get very much fulfillment from their home lives. They get paid enough to have double-shift coverage on children, or they don't have children at all. Since they don't have to be home as much, they aren't. They don't mind the commute because they get to drive a fancy car, park in a reserved spot, and are usually on the road before the traffic starts. They get all their jollies from being in an office, talking to other people with the same lifestyle, and they can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to be in an office (aside from malice or laziness). And they derive their energy from seeing all the activity -- people going to meetings, milling about, etc. They see that stuff and conclude that yes, problems are being solved, innovation is happening, and that gets them excited.

If a mentally deranged vagrant runs up to you and punches you hard in the face, knocking you to the ground before running off, in NYC that is considered 3rd degree assault - a non-violent misdemeanor. On the rare occasion when this violent lunatic is caught, he is given an appearance ticket and released - non violent misdemeanors like this aren't \"bail eligible\". In a massive portion of these cases, the prosecutor will simply drop the charges. On the very, very rare occasion when it does go to trial the lunatic is deemed \"not fit to stand trial\" and simply released back onto the street. In all of these events, this is not recorded as a violent crime, so people with their head in the sand can wave their hands in the air and talk about how there is no violent crime in the city. But the often traumatized person who has been a victim of this violent assault now suffers from the memory of being attacked - more so because they know their attacker faces absolutely no sanction and is back out on the street.

Tech management is often bad, for any number of reasons (not the least of which is non-technical peoples' complete lack of understanding about what their people are doing). At least when these managers are beyond physical reach of their workers, the workers have a better chance of creating a productive environment and shielding themselves from distraction and nonsense interactions. Many of these managers actually do very little beyond low-value talking and meeting. They are figureheads who are recognized by figureheads who likewise provide little actual value. Meanwhile, a team of 1 product/project management skill + 2 devs + 1 designer, when all agreeing on the goal, can do what a corporate organization of 100 people cannot do. This is why most new value is created by small independent teams who are then bought up by laggard giants that can no longer do anything beyond manipulating the system to maintain some form of monopolistic control.

And by all accounts, Netflix and Amazon are stressful to work for, at least partially because these employees are having to manage themselves in addition to performing their individual work. I actually agree with most of your points, but if you think of the market as an ecosystem and companies as lifeforms, you'll find many species employing completely different (successful) growth strategies. I've been on teams that were undermanaged, I've been on teams that were over-managed, organizations with incredibly effective management, and organizations where management was comprised of politicians and fools who actively harmed the effectiveness of the teams they were supposed to lead. It's relatively easy to hire great ICs. You ask them some questions to make sure their resume isn't bullshit, try to gage their enthusiasm, attitude, and friendliness, then pay them what they want. It's really, really hard to hire great managers, because even if they've succeeded in past positions, it has little bearing on whether they'll succeed in this particular position, working with these particular people. And it's even harder to build an organizational culture whereby the right people get promoted internally to management. Almost every company screws this up, and the big companies that get this less-wrong are much less stressful to work for and more effective than their peers. reply shmatt 6 hours agoprevThe University of Chicago research was a little confusing.

I haven’t seen any research on that yet So far the data shows RTO makes people leave, but it makes them leave to other RTO companies, not fully remote ones reply esrauch 6 hours agoparentEven if they leave a non-RTO company and join a non-RTO company its an interesting effect. It seems that being forced to RTO in the same role can lead to unhappiness and into 'shields down' (https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/), then people are more willing to look around to see if there's a better deal on offer somewhere else (even if the _other_ deal ends up also being in-office). reply bravetraveler 6 hours agorootparentThis is delightful to read, thank you for sharing. Ham-fisted RTO was definitely my 'shields down' moment. The 'how' matters much like the 'what' or 'why'. In terms of on-site/remote, I'm not firmly for or against either. I see benefits in both. Similarly - it's interesting to see this from the manager PoV. I've been primarily WFH since ~2016 after doing the traditional thing for longer. I'm not new to either. Then the pandemic came/went... and how we kept working remained a hot topic. I saw executives above me (with more pull) get put in a tough spot: sell their new homes and relocate, or find new work. Then their peons/reporting managers tried to convince me that I'd be safe - appealing to pride saying I was too important to be lost to things like that. Yeah, right. As strange as it sounds... my shields were forced down out of preservation. It took over a year of (communicated) discontent before the shields finally went down for good. Nobody else did this - it was the business/leadership. I was productive despite most of the job not being about the work. It just so happens there are places requiring less work (relevant to the job or not) while being more rewarding. Loyalty is a funny dynamic. There's efficiency and leniency for everyone involved by choosing to not bike-shed over things like 'Where Are My Adults'. Doing the job you hired them for. I hope. reply animuchan 5 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely, it's like any other worsening of the working conditions. When I've had a conflict of sorts with my direct manager, I also started looking elsewhere for job opportunities. Obviously in those other potential workplaces the same thing could happen, but in the current job I already know it has happened, so a coin flip is a (perceived) improvement. (Also when negotiating a new contract with a working-from-office company, there's a better chance of getting a hybrid model than if you're already an employee.) reply segmondy 6 hours agoparentprevIf you have to RTO, better to RTO where you get paid better. I WFH and pay isn't what I can make if in office, I take the flexibility. If I have to RTO, I'll seek higher pay, even if it means relocating to a different location. reply everforward 5 hours agoparentprev> It’s not surprising that people left MSFT for companies that pay double or triple. The part that’s more interesting is if people are willing to take a 50% pay cut to go remote. I haven’t seen any research on that yet It would also be interesting to see if there are preferences when given equal pay. I suspect most people have a number where they're willing to go into the office every day, it's not surprising to me that people are willing to RTO for multiples of their current pay. It all gets a touch weird when comparing comp, though. If someone takes a 50% pay cut, but they move from SF to somewhere that costs something like 60% less, have they taken a pay cut or not? That feels subjective to me, and I've heard both sides. Their ability to save may have gone down, their quality of life may have gone up, it feels like a wash. Another factor that may be weighing on people is stability of infrastructure and of the remote work job market. I grew up rural and would like to return to the country (not for farming, I already know I hate that from experience). I'm also fully remote, but haven't moved back. There are too many uncertainties. Will the remote work job market hold up, or will it collapse and I have to keep the same job for forever or uproot my whole life? Will Starlink continue to be a reliable provider, or are they going to enter the race to the bottom in 5 years? In the end, I work remotely, about a 15 minute drive from the office, because of the certainty it brings. I don't have to watch the news with anxiety, waiting to see whether the life I've chosen has become unviable or not. That undercuts the kind of peace I'm looking for in moving to a rural area in the first place. It's probably less of a concern for the digital nomads, who seem to live in relative chaos generally (not a moral judgement, I can see the appeal, it's just not for me at this point in my life). reply mgerdts 5 hours agoparentprevMaybe the RTO job they switch to is a better match with their location. Some people accepted a job assuming or being told it was permanently WFH. From 2007 through 2010 I worked in an office in a job I didn’t particularly like and repeatedly turned away recruiters from Google. In 2010 I joined Oracle (Solaris org) remotely. As the Solaris org wound down, I continued to turn away the google recruiters with positions that would have required a move. Since leaving Oracle I’ve held two other remote jobs. If any of those remote jobs would have required me to move within commuting distance of an engineering office, I would have left. reply malfist 6 hours agoparentprevI wouldn't characterize Meta as being aggressive towards RTO.

After the pandemic, he pondered on RTO/WFH. His company is still growing and he needed to hire more people.

The entire development of the article hinges on this being true but I see no sign of justification or reasoning behind this affirmation. reply adrianmonk 5 hours agoparentAgreed. There's a lack of justification, and moreover I would expect the opposite. With all the recent layoffs, right now many companies might be OK with some attrition. It's one of the least ugly ways to reduce payroll costs. It's not as bad for PR or morale as layoffs would be. And you don't have to pay severance. And if you lose more employees than you wanted to, it should be easy to hire new people because of laid off people who haven't found new jobs yet. Sure, losing valued senior employees will have a negative impact. But they're also usually paid a lot, so I doubt business people will cry very hard about it. reply Raed667 6 hours agoparentprevbecause companies keep claiming that retention is a top concern reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparent> companies keep claiming that retention is a top concern when times are good. Fixed that for you. When times are good it is hard to find people and so they care about them. However the real test is when times are not good. If retention was a concern it will show up when times are bad - but it doesn't so we know that it isn't a real concern. Of course if it is a concern management has a much harder job. They can no longer hire as many people in the good times as they would then have to let good people go. Much easier to give them a cheap foosball table or something that makes it look like they care without making their job hard. reply benterix 6 hours agoparentprevI don't get your point. High turnover means unnecessary costs. And especially in senior positions it might take years to get the necessary experience to get equally productive. So unless you really aim at the very bottom, you should care about employee retention. reply bluGill 6 hours agorootparentYou and I know that, but I see no evidence that any management anywhere does. Thus there is the real possibility we are wrong.

One-third said they had discontinued a hiring process in the last year due to expectations that employees would return to a physical workspace. Sounds like what happened here is that the author of TFA read the whole report instead of just the headline. reply Justsignedup 5 hours agoprevI often attribute this to free layoffs, but the problem is that if your _senior_ leadership and employees leave, the problem is that you're in a bad situation. Laying off some people who recently joined, are a bit underperforming, etc is a great way to do layoffs. But losing your top talent is the best way to sink yourself. However the effects are felt a few years down the line, and these big orgs usually praise the CEO for doing this genius maneuver and saving a bunch of money, only to later leave in a few years when shit is about to hit the fan. Overall its a weird time. And to note, I do like working from the office, so I happen to be in the minority who likes hybrid. Though even I cannot deny the benefits of being able to WFH and get to a doctor appointment or take care of my kid when she's sick. reply gravescale 6 hours agoprev> Finding AI talent, which more and more companies are going to need, is already a search for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Adding strict RTO policies to that scenario won’t make the talent search easier.

In fact, it stands even without the everything-is-now-about-AI journalism gloss. The expensive, grumpy seniors with the pointed questions in meetings are largely the ones who feel most able to risk jumping ship in 2024 and treating them like naughty children or unreliable juniors really winds them up.

The first group will almost never go office-first, whereas the second group will revert to its “original DNA” unless a deliberate culture change is made. It has to be a complete change in operational procedures, communication culture, etc. It’s much much more than simply using Slack and having Zoom calls instead of office meetings. If that doesn’t happen, the switch to remote won’t stick. So if you like working remotely, pick a company that’s always been remote. reply burnedout_dc4e3 4 hours agoparentI thought that too, and joined a startup that was founded as remote first. However, we later acquired another company that was 100% in office, and also hired a couple key executives who didn't like remote-first. It's now incredibly painful to get anything done because most of the senior people who built that remote-first culture have been pushed out, and things have reverted to hoping someone overhears the information they need. reply bluedino 4 hours agoprevHere's one that's funny.

The goal is to reduce 'head count' and in the real world cost. They rank you by pay and tenure. Then decided if they can do without you. It almost rarely has anything to do with how good you are. But more 'my project would not finish in x time if y was gone'. Then they decide to keep the whole project or not and if they get rid of the project that means maybe 15 other people can go too. After a particular level in many large companies you become a cost number instead of a person. What you are working on may seem important. At least it is to you. But in the grand scheme of things most of what we work on is ethereal. I have been in this industry coming up on 30 years now. Very little of what I have ever worked on is even in production anymore.
