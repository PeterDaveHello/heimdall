It&#x27;s so exactly what I wish for out of a scratch pad.My feature request to add to your pile (possibly a lonely one, since maybe it&#x27;s just unique to how my brain works):I really want a scratch pad like this to have UX that supports \"inverted\" order. Meaning, new blocks get added to the top of the page instead of the bottom. The blocks naturally flow in descending order of creation rather than ascending. The scratch pad always opens at the top of the page. Over time, blocks thus end up \"decaying\" toward the bottom, with the most relevant at the top.It just fits better with how my brain works.I also +1 the sentiment given elsewhere in this thread to bias toward ignoring the vast majority of these feature requests and preserve the simplicitly of what you&#x27;ve built. That includes mine! reply jonatanheyman 16 hours agoparentHappy you like it :).I get the idea of the \"inverted order\". I wonder if it would be enough to make it configurable so that C-Enter inserts a new block before the current one + Heynote sets the cursor at the beginning of the buffer at startup (instead of last which is the current behavior)? reply al_borland 9 hours agorootparentAnother option might be to have the default scroll position at the bottom, to act more like a terminal or chat app. Scroll up to see the history, rather than scrolling down to see the latest.(Sorry if this is how it already works, I’m on my phone right now, so I can’t download it, but I’m very interested in the block idea. I like that concept a lot for a scratch pad. I’m definitely saving this for later.) reply dwilding 9 hours agorootparentprevYour app is awesome, it&#x27;s just so satisfying to use. Really fantastic job!My two cents on block insertion: Personally, I would love if Cmd+Enter inserts a new block at the very topFor inserting a new block in sequence, I feel like Cmd+Shift+Enter (splitting the current block) might already be enough - but I obviously haven&#x27;t used heynote for long enough to have a very informed opinion on this :)Maybe there&#x27;s some way to make the behavior configurable? reply jsdalton 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah I was thinking similar. And&#x2F;or a separate shortcut key that opens a new block at the very top of the page (regardless of where the current cursor is positioned). reply smusamashah 15 hours agorootparentprevHaving an option to set either behaviour the default would be a better choice here. reply drBonkers 10 hours agorootparentprevThat would be plenty for me! reply chatmasta 11 hours agoparentprevI also like this. But I don&#x27;t like the distraction of seeing all the blocks below my cursor move every time I make a new line.The perfect UX would be to add a new buffer at the top, but with enough padding to fill the window so that you can&#x27;t see the movement of previous blocks while you&#x27;re typing.(Maybe this is already kinda how it works - I haven&#x27;t downloaded the app yet, but I&#x27;m excited to try it, because it looks great!) reply oezi 10 hours agorootparentI wrote a small Ruby TUI which works like this called Rodo (Ruby Todos). Pressing CTRL+t will get you a new Todo list (it&#x27;s just markdown) at the top of a file.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coezbek&#x2F;rodo reply radley 11 hours agorootparentprev>I don&#x27;t like the distraction of seeing all the blocks below my cursor move every time I make a new line.Uhm... They don&#x27;t move. They stay the same distance, relative to your line. As you add more lines, they&#x27;ll disappear below the fold. reply chatmasta 11 hours agorootparentIn a regular doc, if you start typing at the beginning, then all the lines after it move down as you type. It&#x27;s just the movement I find distracting, compared to appending to a doc with no space below where I&#x27;m inserting text. I&#x27;d rather feel like I&#x27;m typing into empty space rather than up against a wall. reply amadeuspagel 14 hours agoparentprevI made a notes app that&#x27;s kind of like that. Notes get added to the top and when you edit a note it gets \"bumped\" to the top again: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinktype.app&#x2F; reply SpaghettiCthulu 14 hours agorootparentTIL using the .app TLD makes your website categorically an app reply phanimahesh 5 hours agorootparentA web page that can run offline is typically called a web app. With some metadata it is possible to \"install\" them to run in ui chrome less windows like a natively installed app on multiple environments.It&#x27;s not the .app domain so much as the functionality. Web apps are nicer and easily accessible imo, lower friction than an install. Not everything should need an install. reply amadeuspagel 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure what you mean. This is an app that stores everything client side. It works offline. It&#x27;s no different from a native app. reply SpaghettiCthulu 10 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re somewhat right. However, I would hesitate to call any website an app. And there certainly is a difference. For one thing I would say an app must be it&#x27;s own program, even if it just uses Electron or similar. reply hjadal 16 hours agoparentprevI agree that this addition would be very helpful as it is already how I take notes in a markdown document. reply vy007vikas 16 hours agoparentprev+1. This would be great. I could then use this for daily logging as well. reply breakfastduck 8 hours agoparentprevplease do this inverted order reply zero-true 10 minutes agoprevThis is awesome.... I&#x27;m super interested in polyglot file formats like this one. Huge congrats and I will definitely be giving it a try.I&#x27;ve actually been working on my own project to combine Python+SQL+Markdwown+Rich Text into one reactive executable document. If any of you are interested here is a link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Zero-True&#x2F;zero-true. reply dceddia 15 hours agoprevThis looks awesome! I love the blocks idea. I’m gonna download and give it a try.I see lots of comments about Electron (per usual here haha) and I just thought I’d shout out Tauri if you hadn’t run across it. It’s basically Electron-but-in-Rust and uses the system webview instead of Chromium, so bundle size and memory usage is reduced a bunch.I took a look at the code and it looks like you haven’t got a ton of Electron-side code so if you felt like playing with Rust it might not be too hard to swap. I have a video editing app that I started building with Electron and then switched to Tauri midway and it’s been pretty nice.I hope it’s clear this isn’t a request and please feel free to disregard this comment entirely :) reply jonatanheyman 15 hours agoparentYeah, I looked at Tauri in the beginning of the project. What made me go with Electron was the maturity and large user base. And it has actually been a bliss to work with Electron (my expectations after having worked with other cross-platform tools for mobile were extremely low), so I haven&#x27;t regretted my choice. I&#x27;ve dealt with very few bugs. I love that there is a large ecosystem, and that it was easy to automate building (as well as auto-updating) for multiple platforms. reply dceddia 15 hours agorootparentThat makes a lot of sense. I miss a bit of that from Electron. Its auto-updater is nicer, and while I haven&#x27;t had a ton of cross-browser issues there&#x27;ve been a couple that I had to fix with transpiling or avoiding some newer CSS stuff. Shipping everything with one browser engine lends a lot toward peace of mind.I wish there was a way to build a stripped-down Electron, like a configurator where you could uncheck things you don&#x27;t need. Printing support? WebGPU? WebRTC? Video playback? PDF reader? Straight to jail. It would be lovely. I&#x27;d love to see what would happen to the bundle size. reply OccamsMirror 10 hours agoparentprevMy issue with Tauri is that it used WebKitGtk2 on Linux. Which is pretty poor from a performance perspective and missing feature support compared to WebKit on MacOS or Webview2 on Windows. reply esafak 15 hours agoparentprevI read that the Rust part was unergonomic. Do you find Tauri productive? reply dceddia 14 hours agorootparentYeah, it works pretty well for me. Rust definitely took some getting used to (I was new to it when I started).There&#x27;s a lot of functionality you can access from JS without needing to get into Rust, but on the Rust side Tauri has this notion of \"commands\" for calling Rust from the UI.You can write a Rust function and annotate it with #[tauri::command], and register it, and then you can call it from the JS side with invoke(&#x27;your_command_name&#x27;, args). Those commands can be async too, so you can do blocking work on the Rust side and the UI won&#x27;t freeze.You can inject State variables into those commands, which get injected at call time and are effectively global to the Rust side. I would say the State stuff is a bit unergonomic in that you run up against needing to share them between threads, so everything inside them needs to be Arc> and writing those wrappers was boilerplatey.I wish the JSRust calling overhead were lower. It serializes everything to JSON and back, so I try to avoid too many calls, and try to avoid sending lots of data between them. reply evnc 15 hours agoprevI love this! Simple and solid execution. I&#x27;ve been wanting to build something similar for some time now, might fork and play around with it. Thank you for open sourcing it!I&#x27;ve started using Obsidian with a new note for each day and separating \"blocks\" with a Markdown horizontal rule (`---`) to achieve something similar, but this is much cleaner.The strength of such an approach is making capture extremely easy -- new block, start writing, no thinking about where this goes and how to fit it into pre-existing structure. I find that if I&#x27;m trying to do that, then by the time I find where my idea goes, I&#x27;ve lost the idea.The downside, of course, is finding things again. The ability to tag or title a block and search by tag or title would be great. More ambitiously, it would be cool to experiment with incorporating LLMs and embeddings to automatically tag, summarize, categorize, cluster etc. your blocks.There&#x27;s a lot of different directions one could take this, but I&#x27;ll echo the sentiment of others to refrain from adding too many features and losing the original appeal of simplicity. :)Also: How do you handle performance when the buffer gets very large? reply mkl 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s not open source, as it uses the Commons Clause which severely limits what can be done with it (the name is misleading). reply prartichoke 11 hours agorootparentAs far as a quick google search got me, it seems pretty open with the only caveat being you can&#x27;t sell or monetize it... how is that not open source? reply aryonoco 10 hours agorootparentIf you put any restrictions on usage or what can be done with it (like selling), then it&#x27;s absolutely not open source.open source doesn&#x27;t mean source code is there. open source has a specific definition. There is a list of acceptable open source licenses, as defined by OSI. similarly there is a list of acceptable free software licenses, as defined by FSF. Broadly, the two lists are the same. Commons Clause is definitely not open source. reply j1elo 8 hours agorootparentNot sure why you&#x27;re being downvoted. Even the Commons Clause itself is clear about it:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonsclause.com&#x2F;#faq> Is this “Open Source”?> No. reply bityard 8 hours agorootparentprevThere exists a niche of commercial software developers who are actively attempting to water down the commonly accepted meaning of \"open source\" for their own gain, and I suspect they are voting you down. :( reply jonatanheyman 15 hours agoparentprevPerformance is mostly handled by CodeMirror (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codemirror.net&#x2F;), the underlying editor that Heynote is built upon. It seems to handle quite large buffers well. Where I have seen some minor performance issues is when working with very large blocks in certain language modes. reply maineldc 19 hours agoprevI just downloaded and installed and I am really impressed. I liked the concept of math blocks though it took me a few seconds to figure out how to change a new block into a math block. This note at the top wasn&#x27;t clear to me:⌘ + L Change block languageThe phrase block language didn&#x27;t trigger my \"change the type of block\" thinking. I might slightly rephrase like:⌘ + L Change block language (Math, Markdown, etc.)Otherwise, I think this is a great \"scratches an itch\" type project. Congrats! reply jonatanheyman 19 hours agoparentGood suggestion, I&#x27;ll change that! reply zestyping 12 hours agorootparent\"Change block type\" makes more sense then \"Change block language\". \"Language\" sounds like it could mean English, French, etc. whereas \"block type\" is unambiguous. reply silvestrov 17 hours agorootparentprevIt would be nice with some documentation of what the Math mode supports, e.g. syntax, units, functions.It can be difficult to figure out why some lines are interpreted ok and while others fail.How to convert between fahrenheit and celsius? reply jonatanheyman 17 hours agorootparentYes, I&#x27;ve learned that Heynote is lacking some documentation. Will improve that.Math.js (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathjs.org&#x2F;) powers the Math blocks, so what&#x27;s supported by Math.js should be supported by Heynote, with the addition of currency conversions (exchange rates are updated daily).> How to convert between fahrenheit and celsius?This should work: 10 celsius to fahrenheit reply silvestrov 17 hours agorootparentCould it be made to parse \"10°C\" as \"10 celsius\" as that is much shorter?Suggestion: mouse over on green calculated value should show value in multiple formats. E.g. \"time = 4000 seconds\" could show \"01:06:40\"also: \"today + 4 days\" or \"now + 1 day\"Unicode \"π\" should parse like \"PI\". reply promiseofbeans 7 hours agorootparentYou can do that (and lots more) with Fend: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;printfn&#x2F;fend&#x2F; reply samstave 15 hours agorootparentprevAll blocks should be collapsable - I was playing with it and had to enter a comment marker in some to be able to get the collapse arrow in the bar, like # in a python block, however the behavior for a python block collapsing vs another - is that the python block collapses to &#x27; ... &#x27; Whereas, other blocks maintain the firt row as a header, so if I label another block NOTES and collapse it, I can still see the header.So a collapse button on every block would be nice.I love this. Thank you. reply jonatanheyman 15 hours agorootparentI agree! This would (will hopefully) be an improvement. reply samstave 14 hours agorootparentMaybe a block header which includes the timestamp for block birth and whatever text on that line for the title. So row 0 of every block would be the block meta header? no feature creep I promise...Oh! and one more thing....https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;UZwOhIZ.png replyrglover 11 hours agoprevThis is really, really good. Just earned a permanent spot on my dock in short order.One request (which I would happily pay for): make it so that you can run the code blocks and generate an output. I routinely crack open the browser console to test out some JS and it would be great to be able to do this right alongside my other notes. reply promiseofbeans 7 hours agoparentYou might be able to hook into the new Deno jupyter notebook feature for this reply porridgeraisin 17 hours agoprevLove this. This is exactly what I need. I have been using a WhatsApp group with just me, for this purpose, until now.Feature requests: - arch package- would really like the results of the math to be in buffer.txt and in Ctrl+a and copy.- changing font and color theme(I like the Nord one right now though!) Please keep it minimally colored as it is now so that changing color is just a simple matter of configuring a handful of colors as opposed to custom css. That would make it too complicated.- support for images and media in markdown blocks would be nice to whatever extent possible. I would love it if you could copy the way vscode markdown works. Ctrl+v an image in the editor and it inserts the markdown for it and saves the image to a file. Markdown preview would be nice but I understand if you think that&#x27;s out of scope.- timestamp for blocks. especially would be nice if you could store createdAt updatedAt in the line with the infinity symbols in buffer.txt to make it easily extractable using grep and cut.- saw that you mentioned downthread that you&#x27;re working on reloading the file so that we can back it up with git or whatever. Would love that!- is mobile possible? Through Cordova or somethingThanks for making this! reply jonatanheyman 17 hours agoparent> would really like the results of the math to be in buffer.txt and in Ctrl+a and copy.Adding the results to lines that are copied from Math blocks should be doable, and I like that idea! I agree that it would also be nice with the results in buffer.txt, but because of implementation details it&#x27;s harder to implement I think.> changing font and color themeAt the moment, I&#x27;m leaning towards keeping the number of configurable settings down and not add have font color theme settings.> timestamp for blocks. especially would be nice if you could store createdAt updatedAt in the line with the infinity symbols in buffer.txt to make it easily extractable using grep and cut.yes, this is on the TODO> saw that you mentioned downthread that you&#x27;re working on reloading the file so that we can back it up with git or whatever. Would love that!Yes, this too :)> is mobile possible? Through Cordova or somethingProbably not :&#x2F; reply bachmeier 14 hours agorootparentChanging the font is accessibility, not customization. I downloaded the app, opened it up, and the font was too small for it to be practical for me to use. I know it doesn&#x27;t take much to fix, because I did a Ctrl-Shift-I, changed the font from 12px to 18px, and problem solved. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m going to do over and over. reply rkeene2 13 hours agorootparentYeah, it&#x27;s not really usable without being able to configure a reasonable font. reply porridgeraisin 5 hours agorootparentFor now, go to devtools and save a chrome snippet with document.querySelector(.cm-scroller).style.fontFamily = \"whatever\"; hit save.Then everytime you open, Ctrl+shift+i, Ctrl+o, enter, Ctrl+enter incantation will run it.Emacs style, if I may ;) reply monkey_monkey 13 hours agorootparentprevcmd + (or whatever the equivalent is for your platform) seems to permanently increase the font size. reply bachmeier 8 hours agorootparentTried it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. reply porridgeraisin 16 hours agorootparentprev> At the moment, I&#x27;m leaning towards keeping the number of configurable settings down and not add have font color theme settings.Alright, if you ever lean the other way a tad bit, please allow configuration of fonts, I can try to contribute that feature next week. I don&#x27;t mind fixed colors nearly as much.>> is mobile possible? Through Cordova or something> Probably not :&#x2F;Understandable. Check my comment (sibling to my parent comment) for a suggestion for the PWA you mentioned though! reply porridgeraisin 17 hours agoparentprevAdding to it:Saw you mentioned below that you were planning to add a pwa + local storage version. In that case you can disregard my mobile request, and replace it with a download button on mobile so we can sync it to our desktop through git or drive or something. reply silvestrov 17 hours agoparentprevFont and color could be implemented by letting us add some CSS to the html page (as it is made using Electron).This would enable using fancy CSS for some notes. reply rebeccaskinner 17 hours agoprevThis reminds me a lot of org-mode(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;). Do you have plans to add other org-like features, like evaluating code blocks? I don&#x27;t personally see myself moving away from org-mode, but it would be nice to have something to recommend to people who are reluctant to use emacs, even if it&#x27;s only for a single application. reply jonatanheyman 17 hours agoparentOh, I haven&#x27;t seen orgmode before, so I don&#x27;t know what its features are. I&#x27;m not planning to add evaluation of code blocks (apart from Math blocks that is) due to the complexity it would add. reply bradrn 11 hours agorootparent> Oh, I haven&#x27;t seen orgmode before, so I don&#x27;t know what its features are.Essentially, it’s an environment for writing+outlining+task tracking+time management. It’s incredibly useful — you should definitely try it since you’ve used Emacs. reply versteegen 7 hours agorootparentJust like emacs itself, it&#x27;s hard to describe what org-mode is, since it has so many features, most of which any individual probably won&#x27;t use or even know about. You didn&#x27;t mention tables, hyperlinks, tagging, exporting documents...See the manual&#x27;s table of contents: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;org.html reply beepbooptheory 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is so much like org mode (or rather, a small subset of org mode) its fascinating and cool to me you had never even heard of it! Great minds...Make sure to also look at org roam, it is more specifically why I won&#x27;t personally have a need for Heynote any time soon, but it could maybe be inspiring for you going forward.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orgroam.com&#x2F; reply stantham 1 hour agoprevHi. Great work! I&#x27;ll be giving this a try, as I always type my notes on txt files.Any plans on adding support for tabs&#x2F;multiple files? I usually have different files for different types of notes (todos, project notes, tmp file for random things, etc). reply AlphaWeaver 13 hours agoprevThe calculations alongside the notes remind me of the \"dynamic annotations\" in Ink and Switch&#x27;s \"Potluck\" [0] demo. I wish there were more examples of this in note taking applications - this sort of progressive enhancement from unstructured notes to structured data is useful.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inkandswitch.com&#x2F;potluck&#x2F; reply nymiro 1 hour agoprevOh wow, i do exactly the same but with vim. After leaving vim for a period of flirtation with intellij i settled for vscode, well recently I am leaning towards cursor. But I always have a macvim window handy for notes and snippets. This might be a better suited tool though. Thanks! reply apwell23 19 hours agoprevThis is great. I always resort to textedit for this stuff, i am going to use heynote instead and see how it goes.love seeing stuff like this on HN like the good old days.Any plans to add vi keybindings support by any chance? reply cozzyd 6 hours agoparentyes, this is cool, but without vi keybindings it&#x27;s not very practical for menow I wonder if I can get or write a vim plugin to do something similar... that would also have the advantage of being in a terminal so it can live in a persistent tmux session and be accessible remotely... reply michaelrpeskin 18 hours agoprevI love this! I typically use a separate text editor for things like this, but the block idea is great and works with how my brain likes to group things.I know this is expanding the scope and complexity and probably opposite to what you&#x27;re trying to do, but one thing that would be cool is to have different tabs. In my current workflow, I have a notepad for \"working memory\" which Heynote will easily replace. I also have a separate one to track the things I worked on each day. I need to have a record of who I charged for what incase I get audited. I could totally see having a block for each day - and I wouldn&#x27;t want that intermingled with the other data.Oh I would love it if you could render markdown as formatted html a la Typora reply jonatanheyman 18 hours agoparentYeah, at the moment I&#x27;m hesitant to add tab support (for the reasons that you stated), though I&#x27;ve definitely thought about it. reply Perz1val 18 hours agorootparentProbably better not to. From my experience tabs (in the long run) are more annoying than helpful. Take vscode: I use the \"open editors\" menu, because tabs work just up to 3 of them. Then they either not fit (scroll-x), have titles far too short to be identifiable or take half the screen when using tab wrapping.I haven&#x27;t used heynote yet (in a train rn), so you may&#x27;ve that already in place, but:I suggest implementing bookmarks with fuzzy search. Press ctrl+b a prompt comes up, type the thing, press enter and get your file scrolled to that section (markdown title) reply digdugdirk 17 hours agorootparentLove this idea. Almost like a vscode \"go to definition\" functionality. Pair that with a \"go back to previous location\" feature and you can get a surprisingly nice and flexible workflow. reply jameshart 18 hours agorootparentprevRight - not sure tabs is the right metaphor. I definitely want the ability to keep some blocks around, put them aside, return to them later...Maybe a block &#x27;tagging&#x27; mechanism? Let me &#x27;stash&#x27; a block and label it with tags... then later on I can &#x27;restore&#x27; stashed blocks by searching for tags. Or open a new window easily containing every block that shares a particular tag? reply nicoburns 9 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps you could consider documenting&#x2F;specifying the file format. Seems to me that this could potentially become some kind of standard (if you&#x27;re open to that). Perhaps with a .mixt extension (for \"mixed text\")?Seems to me that this would be a pretty good general document format for a lot of use cases. reply pomdtr 8 hours agorootparentprevI think tabs could be interesting if coupled with a way to filter the list of blocks (ex: I only want to see math blocks, or only blocks containing the #daily tag, or only blocks from this month).Then each tab would be an opportunity to apply a new set of filter on top of the same document. reply Perz1val 17 hours agoparentprevMaybe try Obsidian for the second use case? reply jonatanheyman 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;d love to get some feedback also :).Heynote Github Repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;heyman&#x2F;heynote reply danpalmer 19 hours agoparentHey! Nice app, I&#x27;ve always had scratch pads around for things like this and never had a particularly good solution for them. Soulver is nice but too maths focused, a tab in VSCode in nice but it&#x27;s a pain to manage multiple buffers for different languages. I like the feature set here.A few bits of feedback for potential improvements or clarifications...- I couldn&#x27;t find the shortcut to change the language until I hovered over the status bar element for it. It should have a menu item with the keyboard shortcut on it.- Toggling light&#x2F;dark mode doesn&#x27;t live in the status bar in any other app I know, probably best to put it in settings.- Doesn&#x27;t respect the system light&#x2F;dark mode, it should by default (but perhaps with an app specific override as some people like that).- Check for update doesn&#x27;t live in the status bar either in any other app I&#x27;ve used, this could be in settings.- If there&#x27;s not enough stuff to put in a status bar, maybe drop the status bar? It feels like things have been scraped together to justify having it.- The green branding is ok, but it&#x27;s quite a strong personality for an app to have. Do you want the app to have a strong personality? (Nothing else about it suggests so). Perhaps consider a more neutral palette that fits in with macOS more, or perhaps several choices for accent colour including a neutral option.- 427MB is huge. Thankfully it&#x27;s not particularly memory hungry at least with small documents, but damn that&#x27;s a big bundle for what it is. Why is it bundling ffmpeg? Does it really need GLES? Is a base Electron framework really >300MB?- Options for a keymap, but after deleting the initial content I&#x27;ve lost the actual keymap! Would be great to have a help reference in the app, or at least a docs page on the website that the help menu links to.- Would be great to be able to change the font.- I don&#x27;t understand the saving model. Where is the data saved? Can I control this? Is saving necessary? If not, how often is the data persisted? Can I put it in cloud storage so it syncs across machines, or if it does this already, can I opt-out of that?- Not personally a fan of putting the name of the app in the icon. Most apps don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d suggest something more subtle. reply jonatanheyman 18 hours agorootparent> I couldn&#x27;t find the shortcut to change the language until I hovered over the status bar element for it.

Since it doesn&#x27;t actually need filesystem access or some of the other integrations electron provides.

It uses the native WebViews on the various platforms instead of bundling Chromium.FWIW, we also have an Electron app, in part because the integration with native APIs (which we use) is fairly full-featured with Electron.

A replacement for that Sublime text window I keep around where I paste stuff to keep for later, or to examine some JSON I just grabbed from somewhere!I do find myself wanting more features, but of course the beauty of this is how simple it is, so you definitely need to strongly resist the urge to add and add as people suggest ways to &#x27;improve&#x27; it. Apply the old &#x27;every feature starts with -100 points&#x27; mindset (attributable to Anders Hjelsberg, I think?).But that said, I&#x27;m going to give you some feature requests anyway :DThe thing I feel like I most immediately want from a tool like this is something close to the common SQL notebook behavior where you can select a few lines of text and hit F5 to run just the selection. Obviously only makes sense in language blocks which have a script engine associated. But the ability to write a chunk of JS or Python or shell and instantly execute it might be powerful. Where does it run, what happens to the output, etc? All good questions. No idea.I&#x27;d love to see markdown blocks get formatted in place (still monospaced, just some bold and italic and stuff) - probably whenever the cursor is not focused in the block... though the potential shift in line wrap that would cause might be annoying. Maybe just have an edit&#x2F;display toggle on markdown blocks to flip them into formatted mode. Additionally, making markdown-formatted tables elastically align in place while editing them would be a huge quality of life boost....... Which (since formatting markdown tables correctly amounts to the same thing) makes me think this could be an opportunity to implement a classic &#x27;elastic tabstops&#x27; plain text mode... the fact that the tab key only increases line indent is... an interesting choice that reduces the need to indulge any tabs vs spaces discussions - though obviously it&#x27;s possible to paste in text that contains tabs even if you can&#x27;t type them. Coming up with something better to do with inline tabs than just &#x27;snap to next multiple of tab width&#x27; is tricky, but I would suggest maybe enabling &#x27;elastic tab&#x27; rules: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickgravgaard.com&#x2F;elastic-tabstops&#x2F; - because this is a place that&#x27;s meant to handle copy&#x2F;pasted text and stuff natively typed in, NOT a place that is expected to open and correctly format files. reply jonatanheyman 16 hours agoparent> I do find myself wanting more features, but of course the beauty of this is how simple it is, so you definitely need to strongly resist the urge to add and add as people suggest ways to &#x27;improve&#x27; it.Definitely!

That&#x27;s something I do in IDEA&#x27;s scratch pads constantly but I&#x27;d like an ever-running note of what I&#x27;m doing divided into blocks.Also it would be awesome to have some metadata on each block that is toggle-able (or just inserts as text) so I can have the current date&#x2F;time added or shown. reply jonatanheyman 17 hours agoparent> I would love the ability to create multiple cursors from a selection (within a block of course)Ctrl-D (CMD-D on Mac) does this (currently not limited to the current block though, but that is something I&#x27;d like to change).> Also it would be awesome to have some metadata on each block that is toggle-able (or just inserts as text) so I can have the current date&#x2F;time added or shown.Yeah, I&#x27;ve been thinking of adding timestamp (of last edit) as metadata for each block reply promiseofbeans 14 hours agoprevI saw the unit conversions and it immediately reminded me of Fend (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;printfn&#x2F;fend).

I got through the first 2 chapters. It was extremely rewarding. But regrettably, I abandoned it for other side projects.I picked it up again 3 months ago, and it’s been a blast. I’m on chapter 8, having completed the logic gates, ALU, CPU, assembler, and half of the virtual machine.Every chapter is overwhelming — in a good way. I keep thinking to myself, “how the hell is this going to work?” And when it does, it’s so satisfying.As a side project, purely for educational purposes, it’s the most rewarding thing I’ve done. I’ve learned so much. It’s a damn good project. And I’m damn proud of myself for sticking with it.Highly recommended. reply wintogreen74 14 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve done this too, and it also took me multiple (3!) tries to get through the entire thing. I interleaved it last fall&#x2F;winter with Ben Eater&#x27;s amazing series on building an 8-bit computer on breadboards. I bought everything over several months from China, then built the subsystems as the parts arrived over the winter. You should do that next! Aside from being (maybe even more) rewarding, it looks damn impressive to see all the flashing LEDs and understand what&#x27;s happening. reply sunday_serif 11 hours agorootparentYes! Ben eater’s content accompanies nand to Tetris so well.I did the 6502 project in which you assemble a computer system on bread boards (wiring together the clock, cpu, ram, etc).It helped solidify many of the concepts from nand2tetris. For some reason doing it all physically with real chips and wires made it all a bit more memorable.I’d love to try his other bread board project in which you assemble all the inner workings of a cpu on bread boards as well — I think this is what you were referring to. reply nvy 11 hours agorootparent>It helped solidify many of the concepts from nand2tetris. For some reason doing it all physically with real chips and wires made it all a bit more memorable.Hang on a second, does nand2tetris not involve real chips and wires? reply sircastor 11 hours agorootparentNo, nand2tetris is done in virtual environments.This is largely about accessibility. If it’s tied to hardware, fewer people can do it. Additionally, real hardware means there’s additional opportunity for error due to faults in the hardware or environmental variables.That said, Nand2Tetris could, in theory, be done with a bunch of 74xx NAND chips on a breadboard. reply apricot 7 hours agorootparentThe Nand2Tetris computer is a bad fit for 74xx chips and breadboards. It&#x27;s 16 bit, for one thing, which implies a lot of chips and a lot of wires on a lot of breadboards, and the usual current problems that come with that. Better have a good source and an oscilloscope nearby. Also, the virtual design sweeps a lot of important timing issues under the rug, so you need some EE chops to translate it correctly to real hardware.I know of a few people who managed to get a working Nand2Tetris computer on breadboards, but it took a lot more time and money than they thought it would.On FPGA, though, it works nicely. reply meter 12 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the recommendation.

This books&#x2F;course doesn&#x27;t cover physics. It doesn&#x27;t even cover signal stuff, like stuff about how fast the voltage levels stabilize, or even voltages at all.It&#x27;s not \"silicon wafer to Tetris\" or \"pile of protons and neutrons to Tetris\" or \"transistors to Tetris\".

Was working on my master&#x27;s in an interdisciplinary CS&#x2F;MIS&#x2F;CompEng program for Cybersecurity and needed an elective. \"Fundamentals of Computer Architecture\" sounded kinda cool.I walk in on the first day not realizing that while I had done my undergrad in MIS (fun fact: this is a business degree), literally every person in the course was either on the last semester of their undergrad in CompEng or were grad students that already had a BS in CompEng (this school combined some undergrad&#x2F;grad lectures).Suddenly i hear the teacher say like \"grad students will also need to use an HDL and design a processor compatible with the basic MIPS instruction set.\" I started at \"what&#x27;s HDL mean?\" Teacher responds \"If that&#x27;s a real question then it means: Hurry and Drop this Lecture.\" Day 1 and I already have the wrong questions for the wrong reasons.That was a really bad 3.5 months...

The behavior of a FET is fairly easy to explain, especially if you don&#x27;t care about the ohmic region (which you usually don&#x27;t in logic ICs), and it&#x27;s straightforward to step from there to a practical implementation of a simple gate like an unbuffered NAND -- the latter of which can be trivially assembled on a breadboard with as little as two FETs and a resistor for a NMOS implementation. reply kragen 4 hours agorootparent> especially if you don&#x27;t care about the ohmic region (which you usually don&#x27;t in logic ICs),you have to care about the ohmic region to be confident you&#x27;ve safely steered clear of it; at least one fet moves through the ohmic region every time a mos gate&#x27;s output transitionsrtl is the bipolar equivalent of nmos (see the analog simulation at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;ylnljbgz) but you do need base resistors if you&#x27;re going to try to drive its inputs with voltage sources instead of the outputs of other rtl gates. but you can omit them when the inputs are connected to rtl outputs http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;ywja8z28the flip side of that is that, though you need a base resistor to provide a constant logic high to an rtl gate, you can provide a low just by leaving the input open, you don&#x27;t even need a wire like you do for nmosbipolar logic is also a lot harder for students to blow up if your lab power supply has a current limit on its output reply throwaway3090 9 hours agorootparentprevSome older parts are specifically made to make creating complex PCB-level CMOS gates easy. i.e. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti.com&#x2F;lit&#x2F;ds&#x2F;symlink&#x2F;cd4007ub.pdf reply throwaway3090 9 hours agorootparentprevI think pretty much every sophomore level microelectronics book starts at basic semiconductor physics, works that into pn junctions, then transistors, then amplifiers, then gates and sequential elements.A typical choice is Sedra & Smith https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learninglink.oup.com&#x2F;access&#x2F;sedra8eBut there is no shortage of choices. reply kragen 2 hours agorootparentsedra & smith is widely considered an excellent recommendation, but on skimming it, it seems that it does not cover solid-state physics at all or even mention any quantum effects; madou does spend a few chapters on solid-state physics, and of course feynman covers elementary quantum mechanics quite comprehensively. sedra & smith does go into a lot more depth on some aspects of chip design than horowitz & hill or even camenzind. it gives the ebers–moll equation in table 6.2, just not by name, and describes the inner workings of transistors in considerably more detail than the other bookshorowitz & hill, camenzind, and feynman are much better written than sedra & smith or madou. the quality of the writing in sedra & smith in particular is quite poor; it contradicts itself every few pages, and often says things that require great effort to interpret as a correct statement, at least in the 7th edition i&#x27;m looking athorowitz & hill also have much nicer schematics than sedra & smith or, especially, camenzind reply superfunny 17 hours agoparentprevWe did the whole project as part of a class; it was one of the best classes I took in my CompSci program.

It is also incredibly fun to appreciate how magical it is that these complicated machines we use are just built from these simple circuits that you keep building up and building up through the course. Finally, the teachers did a fantastic job of simplifying what could be multiple semesters worth of material to quickly give you the gist of things like assembly languages, without oversimplifying.Really can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you have the time to do it. FWIW, the first part of the course (from NAND gates to building a CPU) is very fun and fairly easy.

Each part consists of six chapters and six projects and begins with a newly written introduction that sets the stage for the part’s chapters. Importantly, the two parts are independent of each other. Thus, the new book structure lends itself well to quarter-long as well as semester-long courses.In addition to the two new introduction chapters, the second edition features four new appendices. Following the requests of many learners, these new appendices give focused presentations of various technical topics that, in the first edition, were scattered across the chapters. Another new appendix provides a formal proof that any Boolean function can be built from Nand operators, adding a theoretical perspective to the applied hardware construction projects. Many new sections, figures, and examples were added.All the chapters and project materials were rewritten with an emphasis on separating abstraction from implementation—a major theme in Nand to Tetris. We took special care to add examples and sections that address the thousands of questions that were posted over the years in Nand to Tetris Q&A forums.\" reply brailsafe 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d recommend watching the course material and reading each chapter.

Seeing the code he wrote re-written using these to be so much more elegant was very satisfying. reply jameshart 8 hours agorootparentFor me the &#x27;aha&#x27; moment was the microcode section of the 8-bit computer project. Just the physical understanding of how it can take a different number of clock cycles to execute an &#x27;instruction&#x27; - and how (in this architecture) every instruction cycle has to start with the memory address switching to the current program counter, and the data from that address being loaded into a register.I haven&#x27;t gone as far as actually building a breadboard CPU, but I was able to apply what Ben teaches to build several functional microprocessors in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.falstad.com&#x2F;circuit&#x2F;circuitjs.html, starting with basically reimplementing the breadboard model he built out.. but then after watching the 6502 series, going back and being able to see and even implement some of the things that implies about the internals of a 6502 processor. reply JKCalhoun 16 hours agoparentprevDid Ben Eaters 6502 computer this past summer.

Turing complete has a more non-linear arcade mode. I mean that you can choose which level you want to complete first.There is also soundtrack and a little bit of story line present. There is also gog version of this game.I feel that I learned almost no new skills this semester, but I remember asking my circuit design lecturer questions about this game (in particular, about the possibility of constructing full-adder with fewer elements). That was funYou can stick to nandgame, if you don&#x27;t want to pay, you loose almost nothing, but playing Turing Complete is more handy because it keeps progress on your computer and&#x2F;or on the steam account. So, if you clean cookies every time you restart your browser, when using ungoogled-chromium for example, you better play Turing complete.Also one internet friend advised me to play incredible pm https:&#x2F;&#x2F;incredible.pm&#x2F;It is a similar game, but the main theme is proofs rather than digital circuits. Hasn&#x27;t played yet, unfortunately. reply geoelectric 12 hours agorootparentprevTuring Complete is a great game. Finishing it was a major sense of accomplishment for me, particularly since I rarely complete games (though Zachlikes are a common exception).This is from my Steam review (one of two ever, I liked it so much):> Man, what a trip. I’ve played the NAND game and MRHD, among others, but never quite got to the “build a computer” endgame. I did with this one. At this point I’ve built a 256-byte RAM system that does six math instructions, six conditional jumps, and subroutine calls using its own stack—then developed my own assembly language for it which I&#x27;m now using in the endgame to solve more traditional programming puzzles.> And I designed and built the entire architecture for it myself. The initial levels are mostly \"one solution only\" problems that each results in you designing a component. But by the time you&#x27;re at midgame, all the decisions are yours as long as the output is correct. Previous problems tend to hint towards partial solutions of later problems, but very little is given to you outright. That gives you an incredible sense of accomplishment for what you put together.That said, unless they improved the bit where wiring tends to merge together and virtually short out during edits, it can be a little frustrating once things get very complex. It&#x27;s not enough for me to not recommend it, but there was a point where I felt like I was having to master the tricky interface quirks as much or more than the logic.

I&#x27;ve been playing it off and on over the last few weeks, just finished the first working CPU. It includes small hints and solutions for most levels, so if you get stuck, you&#x27;ll always have a way forward. The interesting thing is, for a lot of levels, you can just google the component you&#x27;re trying to build and use actual logic diagrams as guidance.The game makes the whole topic a bit easier to grok with its visuals and the ability to step through your circuits when they&#x27;re running. So, great fun. But beware, if you&#x27;ve been bitten by Factorio addiction, you might be in danger of missing a lot of sleep :)Also, as some other comments mentioned, I highly recommend the Zachtronics games. Exapunks is amazing. But they&#x27;re quite different, they&#x27;re more like puzzle games about programming. reply SilasX 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve completed both nand2tetris and Turing Complete. A note about differences:- TC only goes up to the level of writing programs in assembly, while nand2tetris has you build layers of abstraction on top of that so you can program in a Java-like language. In fact, TC doesn&#x27;t give you \"assembly code\" at all, you just implement binary instructions, and they leave it to you to decide your own mnemonics for each byte of the 4-byte instructions (on the second computer you implement).- TC lets you make more of the decisions yourself regarding architecture, like how to address memory.One thing I didn&#x27;t like about TC is that, when doing the projects to build the (second) computer, it doesn&#x27;t regression test. When you implement new opcodes, you can be credited for completing the level, even though you broke the previous ones you implemented, and you might not realize it until several projects later, when your computer doesn&#x27;t work. reply Night_Thastus 16 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a bit different, but I also recommend both TIS-100 and Shenzhen IO.

I was at coffee with my girlfriend saying I&#x27;d read you could make all the logic gates using only NANDs, so we got curious and wrote NAND on a bunch of napkins to see if we could figure them all out.We did and it was great fun. For each gate we figured it with NANDs we would write the name of the new gate on a napkin.We took the napkins and the joy of it home and sheet a few days we started combining those gates up as well, trying to eventually figure out an entire ALU. And so along came multiplexors and a bunch of other fascinating stuff.Eventually we got stumped, but I&#x27;d heard about this book and we decided to order it. The rest of the chapters really did help us get an understanding of the low level that had always been mysterious to me as someone with software experience only.Can&#x27;t say I ever did make it all the way through in terms of building around, though. Once it got more into the low software levels I felt I already had enough of an understanding that the work didn&#x27;t seem so appealing, but the read was still fantastic. reply yoyohello13 17 hours agoprevI took this course on a lark when I was working as a data analyst.

Have you built an optimizing compiler that creates binaries from a [relatively] high-level language such as C? Or you have just created an assembly for a specific architecture? reply CatchSwitch 7 hours agorootparentIt mimics Java, so your compiler compiles to a bytecode IR. The compiler as described by the book is a bare-bones recursive descent compiler that doesn&#x27;t do any AST analysis. The compiler is for a toy language called Jack (fake Java) that was intentionally designed to be easy to write a compiler for. L(1) grammar I believe. They don&#x27;t really talk about error handling or more complex compiler topics. No optimization methods are covered.N2Tetris is like doing the 20% to get the 80% of every layer of abstraction. It really scopes down each project so you can cover every layer between logic gates and a high level language with built in OS APIs. I think it&#x27;s a fantastic course but if you&#x27;re looking to learn specifically about compilers I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;ll meet your needs. reply rmshin 12 hours agorootparentprevWithout too much experience in writing compilers beyond this course, I&#x27;d say that the course focuses on grounding your conceptual&#x2F;intuitive knowledge of how compilers work rather than any serious exposition into modern-day production-grade compilers.You write the assembler for the course&#x27;s own hardware architecture called Hack, then a compiler backend that converts a stack-based VM intermediate representation (IR) to assembly, and finally a compiler frontend that does syntax analysis and code generation to translate the book&#x27;s high-level language Jack to the IR. reply skripp 16 hours agoprevI highly recommend you play the game “Turing complete” alongside this course. Will give you an additional visual way of looking at the problems. reply cushychicken 16 hours agoprevDoes this still use a custom hardware description language?The curriculum here is very solid - my only critique is that it uses a custom HDL instead of Verilog, VHDL, or SystemVerilog.It wouldn’t have been a huge stretch to do that, and make the skills taught that much more real as a result. Without the practical aspect of exposure to real HDLs, it seems more like a toy than a tool. reply bmitc 11 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything to be gained by switching to VHDL or Verilog. Their custom HDL is a fine HDL for the uses of the course. There&#x27;s so much commonality that they&#x27;re effectively interchangeable syntactically. If the idea was to use VHDL or Verilog such that one could actually make the CPU on silicon or an FPGA, then that opens up a whole can of worms that is well beyond the scope of the course. I do think it would be awesome if they had a sequel that did this, but I think it doesn&#x27;t make sense in the context of the existing course. reply sweetjuly 11 hours agoparentprevThis was my experience with the course as well. It was fun but not useful.Learning Verilog later really opened the world of digital design for me and has let me build actually useful things. It&#x27;s probably a non-goal though for this coarse to turn people into digital designers, this seems more aimed at people with a passing interest in HW as opposed to those who really want to go deep. reply warkanlock 15 hours agoparentprevKnowing Verilog, I must disagree. Although it would be more beneficial if the book focused on hardware, its primary goal is to teach something other than hardware-specific definitions. HDL serves as a bridge to illustrate communication with predefined logic gates.The book should include a mention or an appendix to clarify its real-world applications. By the end of chapter five, I was dissatisfied, feeling a lack of control over the crucial aspects of the hardware I just built. However, a book can only do justice to some of the missing pieces of information we have. reply brailsafe 11 hours agorootparentI found Chapter 5 to be quite challenging, largely because it took a while to understand the combinatorial way in which any of the chip parts would get new inputs and so on, especially coming from a traditional sequential programming background.What specifically did you feel like you were lacking from the language? reply cubefox 14 hours agoprevI wish there was something like that for computability theory.Presumably for historical reasons, professors of theoretical computer science love to talk about abstract machines like finite-state machines, pushdown automata, Turing machines etc. Not about logical circuits.But arguably, logical gates are much more conceptually primitive than most of those automata above! They are basically an implementation of propositional logic, albeit potentially with a dimension of time and delay. And they are nonetheless somewhat close to how actual computers work. So why do they ignore them as a model of computation?My guess is that they don&#x27;t talk about them because they only awkwardly harmonize with the classical models of computation: FSMs, TMs and the like, and the neat hierarchy of computability they place them (what languages in the Chomsky hierarchy they recognize).For example, Turing machines have two kinds of states: Objects called \"states\", and the states of the tape cells. The former are finite and the latter are infinite. Pushdown automata make a similar distinction into two types of states. Logical circuits, on the other hand, don&#x27;t distinguish two different kinds of states in such a way. It&#x27;s all just circuits.The classical abstract machines have other problems as well: Arguably, among abstract machines, a real CPU is most similar to a universal Turing machine, because it can execute arbitrary programs. But according to the theory of computation, CPUs are merely equivalent to finite-state machines! Because they lack an equivalent of an infinite tape. Infinity is a strange detail to emphasize here, as logical circuits are merely \"potentially infinite\" in the same way finite-state machines are merely potentially infinite. But that doesn&#x27;t make them similar to each other. The relevant difference seems to be that circuits with delay allow for \"memory\" (like flip-flops), while finite-state automata don&#x27;t.I would like to see a course or book on theoretical computer science that tackles this issue: \"From NAND to Turing Machines\". reply aleph_minus_one 12 hours agoparent> But arguably, logical gates are much more conceptually primitive than most of those automata above! They are basically an implementation of propositional logic, albeit potentially with a dimension of time and delay. And they are nonetheless somewhat close to how actual computers work. So why do they ignore them as a model of computation?Simple: logic circuits for propositional logic are not Turing-complete, and in a lecture about theoretical computer science one wants to teach such more sophisticated, mathematical models of computation.On the other hand, in basically every beginner lecture about computer engineering (in German: \"technische Informatik\"), they will teach you how how the transition function of a finite-state machine can be implemented via combinational logic (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Combinational_logic), which can be transformed into logic gates for implementing a Mealy machine (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mealy_machine) or Moore machine (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Moore_machine) in hardware. reply cubefox 11 hours agorootparent> Simple: logic circuits for propositional logic are not Turing-complete, and in a lecture about theoretical computer science one wants to teach such more sophisticated, mathematical models of computation.Logical circuits with delay (sequential [1] rather than combinational logic) are indeed not Turing complete -- but in the same uninteresting sense that a CPU is not Turing complete: In a conceptually irrelevant way. As I argued, Turing machines are precisely not \"much more sophisticated\" than CPUs or the circuits they are made out of. Turing machines merely have infinite rather than potentially infinite memory.You could modify the concept of a Turing machine such that its tape is potentially rather than actually infinite, and it would change nothing of substance. Yet this machine would suddenly only be considered equivalent to a finite-state machine.Apart from that, a perhaps theoretically interesting point about combinational logic (circuits without time&#x2F;delay) and finite state machines would be that combinational logic is apparently computationally weaker than finite-state machines. Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t say anything about that explicitly, but the \"classes of automata\" image [2] they include in the article does suggest it. But that, assuming it&#x27;s true, should be taught in theoretical computer science class, not in computer engineering (if the latter mentions it at all).But, much more importantly, they -- the theoretical computer science professors, not the engineering guys -- should explain the theoretical relation between circuits with delay (sequential logic) and various automata, including Turing machines.The likely fact is that they ignore circuits because they don&#x27;t fit well into their supposedly neat picture of abstract machines. In fact, they call their reliance on infinity as an important difference between models of computation in question.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sequential_logic[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Automata_theory.svg reply kragen 14 hours agoparentprevas you say, the chomsky hierarchy is surely an influence, but i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the main thingi think it&#x27;s probably because a turing machine can do universal computation and can be described completely in a couple of paragraphs, while you need at least several hundred logic gates to describe something that can do universal computation (if you give it infinite memory), and then you still don&#x27;t have a convincing argument that what it does is universal in any interesting senseuntil you bring in turing machines, anywayyou can write a turing machine in about one line of c; the description of a computer in terms of nands doesn&#x27;t give you that reply cubefox 13 hours agorootparentThat seems to be a somewhat strange comparison. Logical circuits are arguably not much more complex than finite-state machines, and theoretical computer science professors don&#x27;t have an aversion to those. So it doesn&#x27;t seem like they find logical circuits too primitive. They even seem to strive for primitivity, as Turing machines are much more conceptually primitive than things like register machines or actual CPUs.Moreover, a logical circuit itself is actually easier to describe than a Turing machine. Both logical circuits with delay and Turing machines can do \"universal computation\" for any reasonable sense of the term (demanding an infinite element is arguably not reasonable).And to give a \"convincing argument\" that they are universal is quite difficult even for Turing machines. What would such an argument even be? In practice, it&#x27;s more the fact that there are no known counterexamples which causes us to believe in the Church-Turing thesis (that any problem that we would intuitively consider \"computable\" is also computable with a Turing machine or logical circuit, and vice versa), rather than any one (positive) \"convincing argument\". reply kragen 4 hours agorootparenta nand gate is not too primitive, of course, but building an actual cpu out of nand gates involves several hundred of them, and that circuit is harder to describe than a universal turing machineturing&#x27;s original paper gave a convincing argument that turing machines were universal; he said that they could do anything a mathematician could do, since the mathematician can only hold a finite number of symbols from a finite set in his memory at once, and can only fit a finite set of symbols from a finite set on a page in his field of view. so the squares on the turing-machine tape were originally pages in a notebookit seems like you would benefit more from exposing yourself to things you find strange; you could start by reading turing&#x27;s strange paper https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.virginia.edu&#x2F;~robins&#x2F;Turing_Paper_1936.pdfstrangeness doesn&#x27;t guarantee insightfulness, but it&#x27;s a necessary precondition to it; if you continue to dismiss all strange arguments you will dismiss everything from which you could possibly learn anything, preserving your ignorance like a precious jewel reply nickpsecurity 11 hours agorootparentprevYou might get more mileage out of Abstract, State Machines.

That&#x27;s not a productive or healthy way to look at things imo—though it might seem like it if you&#x27;re relatively knew—but if your prospects are good right now, then this won&#x27;t help you necessarily keep your current job or get another one. It will help you reason about code, logic, and computers in a way you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise, but you&#x27;ll have a hard time if you&#x27;re not enthusiastic about learning for the novelty of it, because it will eventually be quite challenging and you&#x27;ll need to allocate significant amounts of time.I say that it&#x27;s not a productive way to look at it, because intensity and longevity of singular professional focus only lasts as long as your intellectual and physical infrastructure around it, which means doing things that are somewhere between a short and long distance away from your core subject; sleeping, learning fundamentals, algorithms, design, hiking etc..

    "originBody": "Home » Blog » How Big is YouTube? How Big is YouTube? December 22, 2023 1 Comment How big is YouTube? I got interested in this question a few years ago, when I started writing about the “denominator problem”. A great deal of social media research focuses on finding unwanted behavior – mis/disinformation, hate speech – on platforms. This isn’t that hard to do: search for “white genocide” or “ivermectin” and count the results. Indeed, a lot of eye-catching research does just this – consider Avaaz’s August 2020 report about COVID misinformation. It reports 3.8 billion views of COVID misinfo in a year, which is a very big number. But it’s a numerator without a denominator – Facebook generates dozens or hundreds of views a day for each of its 3 billion users – 3.8 billion views is actually a very small number, contextualized with a denominator. A few social media platforms have made it possible to calculate denominators. Reddit, for many years, permitted Pushshift to collect all Reddit posts, which means we can calculate what a small fraction of Reddit is focused on meme stocks or crypto, versus conversations about mental health or board gaming. Our Redditmap.social platform – primarily built by Virginia Partridge and Jasmine Mangat – is based around the idea of looking at the platform as a whole and understanding how big or small each community is compared to the whole. Alas, Reddit cut off public access to Pushshift this summer, so Redditmap.social can only use data generated early this year. Twitter was also a good platform for studying denominators, because it created a research API that took a statistical sample of all tweets and gave researchers access to every 10th or 100th one. If you found 2500 tweets about ivermectin a day, and saw 100m tweets through the decahose (which gave researchers 1/10th of tweet volume), you could calculate an accurate denominator (100m x 10) (All these numbers are completely made up.) Twitter has cut off access to these excellent academic APIs and now charges massive amounts of money for much less access, which means that it’s no longer possible for most researchers to do denominator-based work. Interesting as Reddit and Twitter are, they are much less widely used than YouTube, which is used by virtually all internet users. Pew reports that 93% of teens use YouTube – the closest service in terms of usage is Tiktok with 63% and Snapchat with 60%. While YouTube has a good, well-documented API, there’s no good way to get a random, representative sample of YouTube. Instead, most research on YouTube either studies a collection of videos (all videos on the channels of a selected set of users) or videos discovered via recommendation (start with Never Going to Give You Up, objectively the center of the internet, and collect recommended videos.) You can do excellent research with either method, but you won’t get a sample of all YouTube videos and you won’t be able to calculate the size of YouTube. I brought this problem to Jason Baumgartner, creator of PushShift, and prince of the dark arts of data collection. One of Jason’s skills is a deep knowledge of undocumented APIs, ways of collecting data outside of official means. Most platforms have one or more undocumented APIs, widely used by programmers for that platform to build internal tools. In the case of YouTube, that API is called “Inner Tube” and its existence is an open secret in programmer communities. Using InnerTube, Jason suggested we do something that’s both really smart and really stupid: guess at random URLs and see if there are videos there. Here’s how this works: YouTube URLs look like this: https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=vXPJVwwEmiM That bit after “watch?v=” is an 11 digit string. The first ten digits can be a-z,A-Z,0-9 and _-. The last digit is special, and can only be one of 16 values. Turns out there are 2^64 possible YouTube addresses, an enormous number: 18.4 quintillion. There are lots of YouTube videos, but not that many. Let’s guess for a moment that there are 1 billion YouTube videos – if you picked URLs at random, you’d only get a valid address roughly once every 18.4 billion tries. We refer to this method as “drunk dialing”, as it’s basically as sophisticated as taking swigs from a bottle of bourbon and mashing digits on a telephone, hoping to find a human being to speak to. Jason found a couple of cheats that makes the method roughly 32,000 times as efficient, meaning our “phone call” connects lots more often. Kevin Zheng wrote a whole bunch of scripts to do the dialing, and over the course of several months, we collected more than 10,000 truly random YouTube videos. There’s lots you can do once you’ve got those videos. Ryan McCarthy is lead author on our paper in the Journal of Quantitative Description, and he led the process of watching a thousand of these videos and hand-coding them, a massive and fascinating task. Kevin wired together his retrieval scripts with a variety of language detection systems, and we now have a defensible – if far from perfect – estimate of what languages are represented on YouTube. We’re starting some experiments to understand how the videos YouTube recommends differ from the “average” YouTube video – YouTube likes recommending videos with at least ten thousand views, while the median YouTube video has 39 views. I’ll write at some length in the future about what we can learn from a true random sample of YouTube videos. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the idea of “the quotidian web”, learning from the bottom half of the long tail of user-generated media so we can understand what most creators are doing with these tools, not just from the most successful influencers. But I’m going to limit myself to the question that started this blog post: how big is YouTube? Consider drunk dialing again. Let’s assume you only dial numbers in the 413 area code: 413-000-0000 through 413-999-9999. That’s 10,000,000 possible numbers. If one in 100 phone calls connect, you can estimate that 100,000 people have numbers in the 413 area code. In our case, our drunk dials tried roughly 32k numbers at the same time, and we got a “hit” every 50,000 times or so. Our current estimate for the size of YouTube is 13.325 billion videos – we are now updating this number every few weeks at tubestats.org. Once you’re collecting these random videos, other statistics are easy to calculate. We can look at how old our random videos are and calculate how fast YouTube is growing: we estimate that over 4 billion videos were posted to YouTube just in 2023. We can calculate the mean and median views per video, and show just how long the “long tail” is – videos with 10,000 or more videos are roughly 4% of our data set, though they represent the lion’s share of views of the YouTube platform. Perhaps the most important thing we did with our set of random videos is to demonstrate a vastly better way of studying YouTube than drunk dialing. We know our method is random because it iterates through the entire possible address space. By comparing our results to other ways of generating lists of YouTube videos, we can declare them “plausibly random” if they generate similar results. Fortunately, one method does – it was discovered by Jia Zhou et. al. in 2011, and it’s far more efficient than our naïve method. (You generate a five character string where one character is a dash – YouTube will autocomplete those URLs and spit out a matching video if one exists.) Kevin now polls YouTube using the “dash method” and uses the results to maintain our dashboard at Tubestats. We have lots more research coming out from this data set, both about what we’re discovering and about some complex ethical questions about how to handle this data. (Most of the videos we’re discovering were only seen by a few dozen people. If we publish those URLs, we run the risk of exposing to public scrutiny videos that are “public” but whose authors could reasonably expect obscurity. Thus our paper does not include the list of videos discovered.) Ryan has a great introduction to main takeaways from our hand-coding. He and I are both working on longer writing about the weird world of random videos – what can we learn from spending time deep in the long tail? Perhaps most importantly, we plan to maintain Tubestats so long as we can. It’s possible that YouTube will object to the existence of this resource or the methods we used to create it. Counterpoint: I believe that high level data like this should be published regularly for all large user-generated media platforms. These platforms are some of the most important parts of our digital public sphere, and we need far more information about what’s on them, who creates this content and who it reaches. Many thanks to the Journal for Quantitative Description of publishing such a large and unwieldy paper – it’s 85 pages! Thanks and congratulations to all authors: Ryan McGrady, Kevin Zheng, Rebecca Curran, Jason Baumgartner and myself. And thank you to everyone who’s funded our work: the Knight Foundation has been supporting a wide range of our work on studying extreme speech on social media, and other work in our lab is supported by the Ford Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. Finally – I’ve got COVID, so if this post is less coherent than normal, that’s to be expected. Feel free to use the comments to tell me what didn’t make sense and I will try to clear it up when my brain is less foggy. 1 thought on “How Big is YouTube?” BigJymn December 22, 2023 at 3:50 pm NOT big enough; that it can’t be wiped away from the surface earth; with a relatively cyber attack from the Alliance. In fact; Google/YouTube will just be one; of 63 communist controlled platforms; that will be completely erased from existence once the order is given.

Back when I was at Pew we tried to map YouTube using random walks through the API&#x27;s \"related videos\" endpoint and it seemed like we hit a saturation point after a year, but the magnitude described here suggests there&#x27;s a quite a long tail that flies under the radar. Google started locking down the API almost immediately after we published our study, I&#x27;m glad to see folks still pursuing research with good old-fashioned scraping.

Catching 100 fish would be analogous to \"sample 100 YouTube videos at random\", but they don&#x27;t have a direct method of doing so. Instead, they&#x27;re guessing possible YouTube video links at random and seeing how many resolve to videos.In the \"100 fish\" example, the formula for approximating the total number of fish is: total ~= caught &#x2F; tagged (where caught=100 in the example)In their YouTube sampling method, the formula for approximating the total number of videos is: total ~= (valid &#x2F; tried) * 2^64Notice that this is flipped: in the fish example the main measurement is \"tagged\" (the number of fish that were tagged the second time you caught them), which is in the denominator.

If there are 20 videos they will have IDs 0 to 19. If you draw 500 independent random numbers between 0 and 999, each number will have 2% probability of being in the range 0 to 19. So on average you will find that 2% of your 500 attempts find an existing video. From that you conclude that 2% of the whole space of 1000 IDs are assigned.

I&#x27;ve used the stats to roughly calculate that the average video is 500 seconds long. Then using a bitrate of 400 KB&#x2F;s and 13 billion videos, that gives us 2.7 exabytes.I got 400KB&#x2F;s from some FHD 24-30 fps videos I downloaded, but this is very approximate. YouTube will encode sections containing less perceptible information with less bitrate, and of course, videos come in all kinds of different resolutions and frame rates, with the distribution changing over the history of the site. If we assume every video is 4K with a bitrate of 1.5MB&#x2F;s, that&#x27;s 10 exabytes.This estimate is low for the amount of storage YouTube needs, since it would store popular videos in multiple datacenters, in both VP9 and AV1. It&#x27;s possible YouTube compresses unpopular videos or transcodes them on-demand from some other format, which would make this estimate high, but I doubt it. reply ksec 5 hours agoparentThat storage number is highly likely to be off by an order of magnitude.400KB&#x2F;s, or 3.2Mbps as we would commonly use in video encoding, is quite low for original quality upload in FHD or commonly known as 1080p.

To further increase search efficiency, randomly generated identifiers can take advantage of case insensitivity in YouTube’s search engine. A search for either \"DQW4W9WGXCQ” or “dqw4w9wgxcq” will return an extant video with the ID “dQw4w9WgXcQ”. In effect, YouTube will search for every upper- and lowercase permutation of the search query, returning all matches. Each alphabetical character in positions 1 to 10 increases search efficiency by a factor of 2. Video identifiers with only alphabetical characters in positions 1 to 10 (valid characters for position 11 do not benefit from case-insensitivity) will maximize search efficiency, increasing search efficiency by a factor of 1024. By constructing search queries with 32 randomly generated alphabetical identifiers, each search can effectively search 32,768 valid video identifiers.They also mention some caveats to this method, namely, that it only includes publicly listed videos:> As our method uses YouTube search, our random set only includes public videos. While an alternative brute force method, involving entering video IDs directly without the case sensitivity shortcut that requires the search engine, would include unlisted videos, too, it still would not include private videos. If our method did include unlisted videos, we would have omitted them for ethical reasons anyway to respect users’ privacy through obscurity (Selinger & Hartzog, 2018). In addition to this limitation, there are considerations inherent in our use of the case insensitivity shortcut, which trusts the YouTube search engine to provide all matching results, and which oversamples IDs with letters, rather than numbers or symbols, in their first ten characters. We do not believe these factors meaningfully affect the quality of our data, and as noted above a more direct “brute force” method - even for the purpose of generating a purely random sample to compare to our sample - would not be computationally realistic.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journalqd.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;view&#x2F;4066 reply stravant 1 hour agoparentprevThe data probably wouldn&#x27;t look so clean if it were skewed.

So let&#x27;s say that possible range of values is true (10 characters of specific range + 1). That would represent one big circle of possible area where videos might be.2. Distribution of identifiers (valid videos) is everything. If Youtube did some contraints (or skewing) to IDs, that we don&#x27;t know about, then actual existing video IDs might be a small(er) circle within that bigger circle of possibilities and not equally dispersed throughout, or there mught be clumping or whatever... So you&#x27;d need to sample the space by throwing darts in a way to get a silhouette of their skew or to see if it&#x27;s random-ish, by I don&#x27;t know let&#x27;s say Poisson distribution.Only then one could estimate the size.

It would just reduce the fraction of the total address space that YouTube can use. This is a well-known property of \"impure\" names, and it means there is a good chance that the IDs have no structure. In other words, the video IDs would be \"pure\" names. reply treesciencebot 7 hours agorootparentIs 32,000 a good enough number to estimate the entirety of the Youtube’s video space?

    "originBody": "Security Is Broken by Zuki HOME CATEGORIES TAGS TIMELINE ABOUT Home Don't Believe Your Eyes - A WhatsApp Clickjacking Vulnerability Post Cancel Don't Believe Your Eyes - A WhatsApp Clickjacking Vulnerability Posted Oct 29, 2023 By Zuki (Itay Zukerman) 6 min read Imagine you have received a WhatsApp message with a link to ln.instagram.com. Where do you think the link leads? Instagram? Think again. I have found a clickjacking vulnerability in WhatsApp that enables phishing attacks. An attacker can send anyone a crafted message with a link that appears to lead to a legitimate website, but in fact leads to any website of the attacker’s choice. Discovery Process I started my research looking for a way to make a message recipient perform an HTTP request. My initial thought was to check WA’s link preview feature. I hoped the the link would be rendered twice, once by the sender and once by the receiver. In order to check my theory, I created a webhook and sent it to a friend. Sadly only one request was made, only by me. That got me thinking. If the receiver does not render the link for themselves, that must mean I send both the link and the preview. If so, I wonder if I can send a link to one site with a preview of another? Issue #1 - Link Preview Mismatch I decided to take a look into what data is sent in a WA message that contains a link with a preview. My goal was to intercept the message, change the link and the preview to mismatch, and send it. I decided to intercept a message via WA web, as hopefully that would be a faster setup than debugging an emulator. I then ran into a problem - WA uses and E2EE so I couldn’t simply modify the message with proxy like Burp Suite. Instead of understanding the encryption mechanism, I decided insert a breakpoint a moment before the message was encrypted and sent through the websocket. WA web’s javascript was uglified and minified, however after a while of searching I found the right place. Exactly as I suspected, the link and the preview were sent separately! I created a message object forinstagram.com and changed the text property to google.com. Unfortunately, the message that was sent did not have a preview anymore. Only a link to Google. Blackbox testing taught me that: Property Purpose text The text of the message canonicalURL The domain that is shown at the bottom of the preview matchedText Seems to be compared against canonicalURL, also tested that its value apears in text I discovered that if the matchedText was deleted from the object, I could create a mismatch! Success! I have created a message with a preview to one site, and when clicked, leads to another. This was a great start, but I didn’t want the real link to be shown in the message. I was looking for ways to hide the message text. Issue #2 - Disguising Links (2K2E) I remembered that some unicode characters can change the representation of text, so I tried fuzzing characters to see their effect: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 function fuzz(start, end) {for (let i = start; i <= end ; i++) { j = i.toString(16) if (j.length < 4) { j = \"0\".repeat(4 -j.length) + j} msg += eval(\"\\\"\\\\u\"+j+\"\\\"\")+ \"https://google.com/\" + i.toString(16)+ \"\"} } I observed the results and one result caught my eye. One of the lines (202e) was in reverse: Apparently, the unicode character U+202E (Right-To-Left Override) alters the way that text is presented to the user by displaying it in reverse order. That was a great start but this link looks horrible. Nobody would click it. Crafting A Mirror URL I wanted to create a URL that, when reversed, looked like https://instagram.com. This means that the link should be moc.margatsni//:sttph (\\u202e+moc.margatsni//:sttph = https://instagram.com ) This fist problem is the TLD. I cannot register a .margatsni domain. My solution was to find a TLD that could look like a subdomain. For example the TLD .nl (Netherlands) would result in ln.instagram.com (ln as in link) Problem number two was that the URL needed to start with https:// in order to look legitimate. My solution to this was to append the string //:sptth (which is a valid path) to the URL, so that https://moc.margatsni.nl//:sttph would appear as https://ln.instagram.com//:sptth With a mirror URL and the U+202E character, an attacker can make any URL look like any other! I call this vulnerability 2K2E Final Result Finally I have a legitimate looking URL that seems like it leads to Instagram, when in fact it leads to my blog Security Is Broken. Attack Scenario Utilizing both these issues can allow attackers to perform phishing attacks where they construct legitimate looking links that lead to malicious websites. The full attack flow: An attacker purchases the mirror domain of the site they would like to impersonate. For example moc.margatsni.nl to impersonate ln.instagram.com The attacker creates a message with a link to original domain in order to use its preview. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 { \"text\": \"https://instagram.com/\", \"matchedText\": \"https://instagram.com/\", \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://instagram.com/\", \"description\": \"Create an account...\", \"title\": \"Instagram\", \"jpegThumbnail\": {}, \"previewType\": 0, \"mediaKey\": {}, \"mediaKeyTimestamp\": 1693302818542, \"thumbnailDirectPath\": \"/v/t62.36...\", \"thumbnailSha256\": {}, \"thumbnailEncSha256\": {}, \"thumbnailHeight\": 1024, \"thumbnailWidth\": 1024, \"inviteLinkGroupTypeV2\": 0 } The attacker then removes the matchedText property and changes the text property to the following value: U+202E + “URL to the mirror domain” + //:sptth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 { \"text\": \"\\u202ehttps://moc.margatsni.nl//:sptth\", \"canonicalUrl\": \"https://instagram.com/\", \"description\": \"Create an account...\", \"title\": \"Instagram\", \"jpegThumbnail\": {}, \"previewType\": 0, \"mediaKey\": {}, \"mediaKeyTimestamp\": 1693302818542, \"thumbnailDirectPath\": \"/v/t62.36...\", \"thumbnailSha256\": {}, \"thumbnailEncSha256\": {}, \"thumbnailHeight\": 1024, \"thumbnailWidth\": 1024, \"inviteLinkGroupTypeV2\": 0 } Finally the attacker sends the crafted message to their victim Meta’s Response Because we support many different platforms and environments, there are a significant number of ways that some platform could choose to normalize a URL differently than our server-side logic does. To address that, we have systems in place which allow us to adjust our URL normalization logic dynamically in the event of real-world spam and abuse. Sadly, Meta has shown no intention to resolve this security issue and from their response it seems that they will try to stop these attacks only if their systems detect them as spam. This means that WhatsApp users can only cross their fingers that they won’t fall victims to 2K2E attacks. Apposed to WhatsApp, other platforms such as X, TikTok, and Pinterest, all have sanitization of the U+202E character. Mitigation Because Meta has no intention of fixing this issue, links on WhatsApp cannot be trusted. In order to not fall victim to a 2K2E phishing attack, before clicking on a link, copy it. The clipboard preview should show the link address while sanitizing the U+202E character. Update I have found other services that do not have proper sanitization and are vulnerable to 2K2E as well.

That can be useful in some cases, but unless the attacker is a police force, intelligence agency, or similar, there would usually need to be some kind of follow-up attack, e.g. exploiting unpatched software on the device.In the interest of technical accuracy, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d label this one \"clickjacking\" specifically. \"Clickjacking\" usually refers to a very specific technique that involves invisible HTML frames overlaid on top of other content.[1][2][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owasp.org&#x2F;www-community&#x2F;attacks&#x2F;Clickjacking [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portswigger.net&#x2F;web-security&#x2F;clickjacking reply Thorrez 11 hours agoparentYeah, I wouldn&#x27;t call this clickjacking, because real clickjacking is a technique the makes a victim perform some account action without knowing it. Simply opening an unintended link isn&#x27;t as bad as that. reply Aachen 10 hours agoprevClickjacking is where you perform a click on some element, but actually the click event is caught by a different element, typically laid transparently above the thing you think you&#x27;re clicking on. The click can be detected by the attacker, despite you not getting the event, by making your visible underlying layer have focus and look for the onblur event to fire.What OP found is cool. I&#x27;ve also used RTL characters to make screensaver files (so just normal executables with a different extension in Windows) that looked like Word documents, I forgot why, maybe to prank a friend or teacher or so. OP has gone one step further and found a way to alter the displaying on another system. I&#x27;m not sure what this is called, though it&#x27;s not clickjacking (the Wikipedia page OP links to in the article lede confirms that) because the user doesn&#x27;t mistake which element they&#x27;re clicking on, they mistake where a link will lead. I&#x27;ve also never seen a clickjacking being abused in practice, but what OP found I can imagine will be abused!Honestly I&#x27;ve long given up on users being able to tell which domain they&#x27;ll end up on when clicking a link. A majority doesn&#x27;t understand the concept anyway, and the remainder can&#x27;t tell. Those who think they can tell (such as yours truly) end up getting frustrated when all links go to sendgrid.tld&#x2F;j3ovi3bfogobbledypoop93jnri2o. We&#x27;re training people to click random tracking obfuscated fishy looking garbage every day and nobody bats an eye at it reply darkwater 20 hours agoprevEveryone fixing on the UTF RTL character but Meta should have at least acknowledged the issue with the preview URL that can be different from the message URL. I understand that this is probably to unfurl shortened URLs, but there has to be some clever workaround that Meta & Whatsapp can implement reply amadeuspagel 19 hours agoparentNo. End-to-end encryption means that the preview has to be generated either by the sender or the receiver. Having the receiver generate the preview would leak his IP. They have to remove the preview feature. reply darkwater 19 hours agorootparentYes, preview is generated by the sender to avoid receiver&#x27;s address leak to a sender-controlled host, but what I&#x27;m saying is that WA should enforce on the receiver side that both point to the same URL. As said initially, they are most certainly doing it this way to unfurl URL shorteners, which would other be the easiest way to phish people. At the same time it&#x27;s also noteworthy that the preview can fail to be generated on the sender side and the message will be send out anyway, so yeah, I agree with you that they could just remove the preview feature. Probably in their opinion the trade-offs are worth, I guess. reply chimeracoder 17 hours agorootparent> Yes, preview is generated by the sender to avoid receiver&#x27;s address leak to a sender-controlled host, but what I&#x27;m saying is that WA should enforce on the receiver side that both point to the same URL.How do you do that without having the receiver make an HTTP request to that address, in order to follow all redirects? reply o11c 17 hours agorootparentThe receiver can do the verification while clicking (which would make the request anyway). reply darkwater 12 hours agorootparentprevExactly, that&#x27;s why I say that they chose the trade-off of easy-to-send shortener over more complicated&#x2F;manually crafted attacks like the one in the article. reply josu 19 hours agorootparentprev> They have to remove the preview feature.They can just disable it for contacts that you don&#x27;t have on your contact list. reply tambourine_man 21 hours agoprevNice hack. The real problem is not WhatsApp or the Unicode reverse character, though, it’s that URLs are hard.Just this simple visa.securesite.com fools a lot of people. And I don’t see a good solution in the near future. reply acdha 21 hours agoparentThis specific example is poor sanitization because it actively misleads the users who try to understand what they’re clicking on.Your example of the generic confusion around host names and domains is a harder problem but people have tried to mitigate it somewhat by doing things like highlighting the domain name portion. Like most phishing techniques, passkeys will end it eventually. reply paulryanrogers 19 hours agorootparent> Like most phishing techniques, passkeys will end it eventually.This assumes passkeys will be widely adopted. And that users will know to stop wherever the passkey doesn&#x27;t work. I have doubts about both. reply acdha 15 hours agorootparentYour first assumption is dubious: Apple, Microsoft, and Google all have well-integrated support and usage is increasing on mainstream sites. It seems unlikely that there will be strong popular backlash against something which is easier to use in addition to being safer.The second is flat out wrong. Passkeys and U3&#x2F;F&#x2F;FIDO2 do not depend on the user at all. Even if I completely fool you, the credential you get for example.com cannot be used on example.org because the protocol incorporates the host name. That’s why the security community is pushing them since phishing is so common and this shuts that down entirely. The attacks now tend to involve getting people to downgrade to password + SMS&#x2F;TOTP so the more those fade from common usage the better everyone will be. reply jpc0 19 hours agorootparentprevSo Google and Amazon have support, and it seems depening on which AB group you are in Apple does too?I think it is a significant benefit and likely to be implemented specially concidering client support is already there and there are good libraries available to do it. reply paulryanrogers 17 hours agorootparentLarge providers have supported other standards and not seen uptake.

You can override password managers, but \"why can&#x27;t I find my credentials\" makes you look at the URL again at least once.For Bitwarden, this will be the hostname, and as such, will tell you that you don&#x27;t have any passwords for moc.margatsni.nlThere are design issues at play here, but mitigations for most types of phishing are already available. Websites need to implement Passkey support, but any username+password website should work perfectly fine with password managers. reply josephcsible 16 hours agoprevRTL has been a huge source of security vulnerabilities for its entire existence.

It&#x27;s an extremely rare codepoint that&#x27;s used to force left-to-right characters to be displayed as if they were right-to-left characters. The only use case I can think of off the top of my head is some kind of interlinear phonetic transcription where you want Latin characters to flow the same direction as the corresponding Arabic for ease of cross-referencing.For ordinary bidirectional texts, RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE, its sibling LEFT-TO-RIGHT ISOLATE and POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING are plenty:⁧عنوان URL لهذا التعليق هو: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38734329‬Where I used RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE in the beginning to make sure the Arabic text in front of the colon is to the right of it, and then POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING in the end to restore the original directionality. (Amusingly, HN&#x27;s URL parser treats the POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING as part of the URL, which breaks the link.)Otherwise it would show up like below, where \"in front of the colon\" means \"left of it\" (as is customary in English text):عنوان URL لهذا التعليق هو: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38734329 reply amenhotep 20 hours agorootparentprevThe client should probably be aware of whether the user might be expecting RTL text and maybe display a warning if not? Arabic users receiving a URL containing the character shouldn&#x27;t raise any eyebrows, but if a random Anglo user clicks on one it might be worth displaying a warning that it&#x27;s backwards text? At least the first time. reply WilTimSon 20 hours agorootparentIt wouldn&#x27;t really solve the problem, sadly. The percentage of people who&#x27;d bother to read that warning is likely quite low. reply berdario 20 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good reason for not including such a warning.\"quite low\" for a service with billions of users, can still allow for million of users who would benefit from seeing the warning. reply thiagoharry 18 hours agorootparentThis does not solve the issue for arabic users. Sounds not good for me declaring the problem solved just because it was solved for people speaking certain languages. Or attacking the problem excluding certain languages. reply berdario 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a good point, but the algorithm for detection&#x2F;flagging doesn&#x27;t have to be what the grandparent post proposed.Maybe something like: strip all tags (leaving only the unstyled text) and check:- there shouldn&#x27;t be any RLM within the URL- RLM marks are accepted before&#x2F;after the URL only if the URL uses only characters for a language that is RTL and the surrounding text uses characters for a language that is LTR (or viceversa, LTR and surrounding text is for RTL text)... Otherwise the text is flagged- flag URLs that contain both characters for RTL and LTR languages (with possible exceptions for ccTLD&#x2F;TLDs? )Of course, this leaves some open problems (how big should the sample of the \"surrounding text\"?)And also, Meta could roll out this logic&#x2F;algorithm in public Facebook&#x2F;Instagram posts, where it has more control of it... Rolling it out in WhatsApp first could be more problematic, since due to e2e, Meta wouldn&#x27;t be able to easily spot false positives (messages with URLs that are flagged as potentially malicious, but which are actually fine) replyavel 20 hours agorootparentprevYou can only apply the fix to the URL field in the payload described, not to normal message text. reply bugsliker 19 hours agoprevI love that this is categorized as \"reverse engineering\" at the bottom of the post. reply AlexSW 22 hours agoprevInteresting ideas and vulnerability! With a nice and concise summary. Thanks for sharing reply aeonik 21 hours agoprevVery cool attack, and easy to read write up.I have one basic question: It was mentioned that attacking the encryption was skipped in favor of using a debugger.Was this debugger applied to the WhatsApp Web app? Or was the debugger deployed on the phone? Was it an emulator?For some reason I didn&#x27;t think WhatsApp had a web app (I don&#x27;t use it). reply ajb 21 hours agoparentThe article says \"I decided to intercept a message via WA web\". reply isaacfrond 20 hours agorootparentThat was the initial idea, but it failed because Whatsapp traffic is end to end encrytped. The second idea, which actually worked, was to put a breakpoint in Whatsapp while running in an emulator. reply LelouBil 20 hours agorootparentNo, not an emulator. Just using your browser&#x27;s JavaScript debugger.You can do that on any website. reply flutas 18 hours agorootparentYeah, the article also says \"WA web’s javascript was uglified and minified, however after a while of searching I found the right place.\" reply blincoln 17 hours agoparentprevThe article doesn&#x27;t make it 100% unambiguous, IMO, but the debugger screenshot looks like a desktop browser&#x27;s debugger. You could also potentially do the same thing in the mobile app using Frida. reply eviks 19 hours agoprev> Exactly as I suspected, the link and the preview were sent separately!This is an even bigger issue with the UI design, why should poor users compare links and previews to be safe? reply kevincox 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a security tradeoff. Given that you want to provide a link preview (which is a nice feature) you have a few options:1. Generate on the sender side. Downside: Can be spoofed.2. Generate on the receiver side: Downside: Leaks receiver IP.3. Generate via third party: Downside: Leaks information to the third party.Overall I think that 1 is the best option. The sender can \"spoof\" all of their messages anyways, including the preview as part of the message is really no different. The problem here is that it isn&#x27;t obvious that this content comes from the sender, it is displayed as a separate bubble and I would bet that 99% of users don&#x27;t realize that the content is from the sender.Plus the URL is all that really matters anyways. If you are clicking on an attacker-controlled URL they can make the preview display anything they want. So you gain very little by forcing the preview to be \"authentic\".Option 3 can be good as well. Especially if implemented with something like double-blinding. So you connect to one party which forwards you to a second party. This way the first sees your IP and the second sees the destination IP but neither sees both (unless they collude). However that is a lot of infrastructure to set up and maintain for relatively little benefits. reply robertlagrant 11 hours agorootparentAnother comment picked what I think is the best option: the sender generates it, and receiver verifies it, but only on click. That way the receiver&#x27;s already going to leak their IP, so WhatsApp can verify before opening up the web page. reply kevincox 11 hours agorootparentVerifies what? That the preview matches? What if it changed between the send and the click legitimately? Also what is the threat model here? If the sender controls the URL they can generate any preview that they want. reply rashidujang 17 hours agoprevAmazing article! In case the author sees this, it&#x27;d be great if the author can deep dive into how he \"found the right place\" in finding the correct breakpoint to produce the decrypted message.

My intuition tells me the preview is used to track user activity. I wish I could contact the author to know more about how WhatsApp tracks activity reply kioleanu 19 hours agoparentThey cache the preview for subsequent messages containing the same link. For example, if a link is making the rounds and gets sent 200k times in an hour, they don&#x27;t call the URL 200k times to build the preview, as that&#x27;s a huge waste of resources on both sides, with a huge chance that the servers containing the link gets DDOSed reply neverrroot 22 hours agoprevUsing a unicode character to reverse order of characters and create links that have “trusted” value like: ln.instagram.com&#x2F;&#x2F;:sptth.

Code). As I have said before, convictions for simple possession of marijuana have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities. Through this proclamation, consistent with the grant of Proclamation 10467, I am pardoning additional individuals who may continue to experience the unnecessary collateral consequences of a conviction for simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana.

My intent by this proclamation is to pardon only the offenses of simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana in violation of the Federal and D.C. laws set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this proclamation, as well as the provisions in the Code of Federal Regulations consistent with paragraph (4) of this proclamation, and not any other offenses involving other controlled substances or activity beyond simple possession of marijuana, attempted simple possession of marijuana, or use of marijuana, such as possession of marijuana with intent to distribute or driving offenses committed while under the influence of marijuana. This pardon does not apply to individuals who were non-citizens not lawfully present in the United States at the time of their offense. Pursuant to the procedures in Proclamation 10467, the Attorney General, acting through the Pardon Attorney, shall review all properly submitted applications for certificates of pardon and shall issue such certificates of pardon to eligible applicants in due course.

For one, it&#x27;s much cheaper than high quality heroin. Second, heroin used to be the dominant drug when people couldn&#x27;t afford prescription pills. Peoples tolerances on opioids quickly build and some subset of the population were using so much heroin that they could more cheaply inject or smoke fent. Going up that pipeline can happen in months, going down could take years.The scheduling of the drug is irrelevant to the problem that there are and will be people who illegally manufacture and sell meth and fent. The DEA has plenty of those people to go after, even if we legalize and regulate every drug today. Why? Cost. The same way prescription pills are a pipeline to fent, meth is the final stop in a similar pipeline of stimulants. reply chimeracoder 12 hours agorootparentOP is technically incorrect that rescheduling alone would solve the fentanyl problem, but not for the reasons you state.> For one, it&#x27;s much cheaper than high quality heroin.

Peoples tolerances on opioids quickly build and some subset of the population were using so much heroin that they could more cheaply inject or smoke fent. Going up that pipeline can happen in months, going down could take years.Fentanyl is cheaper than heroin because of supply-side constraints: specifically, fentanyl is produced in larger quantities for pharmaceutical purposes, and the illegal markets are structured in a way that promotes the distribution of fentanyl over the distribution of heroin. However, that does not mean that fentanyl is inherently cheaper in an abstract sense. If legal restrictions were lifted, both fentanyl and heroin would be dramatically cheaper than either one is today.This is, incidentally, another argument in favor of maintenance programs. Almost all of the indirect harms associated with illicit drug use, and many of the direct ones, are a consequence of the legal status and the expense (both financial and nonfinancial) associated with them.Clinical trials present overwhelming evidence that, when provided with a low-cost, pharmaceutical grade supply of heroin, users are able to hold down stable jobs, maintain permanenent housing, etc., all things that they previously struggled with due to having to spend so much time, effort, and money in order to address what is fundamentally a medical issue for them.> The same way prescription pills are a pipeline to fent, meth is the final stop in a similar pipeline of stimulants.This is more or less the \"gateway drug\" theory, and it&#x27;s simply incorrect. There is no \"pipeline\" of stimulants, and to the extent that one can even be argued to exist, methamphetamine is not the \"final stop\" in one. reply oooyay 11 hours agorootparent\"Gateway drug theory\" has to do with going from one class of drugs to another. That is not what I described. I described usage within a single class of drugs that has to do with chemically addictive properties, strength, and cost dictating the choice of the next drug.I can see your argument about cost, but I think it ignores that, for instance, tranq is now being used in combination with fent. The reason for that isn&#x27;t cost, it&#x27;s entirely strength and chemically addictive properties. I think ignoring those kind of factors falls squarely outside of harm reduction. Where your argument with cost runs foul is in states like California where the legalization and subsequent regulation of the drug shot it&#x27;s cost up.

It would not. Materially restricting access to high-test opiates might, but we have ample experience from well-labeled high-test opiates to suggest that uncontrolled access to any of them is likely to be deadly.If by \"regulation\" you mean \"restriction\", then, sure, I buy that, stipulating that it&#x27;s somehow possible to restrict access.

But I am responding to you, not that guy upthread.Your implied claim, as I read it, is that \"opioid-ness\" is \"why fentanyl kills,\" and there&#x27;s nothing special going on because we had a bunch of deaths from licit opioids in the early 2000s. But I think that there&#x27;s actually something special about illicit fentanyl in particular, as opposed to regulated opioids, and dose inconsistency is one plausible difference.Anyway, you could just share what your thoughts are more explicitly, and that would be interesting and maybe harder to misunderstand. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentI was responding to a particular argument. I&#x27;ve lost track of what we would be arguing about here. My point was pretty straightforward: high-test opiates don&#x27;t simply kill because they&#x27;re unregulated; they do a very good job of killing simply by being widely available at all. reply 4RealFreedom 10 hours agorootparentBy that logic, we shouldn&#x27;t have many opiate deaths because they are currently controlled. reply tptacek 10 hours agorootparentThey are not at all meaningfully controlled.

I&#x27;m sure the street drugs are much more dangerous dose-for-dose, but given free access to oxycodone, you&#x27;re just as likely to die, perhaps on a marginally longer schedule (there are survivor high-functioning maintenance addicts on both natural and synthetic&#x2F;street opioids, obviously).

It wasn&#x27;t about oxycodone being &#x27;safe&#x27; (even though I gave you stats that showed 80% of deaths of from combining drugs), it wasn&#x27;t about oxycodone vs heroin.

Really, what is the point of a reply like this? reply tptacek 5 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I am. The subtext of the original comment was that making opiates more widely available but more carefully regulated as to content and dosage would save lives. It pretty clearly would not do that.

    "originBody": "Google Search Overwhelmed By Massive Spam Attack Google is apparently struggling to contain a spam attack that's been ongoing for days SEJ STAFF Roger Montti December 21, 2023 ⋅ 8 min read 88 SHARES 15K READS Google’s search results have been hit by a spam attack for the past few days in what can only be described as completely out of control. Many domains are ranking for hundreds of thousands of keywords each, an indication that the scale of this attack could easily reach into the millions of keyword phrases. Updated: The spam was initially discovered by Lily Ray: If you currently Google \"craigslist used auto parts,\" every single result in the top 20 is spam, minus the first two results from Craigslist. — Lily Ray 😏 (@lilyraynyc) December 20, 2023 How Google’s Algorithms Might Be Gamed The spam sites appear to be taking advantage of at least three windows of opportunities that a part of how Google ranks websites. These opportunities are not new and spammers have been taking advantage of them for many years but not to the extent that has been going on lately. Perhaps the most important reason for the success of the spam is that the search queries the spam sites are ranking for are low competition, which makes it easier to rank. There are two kinds of low volume search queries where the spam sites are finding opportunities. Opportunity 1. Local search algorithm: Local Search is a type of search that is triggered when people search for things nearby, like a restaurant or movie times. It’s a more permissive algorithm that allows a local restaurant with no links to rank. Opportunity 2. Longtail Keywords: Longtail keywords are queries low volume phrases, one-offs that happen once a month or once a year. Consequently these queries are low competition which makes it easier to rank. Opportunity 3. Many of the spam sites are brand new. The domains have been registered within 24 to 48 hours previous to ranking. Google gives brand new sites a short period of time where it gets the benefit of a doubt while Google’s algorithm figures out the site during a short honeymoon period where the site is able to rank for search queries. Many of the domains have only been registered within the past 24-48 hours. That could mean that those domains are also taking advantage of this small window of opportunity to sneak in, rank for millions of search queries then disappear. A Googler described why new sites can rank: “In particular, with completely new websites, one of the difficulties that we have is we might not have a lot of signals for those websites so we have to make estimates. And depending on how we make estimates, it can sometimes mean that in the beginning we show this website a little bit more visibly than like it turns out that the signals tell us in the end. Links Help Google Find The Spam Sites This recently came to my attention from a series of posts by Bill Hartzer (LinkedIn profile) where he published a link graph generated by the Majestic backlinks tool that exposed the link networks of several of the spam sites. The link graph that he posted showed scores of websites tightly interlinking with each other, which is a fairly typical pattern for spammy link networks. Screenshot Of Tightly Interlinked Network Image by Bill Hartzer via Majestic Bill and I talked about the spam sites over Facebook messenger and we both agreed that although the spammers put a lot of work into creating a backlink network, the links weren’t actually responsible for the high rankings. The links are likely there to help Google find the brand new spam sites and get them crawled and eventually ranking. Bill said: “This, in my opinion, is partly the fault of Google, who appears to be putting more emphasis on content rather than links.” I agree 100% that Google is putting more emphasis on content than links. But my thoughts are that the spam links are there so that Googlebot can discover the spam pages and index them, even if just for one or two days. Once indexed the spam pages are likely exploiting what I consider two loopholes in Google’s algorithms, which I talk about next. Out of Control Spam in Google SERPs Multiple sites are ranking for longtail phrases that are somewhat easy to rank, as well as phrases with a local search component, which are also easy to rank. Longtail is a concept that’s been around for almost twenty years and subsequently popularized by a 2006 book called The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Spammers are able to rank for these rarely searched phrases because there is little competition for those phrases, which makes it easy to rank. So if a spammer creates millions of pages of longtail phrases those pages can then rank for hundreds of thousands of keywords every day in a short period of time. Companies like Amazon use the principle of the longtail to sell hundreds of thousands of individual products a day which is different than selling one product hundreds of thousands of times per day. That’s what the spammers are exploiting, the ease of ranking for longtail phrases. The second thing that the spammers are exploiting is the loophole that’s inherent in Local Search. The local search algorithm is not the same as the algorithm for ranking non-local keywords. The examples that have come to light are variations of Craigslist and related keywords. Examples are phrases like Craigslist auto parts, Craigslist rooms to rent, Craigslist for sale by owner and thousands of other keywords, most of which don’t use the word Craigslist. The scale of the spam is huge and it goes far beyond than keywords with the word “Craigslist” in it. What The Spam Page Looks Like Taking a look at what the spam page looks like is impossible by visiting the pages with a browser. I tried to see the source code of the sites that rank in Google but all of the spam sites automatically redirect to another domain. I next entered the spam URL into the W3C link checker to visit the website but the W3C bot couldn’t see the site either. So I changed my browser user agent to identify itself as Googlebot but the spam site still redirected me. That indicated that the site was not checking if the user agent was Googlebot. The spam site was checking for Googlebot IP addresses. If the visitor’s IP address matched as belonging to Google then the spam page displayed content to Googlebot. All other visitors got a redirect to other domains that displayed sketchy content. In order to see the HTML of the website I had to visit with a Google IP address. So I used Google’s Rich Results tester to visit the spam site and record the HTML of the page. I showed Bill Hartzer how to extract the HTML by using the Rich Results tester and he immediately went off to tweet about it, lol. Dang! The Rich Results Tester has an option to show the HTML of a webpage. So copied the HTML, pasted it into a text file then saved it it as an HTML file. Screenshot Of HTML Provided By Rich Results Tool I next edited the HTML file to remove any JavaScript then saved the file again. I was now able to see what the webpage looks like to Google: Screenshot Of Spam Webpage One Domain Ranks For 300,000+ Keywords Bill sent me a spreadsheet containing a list of keyword phrases that just one of the spam sites ranked for. One spam site, just one of them, ranked for over 300,000 keyword phrases. Screenshot Showing Keywords For One Domain There were a lot of Craigslist keyword phrases but there were also other longtail phrases, many of which contained a local search element. As I mentioned, it’s easy to rank for longtail phrases, easy to rank for local search phrases and combine the two kinds of phrases and it’s really easy to rank for these keyword phrases. Why Does This Spam Technique Work? As previously mentioned, local search uses a different algorithm than the non-local algorithm. For example, a local site doesn’t need a lot of links to rank for a search query. The pages just need the right kinds of keywords to trigger the local search algorithm and subsequently rank. The algorithm for local search is different and more permissive so that local type sites can rank. Local search algorithms are so permissive that a site written virtually entirely in Latin could rank for a phrase like Rhinoplasty Plano Texas. Google has known about this spam problem since at least December 19th, as acknowledged in a tweet by Danny Sullivan. Yes, I already passed that one on to the search team. Here’s a peek. And it’s being looked at. pic.twitter.com/vJH3EisnXD — Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) December 19, 2023 There are a lot of ways Google can do it, like for example being stricter and not allowing sites on certain domains rank. It will be interesting to see if Google finally after all this time figures out a way to combat this kind of spam. Featured Image by Shutterstock/Kateryna Onyshchuk News SEO",

This policy is long gone, but it would help here (assuming the automated tooling to enforce it was any good, and I assume to was).More recently, Google seems totally okay with sites that show content to Googlebot but go out of their way not to show that content to regular users. reply rented_mule 10 hours agoparentAbout 10 years ago, I was working on a site that served several hundred million non-crawler hits a month. Many of our millions of pages had their content change multiple times a day. Because of the popularity and frequent changes, the crawlers hit us constantly... crawlers accounted for ~90% of our traffic - billions of hits per month. Bing was ~70% of the crawler traffic and Google was ~25% of it. We noticed it because Bing quickly became very aggressive about crawling, exposing some of our scaling limits as they doubled our already significant traffic in a few short months.I was working on the system that picked ads to show on our pages (we had our own internal ad system, doing targeting based on our own data). This was the most computationally intensive part of serving our pages and the ads were embedded directly in the HTML of the page. When we realized that 90% of our ad pick infrastructure was dedicated to feeding the crawlers, we immediately thought of turning ads off for them (we never billed advertisers for them anyway). But hiding the ads seemed to go directly against the spirit of Google&#x27;s policy of showing their crawlers the same content.Among other things, we ended up disabling almost all targeting and showing crawlers random ads that roughly fit the page. This dropped our ad pick infra costs by nearly 80%, saving 6-figures a month. It also let us take a step back to decide where we could make long term investments in our infra rather than being overwhelmed with quick fixes to keep the crawlers fed.This kind of thing is what people are missing when they wonder why a company needs more than a few engineers - after all, someone could duplicate the core functionality of the product in 100 lines of code. At sufficient scale, it takes real engineering just to handle the traffic from the crawlers so they can send you more users. There are an untold number of other things like this that have to be handled at scale, but that are hard to imagine if you haven&#x27;t worked at similar scale. reply bombcar 9 hours agorootparent90% of traffic being crawlers seems (on the face) just absolutely batshit insane. reply amenhotep 7 hours agorootparentSeems like a natural consequence of having \"millions of pages\", if you think about it?

It&#x27;s a site&#x2F;app that has probably been used by 80-90% of adults living in America over the last decade. It would not exist if these ads weren&#x27;t targeted. I know because we knew (past tense because I&#x27;m no longer there) exactly how much targeting increased click-through-rate and how that affected revenue.On top of that, they were ads for doing more of what the user was doing right then, tailored to tastes we&#x27;d seen them exhibit over time. Our goal was that the ads should be relevant enough that they served as an exploration mechanism within the site&#x2F;app. We didn&#x27;t always do as well as we hoped there, but it was a lot better than what you see on most of the internet. And far less intrusive because they weren&#x27;t random (i.e., un-targeted). I have run ad blockers plus used whole house DNS ad blocking as long as I&#x27;ve been aware of them, but I was fine working on these ads because it felt to me like ads done right.If we can&#x27;t even allow for ads done right, then vast swaths of the internet have to be pay-walled or disappear. One consequence of that... only the rich get to use most of the internet. That&#x27;s already too true as it is, I don&#x27;t want to see it go further. reply skinkestek 19 minutes agorootparentI have no problems with this (first party, targeted) as far as I can read English and understand.In fact one of my bigger problems have been that Google has served me generic ads that are so misplaced they go far into attempted insult territory (shady dating sites, pay-to-win \"strategy games\" etc). reply mcpackieh 17 minutes agorootparentprev> websites shouldn&#x27;t be able to make money from advertising at all.This is the case. Advertising is a scourge, psychological warfare waged by corporations against our minds and wallets. Advertisers have no moral qualms, they will exploit any psychololgical weakness to shill products, no matter how harmful. Find a \"market\" of teenagers with social issues? Show them ads of happy young people frolicking with friends to make them buy your carbonated sugar water; never mind that your product will rot their teeth and make them fat. Advertisers don&#x27;t care about whether products are actually good for people, all they care about is successful shilling.Advertising is warfare waged by corporations against people and pretending otherwise makes you vulnerable to it. To fight back effectively we must use adblockers and advocate for advertising bans. If your website cannot exist without targeted advertising, then it is better for it to not exist. reply CaptainOfCoit 7 hours agorootparentprev> Among other things, we ended up disabling almost all targeting and showing crawlers random ads that roughly fit the pageSeems like that&#x27;s exactly what they did... reply driverdan 6 hours agorootparentFor everyone, not just crawlers. reply bhartzer 12 hours agoparentprevThat &#x27;policy&#x27; is still actually in effect, I believe, in Google&#x27;s webmaster guidelines. They just don&#x27;t enforce it.Years ago (early 2000s) Google used to mostly crawl using Google-owned IPs, but they&#x27;d occasionally use Comcast or some other ISPs (partners) to crawl. If you were IP cloaking, you&#x27;d have to look out for those pesky non-Google IPs. I know, as I used to play that IP cloaking game back in the early 2000s, mostly using scripts from a service called \"IP Delivery\". reply LoulouMonkey 10 hours agorootparentNot sure about now, but I worked in the T&S Webspam team (in Dublin, Ireland) until 2021, and we were very much enforcing cloaking.It was, however, one of the most difficult types of spam to detect and penalise, at scale. reply amluto 9 hours agorootparentIs it even well defined? On the one hand, there’s “cloaking,” which is forbidden.

Are these really clearly different?And then there’s whatever Pinterest does, which seems awfully like cloaking or bait-and-switch or something: you get a high ranked image search result, you click it, and the page you see is in no way relevant to the search or related to the image thumbnail you clicked. reply yreg 3 minutes agorootparentI think they must be penalized, because I see this a lot less in the results than I used to.And byw (unless we are talking about different things) it was possible to get to the image on target page, but it was walled off behind a log in. reply bombcar 9 hours agorootparentprevWhatever Pinterest does should result in them being yeeted from all search engines, tbh. reply mrwiseowl 6 hours agorootparentprevDo you have any example searches for the Pinterest results you&#x27;re describing?

My intent is not to defend rich people. Yes obviously most of them don&#x27;t spend their time controlling the media but instead spend time showing off on their yachts.My point is something else: I don&#x27;t but the idea that there are two factions, the rich and the poor, and that all rich people have the same interests and thus are allies and that all poor people have the same interests and are allied (or so they should).Sure, this view is partially grounded in realty and that&#x27;s why Marx did come up with it and it&#x27;s why it stuck to this day as sensible to so many people.But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true. I think it oversimplifies reality to the point that a spherical cow in comparison is anatomically accurate.But it&#x27;s worse than just being wrong. It actively stifles conversation. Any attempt to have a nuanced conversation about these topics ultimately resolves in an accusation of \"you&#x27;re defending the rich, just admit it\". That&#x27;s what turns a idea into an ideology. Ideologies are ideas with built-in self-defense mechanisms. reply colordrops 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t follow your question.

Those ideas are then selected and amplified by all sorts of people leveraging all sorts of means driven by all sorts of motives.In fact there are plenty of examples of populist leaders that are not rich. The fact that the US has the cult of the millionaire sometimes obfuscates that fact; for some reason for populist leaders in the US to raise they have to be millionaire (or pretend to be) to begin with.My point is that, sure, the moneyed class does play a role, but reality is much more complex than that and I don&#x27;t really buy the idea that the world is \"controlled\" by a bunch of \"supermen\" who are both incredibly wealthy and also incredibly intelligent and play 4d chess.I&#x27;m not sure you believe that, that&#x27;s why I wanted to ask a question instead of implying anything for your position.

And it&#x27;s impossible to know what that will be beforehand, which makes using the tools very frustrating.For example, try searching for anything medical related. Even if you&#x27;re clear that you not looking for medical advice, you&#x27;re just looking for info, it won&#x27;t give it (sorry, as an AI I can&#x27;t give medical advice). I imagine this is very frustrating for medical students.And yes, I&#x27;m sure that I could coerce it into responding.

Technical queries? Just search StackOverflow and Github directly. Searching for a local venue of any kind? Search against a dedicated places database where new entries have to pass at least a cursory scrutiny. (Arguably Google Maps or Yelp already serve this purpose today, but I&#x27;m not sure if they have enough vetting today). Medical question? Search across a few sites known to be trustworthy.We have become accustomed to go to Google because it&#x27;s more convenient to type in a movie title, \"chinese restaurant philadelphia\", \"flights to miami 4&#x2F;12&#x2F;24\" or \"Error code 127 python\" into the same single place, but something tells me we&#x27;d be better off if that one place made some LLM-assisted guesses of what kind of search it is, and then went to a specialized search that is curated.

Whether or not your site would have business on the web would be entirely dictated by whether or not you woul be correctly classified (or indeed classified at all) in this engine. if you wanted to start your own stackoverflow competitor for whatever reason, you would have a very hard time getting any traction. this is also true of current general purpose engines, but you still do stand a chance to be referenced well and hit high enough to still get traffic.the yahoo model collapsed for this very reason. back when you went to more than 5 websites to look at screenshots of the other 4, the directories would not necessarly show you the latest thing, because it wasn&#x27;t on the list of sites manually added to each directory.i think the current problem with google isn&#x27;t to do with spam. i think google has become complacent because their ads are on all the sites anyway, so the function of \"maximize revenue per search\" doesn&#x27;t actually care if you find what you&#x27;re looking for, because you will get shown google ads anyway, and will be coming back to google anyway. in fact, they probably get to show more ads by feeding you bad results, because then you&#x27;re loading more pages. this didn&#x27;t used to be the case when google search was on top of spam sites, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing anymore algo updates to curb the current trend, and spam sites have caught on to what ranks higher in the results. reply bantunes 59 minutes agoparentprevBy limiting web search results to \"a few known sites\", you&#x27;d be expediting the death of parts of it.The beauty of search engines (in theory) is that you can find something NEW.

The idea being: show a certain demographic the same annoying ad again and again, and they might end up paying just to get rid of ads.

The guy who did it did it in a very obvious way, but I’m assuming you can just schedule a lot of posts that would drop once a day, make the AI to use different language structures and change the underlying AI model in general (e.g. switch between OpenAI, Mistral and whatever) and slow drip submit the posts. How would Google know they’re “mass generated”? reply mrwiseowl 10 hours agorootparentThe original poster of that Tweet (Jake) admitted they got a manual penalty. Also, clearly Google didn&#x27;t fix it because if not Google wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;overwhelmed&#x27; with this current spam attack going on. If you look into the attack it&#x27;s mass generated absolute spam garbage pages on hundreds if not thousands of separate domains. So it is definitely not fixed. reply mrwiseowl 10 hours agorootparentprevDid they really close the &#x27;loophole&#x27; though? Jake said on Twitter they were actually hit with a manual penalty. So doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s patched.

It claims it doesn&#x27;t, but it does, a lot of SEO strategies now revolve around spamming the search engine with articles, pages, etc. Not for useful content, but for linkbacks, internal linking, etc. It is especially bad for geo-specific SEO strategies, where you&#x27;re trying to have different page sets for different regions. Basically, how it was when Google first started and was easily gamed. Now people are spinning up 100s of pages and articles using AI and just spamming it. It has gotten bad, but the worst part is that you have to do it now in order to compete for keywords. reply whstl 3 hours agoparentYeah. Ten years ago Google was fighting those strategies involving content farms and abusive SEO with things like the Panda update, etc. Now it seems they don&#x27;t care anymore. Since low-quality SEO ranks over legitimate sites, it forces those sites to pay for advertisement.

Or just random ranking; only require a certain low threshold of backlinks to establish baseline relevance. reply jongjong 10 hours agoprevThe fact that Google puts so much focus on content makes it sound like the Google algorithm has been corrupted.

Google makes money with ads. the quality of search results is almost irrelevant to its business model reply charcircuit 9 hours agoparentNo? Decreased search quality will reduce the number of searches people are doing which redcues the amount of ads Google can show. Decreased searches can come from not only people switching to another search engine, but also from people using the web less.

I&#x27;m still holding my breath that the critical mass makes the leap eventually; \"it&#x27;s just twitter but you can write and use custom clients and feed algorithms\" is a compelling propositionFor me and a lot of others, it&#x27;s the only twitter alternative we ever signed up for. A few never came back to twitter, but most did mostly for social reasons. But twitter as a platform gets worse each day, and if it ever truly breaks or dies, bsky will be the schelling point for a whole bunch of people reply kjkjadksj 10 hours agoparent> \"it&#x27;s just twitter but you can write and use custom clients and feed algorithms\" is a compelling propositionFor the average twitter user this is probably the exact opposite of a compelling position. Tech people want more control and less abstraction. Everyone else is happy with their walled gardens and ten layers of separation from the machine code. Its why things are the way they are and not some technopunk utopia that we all want. reply pfraze 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a consumer product and it has to compete as one. We&#x27;ve been pretty aware of that from the start.I think you&#x27;re under-estimating what&#x27;s happening with 3rd-party feeds. That&#x27;s a core pattern where independent services can integrate into the UX as if they&#x27;re native to the product. This means turning the client into an open platform for third-party applications.That&#x27;s been a success with feeds. They&#x27;re actively adopted and created by users. Most of the feeds are hosted by skyfeed, a 3P app which gives users a GUI to create them. The author of skyfeed submitted this actually. Talented dev afaict but I&#x27;ve not met them, which is kind of the point. (Looking forward to it though, redsolver!)3P integration operates by a thick client model. We exchange typed JSON that describes content and interfaces. This lets services drive the client through request&#x2F;response flows. We can bounce out to webviews when we need, but not executing code means better integration into the app, which means users get access to new experiences within the client and providers get users more easily. This being social protocol means that auth and high level verbs (following, liking, commenting) also come along. The Web 1.0 did quite a bit without client scripting, and I suspect this client can too.I also want to mention: the product experience right now is establishing a UX on a protocol-driven network that feels good to consumers. Our metric for success wasn&#x27;t whether it was novel; it was whether we could meet consumer expectations. If we can prove out scaling -- which I&#x27;m now confident we will -- then we&#x27;ve established the core of the network. After that we use that core as a backbone for 3P devs to build integrated experiences, and it should lead to a notably diverse product, and I think that&#x27;s the compelling position for us to offer. reply madeofpalk 10 hours agorootparentprevTwitter, previously, was the best of both worlds. A first-party app “most” people used, and then a vibrant third party app ecosystem that others, mainly power users, loved. reply blurrybird 10 hours agorootparentThreads is this now. API is almost finished &#x2F; ready for release. reply madeofpalk 9 hours agorootparentYou and I have very different definitions of \"now\" :) reply jakebsky 8 hours agorootparentprevIn the early days, Twitter used to have a very open and friendly API. It&#x27;s a big part of why users and third-party devs (I was both) loved it. Same thing was true of Facebook and Reddit.Over time, they shut down their APIs (or charged huge fees) in an effort to intentionally kill off third-party clients and services.A key goal for Bluesky is to \"lock open\" the network and the API so that it&#x27;s impossible to reverse the decision. reply semitones 7 hours agorootparentprevOpen source clients and algorithms could serve as a foundation for more end-user friendly abstractions and UIs, that let average users very plainly express (or not express) what they want to see, and who they want to be seen by.Imagine a sort of plug in ecosystem with sane defaults reply 0xDEAFBEAD 7 hours agorootparentCould this worsen polarization by facilitating extremist fever swamps? reply matsemann 10 hours agoparentprevMy whole community has moved from twitter to bsky. The first push was for mastodon, but that died out after a few weeks. But all action is on bsky now, not twitter, so I feel most have migrated fully, not just double posting. reply chatmasta 8 hours agorootparentThe fact that your whole community was insular enough to move to an invite-only app is exactly what worries me about Bluesky. It&#x27;s just a bunch of cliques. Is that sustainable? We&#x27;ll see.I do like the technical vision, a lot. But I haven&#x27;t been able to try it out because any time I felt the desire to look, nobody could actually link me to a post or a feed. So I never achieved the required activation energy to even look at it, nevermind adding it to my doomscrolling repertoire or signing up to the thing.Opening up the posts is a good first step to sustainable adoption. Now next time people are mad at Twitter they&#x27;ll have an outlet instead of being met with a brick wall when they finally get the urge to try something new. reply matsemann 44 minutes agorootparentAs I wrote in another comment, it&#x27;s a clique that I moved with, yes. Related to urban planning, cycling infrastructure etc in my country. If anything, the move has been nice. No longer daily death threats from car drivers thinking that&#x27;s a proportionate response for us advocating for a new bicycle lane..Being a small group of course made the transition easier. Most of us didn&#x27;t use Twitter to follow all kinds of stuff, just mostly these things.And while being a clique, with no outside influences, can be bad, the \"influences\" you now get from blue checks on X isn&#x27;t anything worth having.

You can go on the app store right now and take your pick of bsky clients, and you can browse&#x2F;search different algos from within the app and keep a list of your favorites and swap between them, it&#x27;s all very user-friendlyMost of the biggest complaints people have about twitter are client-side problems. So just having an ecosystem of clients (and the competitive pressure that puts on the official client) makes the experience way better reply jjfoooo4 10 hours agorootparentChoice is only good if the options are differentiated and easy to understand.A bunch of algo and client options sound good for someone who is already a committed user, but for a new user it just complicated the onboarding experience.Not to mention, it’s unclear what the incentive to put real resources behind any of these clients is. reply brundolf 10 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t complicate the onboarding process though, because there&#x27;s an official client and a default algo. That&#x27;s Bluesky&#x27;s whole thing: sensible defaults and easy onboarding, so it can be \"just twitter\" if you want it to be. But the open protocol and ecosystem that give you more options if&#x2F;when you want them, and put pressure on the official ones to stay good reply ziml77 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s really the key. Most people don&#x27;t need to care. Bluesky is nice and easy for their needs. They just use the bsky.app website and the official Bluesky phone app.This is in contrast to Mastodon where people were told to pick an instance and not really guided to any one as the primary one (because Mastodon devs&#x2F;users don&#x27;t want there to be a thought that there even is a \"primary\" instance).People here on HN can claim picking an instance isn&#x27;t a big deal all they want, but I can say with confidence it is.

We consider portability to be crucial because it protects users from sudden bans, server shutdowns, and policy disagreements. Our solution for portability requires both signed data repositories and DIDs, neither of which are easy to retrofit into ActivityPub. The migration tools for ActivityPub are comparatively limited; they require the original server to provide a redirect and cannot migrate the user&#x27;s previous data.Other smaller differences include: a different viewpoint about how schemas should be handled, a preference for domain usernames over AP’s double-@ email usernames, and the goal of having large scale search and discovery (rather than the hashtag style of discovery that ActivityPub favors).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atproto.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;faq reply edavis 10 hours agorootparentprevDuring the early days of what would become Bluesky, they first reviewed the available options for decentralized public communications and nothing out there checked all the boxes.

You would think they were invite-only to keep the quality high, but everything is either furry porn or hate-filled rage bait, neither of which I am personally a fan of at all. I keep telling trying to tell it as much, but I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen one post I truly wanted to see. I tried to do it for like a week hoping it would get better, but honestly it seems like there&#x27;s just nothing worthwhile on the whole site.

I simply leave, and think Twitter is a worse as worse site every time I run into that. It’s a move that reeks of desperation and makes me not want to sign up. I should feel compelled to make an account if I want to follow someone or post something, not just to read a single post. I’m not sure how they expect to grow when they hide what’s inside and word of mouth is largely negative. Walled gardens have their place, but it’s not the “town square” Elon has been taking about.

I was a little disappointed how it just felt like ... more twitter. I&#x27;m browsing around finding mostly memes or outrage that doesn&#x27;t have context to me. I fairly quickly get exhausted trying to find &#x2F; curate content.I guess I should have expected it, but I hoped that somewhere a different network would have a different style or flavor. However, the content patterns that get engagement and etc seem ingrained in the participants no matter where you go.Personally I can&#x27;t help but feel both left out, and not wanting to be a part of whatever these style of social media apps are.Having said that there&#x27;s a lot of talk about twitter clones missing features, but for me I wonder if the content is the same, why would a significant number of people move anyway? reply rconti 10 hours agoparentI feel much the same way. Facebook tried to sell me on threads by showing me an ad with 2.5 threads visible: one of them was clearly a racist post that I didn&#x27;t want to see the conclusion of, the other was clearly a liberal outrage thread about how much money Jeff Bezos makes that I ALSO didn&#x27;t want to see the end of, and the third was a mostly-obscured post by a ceramic artisan I follow. They don&#x27;t seem to have any idea who they&#x27;re advertising to if they think these things will get a positive reaction out of me, rather than just closing it and marking it as \"show less like this.\" For that matter, the vaunted algorithm is not very smart if it can&#x27;t figure out that I only engage with reels and stories about 1% of the time, vs the content I actually like to engage with.It&#x27;s like, these social media companies wrote a SINGLE outrage-farming algorithm that they push on everyone&#x27;s feeds without regard for whether it works on individuals or not.This all is why, despite it getting worse, I use FB more than the other platforms. Actual content posted by actual humans I actually know with their actual names under them.

The place is kinda a mess and the medium is responsible for part of that. reply mjr00 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the problem with the wave of Twitter clones is exactly that: they&#x27;re clones. You don&#x27;t make a successful social media site by being the same as an existing site but with different people. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Discord, TikTok, Reddit are all very different in how they function and what types of content is shared. Google+ tried to clone Facebook and was a colossal failure despite hundreds of millions, or perhaps billions of dollars being poured into it.Fundamentally the issue with Bluesky, Mastodon, etc. is that they don&#x27;t offer anything different to most users. Yes, they run off decentralized protocols, but most people don&#x27;t care. Yes, there&#x27;s no Elon, but most people don&#x27;t care.So I&#x27;d put it firmly in (c). Bluesky and Threads both tried to recapture the lightning in the bottle which is 2008 Twitter by copying it (Bluesky going so far as to copy the early 00s invite-only model!). Both are either failures or marginally successful, depending on who you ask. Certainly neither are a home run.If you want to get people off Twitter, don&#x27;t build Twitter-but-different.

Maybe you haven&#x27;t seen a lot of innovation around UX not because people are not trying, but because those who tried to experiment with different UX were aiming at such a niche that completely failed as social network? reply npunt 10 hours agorootparentAt least for me, I&#x27;ve spent the last ~3 years designing new feature ideas for twitter and twitter-like products as a hobby and been involved in various communities working on these issues. Ways to improve quality of comments, reduce conflict, improve context, build media literacy, etc. I need to get around to publishing these ideas but have definitely put real work in. This is the only one I&#x27;ve published in blog form [1], tho I&#x27;ve put bits of others out on twitter itself over the years. Fwiw I used to run product&#x2F;design for a social media co and have on and off run communities all the way back to bbses.As far as I&#x27;m concerned the innovation just isn&#x27;t there in the core loops and UX of twitter-likes, it&#x27;s all circa 2008 stuff.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickpunt.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;deescalating-social-media&#x2F; reply rglullis 10 hours agorootparent> designing new feature ideas for twitter and twitter-like productsWhich is not the same as \"innovating with UX\" in any way that is incompatible with the status quo.Going by your blog post, do you agree that it is not something that (by itself) a feature so innovative that would make people drop twitter to favor a new social network that implemented it? reply npunt 6 hours agorootparentNo this feature by itself isn&#x27;t something to attract people to a brand new social network, I hope I didn&#x27;t represent it that way.My perspective on the problem is that the way twitter&#x27;s medium is designed doesn&#x27;t produce a wonderful signal:noise ratio. Some people might revel in the noise, and some amount of noise certainly generates MAUs and ad dollars, but ultimately it&#x27;s not living up to its potential as a medium and social network. &#x27;A clown car that fell into a gold mine&#x27; still applies.My theory of change is that in general, features that improve SNR are going to provide a sustaining MAU advantage to products that implement them, because the vast majority of users want better SNR. They want quality discourse, funny memes, kind interactions, etc. Drama and conflict also produce MAUs, but ultimately they&#x27;re net negative because of the people they scare off.If you accept that premise, then the question is more when than if features focused on improving the SNR of interactions should be built. Do they meaningfully differentiate and help with the cold start problem? Or are they to be built after some amount of audience has arrived?From what I&#x27;ve seen on the clones, as they grow they&#x27;re all running into the same SNR ceiling. I think that ceiling is preventing them from being breakout successes, because whatever differentiator they started with (decentralized, free speech, etc) will fade in relevance as they get bigger and their core experience reverts to the mean. They&#x27;re just twitter, but smaller.Would a product that focused more on improving SNR be able to breakout? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m just disappointed nobody seems to have tried very hard. reply TheLegace 1 hour agorootparentI very much agree with your sentiment. Glad to see someone else recognize the problem with trying to find interesting content nowadays. I have noticed a negative relationship between sizes(after a certain threshold) of communities&#x2F;platforms and the ability to find interesting content that is also suited to my preferences.It seems like a ranking problem, you would think having upvotes&#x2F;likes&#x2F;points&#x2F;etc. would be a good metric. But you just get an outsized influence of posts that have huge critical mass, and the content just becomes generic and clickbaity(i.e. Mr. Beast).I think it is an optimization problem that has to balance competing needs and bring the best solutions under a wide set of criteria. This has been my experience trying to solve this problem, I already have a system that ingests huge amount of reddit posts from preferred and top subreddits. What I want to do is filter out the best content, then apply that generally to all content sources(YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, etc). Moving away from content that gives a short term dopamine hit to content that is an experience that changes structures in your brain. Ideally sustaining pleasure, intrigue, curiosity for longer periods of time.There are sites with great UX like Scrolller[1] trying to solve the issue, but its only images&#x2F;gifs.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrolller.com&#x2F; reply rglullis 4 hours agorootparentprev> If you accept that premisePersonally, I don&#x27;t. I think the flaw in this reasoning is to think that people join social networks with the sole purpose of exchanging information effectively, but I could probably make a list of 50 reasons that make people participate more than that.There is also the aspect that SNR is frankly a bad metric. We are quite able to filter things ourselves, which means that in the end we will flock to the places where the total signal is what matters, regardless of how much noise comes along with it. reply npunt 2 hours agorootparentI think you might be interpreting my point about SNR narrowly and literally, when I meant it in the broadest sense. Obviously social networks are not solely about exchanging information (which I never said...), they serve all sorts of other purposes, connecting and forming bonds being a major one.I think you&#x27;re also not being particularly charitable in your interpretations of what I&#x27;m saying, or opening yourself up to the possibility for other ways things can operate. If you were to be, you&#x27;d find we have quite a bit of agreement about this. Total signal also matters, good point I can see how you read it that way. I&#x27;d put that in the umbrella of SNR, as my intent is to advocate for better signal - both in quantity and quality.Where I think we may disagree is that existing filtering capabilities are sufficient and broadly used. I mean, if you can imagine a world where it takes users less effort in setting up their twitter account to get the same quality output, then we&#x27;re in agreement that there&#x27;s work to be done on signal and noise. Currently it&#x27;s a hell of a lot of effort, and you still run into a lot of unnecessary strife and bullshit. I&#x27;d push you to consider that twitter&#x27;s current feature set around discourse is also not the end all be all of online communication, and there is room for improvement. If you can accept that there is room for improvement in these domains, then we&#x27;re on the same page here.In fact I think this very conversation is a decent example of how the design of a medium can cause some unnecessary strife and result in the rather silly situation of being in violent agreement.

There&#x27;s been some work in a design pattern libraries but it&#x27;s hard to design new features from the outside, and I don&#x27;t think until very recently people saw starting a rival social network as a good business move, since social networks are defined by their network effect moat. Twitter&#x27;s meltdown has created some opportunity but it remains to be seen if the attack of the clones is just a fracturing versus a cambrian event. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparentprev> The twitter clones seem to play things very close to twitter&#x27;s style.

Twitter bleeds money because the company has been mismanaged (going back long before its current ownership), not because putting ads on a social network with that number of users couldn&#x27;t turn a profit.A \"failed social network\" is one that nobody uses.> Or maybe UX where I actually feel like I can find or interact with things I want just doesn&#x27;t work for profitability (Facebook doesn&#x27;t show me what I want)?There&#x27;s probably a short-term&#x2F;long-term thing here. Big companies run on metrics, so they make a change and the number goes up so they keep the change. But the way the change works is by frustrating people into spending more time on the site, which short-term increases the metrics and long-term makes people hate you and be eager to switch away at the first opportunity.What you probably want here is a service with a single owner who actually uses it and cares about making the service good (and, most importantly, is competent), but what usually happens instead is it becomes a publicly traded company controlled by shareholders who institute the aforementioned metrics-based bureaucracy.The key is somehow getting the one with benevolent leadership and the one with millions of users to be the same one. reply rglullis 9 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m curious about any social networks that have tried some new UX?And I&#x27;m curious about flipping this question: can you think of any UX that would be interested for you in a social network? reply doublerabbit 9 hours agorootparentprevSome guy here posted on HN about his project non.io[0]Still hanging aroundhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;non.io&#x2F; reply joepie91_ 10 hours agorootparentprevI mean, there&#x27;s plenty of UX innovation going on in the fediverse, for example.

Account portability on Mastodon requires your current home server to be online and cooperate with you if you want to transfer your account to a different server. With Bluesky, you can do it as long as you have an archive of your data. The intention is to make choosing your home server into a minor implementation detail where the user is always in control instead of a hugely consequential upfront decision as it is with Mastodon. reply notnullorvoid 9 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m fine with a new protocol, what I dislike is they marketed it as a main feature and still haven&#x27;t shipped what was promised.

So folks should find them quite cheap and easy to run. One reason is that they don&#x27;t need to directly support application features such as timeline construction, search, image optimization, etc: they just host your social data.We have 10 servers federating in production, each housing around 270,000 users, and it all runs on disk and sqlite, quite affordable!

You could monetize the client by charging a small premium above and beyond the baseline server costs.I want an experience so porcelain that in order to create a new account, I enter my username and it automatically checks its availability across dozens of social sites, then registers me in as seamless a manner as possible. Then when I click post, it by default broadcasts that post across all the accounts I registered.I suppose this is probably similar to the existing interface for a product such as Hootsuite, no?

Dec 22, 2023 635 Share this post In The Long Run, We're All Dad www.astralcodexten.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 353 Share I. In February 2023 I found myself sitting in the waiting room of a San Francisco fertility clinic, holding a cup of my own semen. The Bible tells the story of Onan, son of Judah. Onan’s brother died. Tradition dictated that Onan should impregnate his brother’s wife, ensuring that his brother’s line would (in some sense) live on. Onan refused, instead “spilling the seed on the ground”. God smote Onan, starting a 4,000-year-old tradition of religious people getting angry about wasting sperm on anything other than procreative sex. Modern academics have a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this. If Onan had impregnated his brother’s wife, the resulting child would have been the heir to the family fortune. Onan refused so he could keep the fortune for himself and his descendants. So the sin of Onan was greed, not masturbation. All that stuff in the Talmud about how the hands of masturbators should be cut off, or how masturbation helped cause Noah’s Flood (really! Sanhedrin 108b!) is just a coincidence. God hates greed, just like us. Modern academics are great, but trusting them feels somehow too convenient. So there in the waiting room, I tried to put myself in the mindset of the rabbis thousands of years ago who thought wasting semen was a such a dire offense. The average ejaculation contains about 300 million sperm. There are about 300 million people in the United States. If every sperm in a single ejaculation got to fertilize an egg and incubate in a womb, it would be enough to populate a second America. America has about 200 living Nobel Prize winners. 735 billionaires. 1,000,000 doctors, 5,000,000 nurses. 100,000 pilots, 700,000 cops. Also 700,000 drug dealers, 100,000 murderers, and 1,700 NYT journalists. That doesn’t necessarily mean my cup contained exactly 100,000 future pilots. If we assume complete genetic determinism, my sperm form a normal distribution around my personal genetic average. I’m terrible at three dimensional reasoning, so let’s say I’m two standard deviations less likely than usual to become a pilot. If my wife is normal on this trait, and we average it out, that means only about 32,000 future pilots in the cup. On the other hand, I’m better than average at writing. I might be among the top 20,000 most-read authors in the US, so maybe +4SD above average. Again assuming my wife is normal, that suggests even the average kid we have will be a good writer. But imagine an entire America worth of people centered around being a good writer. The best writer in existing America should be +6SD above average; the best writer among the sperm in the cup is +8SD. 8SD is “best in two quadrillion”. There has never been a writer that good in the whole history of the world. There is a sperm in that cup who could write at an utterly superhuman level, write things none of us could possibly imagine, things so good it’s not even clear you would still call them writing and not some entirely new semi-divine form of art. There’s also, on priors, some sperm who would shoot up a school. There’s a decent chance of a few who, if given an egg and a womb, would destroy the world, and a few others who would save it. A few hundred might ruin my life so thoroughly that I would commit suicide to escape them. A few dozen might be so great that people would build statues to me just for being their father, the same way some people build statues to St. Joseph. The nurse called my name, I handed her the cup, and she took it away to pour into some lab apparatus. Good bye, 200 Nobelists. Good by, 32,000 pilots. Good bye, son who would have destroyed the world. Good bye, daughter who would have saved it. I waited to see if God would smite me. He did not. A few weeks later the clinic called and said there was nothing wrong with my sperm. My fertility problems were just bad luck. I should just keep trying. There’s an old Jewish joke. How do you make God laugh? Tell Him your plans. 1/10,000 chance of a pilot, because I’m bad at navigation and the base rates are low. 1/10 chance of a doctor, because of all the doctors in my family. I knew it was bogus. Partly because I’m bad at standard deviations and probably got the numbers wrong. But partly because anything can happen. Maybe I was having all this trouble because the lab missed something and I really was infertile. Maybe my wife was infertile. Maybe we’d eaten too many microplastics and it was all over. Maybe we’d have a kid, an amazing kid who could have changed everything, but the world would end in 2027 and they’d never get a chance. Still, you’ve got to calculate. One in three million chance of becoming a billionaire. One in thirty thousand chance of committing murder. One out of this. One in that. One one one one one, until you reach semantic satiation on the number “one” and the syllable loses all meaning. This time God chose to frustrate my calculations even faster and more decisively than usual: He blessed me with twins. II. Natural selection didn’t design the female body to carry two children. It barely, grudgingly, designed it to carry one. Two is a cruel joke. I remember cutting an onion, sometime during month one. My wife asked if they were a different variant from usual, or if they’d gone bad. They hadn’t. It had to be morning sickness. We laughed and hugged each other. This pregnancy thing was starting to feel real! A month later - including a hunt through the kitchen to cleanse it of any shred of onion, or anything that had ever touched an onion - we agreed that actually, morning sickness was bad. Two months later, we debated bringing my wife to the ER because she hadn’t eaten anything other than plain saltine crackers in several days. We did manage to avoid the hospital, but it was rough. I’m surprised more people don’t name their children after Zofran®. Women get such positive feelings about it, right when they’re considering baby names. For a girl, you could nickname her Zoe. For a boy, Frank. And after the morning sickness it was asthma. After the asthma, anemia. After the anemia, hip pain, trouble sleeping, trouble walking, trouble with everything. I’ve heard rumors of some women who keep working all through pregnancy, with a smile on their face. Pronatalist influencer Simone Collins says she was taking business calls from her hospital room during the delivery. I think it’s a conspiracy. All the pronatalist influencers get together and say that pregnancy isn’t so bad. Young women believe them, and so the human race survives another generation. As my wife labored to build our childrens’ physical forms, I toiled to give them their spiritual-semiotic identity. The theory of nominative determinism posits that a person’s name shapes the course of their future life. Its proponents have collected a mountain of evidence: British chief justice Igor Judge, neurologist Lord Brain, poker champion Chris Moneymaker, investment CEO Eugene Profit. The Chinese think the number of strokes in the characters that form a child’s name must add up to a lucky number; the Jews believe each letter corresponds to a number, and a person’s name resonates spiritually with all other words whose letters sum to the same amount. Now the statisticians have joined the fray: did you know that children with short first names earn over $10,000 more than longer ones? Or that men named \"Jim\" make 50% more than men named \"Isaiah\"? Is this causation or confounding? Names indicate whether you are black or white, rich or poor, and whether your parents are traditional or eccentric; what is left after adjusting for this effect? The only paper I’ve seen even begin to address the question is a sibling-control study by David Figlio, who finds that even within families, children with lower-class names perform worse. And you don’t need scientists to know that names affect how other people see you. Just ask Chad, Karen, Tyrone, or the poor doctor I worked with once named Osama (he went by “Sam”). But also, some people love their names, and other people hate theirs. This was the factor I was least sure about, so I surveyed 1518 blog readers. Here “popularity rank” comes from the List Of Most Popular Baby Names for the respondent’s birth year - for example, Scott was the 39th most popular boys’ name in 1984, so I am rank 39. I find that people are happiest with names in the 501 - 1000 range (a separate question, which asked people to rate their happiness with their name on a scale of 1 - 5 without reference to whether it was traditional or unusual, got the same result). What about other considerations? I asked people how happy they would be with ten different types of names. People expressed a strong preference for common older names like John and Mary. Does this contradict the finding above that people with very common names were least happy? Not necessarily - the common names on the question above included all common names (the #1 most common name for boys born last year is “Liam”), so maybe people like common older names in particular? But I looked at people in the sample named John, Michael, Mary, and Sarah, and they didn’t differ much from the overall common names category. So people may think they would like names like these, but actual Johns and Marys wish they were named something a little more unusual. The least popular categories included “new-fangled name” and “sci-fi / fantasy name”. The most popular were “name honoring a deceased relative”, “name from your ethnic origin”, and “historical figure”. So that’s why I decided to name my children Napoleon Herschel Siskind and Hatshepsut Tzeitel Siskind. No, seriously, I’m not comfortable telling the Internet my kids’ names. I’ll let them get doxxed the usual way - by the NYT, the first time they express a problematic opinion. But I need some way to refer to them online, so their nicknames are Kai and Lyra. III. On December 13, 2023, two surprisal-minimization engines registered an unpredecented spike in surprisal. They were thrust from a sunless sea into a blooming buzzing confusion, flooded with inexplicable data through input channels they didn’t even know they had. The engines heroically tested hyperprior after hyperprior to compress the data into something predictable. Certain patterns quickly emerged. Probability distributions resolved into solid objects. The highest-resolution input channel snapped into place as a two-dimensional surface being projected onto by a three dimensional space. But - a blur of calculations - the three-dimensional nature of space implies that it must be intractably large! And if there are n solid objects in the world, that implies the number of object-object interactions increases as n(n-1)/2, which would quickly become impossible to track. Their hearts sinking, the engines started to worry it will might take hours before they were fully able to predict every aspect of this new environment. A panic reflex they didn’t know they had kicked in, and they began to cry. Some outside force picked them up, rocked them back and forth. A million inexplicable sense-data, overwhelmed by a single stimulus - a rhythmic stimulus. The predictability of importance-weighted sense-data shot way up! Kullback-Leibler divergence dropped to near-zero! The panic reflex subsided, and the engines - exhausted by their sudden spurt of computation - shut off to renormalize synaptic weights. Soon the engines will discover that things are even worse than they think. Some of their predictions are hard-coded; they will never be able to change them to match the world. Their only hope is to change the world to match their predictions: they are obligate agents. As they grow older, their goal systems will throw up increasingly complicated hard-coded forecasts; food, water, belonging, social status, sex. Their only path towards predictive accuracy will be to obtain all of these things from a hostile world. It’s a lousy deal. My poor, fragile, little cognitive engines! These, then, will be the twin imperatives of your life: surprisal minimization and active inference. If your brains are still too small to process such esoteric terms, there are others available. Your father’s ancestors called them Torah and tikkun olam; your mother’s ancestors called them Truth and Beauty; your current social sphere calls them Rationality and Effective Altruism. You will learn other names, too: no perspective can exhaust their infinite complexity. Whatever you call them, your lives will be spent in their service, pursuing them even unto that far-off and maybe-mythical point where they blur into One. If you pursue them only far enough to reduce your own predictive error, it will still be a life well-lived, and nobody will blame you for it. But if you choose, you can take an extra burden upon yourself, improving not just your own models but the broader predictions of the world. You can push forward the frontiers of knowledge, or improve the lot of all humankind. It’s a crazy thing to try, when even your own local predictions are so far from perfect accuracy. I cannot exactly tell you why you should want to do something like this. If you feel it, you feel it; if not, so it goes. But a parable: when you were born, your mother kissed you. Along with the kiss came a microdose of the BCS3-L1 genetically engineered bacterium. Without any teeth to cling to, it fell into the pit of your stomach and died. But she’ll kiss you again and again, transferring a few more BCS3-LI each time. In a few months, one of the colonists will find an incipient tooth and hang on for dear life. It will fight off competitors, wage epic battles that will determine the fate of the mouth for decades to come. It will win, because its genetic enhancements are pretty good. Then, if some smart people got their calculations right, it will do exactly nothing. No tooth decay. No cavities. The teeth will stay safe and clean. When you get older, I’ll tell you the story behind this. Your mother worked for a company synthesizing genetically engineered tooth bacteria that prevent cavities. She isn’t the kind of person who would push a product on others that she hadn’t tried herself. So she infected herself with the bacterium, fresh out of the lab. Other people in the company did the same. But only she was pregnant. Babies get their mouth bacteria from their mothers. So you might be the first children in the world to grow up without s-mutans-mediated tooth decay. Tooth decay isn’t the worst thing in the world. As victories go, this is a relatively minor one. I tell it to you only because it is ours. Our drop of water in a vast ocean of victories that have improved the lot of humankind on every continent, for as long as the species lasts. There is nothing that hammers this in like being a new father - nothing like seeing two tiny rudimentary week-old cognitive engines struggle not to fade into the entropic background. Kai, you wouldn’t come out of your mother on your own - the obstetrician used vacuum extraction to save your life. Neither of you was a great breastfeeder at first, and if we hadn’t had nurses and bottles and formula, you might not have made it. A few days after your birth, it rained two inches in fifty degree weather; if we didn’t have central heating and space heaters and warm blankets, who knows what would have happened? In 1800, about 50% of babies died before their fifth birthday. This statistic used to feel like a brute fact. Now I’m noticing all the little cracks that Death could creep in through, if we didn’t have our cornucopia of technologies and our team of vigilant pediatricians. There are two of you. Back in 1800, statistically, one of you would have made it. I look at you now - such beautiful, fragile cognitive engines - and I cannot bear the thought of losing either one. The statistics for the 21st century suggest I won’t have to. I was thinking about this recently, because - well, I feel kind of bad. I instantiated two surprisal-minimization engines - two conscious algorithms designed to feel negative qualia in the presence of hard-to-predict stimuli - on a world ruled by 195 mutually-hostile and frequently-shifting coalitions of over-evolved murder-monkeys, many of whom have nuclear weapons. I cannot quite remember why I thought this would be a good idea. I blame the pronatalist influencer conspiracy. But if I have any excuse at all, it’s excessive enthusiasm for this grand project of world-scale surprise minimization and active inference. You are here to benefit from it, to enjoy sensual and intellectual pleasures that our ancestors could never know. And also, if you choose, to continue it, push it forward into a new era. You have already contributed in a tiny way - as guinea pigs - to the conquest of tooth decay. But there are so many other worse sources of prediction error out there. What else might you conquer, my two little surprisal-minimization engines? IV. There is a secret known only to parents of twins, medical residents, and Alexey Guzey: the human body does not actually need sleep. After 31 hours awake, you get an integer overflow in God’s database and go back to being well-rested again. Also you gain the ability to see angels. This has become the new rhythm of our lives. Changing, nursing, burping, first one child, then the other. Twenty minutes per child, times two children, times once every 2-3 hours; you can do the math. We do everything else - laundry, shopping, cooking, occasionally even napping - in the precious intervals when both babies are asleep. The Snoo is a $1500 computerized bassinet that continually assesses babies’ needs and tries to calm them with various soothing noises and automated rocking motions. We got two, both of which have been soundly rejected. The twins insist on sleeping in their carseats, which we’ve grudgingly moved to the nursery. At first I was miffed, but now I see their logic. You’ve got to learn to resist the algorithmic content mills early. Kai has some baby version of Alien Hand Syndrome. His arms are controlled by a malevolent entity with a grudge against the rest of his body. If we leave them loose, they wave wildly in all directions, and he freaks out. This is apparently a common problem, best solved by heavy swaddling clothes. The malevolent entity struggles against the swaddle and occasionally breaks free, like some 1980s horror movie monster. Every nursing, we must struggle against it and bind it anew before returning him to his carseat. Lyra is already an overachiever. She has clearly read all the How To Be A Baby textbooks, learned when crying is appropriate, and only cries at those specific times. She drinks the exact amount of milk recommended on the Baby Age-Appropriate Nursing Chart, then refuses to accept more. I’m worried that if we don’t teach her to think independently soon, she’ll end up somewhere terrible like Harvard. I look over at them. They seem so peaceful in their stupid carseats. Let them sleep. Let them nurse as often as they want. They’ll need all their strength for what’s ahead. Kai. Lyra. You’ll live to see a million things that man was never meant to see. You were born just in time for a high-speed collision with the hinge of history. I’m only 39, I expect to be around when whatever-it-is happens - but if not, you’re our family’s ambassador to the singularity. A thousand generations, from hardy Neolithic farmers to studious Russian rabbis to overprivileged American office workers - they all lived and died so you could be here and experience this, and maybe tilt the course of what’s coming by a couple of micro-degrees. Parents are supposed to teach their children the skills they need to navigate the world. This already feels somewhat obsolete - where are the Google programmers who were taught Python by their fathers, or the Instagram influencers who learned content creation on their mother’s knee? Soon it will be completely hopeless. Where we’re going there are no roads. You’ll have to figure it out by yourself. If I am to pass on anything of value to you, it can only be the ultimate power, the technique that forms all other techniques. I’ve always wondered why I wrote so much. Now I realize I was leaving you bread crumbs. Happy holidays, from our family to yours. ACX will return to its normal posting schedule in January. …of 2042.

Soon it will be completely hopeless. Where we’re going there are no roads.This was a clear presentation of a thought that has bothered me a lot. It&#x27;s easy for me to get engaged and keep teaching my children specific techniques, so I have to occasionally stop and remind myself to teach them things like falsification, self-monitoring, incorporating feedback, noise filtering, pattern recognition, and other meta-skills that they can use to build far more skills than I could ever teach them. reply flatline 17 hours agoparentThe skills I try to instill in my kids are things like: empathy, self-regulation, effective communication, personal boundaries, autonomous decision making, high-level planning, and the basics of adulting. The biggest one I think is adapting to change, because their world will be even more mercurial than the one we are navigating now.I’m an expert software developer but have not spent time teaching these skills to my 10 year old son. He can get that from literally a hundred other places, and while I am a decent teacher, I’d rather spend our time together focusing on the things I place value on that I don’t think he is likely to get through other sources. I sometimes feel like a full-time therapist for my 12 year old daughter, what good is another A on her middle school report card when she is doing herself in trying to mold herself to meet others’ expectations? She needs an advocate more than a trade skill. reply kqr 11 hours agorootparentGreat point! I guess I haven&#x27;t thought of some of those things as teaching, but you&#x27;re right about their importance.Communication and emotional awareness in particular are two areas where I have had to grow immensely myself first in order to be a useful guide to my children. reply blitz_skull 14 hours agoparentprevI disagree with the premise of the quote. Parents are tasked with instilling the VALUES needed to successfully navigating the world. Knowing when to persist and when to quit an endeavor is a values-based calculation, not a skill. Yet it is incredibly important to know.Instill values. The skills will come naturally. reply yu3zhou4 15 hours agoparentprevThank you for this comment.

I couldn&#x27;t tell when he&#x27;s making things up. Did he really write about Taylor Swift for four months? Is anything he wrote about Swift true? Did he actually go to a protest where they started chanting \"from the river to the sea?\" (Soon after, it’s obviously fiction.)When I have to read something else to find out what actually happened, I think the writer is being too clever and too obscure for me.Then again, there are people here who clearly don&#x27;t get Scott Alexander and it&#x27;s clear to me when he&#x27;s joking, probably because I&#x27;m a long-time reader.

Not sure what the point of engaging in discussion on an article you admit to refusing to read is...So you are basically refusing to read this simply because the author is even willing to be aware of what&#x27;s in the bible. What a bizarre and anti intellectual stance.I&#x27;ve been seeing this strange kind of attitude more lately -- for example, I encountered a young person who refused to read books that were more than 20 years old \"because they might have bigoted ideas in them since they&#x27;re old\"But avoiding reading about the past because it scares you is a great way to remain stupid and cede control of the world to others without such hangups.> God smote Onan, starting a 4,000-year-old tradition of religious people getting angry about wasting sperm on anything other than procreative sex. reply briansm 3 hours agorootparentI dunno. &#x27;Ignorance is Bliss&#x27;.

Most individuals would internalize and accept that (like how most people accept and don&#x27;t question the religion they&#x27;re raised in)It wouldn&#x27;t take much people opting out for the population growth rate to become negative: anything less than 2 kids per couple on average, and the X (in X^N) goes below 1, meaning X^N decreases.Now that more people see the rigged game, they opt out, causing a difference families having more than 2 kids (say very religious families or whatever) can compensate for.It&#x27;s funny how it&#x27;s men bothering with that (the title is written to conviently exclude half the population): I guess it&#x27;s easier to see something as a problem when you don&#x27;t have to personally bear as much of the costs (in wear and tear of the body + risk of death a few centuries before) reply lovecg 11 hours agoparentprevIs it rational to do anything pro-social that might not have any direct benefit to oneself?

But being given an embarrassing nickname is a far cry from being smote by God. And if you get to inherit your brother&#x27;s riches, it might be a fair price to pay.But Onan&#x27;s sin is described as something he did, rather than something he failed to do. It is pretty clear, when you look at the text the way someone of that time would have looked at it, that Onan&#x27;s offense was not merely that he was being selfish, but that he was employing a method that severed the procreative element of the sexual act. He could have refused to marry Tamar. He could have refused to have sex with Tamar. But instead he fulfilled the letter of the levirate marriage custom without fulfilling its spirit. He used her for his own sexual satisfaction, but then deprived her of the natural ends of that action.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Deuteronomy%202... reply anonymous_sorry 19 hours agoparent> severed the procreative element of the sexual actSo by that reading it was only wrong because the understood purpose is the whole arrangement was to give Tamar a chance to have a child, which she was entitled to expect when Onan married her?It therefore has no bearing on what consensual activities couples may engaged in where no such commitment has been made? reply ajkjk 18 hours agorootparentWell yes it&#x27;s from literally biblical times.

Laws treating the rape of a wife as a crime against her husband were common in the 1960s. Laws prohibiting doctors from helping married couples have access to birth control lasted into the 1960s.All of these were based on the idea that marriage was an institution ensuring the continuity of future generations to the family and society. Because the broader family and society had a vested interest in the results of the marriage, the people involved had a responsibility to those around them. This was a widely accepted social norm just a few decades ago. reply Aloha 17 hours agorootparentI see &#x27;no fault&#x27; divorce as an extension of islamic divorce law - in practical terms its not an aberration though - we&#x27;d been employing various legal fictions in divorce cases to grant pseudo no-fault divorce as far back as the 1840&#x27;s - where yes &#x27;fault&#x27; was meaningless in the context of the granting of divorce - it just had to exist. reply btilly 15 hours agorootparentIslamic divorce law allows for no fault, but is also highly asymmetric in how easy it makes it for men and women. A man can initiate a no fault divorce at any time. A woman can ask for a no fault divorce, but it is up to the husband whether to grant it.Islam is not the only no fault divorce in history. For example ancient Rome allowed for no fault divorces, on more even terms than Islam later would. It&#x27;s terms were closer to modern US no fault divorces than Islam&#x27;s terms are.Modern US laws are reasonably equal between men and women, and do not come from either of those sources. US law comes from the fact that in some frontier states, the uneven ratio between men and women meant that people saw no reason for an unhappy couple to remain married. If they don&#x27;t want to be married, let them divorce. And let some other guy have a shot at the wife.This specifically became an issue with Nevada, because Nevada only required a 6 month residency in the state before you could get a divorce. As travel became easier, people from other states routinely took advantage of this as the easiest way to get divorced. That lasted until changing attitudes during the Sexual Revolution caused other states to start adopting similar laws.

    "originBody": "WebGPU now available for testing in Safari Technology Preview Dec 21, 2023 by Mike Wyrzykowski WebGPU is a new standards-compliant API that enables high-performance 3D graphics and general-purpose computations on the Web. WebGPU programs are written in JavaScript but expose GPU functionality, allowing GPU computing to be used in Web content for the first time. Starting in Safari Technology Preview 185, WebGPU can be enabled for early testing and development. To enable WebGPU, turn on the “WebGPU”, “GPU Process: DOM Rendering” and “GPU Process: Canvas Rendering” feature flags in the Feature Flags tab in Safari Preferences. If you don’t see the Feature Flags tab, you need to first check “Show features for web developers” in the Advanced tab. Once you have WebGPU enabled in Safari Technology Preview 185, try out this example of WebGPU. It utilizes many of the best features of WebGPU. WebGPU JavaScript API The WebGPU API is accessed through JavaScript, similar to WebGL. Creating a GPUDevice In order to use WebGPU, a device must be created. Resources and pipeline state are created from a GPUDevice instance. To create a device with default limits and features which are supported on all devices supporting WebGPU, we can pass zero parameters to the invocations of requestAdapter and requestDevice. const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter(); device = await adapter.requestDevice(); Configuring a GPUCanvasContext The GPUCanvasContext is an interface that allows you to configure how your content will be displayed in the corresponding HTMLCanvas element on the page. context = canvas.getContext('webgpu'); const canvasFormat = \"bgra8unorm\"; const contextConfiguration = { device: device, format: canvasFormat, alphaMode: 'opaque', }; context.configure(contextConfiguration); Creating a GPURenderPipeline A GPURenderPipeline or a corresponding GPUComputePipeline are used to configure the pipeline state of the graphics driver. This pipeline state is then used in a GPURenderPassEncoder or GPUComputePassEncoder as later illustrated. const shaderModule = device.createShaderModule({ code: wgslSource }); const vertexStageDescriptor = { module: shaderModule, entryPoint: \"vsmain\" }; const fragmentStageDescriptor = { module: shaderModule, entryPoint: \"fsmain\" }; const renderPipelineDescriptor = { layout: 'auto', vertex: vertexStageDescriptor, fragment: fragmentStageDescriptor, primitive: {topology: \"triangle-list\" }, }; const renderPipeline = device.createRenderPipeline(renderPipelineDescriptor); Issuing draw calls A GPURenderPassEncoder is created to send draw calls to the graphics driver. In the below example, we draw a simple triangle which contains three vertices. A GPURenderPassEncoder can also draw multiple instances of the same geometry or draw from an offset of a vertex buffer. const colorAttachmentDescriptor = { view: renderAttachment, loadOp: \"clear\", storeOp: \"store\", clearColor: { r: 0.15, g: 0.15, b: 0.5, a: 1 } }; const renderPassDescriptor = { colorAttachments: [colorAttachmentDescriptor] }; const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder(); const renderPassEncoder = commandEncoder.beginRenderPass(renderPassDescriptor); renderPassEncoder.setPipeline(renderPipeline); const vertexBufferSlot = 0; renderPassEncoder.setVertexBuffer(vertexBufferSlot, vertexBuffer, 0); renderPassEncoder.draw(3, 1, 0, 0); // 3 vertices, 1 instance, 0th vertex, 0th instance. renderPassEncoder.end(); const commandBuffer = commandEncoder.finish(); const queue = device.queue; queue.submit([commandBuffer]); WebGPU Shading Language WebGPU introduces WGSL, a platform independent shading language for the web. Here is an example of a WGSL shader source that would be passed in place of wgslSource in the above API call: const wgslSource = ` struct Vertex { @builtin(position) Position: vec4, @location(0) color: vec4, } @vertex fn vsmain(@builtin(vertex_index) VertexIndex: u32) -> Vertex { var pos: array, 3> = array, 3>( vec2( 0.0, 0.5), vec2(-0.5, -0.5), vec2( 0.5, -0.5)); var vertex_out : Vertex; vertex_out.Position = vec4(pos[VertexIndex], 0.0, 1.0); vertex_out.color = vec4(pos[VertexIndex] + vec2(0.5, 0.5), 0.0, 1.0); return vertex_out; } @fragment fn fsmain(in: Vertex) -> @location(0) vec4 { return in.color; } `; Try WebGPU and file bugs! We’re very excited to have an early version of WebGPU and WGSL in the latest version of Safari Technology Preview. Please do try it out. Check out the public repository of WebGPU samples. And file bugs or issues you discover at bugs.webkit.org.",

Because Safari (in collaboration with Firefox) are the ones who presented the WebGPU proposal reply flohofwoe 14 hours agorootparentWebGPU doesn&#x27;t have much in common with Apple&#x27;s original proposal (which was more or less a Javascript API around Metal). I suspect the new implementation is a complete rewrite from the original proposal, since earlier versions of Safari contained an implementation of the Apple proposal, which was then removed for a very long time while work happened on WebGPU. reply Lichtso 13 hours agorootparentWhile that is true, it also true that Apple had a major influence on the current design and is e.g. the reason why we got WGSL [0] as a source language instead of a bytecode (a GPU WASM equivalent if you will).[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;WGSL&#x2F; reply slimsag 12 hours agorootparentPeople keep spreading this incredibly misleading statement - god knows I do not like Apple&#x27;s closed-source behavior, but at this point people are basically just spreading lies about the situationBy all accounts, Apple&#x27;s &#x2F;only&#x2F; stance was that if WebGPU used SPIR-V it would be a non-starter for them, due to ongoing legal issues between Apple and Khronos.Apple actually proposed WebHLSL in collaboration with Microsoft, to have HLSL be the standard.Mozilla employee&#x27;s stance[0] was that SPIRV was too low level, did not fit with the goals of WebGPU portability and security, and expressed concern that Khronos may add functionality to SPIRV they cannot support in WebGPU like raytracing instructions .. &#x27;So we&#x27;d always be on the verge of forking SPIR-V in some way.&#x27;It was also noted by many people that even if a bytecode format was used, it would still have to be translated to the target (HLSL&#x2F;DXIL, MSL, etc.) in almost the same way a text format would.Nobody proposed a &#x27;GPU WASM equivalent&#x27; or an alternative bytecode format, only SPIRV was ever considered AFAIK.The hard truth is that shader compilation is a fucking nightmare, people do not realize how bad it is across the different native APIs. SPIR-V is good, but it doesn&#x27;t solve that - and presents other challenges if you are a web browser API. Vulkan and SPIRV are not the golden goose many make them out to be.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;gpuweb&#x2F;issues&#x2F;847#issuecomment-642... reply Lichtso 11 hours agorootparentI might have expressed myself in an ambiguous and extravagated way, just to be clear, I was not complaining about WGSL. I actually do like it a little better than GLSL and HLSL, though it still leads to more standards &#x2F; fragmentation.And exactly, Apple did not want SPIR-V (a bytecode) and proposed WebHLSL (a textual source language) instead. So, I think my statement that Apple preferred a textual format over a bytecode is correct. They could have proposed another bytecode format, but as you noted, nobody did.It does not really matter anyway, because the GPU hardware and software paradigms are still undergoing rapid change. And there are a whole lot of under-specified things like memory models, scheduling order, control flow uniformity etc. which I expect will take another iteration of standards to be established. reply modeless 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat you linked was a \"devil&#x27;s advocate\" position from kvark, not his balanced personal opinion. At this point the decision against SPIR-V was already made and he was not trying to get anyone to change their minds back.> By all accounts, Apple&#x27;s &#x2F;only&#x2F; stance was that if WebGPU used SPIR-V it would be a non-starter for themThis is false. Apple&#x27;s other stance, very strongly stated, was that no binary IR of any kind was acceptable, full stop. Lichtso&#x27;s original comment is right. Apple explicitly rejected \"GPU WASM equivalent or an alternative bytecode format\", not just SPIR-V. They would only accept a textual programming language.Now Apple didn&#x27;t mandate WGSL, but clearly they wouldn&#x27;t have accepted GLSL either for their unfortunate legal reasons so that pretty much leaves WHLSL or \"new language\" as the only options. I don&#x27;t know why WHLSL ultimately lost. I remember hearing arguments that HLSL as a language was essentially implementation defined rather than rigorously standardized, making it hard to realize any benefit of code portability or reuse from existing codebases. reply slimsag 4 hours agorootparentWhat he wrote was not just a devils advocate position. I encourage everyone to read it in full. Also his &#x27;Horrors of SPIR-V&#x27; article a year later[0] which has this conclusion:> I had a chance to work with SPIR-V rather intimately, and I’m becoming convinced that most of the defenders of this format (who like to criticize WGSL in turn) have little experience actually doing anything with it [...] I was one of them. SPIR-V is probably a good format for what it was made for: driver compilers. It’s not as good for the intermediate portable representations of your shaders.[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kvark.github.io&#x2F;spirv&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;01&#x2F;spirv-horrors.html> Apple&#x27;s other stance, very strongly stated, was that no binary IR of any kind was acceptable, full stop.Very strongly stated &#x2F;where&#x2F;?I linked my source, in which kvark clearly stated two things (not as part of his &#x27;devils advocate&#x27; position) that directly contradict your claim:> There is much more to it than just \"Apple cannot do X\" that often shows up.> the group agreed to [...] take the semantics of SPIR-V where it makes senseIf there really is a source for it, I&#x27;d love to see it (genuinely). reply modeless 2 hours agorootparentClearly neither of those two things directly contradict my claim that Apple refused binary formats. It&#x27;s weird that you would even say that. My source is I was in the meetings where Apple refused binary IR. Man, you&#x27;re going to make me look up the meeting notes, aren&#x27;t you?OK, I found what I believe are the most relevant meeting notes [1]. Unfortunately the meeting notes are not a straight transcript and not everything that was said is in there verbatim. There were also side discussions not captured at all. The meeting notes say \"Apple would strongly prefer a text-based language to a binary one\". This is really an understatement of their position on the matter, and the notes don&#x27;t capture the most contentious arguments well. But you can at least see in the notes that Apple was arguing strenuously against binary formats generically, even more so than SPIR-V itself in this meeting, going as far as arguing that a hypothetical SPIR-V assembly in text format would be better than SPIR-V in binary form.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1CmKo59tjZwmePVrFpHpIG0W5... replyksec 5 hours agoprevIt seems most comments are mostly interested in some sort of LLM or Gaming on the web.

That said, a third implementation would be nice, too! reply rwbt 12 hours agorootparentA third implementation and also having a WebGPU.framework built-in and shipped with the OS (like all other first party frameworks) would simplify the build and debug process. reply tormeh 11 hours agorootparentWhy? Isn’t it easier to bundle your dependencies rather than deal with whatever may or may not be installed on the client system? reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentIf it was a system vended framework you wouldn’t be beholden to whether it’s installed or not. It would just be available from a given OS version onwards.That means easier builds for the developer, smaller apps, receiving implicit upgrades in lockstep with the OS. Take the example of new metal versions enabling new optimization avenues. Bundling your own dependency would mean that you need to keep on top of the changes to take advantage of it , but with a system framework you’d get it whenever Apple’s engineers enable it. reply rwbt 10 hours agorootparentprevDawn & wgpu projects are great but having native WGSL support with-in Xcode would be pretty nice. They already have the whole spec implemented anyways, why not as a standalone framework? reply JeffSnazz 12 hours agoparentprevThe cross-platform \"OpenGL successor\" seems to be gfx-rs. It&#x27;s not clear why one would expect a specific vendor to champion this. reply lpghatguy 12 hours agorootparentgfx-rs hasn&#x27;t been maintained for several years. The successors are definitely wgpu or Dawn, which are championed by browser vendors. reply adastra22 11 hours agorootparentwgpu is gfx-rs, no? It’s just a name change. reply fidotron 11 hours agoprevI am torn about WebGPU - on the one hand it is a necessary improvement, but it does radically increase the attack surface area in ways that just a few years ago would have been complained about by the browser security teams. (The spectre countermeasures around high resolution timing can still bite you).This makes me suspicious that something has changed to push the balance here, and it must be something to do with trying to offload the execution of LLMs and related neural networks on to clients to reduce the cost of doing it server side. reply armchairhacker 9 hours agoparentI think browsers should require sites to request access to WebGPU like they do location and camera.If a random webpage is asking to use my GPU (especially if it&#x27;s a sketchy-looking site I just got redirected to), that would raise flags and I&#x27;d deny access. If a game or visualization requests access, especially if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve heard others praise, I&#x27;d take the risk.Sure, someone could embed a vulnerability in some decent app which uses the GPU for actual rendering, but it&#x27;s a lot harder. reply brundolf 4 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it would be pretty hard to explain \"GPU access\" to a regular person in a little dialog blurb reply MBCook 7 hours agorootparentprevEven w&#x2F;o a vulnerability a GPU is a great way to burn battery on a mobile phone fast thanks to some stupid effect on a web page or in an ad.I like the permission idea. reply esperent 7 hours agoparentprev> it does radically increase the attack surface areaI&#x27;ve seen this argument being made quite often.

UA detection is needed for detecting bug version.For example Wake lock API has been broken from iOS 16.4 that is like over 9 months.Or zindex rendering was flickering between iOS 15.7 to 16.4Some renderings work in Desktop safari but it is different in mobile safari with same version.It sucks but it is reality of iOS developer experience. reply mkw5053 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;m curious why Apple is now putting effort behind the web when it competes with their app store distribution.

At the time Apple was promoting performance and power efficiency. I’ve been very happy. Sometimes I do run into css stuff that is missing, and PWA is still not great. Latest PWA screw up is that the app won’t switch to dark mode except if you force quit the app, and then it gets stuck on dark mode. This worked perfectly prior to iOS 17.My point is that Apple is competing with other browser implementations on MacOS, yet I’ve very rarely used anything other than Safari. Most exceptions have actually been because I need a plugin to debug the JS framework I’m using. reply naet 12 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re competing a lot less than they could be by nature of being the default browser, and also by not allowing non-webkit based browsers on the iOS apple store. I think without those very few people would be opting in to Safari.I read that both Google and Mozilla are developing non webkit iOS browsers in anticipation of some regulatory changes, and also that Apple has been staffing up the webkit&#x2F;Safari team in response. reply idonotknowwhy 11 hours agorootparentLack of real Firefox is the actual blocker for me using an iPhone. But at the same time, I&#x27;m glad ios only allow safari and I hope the EU don&#x27;t change this.

According to [1] Safari has 28% market share on MacOS. [Edit: This site was wrong, the real number is 37%, see below for a link]If WebKit&#x27;s market share on iOS were to drop this low, web developers would likely test for WebKit a lot less, and tolerate WebKit&#x27;s missing features a lot less, and Apple would soon face much worse web compatibility problems on both platforms. To prevent that they saw that they needed to seriously step up their investment in WebKit, and from what I&#x27;ve observed it seems like they did. Though perhaps not yet to the level they really need. Old habits die hard.Of course they could just do what Microsoft did and give up.

They were the first to get ES6 support (and the only to implement tail calls), they’re usually the first with CSS features reply cutler 14 hours agorootparentSo why do a lot of sites I visit still fail in Safari? reply acdha 14 hours agorootparentIt’s rare to see that but almost every time I have looked it’s been because the developer did something which used a Chrome API instead of a web standard. I’ve found it best to develop in Firefox and Safari, because Chrome almost always works the first time you test it and you don’t accidentally introduce a dependency on something which is still being standardized. reply chrismorgan 14 hours agorootparentHonestly, this hasn’t always been my experience: multiple times I’ve targeted Firefox for doing something mildly out of the normal but absolutely within spec and supported across the board for years, and then tried it in Chromium and found debilitating bugs, to the point where once in a case of CSS blending I just had to give up on the entire concept, or else the page would just stop rendering after 8192px.I’ve never actually developed against Chromium, and my position as a staunch Firefox user (and a Nightly user at that, for at least eleven of the last thirteen years) may be negatively affecting my judgement in this, but although what you say may be true from a features perspective, I don’t find that at all difficult to manage, and from a bugs perspective my impression is that Chromium has historically tended to be much buggier: that Firefox shipped better quality, later, while Chromium shipped lower quality, earlier. Though I do get the sense that this is less true than it used to be, and that Chromium is generally of higher quality for features of a certain age now than five years ago. And I reiterate, this is about the vibes I’ve got, as a Firefox user. I’ve tended to have to file more interesting or problematic bugs against Chromium than against Firefox. reply acdha 11 hours agorootparentI’m not definitely not saying any browser is perfect - I’ve filed many bugs against all of the major browsers - but I think Chrome took over from IE in the category of browsers which a certain type of developer uses as the only browser and decides that if it works for them it’s ready to ship. I’m not sure I’ve ever had someone rant in the inverse case saying that if code works in, say, Safari but not Chrome it must mean that Chrome is a terrible browser and shouldn’t be used. That default mentality is toxic for the web but not uncommon. reply mdasen 14 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t found this to be a problem, but if you do I might suggest looking at the options under the view menu.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;lMHkiH8.jpg\"Reload Without Content Blockers\" and \"Reload Reducing Other Privacy Protections\" might be what you need. It might be Safari&#x27;s anti-tracking&#x2F;cookie features that might be at fault or it might be that you have a content blocker that&#x27;s causing an issue. If you&#x27;re using iCloud Private Relay, it&#x27;s possible that sites are filtering those IP addresses or there&#x27;s a DNS issue and you can use \"Reload and Show IP Address\" to check that. For example, iCloud Private Relay often uses Cloudflare&#x27;s DNS. archive.is doesn&#x27;t work with Cloudflare&#x27;s DNS (because Cloudflare won&#x27;t leak your location to their DNS servers and so archive.is returns bad results to them). reply naet 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had various different issues with Safari as a developer for the last few years (also frequently paired with SVGs for some reason). In the absence of IE, Safari has the perfect combination of decent market share and bugs that for my company we get a lot more Safari specific reported issues than any other browser.It&#x27;s usually smaller things like SVGs not working with CSS animations, or SVG filters causing weird edge case issues, but I&#x27;d really expect any major browser to fully support something like SVG and it&#x27;s a little disappointing to find that the browser is the issue. reply troupo 2 hours agorootparentNot to defend Safari in this case, just to give perspective: SVGs are the forgotten unloved child that very few people building browsers care about.

Usually just things that are more visual, like color spaces and theming. They still drag their feet on a lot of features, but they are getting better. reply mdasen 14 hours agoparentprevOne could say the same for Google&#x27;s browser investments as well. At this point, if Chrome and Safari don&#x27;t implement something, it basically doesn&#x27;t exist as a web technology. The only other engine is Firefox sitting at 3% of usage.In Apple&#x27;s case, I think there&#x27;s some utility behind their drive for WebGPU: it&#x27;s basically Apple&#x27;s Metal graphics API. If WebGPU takes off, it&#x27;ll mean a lot of developers getting familiar with something very similar to Apple&#x27;s Metal API. Apple seems to be pursuing a long-term strategy of bringing more games to their platform. From the Game Porting Toolkit to ray tracing in their processors to Apple Vision to simply giving gaming a lot more attention in their keynotes.And Apple might be well positioned to capitalize on gaming. A $130 Apple TV has a lot more CPU and graphics power than a Nintendo Switch. The same applies to the iPhones people are carrying around. It might not compete with giant consoles from Microsoft and Sony, but Apple has been showing that it can offer impressive gaming performance.Fast forward to 2026: does a next-gen Apple TV have hardware ray tracing? Apple put a 2021 A15 processor in the 2022 Apple TV. It seems reasonable that they could put something better than a 2023 A17 Pro in a 2026 Apple TV (a 3 year old processor at that point). Sure, Microsoft and Sony will have next-gen consoles, but at what point are graphics facing diminishing returns? Nintendo has the most popular console even though it&#x27;s older and was low-powered to begin with. For PC games, one must assume that some people are running graphics cards that are older.I&#x27;m not saying this will happen. Companies can be fickle. However, Apple has show a reasonably consistent (if slow) move toward games over the past year or two. They&#x27;re making the investments now and WebGPU&#x27;s Metal-like API could be part of that strategy.Heck, maybe WebGPU is even a strategy to avoid lawsuits from companies like Epic and anti-trust action from regulators. If you don&#x27;t like the App Store rules, just use WebGPU. If games with native-level graphics can be distributed via the web, then there isn&#x27;t nearly as much for regulators to go after the App Store. reply afavour 14 hours agoparentprevApple tends to put effort behind web APIs long after others do. WebGL, progressive web apps, etc etc… they put the effort in when it’s starting to become a competitive disadvantage not to.WebGPU feels like an outlier in that respect but then it is intended as a “better” WebGL so it makes sense that if you already have WebGL you might as well have WebGPU. It’s a lot closer to Apple’s Metal API than WebGL is so they have an interest in people switching. reply megaman821 14 hours agoparentprevIt could also be strategic. A more capable web browser along with better PWA support, could be an offering to the EU to settle app store monopoly issues. Apple could say they have made it so easy to install quality apps from the web there is no need to mandate alternative stores. reply bonestamp2 13 hours agorootparentOn this same point, if they don&#x27;t keep up with PWA support, they risk getting left behind by application developers.

So, your options will be a subscription or ads.But, a subscription is too much hustle for small utilities and casual games. And I love apps like Procreate that are paid, without subscription and ad-free. reply deergomoo 12 hours agorootparent> So, your options will be a subscription or ads.We&#x27;re basically there already unfortunately, even for store-distributed software. Apps like Procreate and Pixelmator are a rarity these days.It definitely doesn&#x27;t help that the App Store makes charging for new major versions awkward, and that upgrade discounts are basically impossible, but I suspect the main reason is that most developers just make more money from subs than purchases.As a consumer though, it sucks. Subscriptions are fine if your product has an ongoing cost to you as the developer, for example server or API fees. And I really don&#x27;t mind JetBrains-style subs, where you can cancel any time and you retain access to the last version you paid for, for as long as it still works on your machine. But, while I appreciate the need for ongoing revenue to continue paying salaries, I am not interested in renting software in perpetuity—that&#x27;s not a fair deal.

Vast majority of \"apps\" would work just as well, or better, as a website. In fact a lot of them do, e.g. this very site.I think a part of it is an \"app craze\", i.e. organizations want \"apps\" just because \"an app\" is something fancier and totally different than \"just a website\". I have done an \"app\" like this (implemented as an optionally installable website).Also many people, including many developers, also vastly underestimate what can be done with contemporary browsers, so they assume that \"a native app\" is needed if you e.g. want to take a picture or read a file. reply jamil7 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause PWAs on mobile remain kind of underwhelming still.

Because Apple uses Webkit to render a bunch of their \"native\" UIs, they&#x27;re often first to adopt native-like interactions or css features (or proposed them themselves), like backdrop-filter or CSS Scroll Snap. Because the web can have a pretty big impact on battery life on phones and laptops, they&#x27;ve also always had a pretty fast and energy efficient js engine.I&#x27;m really doubtful Apple sees Safari as competition for their app store distribution.

Even with the recent PWA additions it doesn’t seem to matter.At this point I’d say Safari is 100% a hedge against being fully dependent on Google&#x2F;Chrome.

I have looked recently, am I missing one? Gnome Web is a like a Fischer-Price browser. reply ho_schi 13 hours agoparent [–] Epiphany is nice. Especially because it features a native toolkit with Gtk4. What few developers do is incredible :)Main issues: * Since introduction of sandboxing the memory-usage is far too high. It was pretty low before. * WebRTC. They had it nearly implemented years ago. Then removed it because they were unhappy with it. But their new approach isn’t available until now. * Many more developers needed. This means me? * Epiphany releases are linked to GNOME releases. Only applications which are integrated parts of GNOME should do that. The rigid six months release cycle is problematic.Regarding memory usage. Sandboxing depends on multi-process. The multi-process shouldn’t be an issue. The sandboxing was added in late 2019 and - if I remember correctly - Epiphany started to eat memory. Like probably most people I keep my tabs when closing&#x2F;opening the Web-browser. The developers are nice and explained, that for all previous existing tabs a separate sandbox process and a render-process is already started with a blank page. And due to need separation no process is allowed to share memory with others. What is needed is only showing a label on the tab until the tab is actually used.And. Midori? There was previously also Midori using WebKitGtk. I liked it and it was pretty nice. But something awkward happened and an unrelated people took over the name and started to ship Electron (i.e. Google Chrome) as “Midori”. It looks untrustworthy to me, I recommend to not install it.If you use Midori on Archlinux you should be save - they ship and old and original version of Midori. But it is old.Apple, WebKit and WebKitGtk work together for many years. Good work. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Use it all the time for listening to lectures and presentations as podcasts. reply j1elo 18 hours agoparentI tried to do the same with music but for some reason the next enqueued song has the tendency of going straight up to 20 min, 60 min, 3 hour, 10 hour long videos.Not sure why. But this was reliably repeatable. Starting from any given song, I&#x27;d hit Next and before 5 to 10 videos I&#x27;d already be in the 10hrs long spectrum.Another thing that would also happen too frequently is that the next suggested video gets locked on always different videos of the same song. Once and again.Without any way to limit video duration and some filter to skip videos with a too similar name to the ones already played, it was useless to me.We could argue that that&#x27;s just the next video suggested by YouTube&#x27;s server. But YouTube ReVanced, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t exhibit any of those issues and starting from any song, will enqueue a variety of mostly non-repeated, single-song videos. Much better. reply opan 17 hours agorootparentAre you not putting specific videos into a playlist and then playing the playlist?

It streams only the MP3 of the video and the UI is cleaner imo - so it&#x27;s easier to use if you intend to only listen to \"podcasts\" or music as an alternative to Spotify. reply no-reply 20 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t know about Ymusic as it doesn&#x27;t seem open source, but seal [0] seems like a good alternative, based on yt-dlp0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JunkFood02&#x2F;Seal reply crtasm 15 hours agorootparentprevSounds good.

And if you just want the audio, there are music-focused YT apps (ViMusic, or like sibling said, YMusic) reply explorigin 19 hours agorootparentNewpipe has a built-in \"Play in Background\" feature that would be awesome while driving. There are tons of podcast-like content videos on YT that would be fine for a commute. reply jcalve 18 hours agorootparentIt works in my car, I have it running in background mode and I just select the media player in the car menu, no Android auto needed. reply noman-land 18 hours agoprevNewPipe is overwhelmingly my most used app. It&#x27;s simply amazing. reply trulyrandom 22 hours agoprevI remember there being talks of a complete rewrite of Newpipe. Did anything come of that? I&#x27;m a happy user, so I don&#x27;t really have an opinion on whether it should happen or not. reply the-scrabi 19 hours agoparentSchabi here: The team wants to start the rewrite in 2024 after 0.26.0 got released. The reson for the rewrite: Codebase got hard to maintin so we need to refactor. Also android changed the UI style and the UI frameworks a lot. We want to stay up to date with that. reply sureglymop 18 hours agorootparentHow does one get involved? Are contributors welcome? – I know Kotlin and Jetpack Compose much better than the old ways of Android UIs though. reply the-scrabi 13 hours agorootparentYes. Contributors are abaoloutly welcome, and Jetpack and Kotlin is exactly what we are looking for. However we need to prepare and sort out things before we can start. Stay put and follow our blog to find out when we begin: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpipe.net&#x2F;blog reply russdill 16 hours agorootparentprevPretty happy 0.26.0 went out first. There&#x27;s a lot of big changes and fixes in there that really are huge steps forward in the app. reply kzrdude 22 hours agoprevNewpipe has always unreliable and prone to not working for me, unfortunately. Crashes. Youtube import gives just 4 subscriptions while I have hundreds and so on. reply csydas 22 hours agoparentCan you elaborate ont he crashes more? when i still had an android phone newpipe was the only app i actively enjoyed using because it was just reliable and simple. the only issues i ever had were the same everyone had when youtube broke the functionality and usually there was a dev build ready in a few hours with a patch and then a proper update pretty shortly after on the main app. but i never used it to sign in to youtube so might be a difference. i specifically chose newpipe because i didn’t need to deal with google’s nonsense when using it reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m using an old version (2.5.2) and just opening a video will cause an error (\"Sorry, something went wrong\" banner) but the video still plays so I don&#x27;t care. rarely the whole thing will crash, but I&#x27;ve only seen that after hours of abuse (hundreds of videos viewed&#x2F;downloaded)The only other problem I regularly see are queued downloads being suddenly&#x2F;silently deleted which is frustrating because you have to try to remember what it was you&#x27;d queued up. Maybe that&#x27;s been fixed already? reply interloxia 21 hours agorootparentprevI have had a lot of ui crashes unrelated to YouTube over the years. Perhaps similar to the f-droid client. Not enough that it&#x27;s unusable, mostly, but enough to try to avoid it either by suffering through ads or using an alternative.For example, this release fixes a foreground service crash that made background play unusable for me for a while. reply pydry 19 hours agorootparentprevI had a lot more crashes until I started using the official newpipe repository. The fdroid version lags by a few days.I think it should just be taken off fdroid. reply ksjskskskkk 22 hours agoparentprevevery single newpipe problem is google actively breaking them.every time it crashed failing to parse some video is even more reason to use it! reply vanderZwan 20 hours agorootparentI mean, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s also still plain old bugs from human error in there.But yes, if it breaks on YT specifically it&#x27;s almost always due to YT. reply FireInsight 22 hours agoparentprevI used Newpipe first after degoogling, then switch to Libretube for the supposed privacy benefits. App looked a bit better too and crashed often, but way too often there were problems with connecting the Piped instances it was using for streaming and it was laggy and slowly. Newpipe, conversely, when it works, is fast. Sometimes it crashes repeatedly but the problems are usually resolved quickly. Streaming is good quality and fast. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 20 hours agoparentprevI really hope \"Fix app not responding, background app crashes and issues with starting the player\" actually addresses the issue. Getting an ANR popup and having to either dismiss it every 15 seconds or kill the app, search again for your video, and hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again is a horrible experience.The only other experience-breaking issue I ran into is lack of support for multiple language tracks, which also seems fixed :) reply iforgotpassword 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve switched to it maybe two months ago and use it in foreground and background mode, tried pip mode once or twice. But I&#x27;m using it almost every day. I had maybe four or five crashes so far, nothing that comes even close to the annoyance of YouTube&#x27;s ad rate nowadays. reply imglorp 19 hours agorootparentSolid for me.Also it&#x27;s not just the ad rate but also the recommendation drek: it&#x27;s hard to follow subscriptions even, in the yt app or Web client. reply kzrdude 19 hours agorootparentprevWhy I cope with youtube: adblocker ensures no ads and addon enables background play. Firefox on Android. reply iforgotpassword 17 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t really like having YouTube be just another tab in my browser on mobile, it seemed too clunky. So until I switched, I didn&#x27;t want to bother with 3rd party apps, since the experience a few years ago was horrible (forgot which ones I tried though).Also I had that little bit of respect to support creators by not blocking ads. But when there&#x27;s two unskippable 15 second ads before a 7 second shitpost video, at some point enough is enough.So while I mostly just switched because of the ads, what really was a huge improvement to me was how every time I tap a YouTube link now (messenger, browser, mail), I get a nice pop-up from NewPipe asking whether I want to play it right away in the app, play it right away but just audio in the background, or enqueue it (if something&#x27;s already playing). It&#x27;s a small detail but it&#x27;s such an improvement over \"just interrupt the current video without asking\". reply ekianjo 18 hours agorootparentprevNewpipe is much nicer in interface than youtube in firefox reply kzrdude 18 hours agorootparentWith the new version I think it&#x27;s a contender. Now the playlists per channel are available, which is essential. reply lupusreal 19 hours agoparentprevYt-dlp is still the gold standard, but in my experience newpipe&#x27;s reliability has improved in the past year or two. reply opan 17 hours agorootparentGonna piggyback off this comment to say that although this sounds barely relevant (cli tool vs android app) at a glance, you can actually use both yt-dlp and mpv in termux for playing audio on android as well. If you throw a comment at the end of the mpv command with artist&#x2F;song-name then it&#x27;s very fast to find with the ctrl-r reverse shell history search. Arguably faster than opening Newpipe and checking your history or playlists. Speaking of playlists, you could have .m3u files of URLs for mpv to play in termux as well. reply the_third_wave 22 hours agoparentprevDid you send crash reports, report the problem with the missing subscriptions, maybe even have a go at finding the cause if you happen to be versed in the technology? I&#x27;ve never seen it crash [1] on any of my devices so I can add that piece of anecdata to yours. I&#x27;m not a heavy Newpipe user since I run my own Invidious instance which offers close to the same functionality (minus playing in the background since that needs to be implemented on the device while Invidious is a web service) but for those times I do use Newpipe it works well. On those odd instances it doesn&#x27;t load the video the solution tends to be an upgrade away.[1] as in &#x27;the app crashes&#x27;, not &#x27;the video does not play&#x27;, the former is a crash while the latter is an incompatibility with Youtube and tends to be solved by upgrading Newpipe. reply kzrdude 20 hours agorootparentI feel bad now for posting something negative, it&#x27;s just a spontaneous report of me trying to use it. Since I&#x27;ve never successfully stepped over to using it and become a user, I don&#x27;t report bugs either. I&#x27;ve simply been curious to try, but content with youtube (mobile web version) reply Sakos 22 hours agorootparentprevIt crashed multiple times daily when I tried it a few months back. Same thing on my partner&#x27;s phone. reply orangepurple 18 hours agoparentprevStart the app and play something through one bluetooth device. Pause, then connect to another bluetooth device. App won&#x27;t play videos and bugs out. reply SpaghettiCthulu 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve recently started using [Grayjay](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grayjay.app&#x2F;). It&#x27;s not open source, but it is source available and individuals are allowed to modify the code to their liking. I&#x27;ve found that it crashes more often than NewPipe, but the vastly expanded features, more frequent updates, and improved performance fetching subscriptions are all worth it imo. reply ravenstine 23 hours agoprevSo glad this finally adds support for the \"Live\" tab on channels! reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 13 hours agoprevOnly use NewPipe for SoundCloud. Quite stable for that. For YouTube it&#x27;s a waste of time, IMHO. Constantly breaking, IME. Command line utilties for interacting with YouTube I wrote for myself are much more stable and almost never break. (Maybe once every few years. And fixed the same day by me.) reply autoexec 13 hours agoparent100% of my youtube use on mobile is via newpipe and I love it. On the desktop it&#x27;s all command line, but I can&#x27;t agree that newpipe is a waste of time.One of the features new pipe offers that I only started using is the ability to \"subscribe\" to channels. I never log into youtube, so subscriptions are client side only. They&#x27;re basically just a list of bookmarks, but newpipe can also go out and pull down a listing of new videos from the channels I&#x27;m subscribed to and i can categorize those channels into groups. It&#x27;s extremely useful!Newpipe does occasionally stop working, but it&#x27;s been many months since it last happened. When it does happen, it&#x27;s never newpipe&#x27;s fault. Blame google (who sometimes intentionally tries to break things), but when that happens the command line usually still works and updates are pretty fast.My only complaint really is that sometimes new pipe will clear a long list of queued downloads. I&#x27;m not sure what triggers it, but it can be difficult to go back and track down what was queued up. For all I know, that&#x27;s been fixed in this new update reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 4 hours agorootparent\"Newpipe does occasionally stop working, but...\"If I can write utilities that almost never stop working, and this is not difficult at all, then why should I tolerate that.I just checked to see id SoundCloud is working and sure enough it isn&#x27;t.

They put their content out on a platform that does not require my contribution. YouTube was, and is, never about \"compensating content creators\" and I am under no obligation to do so, but they get paid anyway.

No. reply 2Gkashmiri 29 minutes agorootparentyeah. my understanding is this.netflix&#x2F;amazon prime are PAID only services. either you pay and get access or you do not pay and dont get access.I am FINE with this. i have never paid for either and i do not plan to which means i cannot consume this media, again, fine by me.when you put something on public internet, i am under no obligation to \"compensate\" anyone. put a paywall and prevent me from accessing your \"service\" like netflix. reply autoexec 12 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t use sponcerblock, but I do download all youtube videos before watching them and I manually fast forward past the ads. I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help them either.As others have stated there&#x27;s no obligation to give youtubers your time&#x2F;attention&#x2F;money&#x2F;engagement, but when you&#x27;ve found a channel you enjoy it&#x27;s natural to want to help them continue to put out good content.Ultimately though my options for supporting youtubers are limited, because I&#x27;m not signing into youtube so I can&#x27;t even comment&#x2F;like&#x2F;subscribe&#x2F;ring bells or whatever else most people do.I have in the past donated to youtubers directly.

    "originBody": "LED Industrial Piercing 22 Dec 2023 Progress: Complete A friend of mine wears a type of jewellery known as an \"industrial piercing\" or \"scaffold\" that puts a bar across her ear. Always looking for a new challenge, I had the idea to fill the bar with LEDs. Watch the following video to experience the journey: This is one of a number of projects I rushed through in the run-up to the closure of London Hackspace. I've now not had access to a milling machine for over a year. Drilling holes in the side of a hypodermic needle would be a little tricky without one. Design Our journey begins in the summer of '22, when I snapped this image of my friend's ear. (With permission!) Could it be filled with LEDs? Most people laughed in disbelief when I suggested it. But everyone agreed that it would be really cool. You can buy stainless tubing in various sizes, but nothing quite compares to the cheapness and availability of hypodermic needles. A gauge 16 needle is exactly the right diameter, and the sidewall is so thin you couldn't ask for anything better. But needles are quite short, there was some concern that it wouldn't be long enough. I did find a supplier of extra long syringe needles intended for model makers, there might have been something in the right size, but after some careful measurements and calculations I decided the regular needles would be OK. I did the initial design in OpenSCAD, and having rotated the above photo into a scaled and skew-corrected position we could overlay the two in photoshop. That's before the final adjustments to length were made. This mockup was invaluable in getting the LED pitch and offset correct. OpenSCAD continued to be helpful as I came up with the circuit, thinking about how it would fold together and how much tolerance we needed to leave. Just a basic idea is all that's required. The PCB design had to wait until I'd gotten this all exactly right, the distances between the microcontroller and the LEDs is critical. A flex PCB is the way to get the very thinnest board possible. You can technically get 0.2mm FR4 from some board houses but it'll cost about the same as a flex PCB anyway. We could have gone flex-rigid, that would have let us use the thinnest material for the LEDs and a multilayer board for the microcontroller, but it would have cost a lot more and still not allowed us to put a connector above the microcontroller. Once I'd settled on those off-the-shelf earrings as the source of my battery holder, that determined quite a bit about the design too. The metal case is our positive battery terminal, we need to fit a wire that pokes out of the end of the needle to be the ground pin. I did a few redesigns of the board before settling on the above design. Even forgetting the fiddly exact dimensions of how it will go together, routing the LED tracks was tricky. If we had gone for the 0201 LEDs they could have been mounted in the other orientation, with tracks passing directly underneath them. Once I'd checked the dimensions I felt a lot more comfortable with the 0402 LEDs though. Metalwork Once I'd made the tiny brass V-block arrangement, crossdrilling the needle took barely five minutes. In my mind it was going to be a big deal. It helps that I used an endmill to drill the holes, not only would a drillbit have wandered on the curved surface but the carbide is simply a lot stiffer. I should really invest in some tiny carbide drills, you might say that HSS just doesn't cut it for me. The dodgy-but-still-kind-of-legit tactic of holding an endmill in the tailstock chuck no doubt made some viewers grimace. Drill shanks are soft, chuck jaws are hard. Endmill shanks are also hard which means the jaws won't grip them properly. If I'd had the proper tools I would have used them. Anyway you can't argue with the results, the flat-bottomed hole was spot-on. The 1.6mm through hole was a lot messier, the drillbit really wanted to wander. Again I yearned for all my tooling to be solid tungsten carbide. This formed a decent press-fit onto the needle. I suppose the hollow tube is fairly compressible. Even so, once I'd settled on the right position I gave the needle a healthy smear of cyanoacrylate before pressing it in for the final time. Remember, the battery-holding collet on the other end is going to be mounted and unmounted by simply pulling on this join, so we want it to be very secure. Circuit When the circuit boards arrived, I soldered one together almost immediately. For multiple reasons I then put it aside for about a year. It was only a few months ago that I powered the board up and got some flashing patterns going. The microcontroller is an ATtiny44. If I was designing this today I'd have gone with the CH32V003, which admittedly has worse power consumption, but the benefit of that one-wire debug pin can't be overstated. It now seems so silly that I had to wire up six pins to be able to reflash this thing. Sliding the circuit inside of the case and it already looks nearly finished. The thick black wire protruding from the end needs to be trimmed to form our battery negative terminal. But as you can see the power and ground pins are also exposed on the connector. In terms of software, the LEDs are charlieplexed and the pattern I settled on loops over the course of about three minutes. All in, the software is similar but a fair bit simpler than the charliestar, which does more with less. I will link to the source code at the end of the page. Assembly I should mention, the cheapo earrings I used for the battery case are not made from stainless. It's nickel-plated brass, which I realised when I started machining it. It does make me think I'd have had an easier time making the end out of brass and nickel-plating it. On the other hand the stainless does look pretty good, and with any luck it'll stay that shiny for a long long time. At this stage everything appeared to work perfectly, so I prepared some clear food-grade epoxy to fill the holes. I assume the reader has already watched the video, but if not, spoilers: after potting the bar with clear epoxy, one of the LEDs stopped working. Luckily it's on the end, so it's not particularly obvious. As this happened after the epoxy cured, there's no way to repair it. I'm not above building another one from scratch except that I'm currently between workshops. That, and I feel like it's been long enough that the next version should also be an improvement, not merely a second attempt. End Cap I originally planned to add one or more end caps to the design. These would connect into that programming header, which doubles as simply GPIO pins of the microcontroller, and offer various interfaces, such as a microphone or an IR receiver. I'm not saying it won't happen in the future but I didn't get round to it yet. And besides, the flashing pattern I settled on seems interesting enough for now. Case The case was modelled in OpenSCAD too. It's tricky to do fillets and chamfers, and I wasn't trying to make this look amazing or anything. In fact with the dead LED I wanted to wrap this up as quick as possible. But the case turned out great, it holds the device perfectly and you can just chuck it in a pocket without worrying. Here's an embeddiment. The scaffold is stored with the battery pack in the \"off\" position, i.e. pulled out a little. Click to load 3D model The hinges are dressmaker's pins through just-barely-press-fit holes. It's stiff enough that the lid will stay at any angle. The texture on the lid is from the bed of the 3D printer. It helps parts adhere while they're printing, but it also adds a bit of interest to the end result. Modelled It's a while since I've had a living, breathing person pose for my macro lens. It is quite tricky to get the exposure right, usually my subjects are inanimate. The flash does somewhat drown out the LEDs, makes it look a bit clinical. It's entirely possible I'll get some more pictures of the piercing being worn in future. It would be cool to do some long exposures with flash, so that the image is visible but the LEDs leave a trail. Battery Life I measured the current draw at just over 3mA. LR521 batteries have a capacity of about 10mA at best, which naively implies about 3 hours of battery life. However, the alkaline discharge curve is pretty steep and it's not clear at what voltage the chip will brown-out, it could potentially cut out well before the batteries are depleted. However, there's another battery in the same form factor called SR521, which is a silver-oxide battery. Not only does that give us about double the capacity, the discharge curve is much flatter so with those we should be good for at least five hours. Changing the batteries is about as fiddly as it looks. Really, instead of machining that collet to be bigger, I should have just reduced the diameter of our bar near the end, so the regular battery holders from the cheap earrings could be fitted unmodified. In that case, it would only take a second to swap the whole battery pack, instead of having to unscrew things. Conclusion Overall, to my surprise, there really wasn't anything particularly challenging in this project, for the most part all the bits I expected to be difficult turned out fine. Evidently the next piercing will need to be smaller and use those 0201 LEDs. I'm pretty pleased with the result. I was a bit disheartened when the LED died, as all of my joking about soldering things the hard way using the wrong equipment then sounds a bit pathetic. It's fine if you use terrible equipment and it works regardless, but if you use terrible equipment and it fails to work then you're just a fool. However when I saw the thing being worn I had to admit that it looks really good. If you would like to own one of these piercings, you simply can't. At least, it would be even harder for me to make and sell these than most of my inventions as the length has to be sized exactly to the wearer's ear. But, if you're totally loaded and you really want one, get in touch. The source code for the ATtiny is here. ~ mitxela.com » Projects » Hardware » LED Industrial Piercing Questions? Comments?

I made a decent sized donation at the start because I liked what they were doing, and took some great classes there on woodworking and CNC. The woodworking instructor in particular was really interesting as he was an old school pattern maker (patterns for casting) which involves different techniques than finish or furniture carpentry. He could build to 1&#x2F;64\" tolerances by using various combinations of sanders, including a stationary disc sander with a 1 yard diameter. That thing was a pretty cool piece of equipment.Unfortunately I&#x27;m sad to say besides the finances they had some cultural issues. A few of the instructors went pretty heavy on the \"boys club\" style humor in a way that would clearly alienate a lot of women. reply TaylorAlexander 12 minutes agoparentprevOmni Commons in Oakland is at a critical juncture in its history and we may lose the building in 2024.

    "originLink": "https://vgel.me/posts/faster-inference/",
    "originBody": "How to make LLMs go fast December 18, 2023 In my last post, we made a transformer by hand. There, we used the classic autoregressive sampler, along the lines of: def generate(prompt: str, tokens_to_generate: int) -> str: tokens = tokenize(prompt) for i in range(tokens_to_generate): next_token = model(tokens) tokens.append(next_token) return detokenize(tokens) This approach to inference is elegant and cuts to the heart of how LLMs work—they're autoregressive, consuming their own output. And for our toy model with merely thousands of parameters, it worked completely fine. Unfortunately, for real models it's far too slow1. Why is that, and how can we make it faster? This post is a long and wide-ranging survey of a bunch of different ways to make LLMs go brrrr, from better hardware utilization to clever decoding tricks. It's not completely exhaustive, and isn't the most in-depth treatment of every topic—I'm not an expert on all these things! But hopefully you'll find the information here a useful jumping off point to learn more about the topics you're interested in. (I tried to include links to relevant papers and blog posts where applicable.) Table of Contents Why is simple inference so slow? Metrics Hardware Compilers Batching Continuous Batching Shrinking model weights 16 bit floats Even smaller! KV caching Multi-Query Attention PagedAttention Speculative Decoding Threshold decoding? Staged speculative decoding Guided generation Lookahead decoding Prompt lookup decoding Training time optimizations Sparse attention Non-Transformer architectures Conclusion Thanks Why is simple inference so slow? There are two main reasons that inference with the plain autoregressive generate function is slow: an algorithmic one, and a hardware one. Algorithmically, generate has to process an increasing number of tokens every cycle, because each cycle we append a new token to the context. That means to generate 100 tokens from a 10 token prompt, you don't need to run model on only 109 tokens. You need to run it on 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + ... + 109 = 5,950 tokens! (The initial prompt can be processed in parallel, which is part of why prompt tokens are usually cheaper in inference APIs.) It also means that the model slows down as it generates, since each successive token generation has a longer and longer prefix: Attention, at least vanilla attention, is also a quadratic algorithm: all tokens attend to all tokens, leading to N² scaling, making everything worse. So that's the algorithmic reason. What's the hardware reason? Well, it's simple: LLMs are just huge. Even a relatively small model like gpt2 (117M parameters) is hundreds of megabytes, and all that data has to live in RAM. RAM is really slow, and modern processors (both CPUs and GPUs) make up for that by having lots of cache close to the processor that's faster to access2. The details of this differ based on type and model of processor, but the gist is that LLM weights do not fit in cache, so a lot of time is spent waiting to load weights from RAM. This has some unintuitive effects! For example, looking at the graph above, operating on 10 tokens isn't necessarily much slower than operating on a single token, even though the activation tensors are 10x larger, because the main time sink is moving the model weights around, not doing calculations! Metrics As a sidebar, what do we mean exactly when we say slow? There's a whole zoo of metrics people talk about when it comes to LLM inference: Time to First Token—how long is there between receiving the prompt and returning the first token? Generation Latency—how long is there between receiving the prompt and returning the final token? Throughput—how many distinct generations can we pass through the pipeline at once? Hardware Utilization—how efficiently are we using the compute, memory bandwidth, and other capabilities of the hardware? Different optimizations affect these metrics differently. For example, batching improves throughput and better utilizes the hardware, but can increase TtFT and generation latency. Hardware A straightforward way to speed up inference (especially if you're VC funded :-)) is to just buy better hardware, or if you can't afford that, to take better advantage of the hardware you have. If you're buying better hardware, most likely that would be some sort of accelerator—usually a GPU, or sometimes/if you're Google, a TPU. Using an accelerator can produce dramatic speedups (hence the name), but keep in mind that there's a transfer bottleneck between the CPU and the accelerator. If your model doesn't fit in the accelerator's memory, it will need to be swapped out throughout the forward pass, which can slow things down dramatically. (This is one of the reasons Apple's M1/M2/M3 chips punch above their weight for inference—they have unified CPU and GPU memory.) Another thing to keep in mind with both CPU and accelerator inference is whether you're taking full advantage of the hardware—a properly optimized program can squeeze more out of weaker hardware than a poorly optimized one can get out of the best hardware. For example, you could write attention in PyTorch as F.softmax(q @ k.T / sqrt(k.size(-1)) + mask) @ v, which will give you correct results. But if you instead use torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention, it will delegate the calculation to FlashAttention when available, which can produce 3x speedups using a handwritten kernel that better takes advantage of cache. Compilers A more general version of this is compilers like torch.compile, TinyGrad, and ONNX, which can fuse naive Python code into kernels optimized for your hardware. For example, I could write the following function: def foo(x): s = torch.sin(x) c = torch.cos(x) return s + c Naively, this function requires: A memory allocation of x.shape() for s A linear scan of x to calculate sin for each element Another memory allocation of x.shape() for c A linear scan of x to calculate cos for each element A memory allocation of x.shape() for the result tensor A linear scan of s and c to add them into the result Each of these things is slow, and some of the steps require jumping the boundary between Python and native code, which doesn't help. So what if I compile this function using torch.compile? >>> compiled_foo = torch.compile(foo, options={\"trace.enabled\": True, \"trace.graph_diagram\": True}) >>> # call with an arbitrary value to trigger JIT >>> compiled_foo(torch.tensor(range(10))) Writing FX graph to file: .../graph_diagram.svg [2023-11-25 17:31:09,833] [6/0] torch._inductor.debug: [WARNING] model__24_inference_60 debug trace: /tmp/...zfa7e2jl.debug tensor([ 1.0000, 1.3818, 0.4932, -0.8489, -1.4104, -0.6753, 0.6808, 1.4109, 0.8439, -0.4990]) If I go into that debug trace directory and open the output_code.py file there, torch has generated an optimized C++ kernel for my CPU that fuses foo into a single kernel. (If I had run this with a GPU available, torch would have generated a CUDA kernel for the GPU instead.) #include \"/tmp/torchinductor_user/ib/cibrnuq56cxamjj4krp4zpjvsirbmlolpbnmomodzyd46huzhdw7.h\" extern \"C\" void kernel(const long* in_ptr0, float* out_ptr0) { { #pragma GCC ivdep for(long i0=static_cast(0L); i0(10L); i0+=static_cast(1L)) { auto tmp0 = in_ptr0[static_cast(i0)]; auto tmp1 = static_cast(tmp0); auto tmp2 = std::sin(tmp1); auto tmp3 = std::cos(tmp1); auto tmp4 = tmp2 + tmp3; out_ptr0[static_cast(i0)] = tmp4; } } } Now, the steps are: A memory allocation of x.shape() for the result tensor A linear scan of x (in_ptr0) to calculate sin and cos and add them together into the result Much simpler and faster for large inputs! >>> x = torch.rand((10_000, 10_000)) >>> %timeit foo(x) 246 ms ± 8.89 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) >>> %timeit compiled_foo(x) 91.3 ms ± 14 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) # (for small inputs `compiled_foo` was actually slower--not sure why) Note that torch.compile specialized the code above for the specific size of tensor we passed in ((10,)). If we passed in tensors of many different sizes, torch.compile would instead generate code generic over the size, but having a constant size can enable the compiler to generate better code in some cases (e.g. via loop unrolling or better vectorization). Here's another function where torch.compile does something surprising: def gbreak(x): r = torch.sin(x) + torch.cos(x) if r.sum() >> compiled_gbreak = torch.compile(gbreak, options={\"trace.enabled\": True, \"trace.graph_diagram\": True}) >>> compiled_gbreak(torch.tensor(range(10))) Writing FX graph to file: .../model__27_inference_63.9/graph_diagram.svg [2023-11-25 17:59:32,823] [9/0] torch._inductor.debug: [WARNING] model__27_inference_63 debug trace: /tmp/torchinductor_user/p3/cp3the7mcowef7zjn7p5rugyrjdm6bhi36hf5fl4nqhqpfdqaczp.debug Writing FX graph to file: .../graph_diagram.svg [2023-11-25 17:59:34,815] [10/0] torch._inductor.debug: [WARNING] model__28_inference_64 debug trace: /tmp/torchinductor_user/nk/cnkikooz2z5sms2emkvwj5sml5ik67aqigynt7mp72k3muuvodlu.debug tensor([ 1.0000, -0.1756, 2.6782, -0.7063, -2.5683, 2.7053, 0.9718, 0.5394, 7.6436, -0.0467]) The first kernel implements the torch.sin(x) + torch.cos(x) and r.sum() (0L); i0(10L); i0+=static_cast(1L)) { auto tmp0 = in_ptr0[static_cast(i0)]; auto tmp1 = static_cast(tmp0); auto tmp2 = std::sin(tmp1); auto tmp3 = std::cos(tmp1); auto tmp4 = tmp2 + tmp3; out_ptr0[static_cast(i0)] = tmp4; tmp_acc0 = tmp_acc0 + tmp4; } out_ptr1[static_cast(0L)] = tmp_acc0; } } { auto tmp0 = out_ptr1[static_cast(0L)]; auto tmp1 = static_cast(0.0); auto tmp2 = tmp0 (0L)] = tmp2; } } And the second kernel implements the return r - torch.tan(x) branch, since this is the branch that was taken with the example input: #include \"/tmp/torchinductor_user/ib/cibrnuq56cxamjj4krp4zpjvsirbmlolpbnmomodzyd46huzhdw7.h\" extern \"C\" void kernel(const float* in_ptr0, const long* in_ptr1, float* out_ptr0) { { #pragma GCC ivdep for(long i0=static_cast(0L); i0(10L); i0+=static_cast(1L)) { auto tmp0 = in_ptr0[static_cast(i0)]; auto tmp1 = in_ptr1[static_cast(i0)]; auto tmp2 = static_cast(tmp1); auto tmp3 = std::cos(tmp2); auto tmp4 = tmp0 - tmp3; out_ptr0[static_cast(i0)] = tmp4; } } } This is called a graph break, and it's not good! The compiled function is slower due to it, since we have to leave the optimized kernel and return to Python to evaluate the branch. On top of that, the other branch (return r + torch.tan(x)) hasn't been compiled yet, since it hasn't been taken! That means it will be compiled on the fly when needed, which could be bad if it happens at an inopportune time (such as in the middle of serving a user request). A handy tool for understanding graph breaks is torch._dynamo.explain: # get an explanation for a given input >>> explained = torch._dynamo.explain(gbreak)(torch.tensor(range(10))) # there's a break, because of a jump (if) on line 3 >>> explained.break_reasons [GraphCompileReason(reason='generic_jump TensorVariable()', user_stack=[, line 3 in gbreak>], graph_break=True)] # there are two graphs, since there's a break >>> explained.graphs [GraphModule(), GraphModule()] # let's see what each graph implements, without needing to dive into the kernels! >>> for g in explained.graphs: ... g.graph.print_tabular() ... print() ... opcode name targetargs kwargs ------------- ------ ------------------------------------------------------ ------------ -------- placeholder l_x_ L_x_() {} call_function sin(l_x_,) {} call_function cos(l_x_,) {} call_function add (sin, cos) {} call_method sum_1 sum(add,) {} call_function lt (sum_1, 0) {} output output output((add, lt),) {} opcode name targetargs kwargs ------------- ------ ------------------------------------------------------ ----------- -------- placeholder l_x_ L_x_() {} placeholder l_r_ L_r_() {} call_function tan(l_x_,) {} call_function sub (l_r_, tan) {} output output output((sub,),) {} # pretty cool! Tools like torch.compile are a great way to optimize your code to get better performance out of your hardware, without dipping down to CUDA to write kernels the old-fashioned way. (If you do want to write kernels the old fashioned way, or are just curious about how it's done, I really enjoyed this post about trying to match cuBLAS's SGEMM performance from scratch on an A6000.) (And if you're curious about the compilers work, this post by @tekknolagi explores compiling models written in micrograd to C for a 1000-7500x speed increase!) Batching In the unoptimized version of generate, we pass the model a single sequence at once, and at each step ask it to append a token: llm( Mark is quick . He moves ) = quickly ⬇ llm( Mark is quick . He moves quickly ) = . ⬇ llm( … quick . He moves quickly . ) = [end] To batch generation, we instead pass the model multiple sequences at once, generating a completion for each in the same forward pass.3 This requires the sequences to be padded on either the left or right with filler tokens to equal length. The padding tokens (which can be anything, I'm using [end] here) are masked in the attention mask so that they don't influence generation. llm( Mark is quick . He moves [end] [end] The Eiffel Tower is [end] I like bananas because they ) = quickly in have ⬇ llm( Mark is quick . He moves quickly [end] [end] The Eiffel Tower is in [end] I like bananas because they have ) = . Paris no ⬇ llm( Mark is quick . He moves quickly . [end] [end] The Eiffel Tower is in Paris [end] I like bananas because they have no ) = [end] , bones ⬇ llm( … quick . He moves quickly . [end] … The Eiffel Tower is in Paris , … like bananas because they have no bones ) = Random France [end] Because batching sequences in this way allows the model weights to be used for multiple sequences at once, running the entire batch of sequences together takes less time than running each sequence separately. For example, on my machine, using GPT-2 to generate a next token for: 20 tokens x 1 sequence = ~70ms 20 tokens x 5 sequences = ~220ms (linear scaling would be ~350ms) 20 tokens x 10 sequences = ~400ms (linear scaling would be ~700ms) Continuous Batching Notice how in the example above, \"Mark is quick. He moves quickly.\" finished before the other sequences, but because the batch as a whole wasn't done, we were forced to continue generating tokens for it (\"Random\"). This isn't a problem for correctness—we can simply clip the generated sequence to the [end] token—but it is unfortunate, since GPU resources are being used to generate tokens we will just throw away. Continuous batching fixes this by inserting new sequences into the batch as other sequences complete, after their [end] tokens. Instead of generating random tokens after the [end] token, a new sequence can be inserted in that row of the batch, with attention masking to prevent the sequence from being influenced by the tokens from the previous sequence in the row. (Essentially, the prior sequence acts like additional padding.) llm( 1 2 3 4 [end] [end] a b [end] A B C ) = [end] c D ⬇ llm( 1 2 3 4 X[end] [end] a b c[end] A B C D) = Y [end] E ⬇ llm( 1 2 3 4 X Y [end] [end] a b c α [end] A B C D E ) = Z β [end] Shrinking model weights Floating point numbers come in different sizes, and that matters for performance. Most of the time for regular software (e.g., Javascript numbers and Python floats), we use 64 bit (double precision) IEEE 754 floating point. Most ML, however, has traditionally used 32 bit (single precision) IEEE 754: >>> gpt2.transformer.h[0].attn.c_attn.weight.dtype torch.float32 Models train and infer fine with fp32, and this saves 4 bytes (50%) per parameter, which is huge—a 7B parameter model would take up 56Gb in fp64, and only 28 Gb in fp32. Remember that large amounts of time during training and inference are spent moving data from RAM to cache and registers—the less data there is to move, the better. So while fp32 is better than fp64, can we do even better? 16 bit floats fp16, or half precision, is the obvious next step—another 50% savings! You have two main options here: fp16, and bfloat16 (short for brain float, since it was developed by Google Brain), which has better range but worse hardware support. It's easiest to see the distinction with a diagram showing the size of each field: fp32 sign exponent (8) fraction (23) 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 fp16 (IEEE half) sign exponent (5) fraction (10) 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 bfp16 (brainfloat) sign exponent (8) fraction (7) 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 When reducing the fields of a fp32, fp16 and bfloat16 made different tradeoffs: fp16 tried to balance between range and precision by shrinking both the exponent and fraction fields, whereas bfloat16 preserved the range of fp32 by keeping an 8-bit exponent, while sacrificing precision by shrinking the fraction field smaller than fp16. The loss of range can sometimes be a problem for training in fp16, but for inference either works, and fp16 is probably a better choice if your GPU doesn't support bfloat16. Even smaller! Can we go even smaller? Of course! One approach is to quantize a model trained in a larger format, like fp16. The llama.cpp project (and the associated ML library ggml) defines a whole zoo of quantization formats (the README is currently out of date, so make sure to check the k-quants PR as well), which can go down to less than 5 bits per weight from an fp32 or fp16 model. These quantizations work a bit differently than fp16 / bfloat16—there isn't enough room to fit a whole number in that space, so instead the weights are quantized in blocks, where an fp16 acts as the block scale, and then the block of quantized weights are each multiplied against that scale. (In some formats, there's also a min value, and sometimes the scale and min are themselves quantized to still be smaller than fp16—it's complicated! See the k-quants PR for more details about how it's implemented in GGML, and this post for more details about why quantization is challenging.) bitsandbytes also implements quantization for non-llama.cpp projects. (I don't have much experience with it personally, though, besides dealing with it as a transitive dependency when it doesn't want to install on Lambda Labs instances :-)) However, the smaller you go with quantization of a model trained with wider parameters, the more it can start to affect the model's performance, reducing the quality of responses. It's best to go with the least amount of quantization that will give you acceptable inference speed. However, it's also possible to finetune or train models with datatypes smaller than fp16. For example, you can train quantized low rank adapters with qLoRA, and a 2022 paper demonstrated training 175B parameter language models in (simulated) fp8, achieving very similar results to fp16. Note that, as of 2023, GPUs don't natively support datatypes smaller than fp16, except int8 (8 bit integer). You can train and infer with int8 to some extent, but most quantization requires converting the weights from the quantized format to another type (like fp16) for calculation, and then back when they're no longer needed, which incurs some performance cost. This can pay for itself based on how much memory your GPU has and how fast that memory is, but it's worth being aware of—quantization isn't free. KV caching To explain this one, I'm going to borrow some diagrams from my last post about how Transformers work. If this section feels too quick, please read that post for a (much) more in depth explanation! This explanation is also based on GPT-2, since it's the model I covered in that post. Other architectures work slightly differently—I'll explain the relevant differences, but most don't make too much of a difference for understanding KV caching. Inside a Transformer, the activations run through a feed-forward layer to generate a qkv matrix, where each row corresponds to a token: token q q q q q q q q k k k k k k k k v v v v v v v v token 1 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 token 2 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 token 3 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 token 4 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 token 5 0 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Then, the qkv matrix is split into q, k, and v, which are combined with attention like this: softmax( q 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 @ k.T 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 + mask) @ v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 To produce a matrix like this: Result for token 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 (1 * 1) Result for token 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 (0.5*1 + 0.5*1) Result for token 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (0.5*1 + 0.5*(-1)) Result for token 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (0.5*(-1) + 0.5*1) Result for token 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 (0.5*1 + 0.5*1) Now depending on where this layer is in the Transformer, these rows might be used (after passing through an MLP) as the input to the next Transformer block, or be the predictions for the next token—but note that there's a row for every token! That's because Transformers are trained to predict the next token for every single token in the context window! # the gpt2 tokenizer produces 3 tokens for this string >>> tokens = tokenizer(\" A B C\").input_ids >>> tokens [317, 347, 327] # if we put that into the model, we get 3 rows of logits >>> logits = gpt2(input_ids=torch.tensor(tokens)).logits.squeeze() >>> logits.shape torch.Size([3, 50257]) # and if we argmax those, we see the model is predicting a next token # for _every_ prompt token! >>> for i, y in enumerate(logits.argmax(-1)): ... print(f\"{tokenizer.decode(tokens[:i+1])!r} -> {tokenizer.decode(y)!r}\") ' A' -> '.' ' A B' -> ' C' ' A B C' -> ' D' During training, this behavior is desirable—it means more information is flowing into the Transformer since many tokens are being graded instead of just one. But usually during inference, all we care about is that bottom row, the prediction for the final token. So how can we get just that out of a Transformer trained to predict the entire context? Well, let's go back to the attention calculation. What if q was only one row—the row corresponding to the last token? softmax( q 0 0 0 1024 1024 0 0 0 @ k.T 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 + mask) @ v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Then, we'd get this as the attention result—just the result for the last token, exactly like what we want. Result for token 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 (0.5*1 + 0.5*1) So that's great, but to only generate the last row of q, that means we can only run the layer that generates the qkv matrix on a single row as well. So where do the rest of the rows of k and v come from, since we still need them? The answer is in the name—KV caching—we reuse them from the previous token generation step! Inside the model, we save the KV values calculated during attention in each Transformer block. Then on the next generation, only a single token will be passed in, and the cached KV rows will be stacked on top of the K and V row for the new token to produce the single row Q and multi-row K and V that we want. Here's an example of KV caching with the HuggingFace transformers API, which actually returns the KV cache by default as part of the model forward pass. The cache is a tuple with a (k, v) tuple for each layer. The k and v tensors are each of shape (batch_size, n_head, n_seq, head_size). >>> tokens [317, 347, 327] # the \" A B C\" string from before >>> key_values = gpt2(input_ids=torch.tensor(tokens)).past_key_values >>> tuple(tuple(x.shape for x in t) for t in key_values) ((torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64])), (torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]), torch.Size([1, 12, 3, 64]))) If we pass this returned KV cache to a model forward pass, the model will treat the tokens we passed in to generate the cache as present even though we don't provide them again. Note that we only pass a single token here, and only get a single row of logits back! >>> new_token = tokenizer(\" D\").input_ids >>> new_token [360] >>> logits = gpt2(input_ids=torch.tensor(new_token), past_key_values=key_values).logits >>> logits.shape torch.Size([1, 50257]) >>> tokenizer.decode(logits.argmax(-1)) ' E' Compare that to if we only pass the single token without passing past_key_values—we get a completion, but it's not conditioned on those previous tokens that the KV cache was generated from. >>> tokenizer.decode(gpt2(input_ids=torch.tensor(new_token)).logits.argmax(-1)) '.' (Also note that e.g. lit-gpt has a nicer KV cache API that handles the cache for you, instead of needing to pass it around manually :-) ) KV caching helps with the algorithmic side of LLM slowness—since we're now only passing in a single token on each step, we don't have to redo everything for each new token. However, it doesn't completely banish the problem, since the KV cache still grows in size each step, slowing down the attention calculation. The size of the KV cache can also pose its own, new problem—for example, with a 1,000 token KV cache, even with the smallest GPT-2 there are 18,432,000 values being cached. If each is an fp32, that's almost 74MB of cache, for a single generation, for a comparatively tiny model! With modern large models, especially running on a server that needs to handle many simultaneous clients, the KV cache can quickly become unmanageable, so a few techniques have popped up to make it better. Multi-Query Attention Multi-Query attention is a change to the model architecture that shrinks the size of the KV cache by assigning multiple heads to Q, and only a single head to K and V. It needs to be trained into the model from the beginning—it's not just an inference-time optimization—but it's worth being aware of if you're trying to choose a model, because models with MQA can support more tokens in the KV cache than models trained with normal attention. To understand that, first we need to understand multi-head attention, so let's digress into that for a second. Modern LLMs don't usually perform attention on the entire QKV matrix at once like how I described above—instead, the KQV matrix is split into multiple smaller \"heads\". That means instead of how it's shown in the diagram above, it looks more like this: q 0.23 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.87 0.84 0.3 0.3 0.27 0.61 0.7 0.02 0.83 0.94 0.12 0.21 0.79 0.23 0.03 0.28 0.02 0.47 0.97 0.61 0.11 0.1 0.3 1.0 0.08 0.88 0.83 0.69 0.07 0.01 0.16 0.05 0.51 0.54 0.23 0.47 → q/0 0.23 0.03 0.27 0.61 0.79 0.23 0.11 0.1 0.07 0.01 q/1 0.1 0.3 0.7 0.02 0.03 0.28 0.3 1.0 0.16 0.05 q/2 0.87 0.84 0.83 0.94 0.02 0.47 0.08 0.88 0.51 0.54 q/3 0.3 0.3 0.12 0.21 0.97 0.61 0.83 0.69 0.23 0.47 k 0.08 0.41 0.36 0.1 0.15 0.03 0.95 0.16 0.7 0.77 0.57 0.9 0.65 0.36 0.58 0.32 0.77 0.29 0.42 0.58 0.16 0.49 0.17 0.73 0.94 0.36 0.16 0.03 0.31 0.67 0.81 0.94 0.76 1.0 0.45 0.94 0.6 0.49 0.68 0.54 → k/0 0.08 0.41 0.7 0.77 0.77 0.29 0.94 0.36 0.76 1.0 k/1 0.36 0.1 0.57 0.9 0.42 0.58 0.16 0.03 0.45 0.94 k/2 0.15 0.03 0.65 0.36 0.16 0.49 0.31 0.67 0.6 0.49 k/3 0.95 0.16 0.58 0.32 0.17 0.73 0.81 0.94 0.68 0.54 v 0.54 0.8 0.73 0.35 0.97 0.05 0.07 0.45 0.81 0.42 0.13 0.33 0.6 0.75 0.41 0.36 0.81 0.47 0.2 0.05 0.63 0.75 0.58 0.66 0.69 0.89 0.09 0.49 0.49 0.63 0.91 0.88 0.19 0.39 0.22 0.36 1.0 0.17 0.66 0.02 → v/0 0.54 0.8 0.81 0.42 0.81 0.47 0.69 0.89 0.19 0.39 v/1 0.73 0.35 0.13 0.33 0.2 0.05 0.09 0.49 0.22 0.36 v/2 0.97 0.05 0.6 0.75 0.63 0.75 0.49 0.63 1.0 0.17 v/3 0.07 0.45 0.41 0.36 0.58 0.66 0.91 0.88 0.66 0.02 Then each head is combined in attention as before: softmax( q/0 0.23 0.03 0.27 0.61 0.79 0.23 0.11 0.1 0.07 0.01 @ (k/0).T 0.08 0.7 0.77 0.94 0.76 0.41 0.77 0.29 0.36 1.0 + mask) @ v/0 0.54 0.8 0.81 0.42 0.81 0.47 0.69 0.89 0.19 0.39 The individual small result matrices are then stuck back together to recreate a final result matrix of shape (seq_len, embed_size), just like the result of vanilla attention. This process allows each head to be used for a different task (e.g., one head could handle punctuation in acronyms and another French articles), instead of wastefully dedicating an entire Transformer block to a single task. So what is Multi-Query Attention? Instead of Q, K, and V all being split into separate heads, only Q is split. K and V are smaller, the size of a single head, and that single K and V is shared among all the Q heads. q 0.23 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.87 0.84 0.3 0.3 0.27 0.61 0.7 0.02 0.83 0.94 0.12 0.21 0.79 0.23 0.03 0.28 0.02 0.47 0.97 0.61 0.11 0.1 0.3 1.0 0.08 0.88 0.83 0.69 0.07 0.01 0.16 0.05 0.51 0.54 0.23 0.47 → q/0 0.23 0.03 0.27 0.61 0.79 0.23 0.11 0.1 0.07 0.01 q/1 0.1 0.3 0.7 0.02 0.03 0.28 0.3 1.0 0.16 0.05 q/2 0.87 0.84 0.83 0.94 0.02 0.47 0.08 0.88 0.51 0.54 q/3 0.3 0.3 0.12 0.21 0.97 0.61 0.83 0.69 0.23 0.47 k 0.08 0.41 0.7 0.77 0.77 0.29 0.94 0.36 0.76 1.0 v 0.54 0.8 0.81 0.42 0.81 0.47 0.69 0.89 0.19 0.39 You might think this would be a serious problem for the model, but it actually has only a small effect on perplexity. This table from the MQA paper shows slightly worse results than the Multi-Head Attention baseline, but better than alternatives involving shrinking all the dimensions of MHA. The benefit is, because K and V are so much smaller than in MHA, the KV cache is proportionally smaller as well. Both LLAMA-2 and Falcon use MQA, for this reason. Mistral 7B uses a variant called Grouped-Query Attention which is a hybrid between MQA and MHA. If MHA is Q_heads=K_heads=V_heads=N and MQA is Q_heads=N; K_heads=V_heads=1, then GQA is Q_heads=N; K_heads=V_heads=G where 1 >> for i, y in enumerate(logits.argmax(-1)): ... print(f\"{tokenizer.decode(tokens[:i+1])!r} -> {tokenizer.decode(y)!r}\") ' A' -> '.' ' A B' -> ' C' ' A B C' -> ' D' Finally third, some words are very easy to predict. For example, after the word \"going\", you don't need to be GPT-4 to know that the word \"to\" is an extremely likely next token. We can take advantage of these facts to optimize generation! Imagine if, whenever the most recent token was \" going\", we optimistically tacked \" to\" onto the end as well before running generation. Then, after running the model forward, we check if the model's prediction after \"going\" was indeed \"to\". if so, we got a token (\"to\") for free! And if not, no sweat, we simply accept the token predicted for \"going\" instead, with no increased perplexity, since that token is the exact token the model would have generated without our trick. def generate(prompt: str, tokens_to_generate: int) -> str: tokens: list[int] = tokenize(prompt) GOING, TO = tokenize(\" going to\") for i in range(tokens_to_generate): if tokens[-1] == GOING: # do our speculative decoding trick logits = model.forward(tokens + [TO]) # the token the model predicts will follow \"... going\" going_pred = argmax(logits[-2, :]) # the token the model predicts will follow \"... going to\" to_pred = argmax(logits[-1, :]) if going_pred == TO: # if our guess was correct, accept \"to\" and the next token after tokens += [TO, to_pred] else: # otherwise, accept the real next token # (e.g. \"for\" if the true generation was \"going for broke\") tokens += [going_pred] else: # do normal single-token generation logits = model.forward(tokens) tokens += [argmax(logits[-1])] return detokenize(tokens) This will absolutely work, and buy you a (minuscule) speed boost. To improve it, you could imagine making more heuristics: predict \"and\" after a comma, and \"the\" after \"is\". You could even make multi-word heuristics: if you see \"The early bird\", why not optimistically add \"catches the worm\"? Even if they're doing a twist on the phrase, you could still win \"catches\" and \"the\", the entire phrase doesn't need to be accepted. But wait a second—why make these heuristics by hand? We're trying to come up with likely completions of a token... that's exactly what language models are good at! If we use a language model to generate our optimistic tokens, we could pick up even more complex patterns, even ones from the earlier context. We just need to use a \"draft\" model that's small enough (and therefore quick enough to run) that it will pay for itself by avoiding passes through the larger \"oracle\" model. A good rule of thumb is for this model to be ~1/10 the size of the oracle model. It should also use the same tokenizer (to avoid needing to detokenize and retokenize the sequence over and over). Here's what the generate loop looks like with a draft model: def generate(prompt: str, tokens_to_generate: int, n_draft: int = 8) -> str: tokens: list[int] = tokenize(prompt) for i in range(tokens_to_generate): # generate `n_draft` draft tokens in the usual autoregressive way draft = tokens[:] for _ in range(n_draft): logits = draft_model.forward(draft) draft.append(argmax(logits[-1])) # run the draft tokens through the oracle model all at once logits = model.forward(draft) checked = logits[len(tokens) - 1 :].argmax(-1) # find the index of the first draft/oracle mismatch—we'll accept every # token before it # (the index might be past the end of the draft, if every draft token # was correct) n_accepted = next( idx + 1 for idx, (checked, draft) in enumerate( # we add None here because the oracle model generates one extra # token (the prediction for the last draft token) zip(checked, draft[len(tokens) :] + [None]) ) if checked != draft ) tokens.extend(checked[:n_accepted]) return detokenize(tokens) Here, I used the above loop with GPT-2-XL (1558M parameters) as the oracle model, and GPT-2-small (124M parameters) as the draft model, with n_draft=8. The green tokens were generated by the draft model, and the blue tokens are where the draft model was incorrect and the oracle model's corrected token had to be used. What is a tensor in machine learning? A tensor is a mathematical object that represents a set of data points. It is a mathematical object that can be used to represent a set of data points. Note how the draft model is particularly good at quickly copying text from the question (\"A tensor is a\"), completing common N-grams (\"It\" -> \"is a\", \"can\" -> \"can be\"), and inserting stock phrases (\"a set of data points\"), so that the oracle model only needs to step in for a few key words. Here's another example, with the same setup but a different prompt: Index: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z The following table lists the number of times each of the following words appear in the text of the book. Word Number of times in text Here, the draft model does very well in the alphabet part, actually hitting the draft limit several times (the draft model would have correctly predicted \"L\", for example, but we limit it to 8 tokens at once). But once it got into the prose generation below, the draft model couldn't keep up as well. Finally, here's a pathological case: The digits of Pi are 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820 At first the models are in agreement, but fairly quickly they diverge as the draft model becomes inaccurate, and generation becomes unbearably slow. For every token, 8 draft tokens are generated and then immediately discarded. This shows that speculative decoding performance can be very context dependent! If the draft model is well-correlated with the oracle model and the text is easy to predict, you'll get lots of drafted tokens and fast inference. But if the models aren't correlated, speculative decoding can actually make inference slower, because you're wasting time generating draft tokens that will just be rejected. Threshold decoding? An approach I came up with to mitigate the issues with using a fixed number of draft tokens is threshold decoding. Instead of always decoding up to the maximum number of draft tokens, we keep a moving probability threshold, calibrated based on how many tokens are being accepted right now. Draft tokens are generated until the cumulative probability of the draft so far (based on the draft model logits) falls below this threshold. For example, if the threshold was 0.5, and the we generated a draft token \" the\" with a probability of 0.75, we'd keep going. If the next token, \" next\", had a probability of 0.5, the cumulative probability 0.375 would be lower than the threshold, so we'd stop and submit the two draft tokens to the oracle. Then, based on how far into the draft is accepted, the threshold is adjusted up or down to try and calibrate the draft model's confidence with the actual acceptance rate. Right now this is just done by a simple moving average and some thresholding, but there's probably a more principled way to do it based on real statistics. This is the code (using my homegrown framework, apologies): def speculative_threshold( prompt: str, max_draft: int = 16, threshold: float = 0.4, threshold_all_correct_boost: float = 0.1, ): tokens = encoder.encode(prompt) # homegrown KV cache setup has an `n_tokens` method that returns the length # of the cached sequence, and a `truncate` method to truncate that sequence # to a specific token model_kv = gpt2.KVCache() draft_kv = gpt2.KVCache() while True: # generate up to `max_draft` draft tokens autoregressively, stopping # early if we fall below `threshold` draft = tokens[:] drafted_probs = [] for _ in range(max_draft): logits = draft_model.forward(draft[draft_kv.n_tokens() :], draft_kv) next_id = np.argmax(logits[-1]) next_prob = gpt2.softmax(logits[-1])[next_id] if not len(drafted_probs): drafted_probs.append(next_prob) else: drafted_probs.append(next_prob * drafted_probs[-1]) draft.append(int(next_id)) if drafted_probs[-1] < threshold: break n_draft = len(draft) - len(tokens) # run draft tokens through the oracle model logits = model.forward(draft[model_kv.n_tokens() :], model_kv) checked = logits[-n_draft - 1 :].argmax(-1) n_accepted = next( idx + 1 for idx, (checked, draft) in enumerate( zip(checked, draft[len(tokens) :] + [None]) ) if checked != draft ) yield from checked[:n_accepted] tokens.extend(checked[:n_accepted]) if n_accepted <= n_draft: # adjust threshold towards prob of last accepted token, if we # ignored any draft tokens threshold = (threshold + drafted_probs[n_accepted - 1]) / 2 else: # otherwise, lower the threshold slightly, we're probably being # too conservative threshold -= threshold_all_correct_boost # clamp to avoid pathological thresholds threshold = min(max(threshold, 0.05), 0.95) # don't include oracle token in kv cache model_kv.truncate(len(tokens) - 1) draft_kv.truncate(len(tokens) - 1) This table compares threshold decoding to regular speculative decoding with different fixed draft lengths (along with KV caching, to make the comparison fair), for the test prompts I showed earlier. The rightmost column is a sparkline showing how generation speed changes over time.

Threshold decoding, meanwhile, is able to ramp up to take advantage of the easy alphabet tokens, and then ramp back down to not overgenerate on the harder prose section: Index: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z The following table lists the number of times each of the following words appear in the text of the book. Word Number Staged speculative decoding Staged speculative decoding adds two improvements to vanilla speculative decoding: The first is to restructure the draft batch as a tree, instead of a single generation. This helps because longer draft batches on complex text can quickly diverge from the base model. It can instead make more sense to do multiple, shorter drafts, branching off from each other, and then verify them all against the oracle model using a specially-crafted attention mask. Generating multiple draft sequences lets you reuse prior tokens and sample the draft model in batches, further accelerating the process. (You can think of regular speculative decoding as \"deep\" and using a tree as \"wide\", which begs the question of how you should prioritize deep v.s. wide for certain text. Maybe an adjustable parameter like in the threshold decoding section would be useful here as well?) The second improvement is to speculatively decode the draft model as well—it's usually a Transformer after all. This could be a yet-smaller Transformer (they recommend 15-20x smaller than the oracle model), or even a simple N-gram model. Guided generation Grammar-guided generation lets you constrain a model's output to follow some grammar, giving you output that guaranteed to match some grammar—such as JSON. At first, this seems unrelated to speed—reliability is nice, but speed too? That can't be possible! But it is—let's dig into how it works to see why. Imagine you're generating JSON with an LLM, and the generation so far is: { \"key\": GPT-4 could generate any of 100k+ tokens here, but only a few are actually valid: whitespace, an open bracket, a quote, a digit, null, etc. During regular (non-guided) generation, you'd just hope the model had learned that properly and didn't generate syntactically invalid JSON. During guided generation, however, the sampler only samples from those valid tokens, ignoring any others, even if the invalid tokens are more likely.5 Even better, with libraries like Outlines or jsonformer, you can give the guided generation sampler a schema, and it will sample within that schema! For example, if a key requires a digit, it will only sample digits after that key name. Note how the returned object in this example exactly matches the Pydantic schema: ... class Weapon(str, Enum): sword = \"sword\" axe = \"axe\" mace = \"mace\" spear = \"spear\" bow = \"bow\" crossbow = \"crossbow\" class Armor(str, Enum): leather = \"leather\" chainmail = \"chainmail\" plate = \"plate\" class Character(BaseModel): name: constr(max_length=10) age: int armor: Armor weapon: Weapon strength: int model = ... generator = outlines.generate.json(model, Character, max_tokens=100) print(generator(\"Give me a character description\", rng=...)) # { # \"name\": \"clerame\", # \"age\": 7, # \"armor\": \"plate\", # \"weapon\": \"mace\", # \"strength\": 4171 # } This is great for reliability, but what does it have to do with speed? Well, let's take a look at that response again. If we compare it to what's required by the schema, barely any tokens are actually ambiguous—for most of the response, the model would only have one possible token to pick from. In that case, the sampler can just pick that token, bypassing the model entirely! Only a small fraction of the tokens (the ones highlighted in green) actually required a model forward call: { \"name\": \"clerame\", (4 ambiguous tokens: cl er ame \",) \"age\": 7, (2 ambiguous tokens: 7 ,) \"armor\": \"plate\", (1 ambiguous token: plate) \"weapon\": \"mace\", (1 ambiguous token: m) \"strength\": 4171 (3 ambiguous tokens: 417 1 ) } Between the JSON grammar and the schema, we already know the first 7 tokens are { \"name\": \", so we can automatically add those into the context before the first model call. Then after the model generates clerame\",, we know the next tokens up until the model needs to actually generate the age ( \"age\": ), so we append those as well before calling the model again to generate 7,. We can keep going that way all the way down. (We can even save a token by completing m as \"mace\", because no other weapon starts with m!) The complete response was 41 tokens, but only 11 of them had to come from the model, the others were automatically inserted and only needed to be processed as prompt tokens, which are much faster. This is a nice speedup, and more reliable to boot—a win-win. If you need to generate structured data with LLMs, especially OSS LLMs that can use custom samplers, you should definitely be using a library like Outlines. Lookahead decoding Lookahead decoding is a new approach to speculative decoding that doesn't require a draft model. Instead, the model itself is used in two branches: a lookahead branch, which predicts and extends candidate N-grams (short sequences of N tokens), and a verification branch, which verifies the candidates. The lookahead branch is similar to the draft model in regular speculative decoding, and the verification branch has the same role as the oracle model. But unlike regular speculative decoding, this is all done not just in a single model, but in a single model call using a specially-crafted attention mask: I won't go too in depth because the lmsys blog post announcing lookahead decoding already has some nice animations (even if the explanation is somewhat dense). Prompt lookup decoding Prompt lookup decoding is another technique, where the draft model is replaced by simple string matching over the context. They claim it works well for tasks like code editing or RAG where the output necessarily contains lots of verbatim copying from the input. I assume it'd also work well in staged speculative decoding, to speculatively decode a draft model. Training time optimizations There are a few optimizations that I'm going to speed through since they're not very relevant if you don't have the resources to pretrain a model with them from the start. Sparse attention Attention is algorithmically slow because it's quadratic: as the sequence grows in length, each of the N tokens needs to attend to each of the N tokens. Sparse attention attempts to remedy this by calculating less attention. For example, Mistral 7B uses sliding window attention, where tokens in some layers can only attend to nearby tokens. Longformer also explored some interesting sparse attention patterns, like giving all tokens access to specific positions, dilating the sliding window, using different size windows on different layers, and other tricks. (Longformer predates Mistral, but as far as I can tell Mistral didn't use all the tricks Longformer did—I'm not sure why.) Sometimes this kind of attention can be finetuned in or bolted on without tuning after the fact, but for the best performance it needs to be trained into the model from the start, like Mistral did. Non-Transformer architectures Recently there's been a renewed surge of interest in non-Transformer LLMs. If you're new to the field you may not be familiar with RNNs/LSTMs, but they were the dominant sequence modeling architecture before Attention is All You Need was published and Transformers took off. Unlike Transformers where the whole context is available to the model at once, RNNs do a linear scan over the sequence, building up a hidden state that models what has come before. (There are also reversed and bidirectional RNNs, it's a whole thing.) They were outmatched by Transformers due to difficulty scaling them and problems like forgetting, but some recent papers have tried to bring them back, or invent new sub-quadratic architectures that can finally dethrone Transformers. These include RWKV (new type of RNN), Mamba (state-space model), Hyena (convolutional), and Recurrent Memory Transformers (use a Transformer for segments, then special memory tokens for global context). So far the biggest and best models are still Transformers, but that might not be true in the future! Conclusion Thanks for reading! Unfortunately I didn't get to cover everything I wanted to in this post, since it's already quite long—I didn't touch on structured sparsity, Mixture of Experts, activation quantization, static vs dynamic quantization, or lots of other great topics. However, I think the post is a good survey of different areas of LLM optimization. LLMs are currently slow and hard to run, but the situation is improving all the time—Lookahead Decoding was released while I was writing this post! It seems likely that in a few years, between better hardware, better training methods, better quantization, more inference optimizations, and the continuing hard work of the open source community, we could be running models than handily beat GPT-4 on consumer hardware, and these techniques and more will be instrumental to making that happen. (Of course, GPT-5 will probably be out by then... but always upwards!) Hopefully you found the post useful and/or entertaining.

Really helps. 1 Generating 50 tokens with GPT-2-XL (1.5B parameters) on my laptop (Intel i7-10510U (8) @ 4.900GHz, 48Gb of RAM) using this function averages 0.22 tok/s. In comparison, I can get 2.01 tok/s on the same prompt with optimizations like KV caching and speculative decoding, without quantization, and potentially much higher with quantization. 2 This blog post has some great information on memory bandwidth and cache sizes for various GPU models. Note that a global memory access takes ~380x longer than a tensor core 4x4 matrix multiplication! An L1 cache access is only ~34x longer than that matrix multiplication — ~10x faster than a global memory access. 3 This is often implemented manually, but if you use JAX, jax.vmap can batch a function designed to operate on a single example automatically 🎉 4 In that case, why not just use the MMU, and skip PagedAttention? Well for one, the MMU requires allocations to be page-aligned, which may not be a clean multiple of KV cache entry size. But more importantly, I don't think a userspace process can ask that a virtual page be mapped to a specific physical page, even if that physical page is already mapped in the process—that capability is reserved for the kernel. Somebody correct me if this is possible! 5 This is exactly how OpenAI's JSON mode works. It's why you still need to ask the model for JSON in the prompt, since otherwise the token probabilities won't be tied to JSON at all, and the whole thing will get stuck in a loop generating endless whitespace.

Mamba and RWKV on the other hand compress the old state, based on information available at the time of compression. If it turns out the new token wants some information from the old token that during the compression was excluded due to the compression thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be needed, the new token has no way to access it. reply evnc 7 hours agorootparentThis is fair -- the newest token can attend perfectly to the oldest token, within the context window.but also, on a broader scale, if a transformer model is presented with a long input that does not fit in its context (e.g.: you are building a chatbot, and you have a very long chat history), it must \"compress\" or \"forget\" some of that information (e.g.: repeatedly summarizing historical messages, dropping them and appending the summary at the beginning of the input).Mamba&#x2F;RWKV&#x2F;other \"recurrent\" architectures, can theoretically operate on unbounded input lengths; they \"forget\" information from earlier tokens over time, but is that not comparable to what a transformer must do with input lengths greater than their context window? reply D0TheMath 7 hours agorootparentprevThe jury very much still seems out on this.

I’m sure there’s research arms looking to see if they scale to the level OpenAI or Google have their transformers at now, but they’re still very much in their infancy.This all ignores the risk of them not panning out and the lost time not focusing some energy on transformers. reply andy99 16 hours agoparentprevThe speed of transformers is memory bandwidth limited. I think that it&#x27;s possible to speed them way up with different chip architectures, and I know there are lots of people working on this e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etched.ai making asics and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;untether.ai making chips will co-located memory and compute cells.

This is the most fertile ground for new insights that will outperform the current approaches.New technologies aren&#x27;t generally just created out of whole cloth by some genius, they&#x27;re build up of layers of incremental improvements, each of which is modest in its own right but which when taken together are groundbreaking. reply uoaei 7 hours agoparentprev> why there&#x27;s still so much work (and hacks and workarounds) on transformer to make it go faster and consume less VRAM whereas the same effort could be spent on other architecturesProbably because the pace of development is now no longer determined by ML researchers but by CS engineers.

This only used the interrupts to permit the modem (receive) side to generate interrupts, but the concepts are the same as if the interrupt would have come from a timer source. Yes, it uses the EXX and EX AF,AF&#x27; instructions.The best Z80 book, which describes the little-known W and Z registers is http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.z80.info&#x2F;zip&#x2F;zaks_book.pdf start on page 86 for their description. reply andyjohnson0 15 hours agoprevI&#x27;d be very interested to know how preemptive (rather than cooperative) multi-tasking is implemented. It&#x27;s been a while but I don&#x27;t remember the Z80 having any suitable primitives upon which to implement preemption.I poked around the website but it seems light on implementation details. Super-impressive piece of work though.Edit to say: thank you to the responders who&#x27;ve backfilled the gaps in my memory. Interesting what you forget given enough time. reply stephc_int13 13 hours agoparentI once implemented a pre-emptive kernel and OS on a very crude hardware, the Hewlett-Packard Graphing Calculator HP48GX, running a Saturn CPU (4Bits with 64bits registers, a weird beast).It can still be downloaded here : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpcalc.org&#x2F;hp48&#x2F;apps&#x2F;shell&#x2F;You don&#x27;t need MMU or anything of the sort.The only thing you need is programmable interrupts.My implementation was using a 64Hz timer, that was also synchronized on the LCD screen \"vsync\" as it had to be serviced for kernel-level double buffering and different modes of simulated multiple grey levels.It is much less difficult than it seems, save registers, save context, load context, load registers, return to the current process.Optimizing the code is just a good knowledge of the CPU constraints and bit of juggling with registers. It was a simpler time, you could benchmark code by counting cycles, instruction by instruction. No cache, no branch predictors, no throttling. reply GlenTheMachine 12 hours agorootparentI did something similar on the C64 (6502). Programmatically user code could mask interrupts, but as long as it didn’t it worked fine. It saved all the registers and restored them prior to switching execution threads. The unified memory space required that each thread ask for an absolute memory offset to be allocated and then voluntarily stay in that space. reply OnlyMortal 9 hours agorootparentThe vertical blank interrupt was how many games did their screen updates and played music.Those were good days writing demos and crack intros. reply cornholio 14 hours agoparentprevZ80 has a non-maskable (NMI) interrupt line that will break whatever code is currently executing without allowing the software to opt out (EI&#x2F;DI instructions), and then jump to a hardcoded page zero location, I believe it is address 0x66.This line is typically tied in popular Z80 machines to the vertical blanking generator (frame refresh - 50&#x2F;60Hz). Presumably, the OS would then schedule the tasks in a round robin fashion and most tasks will cooperate and yield control quicker to allow a not too choppy experience. reply epcoa 13 hours agoparentprev> Z80 having any suitable primitives upon which to implement preemption.In general the only thing needed is an external interrupt (which the Z80 has).

You can make the kernel&#x27;s code that handles the task switching faster that way. replybaz00 14 hours agoparentprevAs other people have said, there&#x27;s an NMI line. But that&#x27;s not usually how it&#x27;s implemented because you tend to want to mask it if the thing is doing a real time or time critical task. The Z80 CTC was the canonical solution.Back in the dark ages had an \"OS\" which had a simple \"task table\". This was a circular linked list with enough space after each pointer to store the CPU state for a task and some stack. There was one element per task. The task interrupt would fire every 100ms, the registers&#x2F;stack pointer&#x2F;PC would be dumped to that, the list followed and the next task picked up and loaded into the CPU, then it&#x27;d return from interrupt and off it&#x27;d go again. You could call YIELD at any point if you didn&#x27;t want the rest of your time slice. If you had something that needed to handle an interrupt from the CTC or an NMI, it would disable interrupts until it was done.Notably you didn&#x27;t tend to create new tasks. They were hard coded in at assembly time!Edit: we also had an 8031 version as well. reply andyjohnson0 14 hours agorootparentThanks.

I wonder how energy efficient it is comparing to the ARM used in some HP calculators. reply epcoa 13 hours agorootparentI would guess in terms of raw compute efficiency the ARM will beat the eZ80 due to the older Z80 architecture (3x faster than slow is still slow, and the HPs used ARM9 IIRC, while the eZ80 is more similar to an ARM7 and only a 24 bit ALU, etc).

It was launched in 1985; the eZ80 in 2001.That’s a long time to learn from other people’s mistakes, if they even were mistakes for the time. I can’t find numbers for either on the web but I guess that, being pipelined, the eZ80 uses more transistors than the 65C816 (also, a Z80 already has about twice the number of transistors as a 6502).If that’s the case, a better ‘improved 6502’ might have been too expensive for its market in 1985. reply shrubble 15 hours agoparentprevI believe this is the CPU used in the Agon series of retro &#x2F; hobbyist single board computers. reply PaulHoule 15 hours agorootparentYephttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olimex.com&#x2F;Products&#x2F;Retro-Computers&#x2F;AgonLight2&#x2F;o...for a while I thought this was pretty coolhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commanderx16.com&#x2F;but then I saw the Agon stuff which I think is miles better not to mention more affordable. reply cmrdporcupine 12 hours agoparentprevI was a 6502 guy back in the 80s, before I went 68k, and never had a machine with the Z80, so have no nostalgia for it. But when I look on paper, the Z80 really does look like it stood the test of time better.How does the eZ80 extend out into 24 bits without having an awkward banking system like the &#x27;816? (EDIT: I see, it actually adds a 24-bit register mode.)The biggest problem I found with the 816 was that having no registers larger than 16-bits meant, well, there&#x27;s no way to store a pointer in a register, or work with data larger than 64k. Well, that and the awful 8&#x2F;16 mode switching. Oh, and the fact that the stack and direct page are stuck in the first 64k bank. Damn, I really wish Mensch had designed and built a 65xx with a proper 16bit (or higher) architecture instead of the meh that is the 816. reply PaulHoule 10 hours agorootparentThey extended the length of the registers for the eZ80, which they didn’t do for the 816, it is explained really well herehttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zilog.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;um0077.pdfI made it through (most of) the 1980s with a 6809-based TRS-80 Color Computer but I think the 6502 was the most popular CPU in the US then, as the 6502 based PET, Apple ][, C64, Atari 400, Atari 2600 and NES used them. I think it was rare to see Z-80 computers with color graphics, framebuffers, sprites, etc. but it was used in arcade boards and they had thishttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MSXin some other countries.I wonder if you could build a OS for eZ80 that could run CP&#x2F;M software, that would get you a pretty large base of software to run.In an alternate timeline, Apple comes out with the iiGS a few years earlier than it did instead of the Mac but no the ‘816 was not that chip and they would have been looking for a replacement around the time they got looking for a 68k replacement. reply pkaye 5 hours agorootparentI looked it up and the eZ80 is instruction set compatible with Z80 so I think it could run old CP&#x2F;M binaries. You would have to customize the BIOS to add support any IO devices. reply alexisread 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d imagine the ez80 uses an extended register fusion setup ie. You can use 3 8bit registers as a 24bit register. I think that would take 3 cycles to use the full address space, but for the first 8bit space I guess it would work like utf8 in that you just use 1 register (byte). reply ralphc 8 hours agorootparentprevBack in the day I bought a TRS-80 instead of an Apple ][ based on how much easier the Z-80 looked to write assembly for. reply jbverschoor 17 hours agoprevI recently played around with this at MSXGOTO40.

Seeing an old rusty MSX of almost 40 years old pulling off multitasking. They had quite a few apps and games (even the z80 doom haha).I talked to one of the members for a while.So basically they use none of the BIOS, so it&#x27;s purely Z80, which makes it super portable.They do have different drivers for different videocards. So some configurations work faster than others. I saw a stock MSX and one with some videocard, but I can&#x27;t remember exactly. The stock one was slow with redrawing at times, but the other one was very smooth. reply FullyFunctional 3 hours agorootparentI was very regretful that my first (Nascom 2) didn’t leverage interrupts more. I hated that loading&#x2F;saving to tape were simultaneously insanely slow and blocking operations. The slowness would have been easier to stomach if I could do something else while waiting. It wasn’t a technical problem. I had seen concurrent CP&#x2F;M in action and that was amazing. reply tempodox 15 hours agoprevAmstrad CPC! I can remember when you could buy one at the department store. Computing was adventurous exploration then. reply sedatk 9 hours agoparentTwo friends and I started an impromptu coding session last night on my first Amstrad CPC464 bought in 1988. It turned out to be my name sinusoidally moving over the screen. It was so fun to discover BASIC commands and implement effects together. Only photos of the event left though because there was no tape to save the work :) reply pkaye 4 hours agorootparentMy dad got me a Amstrad system here in the US when I was a teenager. It was sold as a word processer system with a high resolution green monitor and a nice printer. But it was not of use for anything else due to the nonstandard floppy form factor. And any games I could get would have to come form the UK so very expensive and hard to get. It did have CP&#x2F;M, BASIC and Logo so I also learned about that.The biggest use out of that system was once I typed up an Eliza chatbot BASIC program from a library book. Its quite simplistic but turned out very entertaining to young children like our close neighbors young kids and much later my young nephew&#x2F;niece. They would always ask for the \"Green monitor\" anytime they visited and spend hours on it. Much later when we meet up they still recall that \"Green monitor\" they had fond memories of. reply sedatk 4 hours agorootparentThat was probably an Amstrad PCW series computer. Never used one, but heard a lot about them. The machines of the era were very remarkable that they made the most of its users write programs, something we see rarely these days. reply pkaye 4 hours agorootparentYes I looked it up and it was one of those Amstrad PCW computers. reply sixothree 13 hours agoparentprevThe thing I miss the most is every device having an answer for “what makes this thing interesting or unique”.
