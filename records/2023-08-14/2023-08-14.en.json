Business users across the globe often tap into the public service to work more productively or act as a creative assistant. However, ChatGPT risks exposing confidential intellectual property. One option is to block corporate access to ChatGPT, but people always find workarounds. This also limits the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT and reduces employee productivity and their work experience. ChatGPT on Azure solution accelerator is our enterprise option. This solution provides similar user experience to ChatGPT but offered as your private ChatGPT. Benefits are: 1. Private: Built-in guarantees around the privacy of your data and fully isolated from those operated by OpenAI. 2. Controlled: Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade security controls are built in. 3. Value: Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or use plug-ins to integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc). We've built a Solution Accelerator to empower your workforce with ChatGPT on Azure solution accelerator.

While I haven&#x27;t tested it extensively, 70B model is supposed to rival Chat GPT 3.5 in most areas, and there are now some new fine-tuned versions that excel at specific tasks like coding (the &#x27;codeup&#x27; model) or the new Wizard Math (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nlpxucan&#x2F;WizardLM) which claims to outperform ChatGPT 3.5 on grade school math problems. reply ttul 10 hours agoparentLlama 2 might by some measures be close to GPT 3.5, but it’s nowhere near GPT 4, nor Anthropic Claude 2 or Cohere’s model. The closed source players have the best researchers - they are being paid millions a year with tons of upside - and it’s hard to keep pace with that. My sense is that the foundation model companies have an edge for now and will probably stay a few steps ahead of the open source realm simply for economic reasons.Over the long run, open source will eventually overtake. Chances are this will happen once the researchers who are making magic happen get their liquidity and can start working for free again out in the open. reply nl 6 hours agorootparent> The closed source players have the best researchers - they are being paid millions a year with tons of upside - and it’s hard to keep pace with that.Llama2 came out of Meta&#x27;s AI group. Meta pays researcher salaries competitive with any other group, and their NLP team is one of the top groups in the world.For researchers it is increasingly the most attractive industrial lab because they release the research openly. reply jokethrowaway 3 minutes agorootparenthearsay, but I&#x27;ve heard OpenAI pays significantly moreI agree that Meta hired some amazing researchers so we&#x27;ll see what the future holds reply robertnishihara 10 hours agorootparentprev> Llama 2 might by some measures be close to GPT 3.5, but it’s nowhere near GPT 4I think you&#x27;re right about this, and benchmarks we&#x27;ve run at Anyscale support this conclusion [1].The caveat there (which I think will be a big boon for open models) is that techniques like fine-tuning makes a HUGE difference and can bridge the quality gap between Llama-2 and GPT-4 for many (but not all) problems.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anyscale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fine-tuning-llama-2-a-comprehe... reply sytelus 4 hours agorootparentFrankly, number of benchmarks you guys are using are too narrow. In fact these benchmarks are \"old world\" benchmarks, easy to game through finetuning and we should be stop using them altogether for LLMs. Why are you not using Big Bench Hard or OpenAI evals? reply MuffinFlavored 10 hours agorootparentprevcan I fine tune it on like 2,000 repos at a corporation (code based) and have it understand the architecture? reply smoldesu 9 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think you can do that with any AI models. It almost feels like a fundamental misrepresentation of how they work.You could fine-tune a conversational AI on your codebase, but without loading said codebase into it&#x27;s context it is \"flying blind\" so-to-speak. It doesn&#x27;t understand the data structure of your code, the relation between files and probably doesn&#x27;t confidently understand the architecture of your system. Without portions of your codebase loaded into the &#x27;memory&#x27; of your model, all that your finetuning can do is replicate characteristics of your code. reply mycall 7 hours agorootparentTypeChat-like things might provide the interface control for future context driven architectures, being some type of catalysis. Using the self-reflective modeling is a form of contextual insight. reply xcdzvyn 7 hours agorootparentprev> The closed source players have the best researchersIs that definitely why? GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 are far larger than 70B, right? So if a 70B, local model like LLaMA can even remotely rival them, would that not suggest that LLaMA is fundamentally a better model?For example, would a LLaMA model with even half of GPT 4&#x27;s parameters be projected to outperform it? Is that how it works?[I&#x27;m not super familiar with LLM tech] reply nl 6 hours agorootparentIf you read the Llama2 paper it is very clear that small amounts of data (thousands of records) make vast difference at the instruction turning stage. From the Llama2 paper:> Quality Is All You Need.> Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that many of these have insufficient diversity and quality — in particular for aligning LLMs towards dialogue-style instructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data, as illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but higher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These findings are similar in spirit to Zhou et al. (2023), which also finds that a limited set of clean instruction-tuning data can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of thousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of 27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.It&#x27;s likely OpenAI has invested in this and has good coverage in a larger range of domains. That alone probably explains a large amount of the gap. reply Maxion 4 hours agorootparentThis quote is quite funny taken out of context like this. Top AI researchers find that garbage in === garbage out. reply nl 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m puzzled. Why do you think it&#x27;s taken out of context? reply hooande 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is no clear answer. It&#x27;s debatable among experts.The grandparent post seems to believe that the issue is algorithmic complexity and programming aptitude. Personally, I think that all the major LLMs are using the same basic transformer architecture with relatively minor differences in code.GPT is trained on more data with more parameters than any open source model. The size does matter, far more than the software does. In my experience with data science, the best programmers in the world can only do so much if they are operating with 1&#x2F;10th the scale of data. That applies to any problem. reply wkat4242 39 minutes agorootparentprevYeah I&#x27;ve been wondering about this too. Word on the street is that GPT4 is several times the size of GPT3.5. Yet I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s several times as good for sure.Apparently there&#x27;s a diminishing returns effect on ever enlarging the model. reply oceanplexian 6 hours agorootparentprevLLamA 2 at 70B is, let’s say pessimistically 70% as good as GPT3.5. This makes me think that OpenAI is lying about their parameter count, are vastly less efficient than LLaMA, or, the lager model sizes have diminishing returns. Either way, your point is a good one. Something doesn’t add up. reply mattlutze 2 hours agorootparentWe just don&#x27;t have the information to make judgements, much less leaping to \"they must be lying.\"There&#x27;s a few public numbers from a handful of foundation models as to performance vs parameter count vs architecture generation. Not being able to compare in detail the architecture of the various closed models nor being more rigorous on training with progressively sized parameter sets, the conclusion at the moment is a general feeling or conjecture. reply qrios 38 minutes agorootparentprevWithout questioning the statement &#x27;70% as good as GPT3.5&#x27;, but wouldn&#x27;t that be quantifying a quality, and a Turing test? Also: maybe these missing 30% are the hard part. reply dr_dshiv 4 hours agorootparentprevIMO Llama2 really isn’t close to 3.5. It still has regular mode collapse (or whatever you call getting repetitive and nonsensical responses after a while), it has very poor mathematical&#x2F;logical reasoning and is not good at following multi-part instructions.It just sounds like 3.5&#x2F;4 because it was trained on it. reply geysersam 3 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re mixing up the language model with the chat bot.The llama2 is a language model. I imagine the language model behind chatgpt is not much different (perhaps it&#x27;s better, but not by many months AI research time). It likely also suffers from \"mode collapse\" issues etc.But 3.5 also has a lot of systems around it that detects mode collapse and applies some kind of mitigation, forcing the model to give a more reasonable output. Mathematical &#x2F; logical reasoning questions are likely also detected hand passed on in some form to a separate system. reply nl 2 hours agorootparentprevLlama 2 wasn&#x27;t trained on ChatGPT&#x2F;GPT4. I think maybe you are thinking of the Vicuna models?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmsys.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023-03-30-vicuna&#x2F; reply vorticalbox 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is what presence_penalty and frequency_penalty are for. reply llm_thr 6 hours agorootparentprevYou seriously underestimate just how much _not_ having to tune your llm for SF sensibilities benefits performance.As an example from the last six months: people on tor are producing better than state of the art stable diffusion because they want porn without limitations. I haven&#x27;t had the time to look at llm&#x27;s but the degenerates who enjoy that sort of thing have said they can get the Llama2 model to role play their dirty fantasies and then have stable diffusion illustrate said fantasies. It&#x27;s a brave new world and it&#x27;s not on the WWW. reply saberience 3 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by \"tune for SF\" ? reply AnthonyMouse 3 hours agorootparentSan Francisco sensibilities. A model trained on a large data set will have the capacity to emit all kinds of controversial opinions and distasteful rants (and pornography). Then they effectively lobotomize it with a rusty hatchet in an attempt to censor it from doing that, which impairs the output quality in general. reply rightbyte 2 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think paying more will give you better researchers. Maybe better \"players\". reply chaosbolt 41 minutes agorootparentprev>but it’s nowhere near GPT 4It will be if openai keeps dumbing down GPT 4, no proof they&#x27;re doing it but there is no way it&#x27;s as good as it was at launch, or maybe I just got used to it and now notice the mistakes more. reply ReptileMan 3 hours agorootparentprevLinux started in the same position. Sometimes the underdogs win. reply jgalt212 10 hours agorootparentprevOK, fair enough. Please give me an example of a customer facing chatbot that Llama 2 (and unbearable to use) and GPT 4 customer facing chatbot that is a joy to use. I think at the end of the day, you still have customers dreading such interactions. reply dandiep 7 hours agorootparentUsing GPT3.5&#x2F;4 in our language learning app and people seem to enjoy it. [1]Tried Llama2 and it definitely doesn’t even come close for what we’re doing. Would absolutely need fine tuning.Maybe customers don’t enjoy chat bots for customer support, but there are a million other uses for these models. I, for example, LOVE github copilot.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squidgies.app reply jmorgan 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s early, and this definitely isn&#x27;t customer facing in the traditional sense, but a team member of mine set up a Discord bot running Llama 2 70B on a Mac studio and we&#x27;ve been quite impressed by its responses to folks who test it.IIRC chat bots are central the vision Facebook has with LLMs (e.g. every instagram account has a personal chat bot), so I would expect the Llama models to get increasingly better at this task.That said the 7B and 13B models definitely don&#x27;t quite seem ready yet for production customer interaction :-) reply qup 7 hours agorootparent> (e.g. every instagram account has a personal chat bot)That made me think of the Black Mirror episode Joan is Awful, where every human gets their life turned into a series for the company to own and promote. Kinda like instagram content. reply pyrophane 9 hours agoparentprev> While I haven&#x27;t tested it extensively, 70B model is supposed to rival Chat GPT 3.5 in most areas, and there are now some new fine-tuned versions that excel at specific tasksThat has been my experience. Having experimented with both (informally), Llama 2 is similar to GPT-3.5 for a lot of general comprehension questions.GPT-4 is still the best amongst the closed-source, cutting edge models in terms of general conversation&#x2F;reasoning, although 2 things:1. The guardrails that OpenAI has placed on ChatGPT are too aggressive! They clamped down on it quite hard to the extent that it gets in the way of a reasonable query far too often.2. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good results with smaller models trained on specific datasets. GPT-4 is still on top in terms of general purpose conversation, but for specific tasks, you don&#x27;t necessarily need it. I&#x27;d also add that for a lot of use cases, context size matters more. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentTo your first point, I was trying use ChatGPT to generate some examples of negative interactions with customer service to show sentiment analysis in action for a project I was working on.I had to do all types of workarounds for it to generate something useful without running into the guardrails. reply pseudosavant 7 hours agorootparentprevI’ll second the context window too. I’ve been really impressed with Claude 2 because it can address such a larger context than I could feed into GPT4. reply CodeCompost 3 hours agorootparentprevCan it handle other languages besides English? reply e12e 1 minute agorootparentNot anywhere near as well as ChatGPT 4 (for chat anyway - maybe the model is better)?Prompt:> Hvad tycks om at fika nu?ChatGPT 4> Det låter som en trevlig idé! Fika är ju alltid gott. Vad skulle du vilja ha till din fika? (Oj, ursäkta för emojis! )https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;8e89a16f-f182-4f62-b9fa-f93cd5...Llama2:> I apologize, but I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by \"fika nu.\" Could you please provide more context or clarify your question so I can better assist you?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hf.co&#x2F;chat&#x2F;r&#x2F;kOF2qst reply jmorgan 6 hours agorootparentprevRE 2 - neat! What are some tasks you&#x27;ve been using smaller models (with perhaps larger context sizes) for? reply ramraj07 5 hours agorootparentprevCould you give examples of smaller models trained on specific datasets? reply antupis 4 hours agorootparentit can be almost anything like your HN comments or some corporate wiki, then get colab pro 10$ month or some juicy gaming machine and fine-tune that using eg this tutorial https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.philschmid.de&#x2F;instruction-tune-llama-2 but https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LocalLLaMA&#x2F; is full of different fine tuned models. reply sytelus 4 hours agoparentprevLLaMA2 is still quite a bit behind ChatGPT 3.5 and this mainly get reflected in coding and math. It&#x27;s easy to beat NLP based benchmark but much much harder to beat NLP+math+coding togather. I think this gap reflects gap in reasoning but we don&#x27;t have a good non-coding&#x2F;non-math benchmark to measure it. reply samstave 8 hours agoparentprevI just had a crazy FN (dystopian) idea...Scene:The world relies on AI in every aspect.But there are countless &#x27;models&#x27; the tech try to call them...There was an attempt to silo each model and provide a governance model on how&#x2F;what&#x2F;why they were allowed to communicate....But there was a flaw.It was an AI only exploitable flaw.AIs were not allowed to talk about specific constructs or topics, people, code, etc... that were outside their silo but what they COULD do - was talk about pattern recog...So they ultimately developed an internal AI language on scoring any inputs as being the same user... And built a DB of their own weighted userbase - and upon that built their judgement system...So if you typed in a pattern, spoke in a pattern, posted temporally on a pattern, etc - it didnt matter which silo you were housed in, or what topics you were referencing -- the AIs can find you.... god forbid they get a keylogger on your machine... reply ajhai 14 hours agoprevA lot of companies are already using projects like chatbot-ui with Azure&#x27;s OpenAI for similar local deployments. Given this is as close to local ChatGPT as any other project can get, this is a huge deal for all those enterprises looking to maintain control over their data.Shameless plug: Given the sensitivity of the data involved, we believe most companies prefer locally installed solutions to cloud based ones at least in the initial days. To this end, we just open sourced LLMStack (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TryPromptly&#x2F;LLMStack) that we have been working on for a few months now. LLMStack is a platform to build LLM Apps and chatbots by chaining multiple LLMs and connect to user&#x27;s data. A quick demo at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-JeSavSy7GI. Still early days for the project and there are still a few kinks to iron out but we are very excited for it. reply gdiamos 13 hours agoparentI find it interesting to see how competitive this space got so quickly.How do these stacks differentiate? reply scrum-treats 12 hours agorootparentQuality and depth of particular types of training data is one difference. Another difference is inference tracking mechanisms within and between single-turn interactions (e.g., what does the human user \"mean\" with their prompt, what is the \"correct\" response, and how best can I return the \"correct\" response for this context; how much information do I cache from the previous turns, and how much if any of it is relevant to this current turn interaction). reply robertnishihara 10 hours agoparentprev> we believe most companies prefer locally installed solutions to cloud based onesWe&#x27;ve also seen a strong desire from businesses to manage models and compute on their own machines or in their own cloud accounts. This is often part of a hybrid strategy of using API products like OpenAI for rapid prototyping.The majority of (though not all) businesses we&#x27;ve seen tend to be quite comfortable using hosted API products for rapid prototyping and for proving out an initial version of their AI functionality. But in many cases, they want to complement that with the ability to manage models and compute themselves. The motivation here is often to reduce costs by using smaller &#x2F; faster &#x2F; cheaper fine-tuned open models.When we started Anyscale, customer demand led us to run training & inference workloads in our customers&#x27; cloud accounts. That way your data and code stays inside of your own cloud account.Now with all the progress in open models and the desire to rapidly prototype, we&#x27;re complementing that with a fully-managed inference API where you can do inference with the Llama-2 models [1] (like the OpenAI API but for open models).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.endpoints.anyscale.com&#x2F; reply toomuchtodo 13 hours agoparentprevCan you plug this together with tools like api2ai to create natural language defined workflow automations that interact with external APIs? reply ajhai 13 hours agorootparentThere is a generic HTTP API processor that can be used to call APIs as part of the app flow which should help invoke tools. Currently working on improving documentation so it is easy to get started with the project. We also have some features planned around function calling that should make it easy to natively integrate tools into the app flows. reply cosbgn 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can use unfetch.com to make API calls via LLMs and build automations. (I&#x27;m building it) reply scrum-treats 5 hours agorootparentIs it possible to not use Google with unfetch.com? reply cosbgn 3 hours agorootparentGoogle is just so easy for login. No need to deal with password forgot, reset, email verification etc. But I&#x27;ll add login via magic link soon. reply bhanu423 13 hours agoparentprevInteresting project - was trying it out, found an issue in building the image - have opened an issue on github - please take a look. Also do you have plan to support llama over openai models. reply ajhai 12 hours agorootparentThanks for the issue. Will take a look. In the meantime, you can try the registry image with `cp .env.prod .env && docker compose up`> Also do you have plan to support llama over openai models.Yes, we plan to support llama etc. We currently have support for models from OpenAI, Azure, Google&#x27;s Vertex AI, Stability and a few others. reply extr 13 hours agoprevOne thing I still don&#x27;t understand is what _is_ the ChatGPT front end exactly? I&#x27;ve used other \"conversational\" implementations built with the API and they never work quite as well, it&#x27;s obvious that you run out of context after a few conversation turns. Is ChatGPT doing some embedding lookup inside the conversation thread to make the context feel infinite? I&#x27;ve noticed anecdotally it definitely isn&#x27;t infinite, but it&#x27;s pretty good at remembering details from much earlier. Are they using other 1st party tricks to help it as well? reply shubb 13 hours agoparentThis is one of the things that make me uncomfortable about proprietary llm.They get task performance by doing a lot more than just feeding a prompt straight to an llm, and then we performance compare them to raw local options.The problem is, as this secret sauce changes, your use case performance is also going to vary in ways that are impossible for you to fix. What if it can do math this month and next month the hidden component that recognizes math problems and feeds them to a real calculator is removed? Now your use case is broken.Feels like building on sand. reply BoorishBears 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure you realize how proprietary LLMs are being built on.No one is doing secret math in the backend people are building on. The OpenAI API allows you to call functions now, but even that is just a formalized way of passing tokens into the \"raw LLM\".All the features in the comment you replied to only apply to the web interface, and here you&#x27;re being given an open interface you can introspect. reply rightbyte 1 hour agorootparent> No one is doing secret math in the backend people are building on.How do you know that? With SaaS you are at the mercy of the vendor. reply shubb 9 hours agorootparentprevThank you for pointing that out - I had assumed that things were not how they are.Although performance has varied over time https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2307.09009.pdf I also notice that the API allows you to use a frozen version of the model which avoids the worries I mentioned. reply edgyquant 11 hours agorootparentprevIt was a contrived example to make a point, one that seems to have flown over your head. reply BoorishBears 11 hours agorootparentNo it was a bad (straight up wrong) example because you don&#x27;t understand how people are building applications on proprietary LLMs.If you did you&#x27;d also know what evals are. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 13 hours agoparentprevThey definitely do some proprietary running summarization to rebuild the context with each chat. Probably a RAG like approach that has had a lot of attention and work reply extr 13 hours agorootparentThis is effectively my question. I assume there is some magic going on. But how many engineering hours worth of magic, approximately? There is a lot of speculation around GPT-4 being MoE and whatnot. But very little speculation about the magic of the ChatGPT front end specifically that makes it feel so fluid. reply BoorishBears 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s mostly because there&#x27;s very little value in deep speculation there.It&#x27;s not particularly more fluid than anything you couldn&#x27;t whip up yourself (and the repo linked proves that) but there&#x27;s also not much value in trying to compete with ChatGPT&#x27;s frontend.For most products ChatGPT&#x27;s frontend is the minimal level of acceptable performance that you need to beat, not an maximal one really worth exploring. reply extr 12 hours agorootparentWhat front end is better than ChatGPT? Is the OP implementation doing running summarization or in-convo embedding lookup? reply BoorishBears 10 hours agorootparentIt sounds like a cop-out but: it&#x27;s one made for your use-case.If you&#x27;re letting people do fun long-form roleplay adventures using summarization alongside some sort of named entity K-V store driven by the LLM would be a good strategy.If you&#x27;re building a tool that&#x27;s mostly for internal data, something that leans heavily into detailed answers with direct verbatim citations and having your frontend create new threads when there&#x27;s a clear break in the topic of a request is a clever strategy since quality drops with context length and you want to save tokens for citations.People who are saying LLMs suck or are X or are Y are mostly just completely underutilizing them because LLMs make it super easy to solve problems superficially: when it comes to actually scaling those solutions to production you need more than random RAG vector database wrappers. reply DebtDeflation 8 hours agorootparent>alongside some sort of named entity K-V store driven by the LLMI&#x27;d be curious to hear more about how exactly this works. You do NER on the prompt (and maybe on the completion too) and store the entities in a database and then what? How does the LLM interact with it? reply BoorishBears 5 hours agorootparentLLMs thrive at completely ambiguous classifications: you can have them extract entities and something like \"a list of notable context\".Let&#x27;s say we want to let our chat remember the character slammed the door last time they were in Village X with the mayor in their presence and have the mayor comment next time they see the player.Every X tokens we can fire a prompt with a chunk of conversation and a list of semantically similar entities that already exist, letting the LLM return an edited list along the lines of: entity: mayor location: village X priority: HIGH keywords: town hall, interact, talk \"memory, likelyEffect\"[]: door slammed in face, anger at playerNow we have:- multiple fields for similarity search- an easy way to manage evictions (sweep up lowest priority)- most importantly: we&#x27;re providing guidance for the LLM to help it ignore irrelevant contextWhen the user goes back to village X we can fetch entities in village X and whittle that list down based on priority and similarly to the user prompt.None of this has any determinism: instead you&#x27;re optimizing for the illusion of continuity and trading off predictability.You&#x27;re aiming for players being shocked that next time they talk to the mayor he&#x27;s already upset with them, and if they ask why he can reply intelligently.And to my original point while this works for a game-like experience, you wouldn&#x27;t want to play around with this kind of fuzzy setup for your companies internal CRM bot or something. You&#x27;re optimizing for the exact value proposition of your use-case rather than just trying to throw a raw RAG setup at it replyMaxLeiter 13 hours agoparentprevIt uses a sliding context windows.

Other conversational implementations use sliding context windows and it&#x27;s very noticable as context drops off. Whereas ChatGPT seems to retain the \"gist\" of the conversation much longer. reply lsaferite 13 hours agorootparentI mean, I explicitly have the LLM summarize content that&#x27;s about to fall out of the window as a form of pre-emptive token compression. I&#x27;d expect maybe they do something similar. reply kuchenbecker 12 hours agorootparentI feel like we&#x27;re describing short vs long term memory. reply tsunamifury 4 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly what it is. It’s just it turns out you need very good generalized or focused simple reasoning to do accurate compression or else the abstraction and movement to long term memory doesn’t include the most important content. Or worse distracting details.I’ve been working on short and long term memory windows at allofus.ai for about 6 months now and it’s way more complex than I had originally thought it would be.Even if you can magically extend the content window, the added data confuses and waters down the reasoning of the LLM. You must do layered abstraction and compression with goal based memory for it to continue to reason without distraction of irrelevant data.It’s an amazing realization, almost like a proof that memory is a kind of layered reasoning compression system. Intelligence of any kind can’t understand everything forever. It must cull the irrelevant details, process the remains and reason on a vector that arises from them. reply yowlingcat 3 hours agorootparentIs it unfair to consider this some kind of correlate to the Nyquist theorem that makes me skeptical of even the theoretical possibility of AGI claims? reply qwertox 10 hours agorootparentprevAt least in 3.5 it&#x27;s very noticeable when the context drops. They could use summarization, akin to what they are doing when detecting the topic of the chat, but applied to question-answer-pairs in order to \"compress\" the information. But that would require additional calls into a summarization LLM so I&#x27;m really not sure if it is worth it.

I thought the main issue with privacy and security of (not at all)OpenAI models is that by using their products you agree for them to retain all the data you send and receive from the models forever for whatever they choose to use it for. Or is this just a thing for free use?If you pay, do you get a Ts&Cs that don&#x27;t contain any wording like this? Still, even if there was no specific \"we own everything\" statement there could be pretty much standard statement of \"we&#x27;ll retain data as required for the delivery and improvement of the service\" which is essentially the same thing.So, any company that allows it&#x27;s employees to use chatgpt for work stuff (writing emails with company secrets etc) is definitely not engaging in \"secure and private\" use.Unless there is very clear data ownership, for example, customer owns the data going in and going out. I can&#x27;t see how it can be any different. The problem (not at all)OpenAI has in delivery such service is that in contrast to open source models I&#x27;m told there is a lot of \"secret sauce\" around the model(not just the model itself).

That made sense when LLMs were in the lab. It doesn&#x27;t make sense now that LLMs have tens of millions of DAUs — i.e. ChatGPT.

I maintain an open source OpenAI library and would like to add support for Azure but can&#x27;t because of this restriction. Why can&#x27;t I just use my regular Azure account? reply devjab 3 hours agoparentMicrosoft owns enough of OpenAI that their endgame goal of putting GPT like features into Azure and Office365 for enterprise customers is what we’re likely to see happen.OpenAI will likely target private consumers while Microsoft focuses on enterprise. I can use my own organisation as an example. We’re an investment bank that does green energy within the EU. We would absolutely use GPT if it was legal, but it isn’t, and it likely never will be considering their finance model is partly to steal as much data as they can. Even if it’s not so polite to say that. This is where Microsoft comes into the picture. In non-tech enterprise you’re buying Microsoft products because everyone wants windows, outlook and office. We can wish it wasn’t like that, but where is the realistic alternative? I’m not anti Microsoft by the way, in all my decades in the enterprise business they’ve easily been the best and most consistent business partner for any IT. When Amazon saw how much money there was on the operations side of EU enterprise they quickly caught up, but Amazon doesn’t sell a Office365 product. So anyway, once you have Office365, you’re also likely to use Teams as your communications platform (which is why there is an anti-trust case against it), Sharepoint as your document platform, and, well, Azure as your cloud platform. Except you might use AWS because Amazon is also great. In some ways they are even more compliant with EU legislation than Microsoft.But if Microsoft can throw GPT products into Azure the same way they put Teams and Sharepoint into Office365… well, then where is their competition? And having GPT features within Office365 will only further their advantage on the office platform. I mean, there are companies which won’t use Outlook, but there won’t be when ChatGPT writes your e-mails.So this isn’t necessarily for you. It’s just part of Microsoft’s over all strategy for total IT domination in Enterprise. I mean, we’re going into RPA (robot process automation) a journey I went through in another Enterprise organisation a few years back. Back then you had to consider what go buy, would it be BluePrism, UIPath, automation anywhere, something else? Today there is no competition to Microsoft’s PowerAutomate if you’re already a Microsoft customer. It’s literally $500 a month vs $50k a month… I mean… that’s the future for GPT on Azure.It’s probably necessary too. Their prices have made a lot of organisations look outside of Azure.

If this is just a front-end for the OpenAI API then how does it remove the data privacy concern? Your data still ends up with Azure&#x2F;OpenAI, right? It doesn&#x27;t stay localized to your instance; it&#x27;s not your GPU running the transformations. You have no way of knowing whether your data is being used to train models. If customer data is sensitive, I&#x27;m pretty sure running a 70B llama (or similar) on a bunch of A100s is the only way? reply dbish 12 hours agoparentAzure is hosting and operating the service themselves rather then for OpenAI, with all the security requirements that come with that. I assume this comes with different data and access restrictions as well and ability to run in secured instances (and nothing sent to OpenAI the company).Most companies use cloud already for their data, processing, etc. and aren’t running anything major locally, let alone ML models, this is putting trust in the cloud they already use. reply padolsey 12 hours agorootparentAh that&#x27;s fair. But it is my impression that the bulk of privacy&#x2F;confidentiality concerns (e.g. law&#x2F;health&#x2F;..) would require \"end to end\" data safety. Not sure if I&#x27;m making sense.

None of those further obligations seem to have been disclosed. Without that disclosure it&#x27;s a bit of a conspiracy theory?Thus, it could very well be OpenAI has taken dollars, is commercially selling its technology to Microsoft on terms which aren&#x27;t special, and sama and the OpenAI executive team and board has independently concluded that engaging in the partnership is a stellar way to grow their OpenAI brand, business and valuation? reply37112741 9 hours agoprevNothing in the repo details how this addresses privacy concerns of running inference on someone else&#x27;s LLM.

It *is* time shifting. 1 12h Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social @benjistokman @HalvarFlake sorry, confused timeshifting it with this \"rolling cipher\" youtube uses. My bad. But in general, there are no \"time shifting is allowed\" laws in germany. Even for HD TV broadcast via satellite there exists some \"CI\"-Cards. To be spec complient, this card can tell your TV when you can record something or do timeshifting. They can prevent you from timeshift over the advertisements. 1 12h Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social @benjistokman @HalvarFlake you are allowed to make private copies (Privatkopie) of media you own or receive via broadcast. However, you are not allowed to circumvent DRM protection mechanisms. The court classified the rolling cipher as DRM protection mechanisms. 1 12h Ben Stokman @benjistokman@mast.benstokman.me @hikhvar @HalvarFlake but why? How? 1 12h Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social @benjistokman @HalvarFlake this laws are from the time CDs and DVDs where the main media. This law was made to fight against the copying of those. Sadly, the Landgericht Hamburg is very DRM holder friendly, and very badly educated about modern tech. They made a lot of rulings, where tech savvy people just facepalm. Therefore, Sony&Co choose always that Landgericht. The ruling here was basically: YouTube down allow left-click->save, so it's DRM protected. 1+ 12h Ben Stokman @benjistokman@mast.benstokman.me @hikhvar @HalvarFlake that’s so stupid. YouTube doesn’t verify that the request is made by someone allowed to watch the video, unless it’s a private video, so it’s not DRM… 1+ 12h Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social @benjistokman @HalvarFlake yes it is stupid. Therefore uberspace will take that ruling to a higher court. But that costs money and time for a rather small hosting provider. 0 11h Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social @benjistokman @HalvarFlake yeah. So the German law says: \"you are not allowed to circumvent an effective copy protection\". Every tech savvy person will tell you, the rolling cipher is not such an effective copy protection. The lawyers of Sony&Co argued it is, and the Landgericht followed their arguments 0 12h Christoph Petrausch @hikhvar@norden.social @benjistokman @HalvarFlake and then they made use of another bad German law made by content owners (Störerhaftung). Basically, the provider of an internet service is required to interfer if one their customers do unlawful things. If you e.g. provide a free WiFi in Germany, you are accountable if somebody does unlawful things via that wifi (eg download torrents) So the ruling was uberspace must not provide a website for youtube-dl because the content is instructions for unlawful actions. 0 12h zeruch @zeruch @HalvarFlake technically recording a song off the radio was legal (but it was hotly contested and the RIAA hated cassette decks), but unlike that, downloading and storing an identical copy is often interpreted as actual distribution, which *is* illegal. It's a semantic clown show, but there it is. 0 2h Androcat @androcat@toot.cat @HalvarFlake The bargain is between legislators and copyright holders. The society as a whole has no mouth and it must scream. 0 1h Fabio Manganiello @blacklight@social.platypush.tech @HalvarFlake I was wondering just a couple of days ago why the RIAA and the music mafia trio hadn't been harassing youtube-dl and its developers for a while. It turns out that I just needed to wait a couple of weeks for the next (pointless) hostile act.

That ban would work regardless of fair use.This is why Section 1201(a)(2) needs to be struct from the law, BTW - your access to copying tools should not evaporate because of a lack of ability to enforce copyright on you.[0] How this ban is actually implemented is immaterial, but perhaps radios can&#x27;t have detachable speakers or audio out ports to hook a tape deck into, or tape decks have to only have an integral speaker and no audio in ports. This wouldn&#x27;t stop home recording of radio but it&#x27;d be significantly worse. reply akira2501 13 hours agoparent> RIAA is alleging that youtube-dl is a copy protection circumvention tool\"(3) As used in this subsection— (A) to “circumvent a technological measure” means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner; and (B) a technological measure “effectively controls access to a work” if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work\"The argument would seemingly be that youtube is in no way \"effectively controlling access to a work.\" And none of the peculiar details of it&#x27;s implementation are designed to operate in this capacity. Quite the opposite, it&#x27;s technology is designed to broadcast, for the purposes of inserting ads, content to anyone who merely requests it.Moreover, youtube is in no way connecting the \"authority of the copyright owner\" with the particular videos on it&#x27;s site and has nothing but an ad-hoc system with limited availability that takes action only after content is uploaded. As there are many videos that are past copyright protection or have been explicitly released into the public domain, and they make no distinction in the \"technical measures\" used in those videos, that they aren&#x27;t effectively controlling access, and the tools aren&#x27;t circumventing them for this purpose. reply extraduder_ire 12 hours agorootparentI am startled, and also glad, that record labels haven&#x27;t put the screws to youtube enough to get them to implement widevine for music videos on youtube.Probably unworkable for the time being. reply kmeisthax 11 hours agorootparentThe problem is that if they implement Widevine they also need to license FairPlay, PlayReady, and Adobe&#x27;s DRM schemes as well. Otherwise YouTube is effectively Chrome-exclusive.The reason why EME didn&#x27;t lead to a catastrophic downfall of freedom on the Web is purely a function of DRM being expensive to license. Netflix can afford it but not YouTube, and YouTube creators generally don&#x27;t want it[0].Related note: if YouTube starts putting DRM on videos then every creator that&#x27;s ever used Kevin Macleod music is now violating the Creative Commons anti-DRM clause. YouTube actually added a feature to mark your video as CC-BY or CC-BY-SA, so they&#x27;d be at least marginally aware of this clause, so they&#x27;d have to at least make DRM opt-in.[0] To be clear, this is moreso that what YouTubers are actually worried about is reuploading content back to YouTube and monetizing it. They don&#x27;t care so much if you have a stream-ripped copy on your computer that you just watch on your own. But things like Content ID actually work way better for preventing reuploading. reply kragen 10 hours agorootparenthey, that&#x27;s a really good point that i hadn&#x27;t thought of: either whatever is required to watch a youtube video isn&#x27;t a &#x27;technological measure that effectively controls access to a work&#x27; or it&#x27;s illegal for youtube to host all those videos using incompetech music reply jojobas 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d say at this point youtube has so much more market capture than any non-chrome browser, they probably could just say \"get Chrome or gtfo\" and not even notice the audience dip. reply Illotus 5 hours agorootparentThis would basically guarantee that regulators would inevitably separate either Youtube or Chrome from Google. reply jeffparsons 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love to believe this, but said regulators don&#x27;t seem particularly energetic these days. reply oefnak 2 hours agorootparentIn the EU they are.

Surely the recipient&#x27;s phone has the key to decode and the company does not? reply Canada 14 minutes agorootparentFirst of all, Telegram is not end to end encrypted. It has limited support for end to end encryption of direct messages only. There is zero support for E2E of groups, and zero support for E2E in a multiclient context, which makes the feature almost completely useless, and indeed, almost nobody uses it and I don&#x27;t think even 1% of telegram users have ever used it or even know how to use it.Integrating either Signal or WhatsApp clients with Telegram would to tantamount to a backdoor, or would require a redesign of Telegram so drastic that would upset its users. A perfect analogy is integrating WhatsApp and Twitter because Telegram is actually more similar to Twitter than it is to WhatsApp.But even integrating Signal and WhatsApp which now share a similar encryption scheme and user ID isn&#x27;t a good idea: Most Signal users don&#x27;t want any interaction either directly or indirectly with WhatsApp. The two programs have completely different group implementations: WhatsApp keeps all the metadata server side, whereas Signal handles all of that client side with the server acting as a dumb router of opaque messages that wrap the group state updates. How would those two systems be reconciled? Would Signal have to accept WhatsApp users joining its group and then just leak all of the group metadata to WhatsApp servers for compatibility? Would WhatsApp have to re-write its entire service to be compatible with Signal&#x27;s group semantics and see to it that all billion users are fully upgraded or kick them off the service?These issues go on and on and on, and they increase exponentially the more messaging systems you try to add. The whole idea is just ridiculous. veave 31 minutes agorootparentprevTelegram is not end-to-end encrypted. reply jojobas 21 minutes agorootparentprevSignal would have to create a fake user for every integrated Whatsapp&#x2F;Telegram user, and the client would have to create an e2e key pair.

Or does it consider the \"copy protection\" scheme protected regardless of how weak the scheme or claim is?I remember that in Finland, it was debated in courts whether breaking DVD CSS encryption using readily downloadable software was infringement upon an effective copy protection scheme or not. An appeals court decided it was (i.e. CSS was deemed \"effective\"), but the requirement that the copy protection scheme be \"effective\" in order for circumvention to be considered illegal is still there in copyright law. (The legislation is based on whatever the EU-wide regulation is and includes provisions somewhat similar to the DMCA such as the prohibition of circumvention.)I doubt that \"copy protection\" that can be circumvented by reading the YouTube web page source code would be deemed effective under that law. Does the DMCA not have a similar limitation? Or is the RIAA just trying to play the lobbying and rhetoric game despite having weak legal grounds? (Wouldn&#x27;t be surprising.) reply kmeisthax 11 hours agorootparentThis sounds like a transposition[0] and translation error. The word \"effective\" has two meanings:- Is strong enough to keep you from copying the thing- Has the effect of keeping you from copying the thingCongress intended the latter meaning and US courts adopted that. The first meaning would be self-defeating: once someone figured out how to break a copy protection system, it would no longer be effective, so you&#x27;d only be able to prosecute the first person to break the system.If effective meant \"is strong enough\" I don&#x27;t think DVD CSS would count because they specifically used export-grade encryption. The rule (part of ITAR, AFAIK) was that 40-bits was the max entropy you could have, specifically so the NSA could break foreign-operated encryption systems. But this is kind of silly - computers are getting faster all the time, so it seems odd that a measure considered copy protection yesterday would stop being copy protection today just because we can crack passwords faster.[0] Transposition is the concept of copying EU regulations into member state law. I&#x27;m using the term slightly broader than EU law. While WTO rules don&#x27;t have a direct transposition requirement, USTR conditioned lots of trade deals on transposing DMCA 1201 into local law. reply ascagnel_ 5 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t know or remember the details of the DMCA, but does it not require the copy protection to be of some reasonable effectiveness (e.g. reasonable cryptography)? Or does it consider the \"copy protection\" scheme protected regardless of how weak the scheme or claim is?The DMCA has no such provision; if a work is DRM-encumbered, it always enjoys the anti-circumvention protections of the DMCA. It’s one of the main reasons why I think works available only with DRM shouldn’t be eligible for copyright protection: the presence of DRM prohibits the creation of an archive-appropriate copy (in a legal sense, not in the quality sense) that can survive the copyright term of the work. If the owner of a work wants to only release it with DRM, they have to rely on other laws with higher burdens of evidence to provide legal protection. reply boomboomsubban 10 hours agorootparentprevThe DMCA says it needs to be \"effective,\" but then defines it as>technological measure \"effectively controls access to a work\" if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.Which sounds like basically anything they call DRM is DRM. reply bitwize 7 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t know or remember the details of the DMCA, but does it not require the copy protection to be of some reasonable effectiveness (e.g. reasonable cryptography)?No. \"Effective\" is defined in section 1201 as meaning that the technological measure prevents copying \"during the normal course of its operation\" -- i.e., the \"happy path\" of the code prevents unauthorized copying. No matter how trivially the code may be broken, breaking it is a felony. A simple bit of JavaScript embedded in a page that prevents right clicks (to download images) would be an \"effective technological measure\" under the DMCA. If you put up a web page showing how to get around this with Chrome developer tools, you are \"trafficking in circumvention tools\" and can be found civilly&#x2F;criminally liable under the DMCA.Note that there are Library of Congress exceptions for circumventing, but not for trafficking. So you can figure out how to, say, rip DVDs yourself if doing so falls under a LoC exemption. But if you then turn around and publish how to do it, you are still in violation of the DMCA. reply mpalmer 12 hours agoparentprevnext [–]No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof, that— (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person’s knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.I&#x27;m not a lawyer but how does youtube-dl fit any one of these criteria? despite the name, it&#x27;s not \"primarily designed to circumvent copyright\", nor is copyright circumvention its only use (though \"commercial significance\" seems to be doing a lot of work here). reply stcg 12 hours agorootparentReading this I wonder if a computer program falls under \"any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof\". Has it been established that a computer program can be a protection circumvention tool? reply kmeisthax 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not \"circumventing copyright\", it&#x27;s circumventing copy protection. The RIAA alleges that YouTube rotating their URLs is a copy protection measure. If that&#x27;s true[0] then youtube-dl would fit plainly in category (A), since downloading YouTube videos is all it does. Category (B) is there to prevent someone from selling, say, a \"DVD decrypting can opener\" and then arguing that the can opener part makes the DVD part legal. Category (C) is there to prevent people from selling you the analog hole.My objection to the RIAA&#x27;s copy protection argument is that they did not actually create the copy protection measure. They are alleging that some third party&#x27;s product feature happens to look close enough to copy protection that it should count as such. Would they be able to sue YouTube if they were to stop rotating their URLs? Do social media platforms suddenly have an obligation to continue to maintain features that accidentally frustrate illegal copying of text? Do I have to reimplement spacebar heating?[1]Another potential objection would be that rotating URLs are not copy protection. This may work, but keep in mind: 17 USC 1201 has no bounds on the scope of copy protection beyond \"it has to somehow stop you from copying a thing protected by copyright\". Encryption and scrambling systems are explicitly named, but the way the law is currently drafted, anything can be a copy protection measure. There&#x27;s a lot of language defining existing copy protection systems they wanted to grandfather in (e.g. Macrovision) but nothing limiting the scope of future systems.[0] If accepted, this would be the widest reading of DMCA 1201 that I&#x27;ve seen accepted by a court of law (as a non-lawyer). Yes I am counting the printer cartridge and garage door opener shenanigans of yesterdecade. Those were bog-standard \"designing the product to commit three felonies a day\" kinds of copyright abuse and the courts smacked them both down.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1172&#x2F; reply mpalmer 5 hours agorootparentI took a minute to read up on this rolling cipher thing and WOW.

That is why I&#x27;d argue that the court has no idea whatsoever what base64 is, what it does, or that it is even an openly defined specification as a text interchange format.I think what confused the court is the parameter shuffling for the signature parameter in combination with base64.

I think fair use applies to the utilization not the acquisition of. For example if I bought a movie and I used it with the intention to discuss it with clips, I can recode it because I physically own the medium. The fair use chimes in when the clips are in use. However when I download something with a tool from Google (YouTube) I&#x27;m violating their ToS. I might also be violating something in the middle that opens up some legal issues. So when you go to use a video only for fair use, you should ask the poster or the source for an unencrypted one.

There&#x27;s also plenty of copy protection circumvention tools that DON&#x27;T trip 1201(a)(2) because they aren&#x27;t marketed as such and have noninfringing uses. For example, Google Chrome. You can use it to bypass right-click blockers because it lets you open Devtools without right-clicking. However, browsers have loads of commercial utility outside of this, and they don&#x27;t specifically advertise their ability to get around annoying right-click scripts, so they&#x27;re legal.We don&#x27;t normally contemplate this sort of thing because most DRM is specifically designed to be both obvious and separable from other permissible behavior. You cannot accidentally write a DVD decryptor that doesn&#x27;t trip 1201(a)(2).

The WIPO requirement was actually added by the US after the EFF managed to kill a precursor bill a few years prior[0].Implementation among signatory countries is high enough to laugh when people say \"Well, this doesn&#x27;t affect me because I&#x27;m not American.\" Unless you live in North Korea or Russia, DMCA 1201 applies to you.Copyright law is so foundational to world trade that the only way 1201 would get repealed would be if there was some kind of mass uprising against copyright overreach in many signatory countries. In that case, so many large countries would have repealed their DMCA 1201 equivalent legislation that nobody would dare actually try to enforce WTO sanctions against them. At worst, a few countries would demand some horse trades[1].Practically speaking, however, democracies are bad at protecting against small harms exacted against large numbers of people[2], so this never happens. Europe has the Pirate Party but the most successful national iterations of it have had to adopt broader Green[3] and technolibertarian agendas in order to have any semblance of electoral viability. In the US, first-past-the-post is an insurmountable hurdle despite the fragility and incompetence of our two major parties. Here, political issues don&#x27;t so much form new parties as much as they infect the shambling corpses of existing ones.Barring that, if only one country decided to repeal their anti-circumvention laws I imagine there&#x27;d be a lot of grumbling from the US or Japan, potentially new tariffs, but no outright sanctions. The weird part about world trade is that a lot of these provisions are only enforceable on very poor countries. China blatantly violates WIPO all the time and we, practically speaking, cannot quit them.

Imagine doing this at a family gathering!

Who has the moral high ground, who can relay that in writing to others? Is it not actually a subterfuge to allow others to do harm and yet call it good?Basically, one needs to find one&#x27;s heart, and follow that. The law is a merely another control structure. reply kmeisthax 6 hours agorootparentBefore we go and enact The Purge IRL, let&#x27;s step back and think of what actually went wrong.Hollywood wanted a bill that would make it illegal to make certain copying tools. This was hot off the heels of the music industry getting a technology mandate for copy protection on digital audio tape (which would eventually be mooted by MP3 players, see RIAA v. Diamond). The problem is, technology mandates are difficult to draft and have significant problems (sometimes it&#x27;s legal to copy things). So instead of banning copying tools altogether, they made them opt-out. If the copyright holder protects a work from copying, you can&#x27;t sell the tool that makes it copyable.This created a drafting problem: what constitutes protection? At the time 1201 was drafted the biggest copy protection in force was Macrovision, a system intended to make VCRs copying tapes record an unusable signal. So they just copypasted Macrovision into the DMCA. But there&#x27;s all sorts of other ways you could copy protect things. Software was the most creative with all sorts of dastardly ways to make nonstandard media, ways to check for that media, ways to check that your checks hadn&#x27;t been changed, ways to encrypt the binary so you can&#x27;t disassemble it, ways to check for debuggers so you can&#x27;t copy the disassembled version of any of the above checks, etc. All of that is way too uncertain to draft into the bill.Congress&#x27;s answer was to say that anything can by copy protection as long as it keeps you from copying things. This is extremely, offensively overbroad. And it also triggered a slew of new attempts to turn 1201 into a generalized \"contempt of business model\" tort. We had lawsuits over printer ink and garage door openers, because it&#x27;s trivial to just smuggle more software into the design of whatever product you want to &#x27;protect.&#x27; Thus nobody wants to touch any sort of adversarial compatibility, because that carries insane liability now, and since everything needs software now we&#x27;ve effectively ended capitalism and regressed to feudalism.It is a mistake to think of law as a substitute for morality. Obviously criminal does not equal immoral. However, we can think of laws as a solution to coordinated action problems and economic \"game balance\". If an entity is too powerful and abusing their power, we can use the law to cut them down to size. When Congress makes mistakes in drafting the law, we create the ability to build illiberal empires. But empires are not creatures of the law. They would still exist without it, making their own laws that would be far worse than the ones Congress gives us.You don&#x27;t want to know what kind of laws Tim Cook would write if he was freed from having to comply with US law. reply tenebrisalietum 10 hours agorootparentprevIf what you wrote is true, you should have a good answer to this: What special interest is served by laws against murder?One&#x27;s \"heart\" is at least as exploitable as a democratic law system. reply verisimi 2 hours agorootparentGreat question.In the case where someone kills another (murder is a legal term) and the cases of many other &#x27;crimes&#x27; eg stealing, abusing children, etc, these are immoral acts. One&#x27;s heart knows this. In general, what people refer to as &#x27;common law&#x27; is more or less in line with morality - I don&#x27;t object to that so much.Now, if you wanted to impose a legal system (an external authority of morality) that doesn&#x27;t cover these cases, you will fail - people will not accept it&#x27;s authority and will see it for what it is. The legal system has to encompass these overt, actually immoral cases as bait, in order for the individual to swallow the hook. But, the legal system is not determining right or wrong, it is merely echoing what you already know.Things like intellectual property rights, speed limits, licensing, tax, etc, are the hook. They are nothing to do with right or wrong. They are merely cash machines for the entities that write the legislation. They could be right, had entered into a contract, where government provided such-and-such a service with explicit agreement. But no one ever did.. reply rocqua 1 hour agorootparentLaws are not cash machines for those that write them. Laws are an attempt at solving coordination problems. They will arise in any &#x27;state of nature&#x27; because the downsides of not solving coordination problems are so incredibly obvious. Specifically, people will organize into groups that establish and follow rules. Not (just) through coercion, but because the alternative is untenable.Obviously at that point you get politics, people vying for power, trying to change the rules to their benefit, etc. But that is not the base nature of laws, it is a highly predictable effect of the lawmaking process.Laws are (nominally) written for the greater good. Copyright protection, for example, exists so artists get compensated for their work, get to claim credit, and, can control distribution. Now this example has obviously also suffered from politics, to the extreme. But the basic premise still makes sense to me. reply verisimi 4 minutes agorootparent> They will arise in any &#x27;state of nature&#x27; because the downsides of not solving coordination problems are so incredibly obvious.Do animals or birds have &#x27;laws&#x27;? Ok - not that state of nature...Do you have laws at a family gathering? No.I think you are mistaking natural law (innate morality) for a bunch of words some corporate lobbyist has written down. And that confusion is the point. If a controlling group can convince individuals to swap out their sense of morality (where each individual decides what&#x27;s right and wrong for themselves) for a law book that can be controlled externally (a book that monied interests can write or re-write as they like) - then those individuals are harnessed to do what you say and call it right. That is domestication.> Laws are (nominally) written for the greater good. Copyright protection, for example, exists so artists get compensated for their work, get to claim credit, and, can control distribution.Right - that is the sales pitch. But in fact artists get a tiny fraction of the revenue. And the whole idea of the music industry as we have it, is itself an expression of corporate interests.What I think you are missing is that music and whatever else, would go on without corporations and government and its laws, if people wanted it. However, if you want to harness that interest for parasitic monetary benefit, you need to make laws, enforce them, educate people into believing they are right, etc.So, yes you can say that this is for the \"greater good\" but what is actually meant by \"greater\" are those corporations (that are bigger ie greater) than the individuals.yieldcrv 11 hours agoparentprevtime to upload the source and compilation instructions on ipfs reply mdaniel 9 hours agorootparenta friendly reminder that (a) ipfs is only as alive as there are seeders and (b) seeders ips are public just like bittorrentThere was a recent Cult of the Dead Cow release that claims \"encrypt all the things, Tor but for phones\" or some such but I haven&#x27;t studied it to know how much is aspirational https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;veilid&#x2F;veilid#welcome-to-veilid https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;VeilidNetwork https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;VeilidNetwork reply kmeisthax 6 hours agorootparentThis caveat is the same reason I can&#x27;t really support PeerTube.

The issue is with how far this rent seeking goes, and where the balance between social good and private good falls.

Universal, the usage of the VCR was justified based on a very narrow, very uncommon use case: if there were a TV show that aired exactly once, and for some reason you wanted to see it but couldn&#x27;t, and it would never air again, you had the legal right to record one copy for later viewing. (I&#x27;m not sure if you had to destroy the copy after viewing it.) On that basis, and that basis alone, was the VCR ruled to have a legal use case. Otherwise it was pretty much a copyright violation device. Justice Blackmun, in his dissent, was clear that even making a single copy for personal use violates copyright law.Fair use covers making excerpts of a work, not copying a full work, for purposes of reporting, criticism, parody, and the like.

Come get me, media-conglomerate scumbags.Remember how they whined against DAT and basically had it killed (abetted by Congress), claiming that \"perfect digital copies\" would destroy their business? Meanwhile, everybody on the planet knew that essentially all \"piracy\" took place on double-cassette boom boxes in dorm rooms.And sure enough, even when \"piracy\" went digital, it was in the form of lossy MP3s... far from perfect. So their story was a lie from top to bottom... but we&#x27;ve seen our \"representatives\" abet ever-greater crimes against consumers at their behest. The absurd tax on blank media, and the DMCA (and even more-egregious proposals since) stand as disgraceful examples.Do you remember when Circuit City or Best Buy offered \"every CD $10.99 or less?\" The idea was to bring people into their stores, where they&#x27;d buy other stuff. But all of a sudden that deal disappeared. It turns out that the record companies threatened those retailers with financial sanctions (by withholding cooperative advertising funds) if they continued to offer those prices.The record companies were sued for this behavior, which prosecutors said ripped off consumers for $400 million. Gee, this is the same figure that the record companies whined that Napster cost them.

Most content producers and publishers are fine with downloading as long as you don&#x27;t re-distribute (which is theft), but we have no way of preventing that, so they are forced to close the download gate reply stcg 12 hours agoparentThat is not theft. It&#x27;s communication. You can&#x27;t \"steal\" ideas, information or facts [footnote]. To \"steal\" means to physically take someone&#x27;s property without their consent.Instead, you seem to mean a violation of copyright. Copyright exists \"to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\" \"The main purpose of the Copyright Act is the public good of use and access to works of art, even if such a public good comes at the expense of the author of the work.\" (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Twentieth_Century_Music_Corp._...).And then my opinion: In this age, copyright fails at that. It even has the opposite effect of resulting in less use and less access to works of art. I think it would benefit the public if copyright were abolished (or at least shortened to 20 years, similar to the amount of years that a person gets from a patent to exclusively produce and sell their invention before anyone may do that). I do think however that it should be a duty to mention the source or original author when sharing a work.[footnote]: but you can neglect to mention the source, or uncover and share information someone wants to keep private reply kstrauser 14 hours agoparentprevThat’s historically wrong.

And, it also allows you to type text anywhere on a PDF, in case that&#x27;s what you actually want.It&#x27;s available for PC, Mac and Linux. (While the Linux version isn&#x27;t as full-featured, I&#x27;d expect&#x2F;hope all the versions have these 2 features...though I see that the feature-matrix on their website shows the Linux version doesn&#x27;t have the Form Filling feature that the other versions have, FWIW, so it might lack one or both of the features I&#x27;ve mentioned).The Fill-and-Sign feature is accessible from the Home tab -- there&#x27;s a tool right end of the ribbon called \"Fill & Sign\".The text-typing feature is also accessible from the Home tab: you choose the Typewriter tool from the ribbon, move the cursor where you want the text to show up, click there, then start typing -- the text will show up in a faint box (which disappears when you e.g. click somewhere else).Later, you can click the Typewriter&#x27;s arrow cursor on the text and the box will reappear -- you can then delete the box and its text, if you like, or you can double-click inside the box and get a text-cursor, which you can use to delete&#x2F;add text.I&#x27;ve used the Typewriter a bunch -- it works pretty well.

With the keyboard shortcuts (Alt > F > K) it&#x27;s actually very fast to do.It would be nice though if you opened a local .html file if it by default was cut off from accessing the Internet until it asked for and was granted permission by the user, much like GPS, webcam and mic use are.

It was a proprietary standard for ~15 years before it became an open standard.Nowadays, the relationship between Adobe and PDF is like Google and Chromium. Other PDF tools are playing catch up, but it’s en enormous amount of tedious work that mist would only do for a good paycheck, which is hard to find outside of Adobe. reply ghgr 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been using pdfarranger for years without issue.

I doubt I&#x27;d be able to find a bug report for it, given Google&#x27;s nature, but there&#x27;s a few reports[1][2][3] by proxy vendors asking for QUIC to be disabled or traffic will go through, even when Chrome is configured to use a proxy.And here&#x27;s[4] a user report with the same observation, with Chrome connecting directly to its mothership without going through the configured proxy.

Your goal is to avoid angering the user by being too slow. So, what to you think? \"I think you're a big nerd!\" was his answer. So I proceeded to start developing my nerdy game. First I had to pick a tech. I didn't feel like learning how to use a full-fledged game engine for my quite simple project, so I figured a simple 2D library would do. I also had been wanting to get back into Python. Naturally, Pygame was the obvious choice. Pygame also had the added benefit of making it possible to compile a game to WebAssembly (using pygbag), making it playable in a web browser. With Pygame I started my journey, and completed it in what was probably a single week spread across eight months. Game Mechanics At the core of the game, there are processes and CPU's. You can click on an idle process to assign it to an available CPU, and click on an active process to remove it from its CPU. Over time, idle processes go through six starvation levels represented by colours and emojis. If a process spends too much time in the last starvation level, the user becomes impatient and kills it. After having killed 10 processes, the user becomes so angry that they reboot you — the operating system —, ending the game. The goal is to survive as long as possible without getting rebooted. That means making sure that every process spends enough time on a CPU to not go through all the starvation levels. An active process can also become blocked because it is waiting for an I/O event. Blocked processes waste CPU time and it is therefore a good idea to remove them from their CPU. I/O events must be processed by clicking on a button that changes appearance when events are available. As the game progresses, more processes appear, making the game increasingly difficult. At some point, all these processes start taking more memory than is available in the RAM, so you need to start swapping memory pages between the RAM and the disk. An active process starts blinking when it is trying to access pages that are on disk, and the corresponding pages also blink. This is when you know you need to swap pages. A process that is trying to access pages that are on disk will stay blocked until the pages are placed back in RAM. If it stays blocked for too long, it will keep going through the starvation levels and eventually get killed. Finally, the game has multiple difficulty levels available, which influence things such as the number of CPU's, the amount of RAM, the number of processes existing when starting the game, the probability of I/O events, etc. It also has a custom mode where all these settings can be tweaked independently. Does This Game Have Educational Value? One has to keep in mind that this game is primarily, well, a game, and as such, has been designed to prioritize playability over realism. The first way in which it is not entirely realistic is the obvious fact that the player is not expected to have the speed of an actual computer! Many other details are technically wrong, such as processes using WAY LESS memory pages than typical actual processes would do, and the fact that a computer user does not usually keep launching new processes indefinitely — that is solely a game mechanic to make the game increasingly difficult. In other words, this game has not been created with education in mind. All that being said, I do believe it can have some value in introducing computer science students to operating system principles like process scheduling and memory swapping, as long as it is made clear that it is not an exact depiction. As a computer science teacher myself, I might use it this fall while teaching a class about computer components, to better illustrate what it actually means for a processor to have more cores, or what happens when we run out of RAM. Compiling to WebAssembly Compiling the game to WebAssembly was easier than expected, thanks to the documentation available here. The main steps are to install pygbag and implement the modifications to the code that are detailed in the documentation. The biggest problem I encountered was with the library I was using to render emojis, which I could not make work with pygbag. I ended up downloading SVG files from OpenMoji and using GIMP to resize them as needed and export them to PNG. By default, the game adapts its size to the browser's viewport, while maintaining the same ratio as the desktop version. It ends up being stretched if the desktop version uses a smaller window size. This does not result in unbearable pixelization for my game, which has a somewhat retro style, but your mileage may vary. Try the Game! If I piqued your interest, you can play the game directly in your browser on itch.io. Furthermore, like most things I do, the game is open source, and its source code is available on GitHub. © 2023 Pier-Luc BraultDisclaimerPrivacy Policy",

If you enjoyed tangrams enough, I can&#x27;t recommend enough picking up a set of pentominoes - definitely agree that a physical set is the right call. There&#x27;s 12 total so you have 60 individual squares, (pentominoes are 5-square tiles), so popular figures are 6x10, 5x12 (a bit harder than 6x10), and 3x20 (very challenging). You can also get cubes and do 2x5x6 (really hard) or 3x4x5 (even harder).Recently though, I&#x27;ve been doing 8x8 - 4, which means picking 4 squares to remove from an 8x8 square and then filling in the rest (I have some wooden boards i picked up from an etsy seller but you can just as easily trace the outline on paper and color in the forbidden cells, which I&#x27;ve also done).

This one needs a lot of work, though. I did it wrong it seems looking at the other comments here but nothing about this one makes me want to try again. Wilmot&#x27;s Warehouse has excellent pacing. The theme of this one could be made to work well but throwing everything at the player right away and see how long they can keep going is not my idea of fun. I&#x27;d suggest automation options combined with changing the use pattern of the system over time. Plus something to give the player more customization options so it isn&#x27;t just \"do this repetitive task as quickly as you can\". Maybe a choice of cute loading icons that you can display in certain circumstances?Mini Metro is another well known game in the time management genera. I&#x27;ve seen some recent games with this design and played a demo of a not yet released game. It seems like a common small indie game genera since larger developers don&#x27;t seem to touch it that I can think of (except possibly some mini games? I can&#x27;t think of anything off hand but there must be some). I guess the larger developers go for RTS games instead.Possibly the OS theme could be turned into a kind of \"bot combat\" game (at least I think that would be the general genera I&#x27;m thinking of, but without direct combat in this case) if the internals are automated and then compared to the market as a whole, with established OSes that are fairly good at everything but not great at anything. These established OSes could then take various anti-competitive actions along the way that force you to get better at a different specialty than you previously targeted. reply nextaccountic 53 minutes agoparentprev> ZachtronicsKinda sad that the dev quitted reply xeckr 8 hours agoparentprev [–] Unlike cookie clicker, this game can actually teach you something. reply cwillu 6 hours agorootparentI learned a great deal about the dangers of grandmas from cookieclicker. reply Apocryphon 7 hours agorootparentprev [–] I’m not contesting that, just making an analogy to quibble against “the nerdiest game ever” claim.

    "title": "Toki Pona: an attempted universal language with only ~120 words",
    "originLink": "https://cohost.org/mcc/post/59045-mi-kama-sona-e-toki",
    "originBody": "log in sign up andi @mcc glitch girl she/her dryad.technology/ Avatar by @girlfiend Also on Mastodon. log in ask andi @mcc 1 yr. ago mi kama sona e toki pona or something So I stumbled a few weeks ago on this video about the world's smallest conlang and I've been thinking about it ever since. (You will probably have the idea more than fully by the ten minute mark.) This fascinated me. I think languages are really interesting but I'm also really bad at them. I cannot hack the memorization. I've mostly avoided conlangs (that's Constructed Languages, like Esperanto or Klingon) because like, oh no, now there's even more languages for me to fail at memorizing. So like, a language so minimal you can almost learn it by accident, suddenly my ears perk up. Toki pona is really interesting, on a lot of different axes. It's a thought experiment in Taoist philosophy that turns out to be actually, practically useful. It's Esperanto But It Might Actually Work This Time¹. It has NLP implications— it's a human language which feels natural to speak yet has such a deeply logical structure it seems nearly custom-designed for simple computer programs to read and write it². Beyond all this it's simply beautiful as an intellectual object— nearly every decision it makes feels deeply right. It solves a seemingly insoluble problem³ and does it with a sense of effortlessness and an implied \"LOL\" at every step. So what toki pona is. Toki pona is a language designed around the idea of being as simple as it is possible for a language to be. It has 120 words in its original form (now, at the twenty year mark, up to 123), but you can form a lot of interesting sentences with only around twenty or thirty (I know this because this is roughly the size of my current tok vocabulary). The whole tok->en dictionary fits on seventeen printed pages⁴. There are no conjugations or tenses to memorize. There are no parts of speech, generally: almost every single word can be used as almost any part of speech, drop a pronoun or a preposition⁵ in the right place and it becomes a verb, drop a verb in the right place and it becomes an adjective. There are almost no ambiguities in sentence structure; I've only found one significant one so far (using \"of\" [pi] twice in the same clause) and the community deals with this by just agreeing not to do that. There's in one sense quite a lot of ambiguity in the vocabulary but in another sense there's none; for example nena is listed in the dictionary as meaning hill, mountain, button, bump, nose, but the official ideology of Toki Pona is that this is not a word with five definitions, it is a word with exactly one definition, that being the concept encompassing all five of hills, mountains, buttons, bumps, and noses. Toki pona words are not ambiguous, they're just broad. I will now teach you enough toki pona to understand most sentences (assuming you consult the dictionary as you go) in a paragraph shorter than this one: Every sentence has an \"verb\" or action clause. Most sentences also have a subject clause, which goes before the verb separated by \"li\". Some sentences also have an \"object\" or target clause, which goes after the verb clause separated by \"e\". So \"[subject] li [verb] e [object]\". All three clauses are any number of words, the first word is the noun (or verb) and the rest are adjectives (or adverbs). If the first word in a sentence is mi or sina you can omit the li in that case only. There is no \"is\", a sentence like \"a flower is red\" is just \"[a plant] li [red]\" because there are no parts of speech and adjectives are verbs. Pronounce everything the way you would in English except \"j\" sounds like \"y\". If you see \"tawa\", \"lon\", \"tan\" or \"kepeken\" in adjective/adverb position that's a preposition, so treat whatever comes after it as a fourth clause. \"a\" and \"n\" are interjections and can go anywhere in a sentence. If you see \"o\", \"pi\", \"la\", \"taso, \"anu\" or \"en\", then you've found one of the few special words (particles) and you should probably either read the book or watch the jan Misali instructional videos on YouTube. That's like… almost it!⁶ Watch one youtube video, or read a half page of grammar summary and keep the dictionary open on your phone, and you're basically ready to jump into conversations. (You'll need those last six particles to make nuanced sentences, but sentences do not have to be nuanced.) In my own case I watched the Langfocus video linked at the top and then lazily over the next week watched the jan Misali overview and two of their instructional videos then read a few chapters of the book, and was already able to construct a full paragraph and be understood by another person: o! mi sona e toki pona. mi lukin sona e toki mute... taso mi toki ike e toki ale. toki mute li jo e nimi mute. nimi mute li pona ala tawa mi. toki pona li pona e mi tan ni. toki pona li jo nimi lili. nimi lili li pona e me :) (Translation: Hello! I am learning toki pona. I've tried to learn many languages… but I speak all of the[m] badly. Most languages have a lot of words. Lots of words is not good for me. Toki pona is good for me because of this. Toki pona has few words. Few words is good for me :)⁷) So that's week one. By the end of week three (that'll be this past Sunday) I had hit three milestones: I was able to make a joke in toki pona. Not a good one. When the joke misfired, I was able to successfully toss off an entire complex paragraph rapidly without really thinking about it. Probably a sign I Am Getting It more significant than anything else: I realized that talking on the Discord I was dropping toki pona words into my English sentences solely because the toki pona word seemed to me to communicate a concept I wanted to communicate more precisely than any particular English word. (That last one actually kind of excited me when I realized, after the fact, that it had been happening for several days before I noticed it.) All of the above happened on the toki pona Discord, which seems to be the largest and healthiest outpost of toki pona community online⁸ and, I assume therefore, the world. Here's my toki pona joke; you'll notice that I begin by preemptively apologizing for it, but by the end it becomes clear I was, at that moment anyway, apparently completely on the Discord's level:⁹ Footnotes ¹ Esperanto was meant to be an auxillary language simple enough the entire world could learn it as a second language. But it does not seem to me to be actually all that simple to learn (the verb tenses may be free of exceptions, but there are still like six of them) and it seems hard to convince myself to study it when I could put that effort toward a more widespread language. Toki Pona on the other hand is a language simple enough the entire world actually could learn it, had it reason to, and the buy-in cost in time is a lot lower. Meanwhile Toki Pona just seems to get certain international-accessibility things right, probably due to the advantage of having over a century of conlang practice largely inspired by Esperanto to draw from. The difference that's most interesting to me, but which I'm also least qualified to evaluate, is that the Toki Pona author had some basic familiarity with, and gave Toki Pona input from, east Asian languages. Both Toki Pona and Esperanto draw roots from a variety of languages but in Esperanto's case this winds up being mostly European languages, mostly Italian, whereas Toki Pona has Mandarin and Cantonese in its mix. Both languages were intended to have a minimal, universal phonology but Esperanto's is not very universal at all and has some consonant sounds that are going to be be totally unfamiliar unless you speak Polish or a language related to Polish. Toki Pona's phonology is actually minimal-- it has the letters in the sentence \"mi jan pi ko suwi lete\" and nothing else and the legal syllabary is basically hiragana without the combination syllables. Now, what I don't know is whether any of this actually helps speakers of Asian languages in practice or if it just makes surface choices that make it seem that way to a westerner like me. In practice if you find a toki pona speaker their native language is almost certainly English, so there doesn't seem to have been a great deal of testing as to how learnable it is to people from varied regions. ² I kept imagining toki pona as being like LLVM IR for human languages or something. ³ Designing an actually learnable, universal(?) international auxillary language. ⁴ By which I mean if you print the unofficial web version it's 17 pages long. But you can fit it in sixteen if you remove the web-specific introductory paragraph, the \"joke word\" kijetesantakalu, and the web footer with the \"trans rights now!\" banner in it. ⁵ There's an awkward nuance in the specific case of prepositions: if you drop a preposition into verb position it still winds up \"behaving like\" a preposition, it's just that the preposition describes an action. It's probably more accurate to say that the preposition phrase becomes a verb rather than the preposition itself. So for example \"mi tawa kalama\" means \"I went toward the sound\" [kamala is a noun and the object of the preposition] not \"I went loudly\" [as it would be if kamala were an adverb modifying tawa as a verb]. Going into detail on this because I don't want to mislead anyone but \"you can form a sentence using an unmodified preposition as a verb\" is such a fun fact I wanted to include it. ⁶ I guess I could say \"what I'm calling 'clauses' are called 'word groups' in official sources; word groups are always separated by a particle or preposition\" but I'm not sure that's interesting unless you're a linguist. ⁷ There's a lot of repetition in this paragraph of both kinds that show what's cool about toki pona and what's kinda impractical about it. Cool, it has some sentences where a single word shows up twice conveying two different clear things based only on where it is in the sentence, like \"mi toki ike e toki ale\" where toki is a verb (\"I speak\") the first time and a noun (\"language\") the second. Less cool, because so much of the meaning of the hyper-versatile toki pona words is based on context, you sometimes wind up having to include multiple sentences saying nearly the same thing just to make sure the reader selects the correct context. I may have overdone it here. ⁸ There's also a low-traffic Mastodon instance, multiple forums including one run by the Merveilles crowd, and something called \"Wikipesija\" ⁹ Translation/explanation: ME: jan utala pi toki ni [\"We are the knights who say 'this'!\"] (\"ni\" is \"this\" in toki pona, which means the Holy Grail scene would seem to be the guy yelling \"We are the knights who say 'We are the knights who say this!'\" after which everyone else jumps around yelling \"this!\" \"this!\" as if agreeing) PERSON 1: (Responding to the fact I initially mispelled \"toki\" as \"toka\") What is a toka ME: ... spelling error :( ... deeply weird one (Weird because toki is literally in the name \"toki pona\" so it is by definition the first toki pona word anyone learns) BOT 1: a and i are 8 keys apart :/ BOT 2: (Trying to translate my comment) Could be \"an arguer in this conversation\" perhaps?

I've tried spanish, dutch, french, and even russian at one point because i just like trying to learn things but it was hard to get to a point where you could understand things or form basic sentances without being spoonfed by duolingo toki pona is still a bit dificult in some areas because of the word order and having to put a lot of effort into processing sentance structure to figure out what is actually being said, but it's the most fun i've had since trying to learn esperanto with an irl friend another fun aspect of toki pona is the context/perspectives. A car could be a travelling/moving tool or a moving room depending on if you're a driver or passenger. i also like how it encourages you to really think about what you're trying to say in order to communicate it in its simplist form. you can say complicated things if you really want to, but it takes more effort to say. login to reply Na @sodium 1 yr. ago fwiw, i think i recall there being mention of relatively sizeable japanese and korean toki pona communities? i think there was a telegram and a discord? but it's been a while since i was looking at toki pona stuff, so i might be misremembering login to reply ♡ evelyn dipshit ♡ @chigbarg 1 yr. ago Yes!

You can check my YouTube channel if you wish to see&#x2F;hear it live in action: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@janPolijan Toki Pona gives you the fun part of using a foreign language, but it skips the boring part of having to learn a ton a grammar and vocabulary. And the phonology is delightfully simple, so you won&#x27;t have a bad accent. There&#x27;s a growing and very active community around it and people write and share novels and songs. But it&#x27;s also useful just as a personal language because it&#x27;s really like a game for your mind. After a while, you reach proficiency and then fluency and it gets even better. It is absolutely possible to explain fairly complex things if you continue to push it. You obviously wouldn&#x27;t want to do engineering in Toki Pona, but explaining quite complex topics is absolutely possible if you really desire (for example, someone has put a YouTube video explaining non-euclidean geometry in Toki Pona). One final thing: contrary to popular belief, Toki Pona is not designed to be as minimal as possible (the \"tuki tiki\" conlang with only 39 words modifies Toki Pona and pushes towards true minimalism). Toki Pona sure is tiny, but it&#x27;s mostly designed to be fun and retain expressiveness. reply ghayes 9 hours agoparentI guess my question is: as you invent new phrases to describe more complex words, aren’t you effectively expanding the size of the language, even if this is “implicit”? Snowman in English is counted as a word, for instance. The advantage here of compound words is that you can easily get a gist without knowing exactly the meaning, similar to characters in Chinese that have a phonetic and meaning radical both present. reply florianist 8 hours agorootparentThere are common forms for certains words of course, but no lexicalisation. In Toki Pona, you&#x27;re not adding words, set phrases, to the language&#x27;s lexicon. So there are no compound words that would be set in stone and things can and do change depending on the situation. Let&#x27;s take an example: coffee. The word \"telo\" is some form liquid or water, so coffee could simply be just telo (if you&#x27;re in context where it&#x27;s clear), but you may just add it&#x27;s the dark&#x2F;black liquid (\"telo pimeja\"), or the strong hot drink (\"telo wawa seli\"), or the liquid of no sleep (\"telo pi lape ala\"), or there are many other possibilities depending on what&#x27;s the important aspect you emphasize and how brief or precise you want&#x2F;need to be (if you need a lot of precision, you&#x27;ll end up doing several sentences, but you&#x27;ll get there). reply jprete 8 hours agorootparentSet phrases aren’t consciously created, they’re the accumulated contextual&#x2F;cultural meaning that people remember for the phrase, until people no longer use it to point at the literal meaning. If some group always drinks coffee and never tea, then eventually “strong hot drink” means “coffee”, and an outsider who asks for their own group’s “strong hot drink” (always meaning tea) is going to get a bitter surprise. reply tgv 2 hours agorootparentSame goes for accents. Any group will develop an accent, and it will be dominated by the group&#x27;s native accent. Toki Pona won&#x27;t be able to escape those, not even at small scale. I also predict the inclusion of loan words, should the language ever go beyond purists. reply Brian_K_White 4 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think they would be surprised, since anyone having used the language enough to get to that point would know how it works, and they would know that they are not in their usual context.It&#x27;s like leaving out units of measure.

Except for the scripts, which both seem to be ideographic, but even then nothing precludes creating new ideographs. reply troupo 1 hour agorootparentAnd inevitably at one point something like \"hot brown water\" will become a single term for coffee. And then it will be contracted into something like \"hobrow\" because the original term was too long :) reply jahnu 4 hours agorootparentprevThe equi-complexity hypothesis states that all languages are equally complex and just trade off complexity in one area for simplicity in another.

You won&#x27;t find an easy way to express ideas like \"justice\" or \"quantum\". It&#x27;s a testament to its minimalist design, but it also means some concepts are lost in translation.Specific flora&#x2F;fauna - While you can use terms like \"kili\", \"kala\", or \"soweli\" to describe plants, fish, or mammals, respectively, don&#x27;t expect to convey specific species such as \"maple tree\" or \"cat\". It&#x27;s a broad brush approach that lacks granularity.Intensive modifiers - Toki pona leans hard on the word \"mute\" for intensifiers. This simplification might hinder nuanced expressions, as there&#x27;s a big gap between \"mute\" and a neutral descriptor.Collective nouns - The language only really has \"kulupu\" to describe collectives. So, distinguishing between, say, a \"flock\" and a \"crowd\" might get tricky.Idiomatic phrases - A repertoire of idioms or set phrases for common topics would make conversations feel more culturally rich and engaging. It&#x27;s one thing to communicate efficiently, but another to do so with character and flair.This isn&#x27;t criticism but an observation of the trade-offs made for simplicity. Every language has its quirks, and understanding these nuances can make for a richer linguistic experience. reply grey_earthling 10 hours agoparent> Abstract concepts - The language seems to skate over complex philosophical or scientific ideas. You won&#x27;t find an easy way to express ideas like \"justice\" or \"quantum\". It&#x27;s a testament to its minimalist design, but it also means some concepts are lost in translation.Justice could be translated as “sama pona” (literally “good sameness”). Quantum could be translated as “wan” (literally “unit”); so a quantum leap in the sense of a non-gradual physical movement would be “tawa wan” (“single movement”), whereas a quantum leap in the sense of a large change would be “ante suli” (“large difference”).You&#x27;re right that it is very easy to lose nuance in translation.

It&#x27;s a broad brush approach that lacks granularity.The idea is that rather than naming things, you describe them. A maple tree could be “kasi suwi” (“sweet tree”) or “kasi pi ma Kanata” (“Canadian tree”), depending on context. A cat could be “soweli pona” (“friendly animal”) or “soweli utala” (“fighty animal”) or “soweli utala pi luka kiwen” (“hard-clawed fighty animal”) or “soweli kalama” (“noisy animal”) or “soweli pona utala kalama” (“noisy fighty friend animal”), depending on your relationship to the individual.Toki pona forces you to think about which aspects are relevant to your meaning, and state the context explicitly. This is one of the stated intentions of the language, and therefore a feature rather than a bug :)> Idiomatic phrases - A repertoire of idioms or set phrases for common topics would make conversations feel more culturally rich and engaging.There are some of these, for example “jan pona” (“good person”) very commonly means “friend”. reply JimDabell 9 hours agorootparent> “jan pona” (“good person”) very commonly means “friend”.But “good person” and “friend” are two very different things. I might describe a well-known charitable figure as a good person, but that wouldn’t mean I would be calling them my friend. One is a value judgement and the other is a personal relationship. reply GuB-42 8 hours agorootparent...in EnglishBut English has similar ambiguities. For example, a \"girlfriend\" is usually not just a girl friend. Other expressions are used when there is no romantic relationship.I don&#x27;t know toki pona but there is probably another expression for actual good people. Maybe something like \"person of high value\". reply themoonisachees 44 minutes agorootparentThe language is also geared towards expressing ideas in general much more than expressing your own feelings. In this way, a \"good person\" is someone you would consider a friend even if you&#x27;ve never met, which while not exactly a concept that&#x27;s entirely sane on the internet, makes a lot of sense in a more thighs knit community (eg: a good person is a friend to the community and therefore a friend to me). reply gpgn 4 hours agorootparentprev\"Arm\" and \"hand\" are two very different things (I guess?), but they are the same word (рука) in Russian. reply bryanlarsen 8 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s likely no different than a homonym in English or a word with multiple meanings. Almost always context makes the meaning clear. reply Kwpolska 2 hours agorootparentprevIf I ask you \"do you have a pet?\", and you respond \"yes, I have a cat\", I can easily imagine the pet you have and be generally right (maybe except the colour). How would you respond in Toki Pona so that an average person would understand you have a cat, not a dog or a guinea pig or fish or a rabbit? reply masklinn 1 hour agorootparentFrom other comments, you would probably describe the pet’s features (likely with a fair amount of confusion &#x2F; fuzziness), or some feature-descriptions might be stand-ins for specific animals.For instance imagine that rather than a cat your pet is a chuckwalla, while that name is quite precise, it is almost certainly useless to the average conversation partner because most people have no idea whatsoever what a chuckwalla is (or that there’s something called a chuckwalla in the first place). reply sowbug 9 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve studied three foreign languages (four if you count a failed Toki Pona attempt a while ago), and I find it neat to discover a new grammatical concept, such as subjunctive in Spanish, which exists but only barely in English, or to realize that a language is missing an English construct, such as Mandarin, which doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near as many gendered words as Germanic or Romance languages. As with computer languages, it&#x27;s rarely the case that something is inexpressible, but it might have to be done differently compared to another language. I don&#x27;t completely buy into the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but I do believe that cultural differences are partly attributable to grammar and vocabulary. reply marmakoide 8 hours agoparentprevIn Mandarin and Vietnamese, you can build new words by concatenation of words with broad meanings. Say, a plane is \"flying machine\", a mobile phone is a \"hand machine\", and a fridge is a \"cold closet\". In practice, it&#x27;s very effective and it allows you to either guess the commonly used concatenations, or make up your own and you might be understood. I assume you can do that in Toki Pona too ? reply bonoboTP 12 minutes agorootparentMost languages are like this. That English words are so opaque is quite a historically contingent thing, not the baseline of how languages usually work. English retains a lot of Latin and Greek and French compounds, which are usually translated more literally in many other languages.In German, plane is Flugzeug (flight tool), fridge is Kühlschrank (cooling closet). In Hungarian, they are repülőgép (flying machine) and hűtőszekrény (cooling closet) as well, calqued from German.English speakers often perceive this as some kind of endearing primitive Tarzan-like communication without all those classy prestigious words, but English also has plenty examples. How about \"washing machine\" for example? reply Sharlin 2 hours agorootparentprevAnd of course in many languages more related to English as well, such as (a bit infamously) German. And obviously there are compound words in English as well, either concatenated (\"snowman\", \"airport\") or not (\"cell phone\", \"compound word\"). reply wongarsu 8 hours agorootparentprevEven English kind of does this, just playing parcour through multiple languages, and with time and use shortening the compound words to shorter alternatives.

I’m also not sure whether most of the existing grammatical markers would survive long, in particular “li” seems redundant and would likely be optimized away in just a few generations. Similarly, the grammar would likely become more complex and gain complex clauses and some grammatical markers for event structure (e.g. time specification) - these are all important things which right now are not ergonomic to use.At any rate, very smart exercise in linguistic minimalism.

It needs its own entry in a dictionary.edit: Not to mention compound words in English, which any linguist would say are just one word (\"hot dog\") but because of spelling conventions, people tend to parse as two words.

I need to correct this. It was never intended to be a \"diplomatic\" language, as such a language only spoken by diplomats between their kind. So the language of a small elite, which does not want to deal with the average man on the street. That sounds like a story which was said about the predecessor of Esperanto: Volapük.Esperanto was at some point in time the \"workers latin\", because the less educated worker could learn it as a means to talk with people from other nations.

The distinction is an important one.By saying you create a diplomatic language, you are marketing towards the elite, as I wrote in my post.By saying that everybody speaks it as a second language, which is indeed what Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, wanted is a different focus. The first is focusing on an elite, the latter focuses on the people.It&#x27;s like the distinction between \"computers for knowledge workers\" and \"personal computers\", the first is only for a small elite, the latter is for everybody. Or the distinction between \"politics for a couple of few\" and \"politics elected by everybody\", the first is called a form of dictatorship, the latter democracy. reply neontomo 8 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the balanced reply! Yes you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m only using lossless and lossy as a metaphor here, because of course, any translation will lose information. Even speaking your native tongue with another fluent speaker will lose information because the meaning is interpreted.However, I&#x27;d say that well-developed languages (which for me means having many hyper-specific words and a diverse vocab available) allows interpretation to be more precise and functionally allow communication to happen. With Toki Pona I have the sense that a lot more is lost, and we end up interpreting broad strokes of the original meaning. This isn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just different.

Does anyone > happen to know how Esperanto compares? As far as I know, it should be > quite similar to a \"normal\" (non-con)language in this regard (just simpler > to learn, with bonus points if you speak a romance language afaik)As an Esperanto-speaker with a shallow understanding of Toki Pona I can say the following comparison:1. Esperanto has way more vocabulary, which is useful for translating nuances from one source language to another language and back. This was added over the years and is still expanding, as any other living language does.2. Esperanto words are way more specific than the one of Toki Pona. A sentence which I took from a Toki Pona cheatsheet \"soweli li moku\" can be translated as \"a land animal is eating\", \"a cat is drinking\", \"a dog is ingesting\", etc. so highly context depending. Esperanto would for the specific meaning of \"a cat is eating\" allow \"kato estas manĝanta\" or, if you don&#x27;t care for the present progressive tense, which is normally how people speak it, \"kato manĝas\" (present tense).3. Toki Pona glues words together by putting them each after the other, without glueing the roots together. \"telo pimeja\" was one example of trying to say \"coffee\". The Esperanto principle would be to say nigroakvo (a kind of water, which is black). Besides that Esperanto allows more nuanced distinctions like adjectives, so \"nigra akvo\" would mean \"black water\", the water, which is black. Also as I wrote earlier, the roots in Esperanto are way more specific. \"akvo\" is in Epseranto just water, not liquid, not fluid, not beverage as is the meaning of \"telo\" is in Toki Pona. Also \"nigra\" is in Esperanto \"black\", not dark, not unlit, as is the meaning of \"pimeja\" is in Toki Pona. Besides that was just an example based on the word coffee, which someone else in this topic used. The actual word of \"coffee\" in Esperanto is \"kafo\" and for tea is \"teo\", because words which are sufficiently internationally understood are put into the language by the speakers of it.4. Esperanto is simpler to learn, it provides the same high rewarding learning curve as does Toki Pona, but it&#x27;s steeper, because it&#x27;s a bigger language. Depending on intelligence, learning style, being able to focus on things regularly, motivation, connections to other speakers, time I would say people can use the language after 3 months to one year. How good that is, that&#x27;s another question. I learnt the language more intensively in the first year and then just maintained it, used it and improved upon it.5. Esperanto uses an agglutination based way of building words, as I wrote in the example of point 3, based on my little understanding of linguistic terms, this could be called \"synthesizing\" words, but it also supports building phrases as does Toki Pona in an analytical way. \"Ĉu mi povas uzi la lazertranĉilon?\" (Can I use the lasercutter?) or \"Ĉu mi povas uzi la ilo kiu tranĉas per lazero?\" (Can I use the machine, which cuts with a lazer?). Toki Pona would be something like \"mi li pali ala pali e suno ilo\" (Can I use the sun-tool?). \"ilo\" by the way is a word taken from Esperanto, as the creator of Toki Pona also understood Esperanto, which means \"tool\".6. Esperanto has 136 years of literature behind it, Toki Pona doesn&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s wait another 136 years and see which of all the current constructed languages are then still around and see how much is produced in them.7. When you learn Esperanto you have acquired some shared vocabulary in romance languages, but also a little bit of other languages in the mix, like German. Which can be a little bit helpful when learning after Esperanto then those languages. Or trying to navigate on a trip through Italy, you won&#x27;t understand 80% of what people are saying, but here and there you will encounter words, which sound familiar. Which shows the so called \"eurocentricity\" of Esperanto, which is then used by some to campaign against the language, as if that property makes it the ultimate evil in the world, if they would apply the same standard to speaking English, then they would stop writing in the internet at all.8. Toki Pona is overhyped. Esperanto is not hyped anymore. Any long existing constructed language loses it&#x27;s appeal at some point, because the times have changed, people don&#x27;t understand the history of it, believe anything which at first sounds enough plausible, but is in fact bullshit. Worldwide auxiliary languages like Esperanto always have the problem to be not \"perfect\" enough, they all replace each other in an eternal asymptomatic drive towards \"more perfection\", without ever reaching that goal. Thus in the end the most working language in that category is still Esperanto and hopefully will be for the next 136 years. But that&#x27;s only my personal pet opinion.Anyway, as I&#x27;m digressing into some general rant about planned languages, I end this comment, I can surely answer concrete questions about comparing these two languages later on, if wanted. reply bravura 13 hours agoparentprevHere was GPT4 giving me a full literal and then figurative translation of the sample text:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;50fd27af-7515-4f89-b0e1-228501... reply coder543 13 hours agoparentprevYou assume that existing ones can’t?Using the example provided in the main link, ChatGPT-4 had no trouble at all: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;3b8faf2e-4eca-4d52-97fb-ac89a4... reply clankyclanker 13 hours agorootparentThis is precisely the case where ChatGPT (or any LLM) will have trouble that a layperson would have trouble validating: Toki Pona has a limited document corpus and requires contextual interpretation obvious to experts.In short, expect hallucinations and other lies. reply coder543 13 hours agorootparentIn this case, I validated against the hand-translated example in the main link.

Yes, ChatGPT can be wrong. So can Google Translate!If you’d like to provide a clear example of ChatGPT-4 (not ChatGPT-3.5) making up a Toki Pona translation that is completely disconnected from reality, please do. That would be legitimately interesting conversational material. General cynicism isn’t.ChatGPT absolutely has limitations, and translation is a hard problem, even for the industry-standard tools. Crossvalidation with multiple translation tools and ideally humans is important for any translations that actually matter. reply janAkali 7 hours agorootparentAnother challenge, is that toki pona requires a lot of context, not only of previous sentences, but visual and communal. For example, I can say &#x27;soweli lili&#x27; and point to a cat, then in all further conversations &#x27;soweli lili&#x27; will mean exactly a &#x27;cat&#x27; until specified.I could use sentence that could mean literally hundred thousand of different things, but if I explain it properly once, you are expected to keep it as context.ChatGPT4 will struggle to keep all context as it will surely accumulate. reply dotancohen 12 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]> In this case, I validated against the hand-translated example in the main link. It did fine.Presumably that hand-translated example was also part of the training data. reply mistercow 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve done a fair amount of translating Toki Pona based on my own sentences, and based on recent online posts.

That&#x27;s an opinion I suppose.-edit- After posting, I decided this was too snarky&#x2F;low value on it&#x27;s own.

Absolutely not. Does it hallucinate&#x2F;get things wrong? Absolutely. Is it useful despite those limitations? Emphatically yes.This idea that its \"only valid use\" is entertainment doesn&#x27;t even make sense to me. \"Entertainment\" is perhaps where I find it the most deficient relative to other current options. reply kordlessagain 13 hours agorootparentprevLies are typically done on purpose and in this example used to indicate intent, when there is none. reply devit 13 hours agorootparentprevSeems ineffective with abstract concepts.\"In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a distance, duration or temperature.

GPT3 doesn&#x27;t translate this very well, it seems to miss the fine points of grammar, but maybe GPT4 would do better reply coder543 9 hours agorootparentThis is what GPT4 came up with for the translation:> The text you provided is in Toki Pona, a constructed language with a minimalistic vocabulary. The translation to English is challenging due to the highly context-dependent and simplified nature of the language. Without further context, here&#x27;s a rough translation:> \"When I count many things, cutting things is not possible. When one new thing comes, I increase the count by one. But I can&#x27;t increase the count by cutting it. In the case of counting many things, this is not possible: two things and a cut of one thing exist. But when I count large things, cutting all numbers is possible. When something becomes large by cutting one, I can increase the count by cutting one. Cutting can make everything small. This counting method can count large things, long times, and hot things. In the case of counting large things, it&#x27;s possible: when I write a number, this writing can count it but is not the same as writing a different number. But with many numbers, its writing is always large and cannot end.\"> Please note that the translation might not capture all the nuances, and the interpretation may vary based on the context in which the text is used. reply tbodt 7 hours agorootparentMuch closer reply coder543 13 hours agorootparentprev> Seems ineffective with abstract conceptsI’ve only heard of Toki Pona for about 20 minutes, but everything I’m reading says that’s just a normal property of the language, not a limitation of ChatGPT.As a human, which of the 120 Toki Pona words would you confidently and correctly translate as “continuous” or “real” or any of these other linguistically uncommon concepts?Based on my own chat with ChatGPT, I feel almost certain that it warned you about this exact limitation of the language, but you ignored that? reply devit 13 hours agorootparent\"continuous\" (in this actually incorrect usage, since the correct term is \"dense\")->said of an algebraic structure such that for every x != y there exists z such that x characteristic (\"nimi\"?) of a set (\"poki\") where for (\"tawa?\") all (\"ale\") thing (\"ijo\") different (\"ante\" + \"lon\"?) than other (\"ante\" + \"nimi\"?) thing (\"ito\") there exists (\"lon\") a new (\"sin\") thing (\"ijo\") such that the first (\"wan\" + \"nimi\" + \"ito\"?) thing is less (\"lili\") than the new thing (\"sin\" + \"ito\"?) and the new thing (\"sin\" + \"ito\"?) is less (\"lili\") that the second thing (\"tu\" + \"nimi\" + \"ito\"?)Would need some way to join into a grammatical structure and probably a preamble that establishes that the context is mathematics. reply Rebelgecko 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat about going the other way? I&#x27;m on chat gpt3.5 FWIW, but when I ask it to translate simple phrases from English to Toki Pona (electric car, barking dog, etc) it hallucinates words that aren&#x27;t in the ~120 word dictionary I found. reply coder543 6 hours agorootparentAs you noticed, ChatGPT3.5 is extremely prone to hallucination. It can still happen on ChatGPT4, but it is much less frequent, in my experience.Here is what I got on the first try: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;88b0358e-c96d-4880-b939-7c62cf...The answers seem plausible, and the words are actual Toki Pona words.My special instructions have nothing to do with language or translation, but for the sake of transparency I did it a second time with custom instructions disabled: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;b85a59d9-2678-45c8-8c2e-8b8a80...Regardless, there is a very limited dictionary to work with in Toki Pona, so communicating extremely specific ideas seems like it is always going to be problematic.

Nice work! reply spanspan 9 hours agoparentRe: ACID guaranteesIt doesn&#x27;t have a notion of atomically batching multiple statements, i.e. transaction. But beyond that, it&#x27;s a single file database, which can only have a single process (learndb instance) that is operating on the database (file). So you get consistency and isolation via being a single connection database. Durability, you get to the extent that the file system is durable. So it&#x27;s somewhere on the ACIDity spectrum.Re: Query planning&#x2F;optimizationI haven&#x27;t implemented this; but I&#x27;ve considered where the optimization could module sit: The parser spits out an AST. This or a derived intermediate representation could be optimized,i.e. the AST could be rewritten or nodes deleted, before the VM executes the AST. reply jarulraj 8 hours agoprevReally cool project!I am curious about the benefits and limitations of using Python in this project as opposed to C++. How well is LearnDB able to support low-level concurrency control and storage management? reply spanspan 8 hours agoparentI began using python as a way to \"mock\" out the overall design; intending to re-implement it in rust. The main reasoning for using python: was the ability to focus on \"high-level\" concepts and speed of tinkering. This implements a single process, single thread, single connection database- so performance and low-level concurrency control were not explicit goals or really optimized for. For those (real-live concerns) rust or C++ are much better; but also come with their set of complexities. reply indymike 9 hours agoprevFirst, great project. Second, the code is very readable.

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP PERSONAL TECH Judge denies HP's plea to throw out all-in-one printer lockdown lawsuit 56 AiO devices won't scan or fax without ink, and plaintiffs say IT giant illegally withheld that info from buyers Brandon Vigliarolo Fri 11 Aug 2023 // 23:28 UTC HP all-in-one printer owners, upset that their devices wouldn't scan or fax when low on ink, were handed a partial win in a northern California court this week after a judge denied HP's motion to dismiss their suit. The plaintiffs argued in their amended class action complaint [PDF] that HP withheld vital information by including software in its all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machines that disabled non-printing functions when out of ink and not telling buyers that was the case. \"It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to manufacture an All-in-One printer that scans or faxes when the device is out of ink,\" the plaintiffs argued in their complaint. The amended complaint was filed in February this year after US federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed the suit on the grounds that it hadn't properly stated a claim. Armed with their amended complaint, lawyers for San Francsican Gary Freund and Minneapolis resident Wayne McMath have succeeded at not only making relevant claims, but also surviving an attempt by HP to have the entire case dismissed for a second time. In the amended complaint, Freund and McMath's lawyers argue that HP's move to disable devices that were low on ink was intentional, citing HP's own comments from a support forum post in which an HP support agent told a user complaining of similar issues that their \"HP printer is designed in such a way that with the empty cartridge or without the cartridge [the] printer will not function.\" \"At this stage, the message board post amounts to a factual allegation that bolster plaintiffs' allegations that HP designed its printers to disable certain functions when their ink is depleted,\" Judge Freeman said in her order [PDF] handed down yesterday. HP pays $1.3m to settle dispute over printer security chip HP Inc to lay off up to 6,000 staff, cut costs by $1.4 billion Florida man might just stick it to HP for injecting sneaky DRM update into his printers that rejected non-HP ink HP: That print-free-for-life deal we promised you? Well, now it's pay-per-month to continue using your printer ink Additionally, Judge Freeman found the plaintiffs had \"adequately\" described \"the alleged defect and HP's knowledge of that defect,\" they had adequately pleaded that HP had a duty to disclose the restrictions, and that the defect occurred within the warranty period since the devices were shipped with ink cartridge limitations for non-printing features. Judge Freeman allowed other claims to stand as well, only dismissing the plaintiffs' request for equitable restitution under the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Otherwise, Freeman said, \"these allegations are sufficient\" to allow the case to proceed. This isn't the first time HP has been taken to court over claims it improperly locked printers down. In 2022 the IT giant settled a European lawsuit for $1.35 million alleging it used security chips and DRM-like software to prevent any third-party cartridges from functioning in HP printers. The US corporation has dealt with similar cases in Australia and America, which were settled. HP hasn't responded to our questions about the latest lawsuit. Canon, another printer manufacturer that sells all-in-one devices, was sued in 2021 for the exact same reasons as Freund and McMath's suit against HP - that Canon all-in-ones disabled non-printing functions when ink was low. That case was settled late last year for an undisclosed sum. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey More about HP Inc Lawsuit Printer More like these 56 COMMENTS TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like SEC lawsuit against Terraform Labs and cofounder Do Kwon lives to fight another day Crypto bad boy’s appeal denied, despite recent Ripple Labs ruling LEGAL 13 days2 Epic snub by Supreme Court in battle to escape Apple App Store payment prison This fight over IAP is getting, dare we say, unreal EDGE + IOT 4 days6 Cigna sued for using software to deny healthcare insurance claims It's just some if-then statements, no AI here, insurer sniffs APPLICATIONS 19 days31 Innovation unlocks new value of data Huawei solutions transform mission-critical FSI scenarios SPONSORED FEATURE Apple owes Brit iOS app devs millions from excessively high commission, lawsuit claims Lawyers look to scale the walled garden APPLICATIONS 20 days21 Tesla board members to return $735M in compensation settlement Look who is learning to share: Deal includes no admission of fault, naturally PERSONAL TECH 27 days40 We will find you and we will sue you, Twitter tells 4 mystery alleged data-scrapers Lawyers say unknown John Does are profiting at Musk's expense LEGAL 1 month90 Celsius feels the heat: Ex-CEO arrested, watchdogs line up to sue bankrupt crypto biz Exec faces fraud charges, one regulator wants $5 billion fine CYBER-CRIME 1 month10 SpaceX says, sure, Starship blew up but you can forget about the rest of that lawsuit Won't someone think of the (checks notes) Kemp's Ridley sea turtle?

This will of course cause printer mfrs to double down on their lockdowns (\"Sorry, your toner is too old so you&#x27;ll have to go out and buy new a new cartridge\"). But its their anti-consumer practices that drive people not to print.My kiddo bought a new printer in 2015 because he had to print something for high school and the toner cartridge was empty. It was cheaper to buy a whole replacement brother with the starter cartridge than to just get a cartridge (and it was delivered for free within the a couple of hours!). I still have it, still use it once in a while, and it&#x27;s still on that same starter cartridge and maybe the same ream of paper.

The thing was an utter pos, it&#x27;s crazy that it could be sold like that.I&#x27;ve since replaced it with a standalone Brother b&w laser printer and an HP ADF scanner and lo and behold both devices just work, I can scan and process my mail using scanline and python and print the occasional document and both devices take up less space than the Canon pos. reply badcppdev 30 minutes agoparentSo how does HP make money from that scanner?

HP may have shared some printer technology with another company.There is nothing new in this space. HP hasn&#x27;t exactly been the beacon of customer satisfaction thanks to their restrictive policies.

The printed documents look like trash and obviously aren&#x27;t in color, but they are readable and frankly, they&#x27;ll do.I have yet to run into a situation where this thermal printed document is not accepted by the other party in case the other party requires a printed document and I can&#x27;t work around that requirement digitally.Aaand I don&#x27;t have to deal with any sort of ink or anything of the sort. Someone downthread mentioned the idea of an open source printer and how complicated it would be for the maker community to build one.

The HP required you to drill a hole in the cartridge and then use a plug to seal it (which often leaked).HP&#x27;s inkjet printhead also makes a distinct annoying sucking air sound. Nobody else&#x27;s inkjet does that. I don&#x27;t even like their plotters for the same reason lol.The second reason was the rollers were made out of cheap rubber and my dj500 seemed to rather often need attention.Dude I have a 13 year old canon where I&#x27;ve never cleaned the rollers, never replaced the print head (maybe once? I forgot), and I have always used cheap generic ink from amazon in it. I&#x27;ve probably spent less than $100 on ink the entire time I&#x27;ve owned the machine.Sadly, newer Canons don&#x27;t seem to be that good. I &#x27;replaced&#x27; mine with a new one that I got free with a laptop, and it died after a year lol. Like, totally dead.Anyway, I stand with the Brother laser printer crowd lol.

After browsing the internet a bit, I found a trick on an obscure forum that worked for me: you put a small piece of tape on the cartridge chip, and miraculously it&#x27;s not detected as \"empty\" anymore. Two years after the procedure, I&#x27;m still printing on the same cartridge that was supposedly empty. reply basilgohar 8 hours agorootparentprevIt was only a matter of time. I bought mine for this reason, and I realize that when the time comes to replace it, I will have to find another vendor, if one even exists, since Brother no longer waves that banner of openness. reply throwaway914 10 hours agoparentprevThank you for this. I didn&#x27;t know about the EURion constellation thing. Very cool&#x2F;alienating examples of DRM. reply zapataband1 6 hours agoparentprevAlso the recyclability of those toners and ink cartridges, they&#x27;d rather sell you a subscription for cartridges than allow 3rd party refillable ones reply darth_avocado 12 hours agoprev> Canon, another printer manufacturer that sells all-in-one devices, was sued in 2021 for the exact same reasons as Freund and McMath&#x27;s suit against HP - that Canon all-in-ones disabled non-printing functions when ink was low. That case was settled late last year for an undisclosed sum.They should not allow settlements in cases like this. There should be a ruling and one that forces companies to not continue these bad practices. reply crazydoggers 12 hours agoparentYou can’t not allow settlements. The plantiff brings the case. You can’t tell a plantiff they are unable to withdraw their case, you’d be infringing on the rights of the plantiff.Yes it works against the creation of precedent, but the court system is meant to provide a resolution of dispute between parties. The creation of precedent is a side effect of that process, not it’s primary goal.Edit: And just to end on a note of positivity, the courts aren’t really the place to make changes like this anyhow, which is out of most people’s hands. Instead we can lobby our Congress people etc to make laws that can end these practices (which is where most of our consumer protections have come from). reply the_lego 11 hours agorootparentOn the other hand, there are laws against false advertising and (in this case) sabotage, where the action is illegal regardless of what a plaintiff thinks. If I went around offices and sabotaged their printers, the district attorney could prosecute me regardless of what the office owners thought (assuming they wouldn&#x27;t lie and claim they authorized my sabotage).This case is exactly the same. Don&#x27;t be fooled - despite HP&#x27;s name on the printers, they&#x27;re not HP&#x27;s printers anymore - they sold them, and have no more claim to them than I.Tangentially, and orthogonal to the issue of if settlements should be allowed, undisclosed settlements should be banned. The public has a right to know what terms are reached through the threat of and with the sanction of the legal system. Because in a democracy, the public is ultimately responsible for reforming or maintaining that system, and how can they do that when they don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s being used? reply crazydoggers 11 hours agorootparentFirst the example you mention confuses civil and criminal proceeding. Sabotaging people’s private property is a criminal act. District attornies bring criminal cases, not civil.The government could bring a civil suit as plantiff, (like the attorney general’s office) but the government would have to show its been harmed. Perhaps for instance through cost of printers used in government offices, or if some specific statute was violated.Also regarding any settlement. If it’s class action it’s public. If it was from a private individual plantiff, then they have a right to privacy you can’t just ignore. reply the_lego 11 hours agorootparent> Sabotaging people’s private property is a criminal act.That&#x27;s what happened here. Refusing to scan without ink is sabotage.> If it was from a private individual plantiff, then they have a right to privacy you can’t just ignore.And the public has a right to transparency in the legal system. The rights are in conflict, and given the obvious risks of a black-box legal system, the right to transparency should prevail. reply crazydoggers 11 hours agorootparentYou have a right to my private contract with someone? Because that’s what a settlement is. What you’re saying is that all contracts need to be made public? That seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water.>> Sabotaging people’s private property is a criminal act.> That&#x27;s what happened here. Refusing to scan without ink is sabotage.Breaking into someone’s office and physically damaging their property as in your example is different than a machine that disables itself. The machine can’t commit criminal acts. If you’re arguing that the CEO of HP commited a criminal act, that’s a stretch, as I have no idea what criminal law you’d say he broke. On top of which criminal cases have a much higher burden of proof, so civil litigation is likely to provide a better outcome.And anyway, again, the proper venue for this, is to create better consumer protection laws in the first place. The judicial system isn’t going to magically police companies. We as the people have to hold them accountable and that means voting, lobbying etc, just as is being done with right to repair bills. The judicial system can compensate for harm, which hopefully will happen here, but it’s only part of the solution. reply lelanthran 4 hours agorootparent> You have a right to my private contract with someone? Because that’s what a settlement is. What you’re saying is that all contracts need to be made public?I hear what you are saying, but a contract is only private while both parties agree that the other is not in breach. The minute you want to enforce a contract its contents are made fully public.TBH, I don&#x27;t think anyone who got a life-changing amount of money from a settlement would want to jeopardise that by breaching the NDA and forcing the other party to sue, making the contract open to public inspection. replyeclipticplane 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s stopping someone else from copying the lawsuit? reply ipython 6 hours agorootparentProbably the fact their printer is now bricked after attempting to use third party ink …(Sorry couldn’t resist) reply darth_avocado 11 hours agorootparentprevSettlements have clauses usually that prevent the same litigation from happening again. Otherwise it’s an infinite money glitch where people keep suing the same company again and again once it’s proven they’re willing to settle. reply crazydoggers 11 hours agorootparentYou can always bring your own case as long as you were not a party to the settlement. Though for it to be successful you’re probably going to have to show you suffered more than the average class member.For instance you buy a dishwasher that is faulty. There’s a class action settlement, but for you, the dishwasher ruined your apartment and the neighbors downstairs. You can opt out and sue directly even if there’s been a class settlement. reply crazydoggers 11 hours agorootparentprevIf it’s class action, then you have to not have participated.If you didn’t, then you can bring your own suit. But in order to bring a suit you’d have to show you’ve been harmed, so you’d have to have been a customer of one of these printers. reply devsegal 12 hours agoprev [–] That&#x27;s amusing - I initially read this as \"Judge denies Harry Potter&#x27;s plea to throw out all-in-one printer lockdown lawsuit.\" replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

JESSICA WILDFIRE Arquimedes AUGUST 11 2023 10:15 AM 4 MIN READ 7 SHARE Back in my 20s, I used to hang out with trust fund kids. They told me about the paid internships their parents lined up for them. They bragged about taking long lunches and shopping on the clock. One chick laughed about her firm accidentally sending her three checks after her last day. She tried to return the money. \"Keep it,\" they said. Even my non-rich friends found ways to slack off. I had friends who managed to sneak back to their apartments for sex. I've worked at bars where the bartenders and servers snorted coke in the bathroom. It made them more productive. It made them smile. These days, I work at a university. I have bosses making $200,000 a year. Do you know what we've caught them doing at the office? Watching soccer games. Taking selfies. Holding wine tastings. Zooming with family. Reading for edification. Holding meetings that were more like social gatherings. David Graeber's essay on bullshit jobs blew the myth of office productivity wide open a few years ago. The elite have been promising us shorter work weeks for about a hundred years. We have the technology. As we speak, they're bragging about their new AI minions. The vast majority of us know what it's like to work an office job. It's full of bullshit errands that don't matter. It's full of distractions. A lot of that gets filed under \"office culture.\" A lot of us finish our core duties in a few hours. We spend the rest of the day looking busy so we don't get fired. At the other end of the spectrum, some office workers can't ever get their real work done because of all the pointless interruptions they have to put up with. Before the pandemic, the internet was filled with stories about the evils of office work. It was bad for your productivity. It was bad for your creativity. It was bad for your health. They were trying to sell us treadmill desks. Remember all that? Now everything has changed. If you work from home, apparently you're a lazy bum who wastes company time by snacking, playing video games, watching Netflix, shopping, hanging out with your friends, drinking, spending time with your family, or having sex. You're an awful person. How dare you cook a healthy lunch at home. How dare you go for a walk in the middle of the day to clear your head. How dare you take a short nap to regain your focus. Didn't you know that an epic commute is actually good for your mental health? Sitting in a cubicle is great for your heart. So, what's really going on here? It’s about real estate. That's it. There's an office real estate apocalypse unfolding. Corporate landlords currently hold $1.2 trillion in loans on office towers all over the country. In some cases, these are the same assholes who've been buying up all the houses and driving up prices on residential real estate, too. They were greedy, and dumb. When the pandemic hit, these landlords did something even dumber. As The Financial Times states, they took advantage of “nearly free money” from the Federal Reserve to buy up “trophy office buildings.” Now that everyone is embracing remote work, they can’t lease that office space to anyone. They have a bunch of zombie office towers. They can’t do anything with them. Some of these commercial real estate owners are trying to turn their empty buildings into apartments and restaurants, but it’s an expensive overhaul. Not every zombie office building makes a great apartment. They’re stuck. Anywhere from 12 to 20 percent of office space remains vacant. It’s worse than the 2008 recession. If these landlords can’t find a way to make money off their corporate real estate soon, they’re going to start defaulting on their loans. The landlords will go bankrupt, and banks will wind up with giant office towers they can’t sell. More than $1 trillion will go poof. The Federal Reserve’s misguided war on inflation has made everything even worse over the last couple of years. By raising interest rates, they’ve motivated more companies to ditch their office leases. Now commercial real estate is in a death spiral that could tank the economy (again). There’s more bad news. Major cities have spent the last several decades catering to these corporate landlords. Now their entire downtowns rely on workers for commerce. We’re talking about all those restaurants and coffee shops that serve breakfast and lunch to white-collar workers, and all the bars where people used to go and complain about work before they spent an hour commuting home. These cities also depend on property taxes from overpriced commercial real estate. When nobody wants those buildings, their value plummets. New York alone has lost $453 billion in office real estate. Across the U.S., office buildings have shed anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of their value. So, we have a problem. Once again, the elite have gotten themselves into big trouble. They want the rest of us to bail them out. If they don't want our tax money, they want us to give up our freedom and autonomy. They want us to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of capitalism to protect their fortunes. They don't care how productive we are. They don't care how creative we are. They sure as hell don't care about our health. It's all a bunch of lies. They only care about one thing, forcing warm bodies back into office buildings to stop the commercial real estate apocalypse. That's it.

Most office-oriented employers don’t own much if any real estate; they lease it. And unless they’re really huge, what _they_ do has very little influence on the price of real estate generally; they’ve no individual incentive here. Arguably a mild counter—incentive; it’s generally to their benefit, as renters of real estate, if future real-estate costs drop.Now, of course, you could argue that it’s pension funds and things exerting control via ownership, but again, this is a bit of a stretch; it’d require a lot of coordination, and there’s no evidence it’s happening. And this would only be a real possibility, at most, for active funds; index funds can’t really threaten to sell a company’s stock if it doesn’t do what they want. And, if this was a thing, you’d expect that the Shadowy Fund Conspiracy would have made more of an effort to save _retail_, whose bleeding out over the last few decades has been a constant problem for commercial real estate.(Also, in most cases, it’s mostly _different funds_; even within a single fund provider, the fund that owns lots of commercial real estate and the fund that owns lots of tech company are generally different funds, with different fund managers, designed for people with different risk profiles. This would make the sort of coordination imagined here even more fraught.)I get why people like this idea; it’s a just-so story. But it’s very hard to see how it would work.I suspect companies are pushing for this because their leaderships genuinely believe it is good for productivity, though as far as I can see there’s an absence of hard evidence. (I personally strongly dislike working from home, and got back to an office as soon as it was allowed, but the idea that it hurts productivity doesn’t gel with what I’ve seen, at all.) reply moonchrome 13 hours agoparentI also believe COVID fucked productivity globally and executives thought it was a temporary thing due to measures in place.But I feel like COVID situation triggered stuff that either accelerated existing trends or introduced new problems, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going back.People quoting productivity drops from new hires during COVID omit insane hiring in tech - implying that remote work is to blame and not their structure inability to scale to utilize those unprecedented numbers of new hires productively. Especially since most of the hiring was aimless \"we need to grow headcount to capture the market growth\". People getting paid serious money to literally sit around. That&#x27;s going to cascade in other ways - I feel like entire industry standard of acceptable delivery sinkedGetting people back to the office sounds like a nice narrative because it&#x27;s relatively easy to fix and corelate.It&#x27;s also, conveniently, entirely not the fault of upper management for insane over hiring and underutilization. reply NotYourLawyer 12 hours agoparentprevPeople want to see “the elites” as one homogeneous cabal out to protect themselves at the expense of the little guy. In reality, it’s a bunch of self-interested individuals whose incentives don’t overlap here. The companies using office space have no reason to waste money helping out their landlords, and would much rather profit by screwing them over.As you say, this theory does not make much sense. reply birksherty 54 minutes agorootparentMakes sense because rich business owners helping other rich people is a thing. These are not landlords, they are big companies. reply zer8k 11 hours agorootparentprevWhen they talk about \"the elites\" they are talking about a cabal and yes, it does exist. Vanguard and Blackrock created this environment by simply owning more real estate (via other companies) than anyone else. This, combined with their ESG score, is absolutely toxic to \"the little guy\". They tell their constituent publicly held companies that they&#x27;re losing big on real estate and the next day 2,000 articles on the reason remote work is terrible come out. This is further compounded by one of the major avenues of reaping back money from startups is VC owned property. There isn&#x27;t conspiracy here. Blackrock in particular is well known as a major buyer of real estate holding companies.Expand that from strictly finance to other facets of life and you&#x27;ll fine similar cabals. Groceries? Yep. News? Yep. They do exist, and it&#x27;s not simply self interested self-made individuals at the helm. They are a product, not the genesis, of the very real so-called Illuminati you occasionally hear about.EDIT: Fastest downvotes in the west wow.

Not a lot of evidence. reply lumost 13 hours agorootparentThe divergence between small and large firms tells the story here. Small firms don&#x27;t own their real estate and are cutting as fast as they can. Large firms who own are forcing their employees back to the office. We&#x27;ll see in 20 years which is the better play. reply theonlybutlet 10 hours agoparentprevGenerally apart from break clauses (usually midway through a lease) companies are liable for the full lease cost and can&#x27;t give early notice for termination.In accounting terms, leases according to IFRS 16 are recognized as a lease liability and a contra right of use asset for the full term of the lease.I&#x27;m not 100% certain on the rationale of an impairment (as it could be construed as no longer useful) but if these companies aren&#x27;t using these properties, auditors may force them to impair their leases, meaning large write offs and accounting losses. reply worrycue 10 hours agorootparentWon&#x27;t they just do whatever is most profitable?

I think that communication can be indirect or even negative in nature, but it has to be there. But if everyone that owns commercial real estate has lower margins, that would eventually lower property taxes for such properties, which hurts city revenue. City planners can connect the dots and push for rto, no communication necessary. reply 1attice 13 hours agorootparentI could be wrong here but I don&#x27;t read this as a claim of conspiracy.To my mind, this is more a systems-level description of currents in capital. Yes, there&#x27;s a clickbaity headline about &#x27;elites&#x27;, but if you think more in terms of wealth doing things of its own accord (similar to how e.g. Dawkins got us talking about selfish genes -- selfish dollars?) then this observation might cash out after all.That said, I do agree that the editorial style of the article is needlessly conspiratorial --- it likely appeals strongly to leftists (like me) who see and sense that capital flows and floes seem to have a mind of their own, but who (unlike me) think this requires smoky backroom deals. reply chaos_emergent 11 hours agorootparentI’m just confused about causal chain that would lead to this happening…perhaps it’s a lack of imagination. Like, do we think that landlords are bribing corporations to lease their properties? reply sudosysgen 10 hours agorootparentCorporations are already in 5+ year leases and don&#x27;t want them to be unmitigated liabilities, the owners of the corporation also have significant investments in real estate, there&#x27;s your incentive. reply galangalalgol 12 hours agorootparentprevIt would almost be better if it required orchestration. Maximizing profit is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.... reply chaos_emergent 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is the part I’m missing. The players who own space are either corporations or landlords who rent to corporations.Corporations have an incentive to not lose money on real estate that they’ve already purchased, whether or not they have employees warming that space.Landlords have an incentive to make money through rent, but they can’t really exert pressure on corporations to rent the space landlords own.Where is the chain of incentives? reply rsynnott 13 hours agorootparentprevIf, yes, but do they? How? reply throway2452 14 hours agoparentprev> as though there&#x27;s some kind of coordinated conspiracy.I don&#x27;t see how this is different from consensus among actors, or rather it looks the same.The label or attribute conspiracy is a tool used to discredit findings or positive correlations.I see now that you think elite is overloaded and programmed to have conspiracy relation. This is not true though according to m-w: \"a group of persons who by virtue of position or education exercise much power or influence\".If you pay attention to main stream media, you will see almost all forms of dissent attributed to conspiracy. reply pdonis 15 hours agoparentprevI read the article more as an implied warning: a lot of paper wealth is tied up in commercial real estate, and that wealth could evaporate. The people who own that paper wealth aren&#x27;t just going to sit back and let that happen. Yes, for many companies there is no direct way to force them to bring workers back to the office.

The areas I&#x27;m aware of that practice subsistence farming, don&#x27;t have a long history of leaving the means of production alone in private hands for very long.This is not correct. Under, for example, the Roman Empire, privately held land was routinely leased to free men, either for a share of the produce (métayage) or for a fixed fee. This practice lasted hundreds of years. The end of subsistence farming has everything to do with technology and nothing at all to do with capitalism.In the eigth century in France, around 50% of the land was under a sharecropping-like system, too. This page, and the page in French wiki it links in the intro, give a good rundown of capitalist-like subsistence farming in antiquity and the middle ages : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metayage reply Kamq 5 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a fundamental difference here in that these examples exist before the state had a monopoly on legitimate violence.Or, to put it another way, the large landowners you&#x27;re referring to, also had large armies, the largest armies around by definition, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have owned that land. They _were_ the state in their area, in the modern sense.That&#x27;s not private ownership of the means of production. reply sudosysgen 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s completely untrue for Rome, and barely true at all for France in those days.Roman landowners did not own their land by stealing it from other citizens with large armies. They owned their land by either receiving it from the state as payment, or by buying it. The Roman state had a definite monopoly on violence. In fact, when people commanded armies to take power in Rome, what they were trying to do was to take over the state, and the vast majority of the time those weren&#x27;t private armies, but State armies that they were misusing.The Roman state very very much had a monopoly on violence and roman agricultural tenants very very much were renting the landlords privately owned means of production.Capitalism doesn&#x27;t magically stop subsistence farming. The advance of science and nothing else makes that possible. The Romans had little interest in advancing fundamental technology because there was no money to be made doing it, and so they never made any advances beyond the domains engineering which were immediately profitable (like weapons and aqueducts and bridges). That&#x27;s why they made barely any scientific progress in a thousand years. replymindslight 12 hours agorootparentprev> On the human level, sure.

Both strawmanning any criticism of it as a rejection of all aspects claimed by capitalism, and also giving capitalism credit for systems that share some aspects of capitalism even though they haven&#x27;t gone all-in and let capital run roughshod over everything else.This dynamic is so common it has become a trope - kneejerk cries of \"socialism\". The original link that kicked off this comment tree was basically doing the same thing in more words.The distinction between the motte and the bailey is easiest to see when aspects that we associate with capitalism end up in direct opposition to capitalism itself. For example, free markets can be directly opposed to capitalism, like in the context of imaginary property. A capital-centric view says that inventing a new form of capital out of whole cloth is the right thing to do. A market-centric view says that competition should drive the cost of information to within an epsilon of the copying&#x2F;distribution cost. reply Kamq 11 hours agorootparent> One of the problems with this whole \"debate\" is that defenders of the status quo apply a huge motte and bailey to the definition of \"capitalism\".

Another country that nationalized industries (the oil industry is a common one) would be, at the very least, a mixed-economy, regardless of how free their markets are.Given the above comments on Europe, I would argue that European countries do meet the definition of capitalist for the most part. While some European countries do completely nationalize a handful of industries, it&#x27;s rare, and the majority of industries are privately owned, even if they are highly regulated. reply mindslight 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know that is a great definition any more. A straightforward implication is that China is capitalist. Which isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong, but rather demonstrates that it&#x27;s focused on yesterday&#x27;s arguments.Meanwhile I&#x27;d say most critics of \"late stage capitalism\" aren&#x27;t bemoaning the private ownership aspect itself.

It&#x27;s a specific set of rules and institutions that cause the problem. reply mindslight 10 hours agorootparentSure, but that&#x27;s the strawmanning I&#x27;m talking about. Citing tweets from people trying to be edgy with Marxism and pointing out their intellectual laziness isn&#x27;t actually addressing the legitimate complaints about late stage capitalism.To me, the root causes of the housing crisis are zoning and the endless supply of newly created money from the Federal Reserve. Both of these policies are direct results of those who own housing (aka capital owners) politically insisting that the value of their \"investments\" continually go up. That&#x27;s capital acting on the meta-system to optimize for capital itself. It&#x27;s sensible to lay the blame for this on capitalism itself, and doing so doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m looking to somehow blow away the entire system in favor of some completely different -ism.I&#x27;d personally make my own distinction of centralized capitalism versus distributed capitalism.

Bezos outright owns the WaPo.Further down the ladder that PR will land on businesses where it just reinforces the attitudes of management towards RTO and gives them arguments to make in meetings. The people in those meetings don&#x27;t necessarily have any skin in the commercial real estate game, but if they&#x27;ve spent the past 3 years reading articles about remote work and RTO published in the business press influenced by those who do have a whole lot of skin in the game, how do you attribute causality?They way I&#x27;d look at it is that you can&#x27;t take it in isolation and you need to step outside of naive root cause analysis that looks at the manager in the company who has no skin in the game and says that they can&#x27;t possibly be influenced by the commercial real estate issues.

Commercial real estate is subject to yearly depreciation, unlike your home. It can be somewhat arbitarily valued or devalued (see the games that Trump plays with real estate and taxes, sorry to introduce some politics), but generally real estate is tangible and appreciates long term.Although if a company has a RECENTLY constructed office then it very much is a sunk cost, because the depreciation is on a 10 or 20 year schedule (don&#x27;t remember exactly) and hasn&#x27;t appreciated, and of course they haven&#x27;t gotten the actual \"house workers who make money for you\" return. SO I agree with that. And of course all the companies don&#x27;t want to see their already-depreciated by market appreciated values collapse under them. They want more sucker startups to but their appreciated properties once their business model ages.Now, I guess we&#x27;ll see how much the author&#x27;s contention of a bubble&#x2F;apocalypse plays out, but we&#x27;ll know if office tower -> housing becomes a recurring thing.

No, they invest it, and often they invest it in whatever&#x27;s \"cool\" that year - in this case commercial real estate.

In a highly competitive market, the organization can’t tolerate gross failure for very long without failing, so it either manages this kind of person out or does not survive. reply strix_varius 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case (having spent several years in both the IC and management tracks).An incompetent or checked-out IC is easy to spot. While comparing the relative impact of people on a team is a Hard Problem, setting that someone&#x27;s just not doing anything is easy.On the other hand, the metric of success for a manager is how well their team is performing. So if you take an incompetent (or even a complete no-op) manager and assign them to a capable team, the organization gets no signal that the manager isn&#x27;t part of the formula for that team&#x27;s success.There are measures to counteract that (skip levels, for example). But in many places, skip levels are so rarely held, and&#x2F;or the manager is geographically close to their manager, creating a wide delta in social comfort between the manager and the IC with the skip-level manager. That dissuades ICs from being honest about the situation.So there&#x27;s no signal to use to \"manage this kind of person out,\" and since this is a common problem across the whole tech sector, competitors are weighed down by a similar percentage of worthless managers - so their existence doesn&#x27;t threaten the company&#x27;s survival. reply user8501 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah my manager is the busiest human being in North America. replybacktoyoujim 15 hours agoparentprevAgents of oppression will ply false generosity with their precious attention and then castigate you for needing it.Manager with be seen as the slur that it should in 50 years. reply brentm 16 hours agoprevBad take.

So while you may be correct that teams could be more productive if they&#x27;re all in the same space, the typical office is not optimized to achieve that.Also, teams never need to be face-to-face for the entirety of the work: in my experience, only design and planning benefits from face-to-face coordination; for deep productive work the benefits of quick verbal checks is negated by the loss of focus from quick verbal checks from others. reply Clent 12 hours agorootparentI find myself knowing so much less about the day-to-day personal lives of my co-workers.Perhaps this is what people are referring to as team productivity?Do some people work better as a team with that personal bond?

I think though if you are on a team that requires a lot of collaboration with people outside of where your office is (either a closely related team or people on your team) then you&#x27;re better off WFH than in an open office, because calls are so much more painful in the office, especially if multiple people on the same call in the same office. The amount of managing muting your mic to prevent office noise and echoing and etc is such a drain compared from WFH reply gdubs 12 hours agoparentprev\"Vibes for me, data for thee\".People lean heavily on anecdotes when it comes to worker productivity. But actual data is much more nuanced on the matter.People seem to have completely forgotten how worker productivity actually went up a noticeable amount during a time when most people were working at home – and under some very unusual circumstances mind you – and actually began declining after restrictions ended and companies started asking people to return on a hybrid or full-time basis. reply kristjansson 15 hours agoprevThis seems needlessly class-war-monegring. People slack off at home, people slack off in the office. Everyone’s situation is not your situation. Everyone’s work does not look like your work. Some people like&#x2F;want&#x2F;need office space to work, some people don’t. Some people find themselves in different camps on different days.In any case, companies driving RTO are acting in their own perceived best interests, not their landlords. Either they’re so beholden to CRE that their landlords best interests are their best interests (eg some law firms, maybe architects, ?), reasoning against sunk costs of their existing long-term leases, playing some petty power-game, or seeing some actual benefit to hybrid&#x2F;in-office schedules. Some of those seem more likely than others, but all seem more likely than all managers being part of an elite cabal and doing it as a favor to their elite-cabal friends with CRE interests. reply wredue 15 hours agoparentThe elites are actively engaging in class war with you.

I like to think critical thinkers are naturally suspicious of grand conspiracy claims, requiring strong evidence and compelling argument.None of this is to deny your basic premise- perhaps this truly is a manifestation of the class war- but instead to address your question. reply shrimpx 14 hours agoprevEven though this article isn’t well-argued, it hints at the core of the concern which is the collapse of downtowns. Lots of people, from real estate owners to governments, don’t want that to happen. Whether there’s a RTO “conspiracy” to avoid the collapse of downtowns, I don’t know.Beyond real estate concerns, my take is fully remote companies are demonstrating how to be productive in a flatter, more asynchronous work structure. This is an existential threat to the exec and managerial class, who are demanding RTO in a fight for their own existence. reply constantcrying 14 hours agoprev>It’s about real estate. That&#x27;s it.I don&#x27;t think that is it. Most companies would be glad to cut down on office space.

Your choice is between another bank bailout on these loans with real domestic unrest risk from consequent currency debasement and the ability to import food and other staple goods, or effectively legislating most people back into offices.\"I lived in commercial warehouse spaces in the 90s, and not only were they cheap, huge, and awesome, but they created a condo boom for all those pretend \"lofts,\" that cashed in on the cachet of that lifestyle our generation inspired. If the bulk of your personal net worth comes from flipping some 600sq&#x27; shoebox for almost a million dollars, you&#x27;re welcome. The middle ground may be that landlords will turn a blind eye to live-ins again, and it will create some affordable housing for young people again, and with their influx, the downtowns can be revitalized from the globalized airport mall dead zones they have become.

Realistically, everyone could take their team of the 10 closest workers they know, form a coop, and contract their work back to the employer akin to a freelancer. This would help take the real leverage from large organizations, their magnitude and its ability to shape markets due to inertia alone, if that magnitude was more of a temporal nature on a per project basis. In a perfect world in this coop model, labor wouldn&#x27;t be \"locked up\" on boring projects for large companies, labor would be free to freelance onto interesting or mutually beneficial projects if there was any idle time that could be filled with more billable work. Profits would also be shared among labor since ownership is distributed among labor, versus being this separate parasitic class carried on a palanquin by labor. reply lostdog 13 hours agorootparentHave you made a coop?

I work(ed) at a unionized German company and when management call everyone back to the office after the Covid vaccination was done, it wasn&#x27;t protested by the unions and everyone sowed up at the office without protest, and remote work was kept as \"in case of emergency\" perk you can get every now and then if you get approval from your manager beforehand.Unions here only serve the purpose to intervene in case of major force like discrimination, health and safety, layoffs, working hours, overtime, and the negociate mandatory yearly pay increases based on inflation and company profits, not help you keep your desired perk of not commuting to the office as the office is seen as the mandatory place of work by contract, not your home, so physical presence at work part is usually non-negotiable.Actually, unions here are relatively against remote work or at least quiet on the topic, as they assume it&#x27;ll lead to easier off-shoring in the long run (already happening anyway) and the loss of their jobs , so on-site presence of the workforce is considered as an advantage in convincing the company to keep invested in Germany and not move abroad (generals like seeing their soldiers at work where their money is goes). reply bobthepanda 15 hours agorootparentThey can if they care; New York City’s municipal employee union negotiated just that. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;adams-remote-wor... reply FirmwareBurner 15 hours agorootparentMunicipal and government workers are different, as they can always demand whatever they want because they don&#x27;t have competition and don&#x27;t need to turn a profit so you&#x27;re stuck with them whether you like it or not.

Some jobs even require union membership, even if you don&#x27;t want to join the union. So these companies simply can&#x27;t avoid union workers if they actually want staff. reply FirmwareBurner 14 hours agorootparentCorrect me if I&#x27;m wrong, but to my knowledge, unions in the US function very differently than unions in Germany&#x2F;Europe.In Germany, the unions function more as partners of the business owners and collaborate together on finding the general compromise that won&#x27;t disturb company profits or the way the business operates, while in the US it seems like unions must treat the business like antagonists even at the sake of company profits because \"all business owners are evil so fuck them\".So even if the US has fewer unions than in Europe, they&#x27;re generally a lot more powerful, which is why many were infiltrated by the mob.If my memory serves me correctly the earliest unions in Germany were very similar to the unions in the US, as in they were started from clashes with the business owners, and they were in charge of handling stuff like healthcare and pensions pots of the workers, similar to the unions in north america today.But the Kaiser saw the growing unions and their pensions pots getting bigger along with their nation wide influence over the working class, as threats to the state&#x27;s own influence and control over the workers, so he dismantled them and introduced them under the new state pension plan, so the modern state social pension in Germany stems form the Kaiser&#x27;s fear of the workers&#x27; unions. :) reply bobthepanda 14 hours agorootparentGenerally speaking one major reason is that union representatives are also on company boards in the Europe. This gives them skin in the game and also the same knowledge that gets shared to the rest of the board. And they generally err on the side of employment; American unions have threatened, and successfully, brought down companies that ceased to be a going concern due to demanding unreasonable concessions.

Decisions are made top-down without consulting with what the workers actually want because the priority is the company&#x27;s profits.Plus, the wellbeing of workers in Germany is already considered (at least on paper) to be top notch that mandating remote work for everyone is not considered necessary as \"German workers already have it so good\".And with German labor loosing competitiveness, unions are relatively toothless when demanding remote work as there&#x27;s no government mandate to offer that like it is with working hours, parental leave, etc. and the companies often threaten with relocation&#x2F;off-shoring when they get demands they don&#x27;t like so the German government is in no rush to pressure them for new social perks.So it&#x27;s up to you to search for a company that&#x27;s fully WFH, not wait for your union to solve it for you. Unions can work only when they have teeth. reply PaulHoule 15 hours agorootparentprevIn the orthodox Marxism still practiced by some Trotskyites, the factory worker is seen as a uniquely revolutionary class because of (1) the discipline that comes from factory work and (2) the factory as itself as a nexus of revolution: workers can organize there and ultimately seize control of the means of production.A knowledge worker who works at home on cloud servers has no spatial nexus to control. All communication between workers is electronically mediated, I guess union organizers can develop a parallel infrastructure, but the workplace itself is a natural place for organizing work to take place.What amuses me though is that until 1980 or so people thought factory work was the worst kind of work, maybe best expressed in the Ray Davies song \"Working At the Factory\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=J0khnH1qi6MOnce the factories left, however, people realized service work or no work was a lot worse and now a new factory in your town is one of the best things a politician can take credit for. reply FirmwareBurner 15 hours agorootparent>workers can organize there and ultimately seize control of the means of production.Workers can try to seize the means of production, but without state support, the police or the military will come shoot and arrest you, like it happened many times in recent history.

And regardless, that&#x27;s not much different than factory workers getting the police called on them by the factory owners.I think the main issue is that knowledge workers are not organized (and generally look down on the idea of union membership), and don&#x27;t really have the guts to step out of line like that. reply FirmwareBurner 14 hours agorootparent>Knowledge workers can seize things to a certain extent.

Solove George Washington University Law School Abstract In this short essay, written for a symposium in the San Diego Law Review, Professor Daniel Solove examines the nothing to hide argument. When asked about government surveillance and data mining, many people respond by declaring: \"I've got nothing to hide.\" According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private. The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing. In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings.

The entity doing the \"spying\" determines what is right or wrong. \"You\" might think \"x\" is ok, however the \"spying\" entity may have the opposite view. And it is the \"spying\" entity&#x27;s opinion that matters, not yours, because it always them that have the power and authority in determining what is \"right\" or \"wrong\". Moreover, definitions change on what is \"right\" or \"wrong\". reply kypro 12 hours agoparentI completely agree with this.I live in the UK and when I raise concerns about government surveillance here people often say, \"I&#x27;ve got nothing to hide\".I learnt of a case just this week where a guy on Reddit left a slightly controversial comment and ended up being charged with hate speech, lost his job and received hate abuse online for his opinion.It was kinda crazy because \"all\" he said was that didn&#x27;t care about a teen who died in police custody, specifically that this teen was a, \"good for nothing, spice smoking, Toxteth monkey\" (Toxteth being a fairly rough inner-city area of Liverpool).The teen he was insulting was dead and unable to take offence, but the police officer on Reddit at the time took offence and decided to prosecute the guy anyway.I&#x27;m bringing this up because I don&#x27;t think most people in the UK realise this. Insulting people online or just saying something mildly offensive will often lead to prosecution. I mean just this week an autistic child got arrested for calling a lesbian police officer a lesbian here in the UK.We all have something to hide when what&#x27;s right and wrong is this arbitrary.Legal notes:I do not agree with the views of the Redditor referenced in my comment. I understand how someone may be offended by what he said, but disagree specifically with it being an offence to state an offensive position online.I also do not agree with the behaviour autistic child mentioned in my comment. I understand that being autistic is not an excuse for being offensive. Again, I am only bringing this up because I do not believe it should be an offence to offend.The offensive language used in my comment were direct quotes used specifically to make a point. reply bemusedthrow75 9 hours agorootparent> Insulting people online or just saying something mildly offensive will often lead to prosecution.\"will often\": no, not at all.

(MoD Police are, I guess, but their remit is military policing).I was responding to the somewhat hysterical parent post to correct the conflation of: the police literally are not the government, do not spy for the government, and do not routinely surveil the population; their surveillance powers are limited and regulated.Does any arm of the state surveil the populace in any sense?

The police work on behalf of the people, not the government. When government manages to suborn the police in even a small way it is very much noticed.It’s difficult for people outside the UK to see this, I suppose, but our experience with this is that state directed police overreach is now unusual, and there is a lot of pushback from the chief police officers and the public when they are asked to oppress. There are aberrations (no police force in the world gets protest management right, and ours is no exception) but in general you have to be consciously right up in their faces to cause such an aberration.The UK is a country of realpolitik at every level.

Just as there are limits to free speech in the USA, there are comments that can have consequences.The bar should be set high, and in general it is, but no, I don’t think hate speech is inherently free speech, for example.The US way of doing things is not a) the only way of doing things, b) intrinsically the best way of doing things or c) trending in the right direction. Free speech is not something with a magical clear definition, and I think it goes without saying that we at least try to take incitement to actual race hate a little more seriously. We can set the bar differently; we have.The problem in the UK is not a rash of prosecutions for offensive comments because despite what the parent comment says, they rarely come to trial. There is no enormous procession of these cases, and knobends are actually pretty free to be knobends here. Speech is free, newspapers don’t get raided when they happen to investigate the local police chief.The problem at the moment is that the guidance is in flux, and too much time is wasted determining that something won’t be prosecuted.

They might be able to get the legal right to CCTV footage of all sorts of cameras but they will have to have the paperwork and knock on doors, not unlike the way they could in the USA. This is regulated by law.Government and the police owns surprisingly little of the cameras in the UK. The vast majority are in private hands, and there is no “network” of them.

It bears no resemblance to the reality of life in the UK. It sounds like a closer fit for the plea bargain culture of the USA. Plea bargains are not a general part of our judicial process or culture.So if the government wants to use the threat of a dozen other violations to make you talk, they will have to get the CPS to take them to trial, because as a general rule the system does not allow you to be pressured into pleading guilty on something else in return. Our system has a much lower conviction rate.I do not, in fact, have an arbitrary definition of what a police state is. But this is the point.

It&#x27;s possible that privacy and free speech are different enough that the logical parallel and inference made in the quote doesn&#x27;t actually hold. reply mitthrowaway2 9 hours agorootparentI think in a certain sense they are closely linked, because one of the very important things I keep private is... well, my opinions. I&#x27;m selective about who I say things to, and when, and if all my private conversations were to be made public, I would leave a great many things unsaid. reply glenstein 12 hours agoparentprevThis one has confused me. A lot of the spirit of it I get behind; I am similarly indignant at the nothing to hide argument, I am similarly appreciative of the value of free speech, and I appreciate the idea that you might hope that you have \"something to say\", in the sense of having values, or ways in which you are engaged in the world that are important and meaningful to you. And I even understand and support the idea that you are letting a beautiful right go unused if you have \"nothing to say.\"But, with all of those elements in place, I don&#x27;t see how they serve to counter the \"nothing to hide\" argument. As other commenters here have pointed out, and as the paper has pointed out, it&#x27;s (1) nothing to hide, from whom, and (2) just because you believe your actions are innocent, doesn&#x27;t mean your information won&#x27;t be used against you to target you.But that&#x27;s very different than the point that is apparently being made about free speech. It may be a bummer to live a life where you have nothing to say, but the failure implied by that is of a different kind.It may just be that I&#x27;m missing an obvious point, but, as far as I can tell, if you have \"nothing to say\", the problem is that you&#x27;ve resigned yourself to a life that doesn&#x27;t assert any values or meaning. Meanwhile, the nothing to hide problem relates to not anticipating how bad actors will use your information against you.It would be a 1:1 analogy if the point being made was, well, you have no information? If you have nothing to hide because you have no significant life attributes or life events, I can see a way that is a criticism of an unfulfilled life, and something that makes the comparison to free speech make sense. But... it&#x27;s kind of lateral to the concerns about privacy that I take to be the most essential to maintaining it as a right. But again, I may just be missing something obvious. reply karaterobot 13 hours agoprevI got through 16 pages of the article, and he hadn&#x27;t gotten to the point yet.

Did anybody get through the whole thing? reply gcanyon 12 hours agoparentSo much this. \"I apologize for writing such a long essay; I did not have time to write a shorter one.\"This is probably too brief, but here&#x27;s Claude&#x27;s take on a summary:Here is a one page summary of the article \"I&#x27;ve Got Nothing to Hide\" and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy by Daniel J. Solove:Solove argues that the \"nothing to hide\" argument, which contends that there is no threat to privacy if a person has nothing embarrassing or illegal to conceal, stems from a narrow conception of privacy. He proposes a pluralistic framework for understanding privacy, grounded in Wittgenstein&#x27;s concept of family resemblances. Privacy violations consist of a web of related problems, not connected by a common element, but resembling each other.Solove&#x27;s taxonomy of privacy problems includes four categories: information collection, information processing, information dissemination, and invasion. Harms include chilling effects, power imbalances, breaches of confidentiality, and exclusion from decision-making processes. Many privacy issues cause structural problems rather than individual injuries.The \"nothing to hide\" argument focuses too narrowly on disclosure of secrets. It fails to account for contextual integrity, social value in keeping promises of confidentiality, dangers of aggregation, problems of exclusion, and difficulties in rebutting predictive prophesies about one&#x27;s behavior. The debate should center on oversight and accountability procedures, not whether certain government actions should be allowed. In short, by conceptualizing privacy more pluralistically, the deficiencies of the \"nothing to hide\" argument become apparent. reply throwaway914 10 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve got nothing to hide.... today.

Of-course only the first type is \"real\", corporations and governments are legal abstractions representing the interests of various subsets of individuals. Further, the state, despite being a virtual construct, usually has ultimate power to enforce the will of whichever subset it represents.The dramatic challenge of digital privacy is that it applies to every possible pair (e.g. person-to-person, state-to-corporate, corporate-to-corporate, state-to-state etc.) and in all possible governance circumstances (e.g. failed state, captured (oligarchic) state, warring states etc.) not just conditioning on benign scenarios.Discussing digital privacy and rational, human-centric designs of digital society cannot ignore these interconnected elements. E.g. corporate surveillance and state surveillance are obviously deeply linked. Social technologies (of which digital information technology is part of) should aim to remove the likelihood and severity of human-inflicted disasters. 16 years after this piece and 7 years after Shoshana Zuboff&#x27;s Surveillance Capitalism we are nowhere close to a more serious discussion (let alone action) about the kind of digital societies we are drifting into and what kind of risks are brewing.The control of digital information flow concerning individuals and groups of individuals is at the very center of societal organization. The challenge is not just generational, its epochal. And it is getting worse, with every piece of code that interjects itself in these information flows.Our era is crying out for exceptional intellectual and moral leadership that will construct the canvas on which a good digital society can thrive. Unfortunately, for now at least, not many are listening. reply zvmaz 12 hours agoprevRemove privacy (from state and society) and you will live in constant fear of being shunned, ostracized, persecuted.

Studies have shown that they just don&#x27;t work. Small time criminals use cash or barter, big time criminals infiltrate banks or have ties to international criminal organizations with their own shadow banking systems. It&#x27;s just not a useful requirement and the significant costs outweigh the negligible benefits.Creating a market for shadow banking systems is extra bad because then the large criminal organizations get the bank&#x27;s margin which they can use to fund more criminal activity.It&#x27;s only then that we get to the privacy costs and chilling effects of putting everything people buy in a database. And the costs it imposes on marginalized populations. And the destruction of value of any service that can&#x27;t exist because it would have to collect social security numbers from users or otherwise impose high transaction costs on low margin transactions.I&#x27;m not entirely sure who the lobby for keeping them even is. People who don&#x27;t know how ineffective they are? Banks who want to keep barriers to entry high? Just brute authoritarians who want to spy on everyone every way they can? reply YeBanKo 12 hours agoparentprevDid he somewhere defend KYC?

The number imprisoned is in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs.[81] In many cases, simply being subpoenaed by HUAC or one of the other committees was sufficient cause to be fired.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;McCarthyism#Victims_of_McCarth...Some weeks back, I started to watch a movie about McCarthyism and didn&#x27;t make it very far in. It&#x27;s not really a history we talk that much about, perhaps because it&#x27;s too disturbing.Americans like to think that sort of thing happens elsewhere, in \"bad\" places like Russia, not here. But it did happen here and not that long ago and it could happen again -- here or anywhere.Milgram&#x27;s famous experiments were intended to show that what happened in Nazi Germany was due to some weird character quirk or defect of Germans and couldn&#x27;t happen elsewhere. His experiment proved the opposite. It proved that a high percentage of people will just do as they are told, up to and including potentially killing someone for no real reason.Milgram suspected before the experiment that the obedience exhibited by Nazis reflected a distinct German character, and planned to use the American participants as a control group before using German participants, expected to behave closer to the Nazis. However, the unexpected results stopped him from conducting the same experiment on German participants.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Milgram_experimentIn order to take an ethical stand at some risk to themselves, people generally need to both feel very clear what is right and wrong in a particular situation and have compelling reason to stick their neck out.People who foment evil generally do all they can to instill doubt of various sorts and deny people full disclosure, which tends to be shockingly easy. Even if the information is available, it can take a great deal of time and effort for a person to adequately educate themselves about a particular thing and this can take too long to act in a decisive and timely fashion to avert an ugly slippery slope. reply bemusedthrow75 3 hours agoparent [–] The HUAC wasn’t McCarthy, of course; they are just sort of bound up in the same Red Scare history. It is routine for people outside the USA to conflate these things because of how they are presented in dramatisations; as a Brit I didn’t realise until recently.McCarthy might have been a pivotal figure in McCarthyism (obviously ;-) but he had nothing directly to do with the HUAC because he was a senator.He sat on what is now the Senate committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It was the Senate Committee on Government Operations then, which had an enormously broad remit and gave him his ability to harass and persecute anyone who worked for the US federal government. He was also more able to resist pressure because of it. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

You might find that it gets a new lease on life. My daily driver laptop is an Acer Aspire S3 from 2012 that runs Linux just fine (but that probably depends on how processor intensive what you're doing is). permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Ifkaluva 2 points 17 hours ago I have a Dell laptop from 2014. I run Linux on it, and I always forget how old it is. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]D_Ethan_Bones 1 point 19 hours ago I was on and off linux on my previous 2008 PC, I have a lot that I like to use (older) Windows for but if MS is just going to terminate support then that leaves me with fewer options. First went into Linux in 2003-ish when failure to buy the latest OSX update for a weeks-old Mac made the Mac incapable of running all manners of software including 3rd party. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]tyarcher79 1 point 11 hours ago Linux has come a LONG way since then and most major distros are very useable nowadays.

It's the same thing, minus the telemetry. I don't trust GitHub, especially since Autopilot launched. I wonder where all the training code is coming from. I don't trust them and I'm learning to minimize my footprint while I find alternatives. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]avjayarathne 2 points 1 day ago vscodium isnt a perfect solution to vscode. most of extension isnt working there. plus i dont think they train copliot on private repos, it's huge reputational risk when they already heavily depend on enterprise sector. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Ryanrk 1 point 14 hours ago Telemetry for VSCode I hope is for more improving the product. As a developer it's nice seeing what features are being used and what features might be confusing or could be improved. VSCode doesn't have ads or anything where Windows does.

If you're concerned about security and privacy, you should not trust either company. Just because Microsoft is lagging behind Google in it's level of monetizing users, it's trying hard and catching up. Windows 11 (and I'm sure beyond) is just as bad as ChromeOS. This trend began with the later releases of Windows 10. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]OkDimension 1 point 17 hours ago Did you try Windows 8? Wasn't part of the start menu reserved for advertising? They still occasionally dump some junk app in it in 10. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]watchingtheweasels 1 point 8 hours ago I don't recall anything like that in the Windows 8.1 that I had running on a desktop for a while. If there was any adware or telemetry in that OS I don't remember it. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Dark_ducK_ 6 points 1 day ago Personally I use nvim but you can also get vccodium which is vscode without the proprietary spyware. And gitlab is good substitute for github if you don't want AI's being trained in your code without consent. I have android but without google apps, I use microg and aurora store. You can look into next cloud for a drive alternative. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]kajEbrA3[S] 3 points 1 day ago i use nextcloud. I want something fast and cheap for encrypted off-site backups. object storage and block storage is 5 USD for 250 GB. onedrive ~9 USD for 1TB seems reasonable for my usecase. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]its_laurel 1 point 23 hours ago Have you looked at sync.com. I’ve used them for years. I have a grandfathered plan, but it looks like they’re now giving 2tb for $8 a month. They do have a free plan with just 5gb if you just want to check them out, And they’re end to end encrypted. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]seabrookmx 1 point 16 hours ago Backblaze B2 + rclone on a cronjob? I use that to do a nightly offsite backup of my shared folders (which I sync across devices using Syncthing).

I came to that conclusion a couple years ago, but what a turn of events it was for me. I grew up hating Microsoft. I was a Commodore kid who thought the Amiga should have won the home/work computer battle for it's technical prowess. I hated MS's monopolistic tendencies that far back. I only tried windows as my daily driver OS for about 6 months over which time I got to taste the transition from 95 to 98. My experience had me saying, \"Why is this so shitty compared to how the experience was on the Amiga? I never had to reinstall my OS on the Amiga, and it crashed far far less.\" Switched to Linux. Screw MS. But fast forward to today, and while I'm still using Linux, and don't trust them, I see them as far less evil to the individual than I do Google. (I've been a sysadmin for some 25+ years now with Linux and Windows) permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]DMonitor 2 points 17 hours ago Microsoft added a key combo to windows that just opens a page full of advertisements. Win+W https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/stay-up-to-date-with-news-and-interests-a39baa08-7488-4169-9ed8-577238f46f8f They also put “helpful content” on your taskbar. It’s insane. Consumer-grade windows is literally adware. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Halos-117 6 points 1 day ago Imo Microsoft is better than Google, but that doesn't mean they are very good. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Ambitious_Summer8894 4 points 1 day ago They are both untrustworthy in different ways. Windows has some crazy bs in it and them trying to force you to have an account to use windows 11 is bs(yes I know there's work arounds). I use newpipe to watch you tube and Aurora store for play store apps without signing into my phone.

(reddit.com) 260 points by thunderbong 18 hours ago| hidepastfavorite240 comments bemusedthrow75 17 hours agoI love VSCode, I use Google Workspace for my domain, run a Mac and an iPhone (and use iCloud), a Surface Go 2 with Linux (quite workable), I host on all sorts of stuff.Uncritically associating \"trust\" with a brand is a mistake. Microsoft are no more on the side of the angels than anyone else (and are very clearly on the other side in some of the legal positions they stake out, such as their amicus brief in support of Oracle against Google in the Java case).Pick a sports team if you must, but don&#x27;t pick a brand and support them loyally. Be an interchangeable consumer, because this is how they model your behaviour anyway. Maximise that. reply irusensei 16 hours agoparentI can’t force myself to like vscode. I need to code right? So I need 1-to be able to write text, 2-syntax highlighting. VSCode is an absolute mess of unnecessary plugins and popup that reminds me of an internet explorer 6 with too many web bars and a bonzi buddy dancing at the bottom of the screen.I also dislike Chrome and any chrome based reskin. I appreciate Firefox and even Safari. Specially Safari for the same reasons the average JavaScript Stan hates it: it’s keeping the web from implementing the latest usb-over-browser crap or wathever the-chrome-consortion (google) comes up with. Safari on iOS is the only thing that keeps “best viewed on Chrome” from happening in current year.Those are personal opinions though. reply bemusedthrow75 15 hours agorootparentYou can turn off a load of stuff. You don&#x27;t have to install any plugins.VS Code has one as far as I am aware uniquely-implemented feature -- remote editing -- which is absolutely invaluable to me as a freelancer with many long-term, infrequently-updated projects.Lots of separate VM dev environments with different editor configuration and tool requirements, and more or less only SSH config and keys to connect me to them, from whichever machine I need to.It&#x27;s the only Microsoft thing I use at the moment. I don&#x27;t even have a github account. reply flamwenco 15 hours agorootparent> VS Code has one as far as I am aware uniquely-implemented feature -- remote editing -- which is absolutely invaluable to me as a freelancer with many long-term, infrequently-updated projects.To be that one guy, Emacs has had remote editing (without even needing to install anything on the remote server, unlike vscode) for forever with tramp mode. But other, more accessible&#x2F;modern editors having it is definitely nice because it&#x27;s such a handy feature reply bmitc 14 hours agorootparentEveryone always brings up Emacs with regards to VS Code&#x27;s remoting features, but I have yet to see anything that supports that it is anywhere close to VS Code.With VS Code, I can develop across Windows, Docker, Linux, Linux running on WSL, and macOS with zero configuration aside from setting up SSH connection configs and installing the remote extensions with a button click. All the extensions work seemlessly when remoting. My settings also automatically sync by just signing into GitHub.With Devcontainers, I don&#x27;t need anything to develop except Docker and VS Code. I simply pull down a repository, open it in VS Code, and then VS Code sets up a container with all dependencies and configuration.No, Emacs does not have this experience.And I don&#x27;t know the technical reasons why VS Code installs on the remote server, but I think it&#x27;s important to note that you&#x27;re not just editing remotely but developing remotely. reply tiberious726 9 hours agorootparentTo also be that one guy, emacs has had this with the ssh method in TRAMP basically since ssh existed. (Not the devcontainer stuff, it has something similar, but it wasn&#x27;t till LXC&#x2F;Docker got popular that emacs could do it that way. At least on Linux) I agree, it&#x27;s amazing and great that more people are finally using this methodology, but certainly not new to VSCode reply urbandw311er 13 hours agorootparentprevAh right.(Embarrassed cough)So, er, I didn’t need to install MacOS Fuse, mount an SSH-FS folder and then use VS Code to open my remote code for editing then?Thanks for sharing. At least I’ll know next time! :-) reply bemusedthrow75 12 hours agorootparentOhh you&#x27;re going to enjoy this when you get to it :-) reply jebarker 9 hours agorootparentprevEven if emacs can handle the remote editing side I doubt the remote debugging experience comes close to what vscode can offer with very little effort.I do all my development on remote supercomputers and the ability to remotely debug multi-process Python and C++ applications running inside containers across many servers made me love vscode. reply rhaway84773 6 hours agorootparentprevPersonally zero configuration is not a selling point for me for a professional tool I rely on to do maybe the majority of my work.I think it’s reasonable to not hold hours or even days of setup and learning against a product I’d use in this fashion. Even a tiny 1% productivity benefit obtained after configuration and learning earns me about 2.5 dev days worth of benefit every year. And if I expect to use the tool for a decade that’s almost a month. reply bemusedthrow75 15 hours agorootparentprevI guess Tramp mode must be the inspiration, to some extent.But the VSC approach allows me to customise the tool environment within the remote extension, including going as far as using different SCSS processors and language servers, but is managed through essentially exactly the same interface as the local.(It&#x27;s also inherently multi-user; changes are reflected in each machine connected to the remote, which makes it really easy to move from a work to a home machine, or a desktop to a coffee-shop laptop.)This is what I meant by uniquely-implemented. I often find that the most visceral critics of VSC or adherents of \"natively implemented\" code editors haven&#x27;t the slightest awareness of this feature.Still -- thank you for your comment, it gives me one more thing to investigate for those times when tools fail me. reply flamwenco 13 hours agorootparentYeah, I certainly didn&#x27;t mean it as a slight against VSC. (I am very much an electron hater but VSC is an exception because they obviously put in the effort to make it work as well as it does.)Much as I love Emacs I do mostly use VSC these days, and I do tend to forget the extent of what remote editing capabilities it provides since I haven&#x27;t had much reason to use them in a while. reply bemusedthrow75 12 hours agorootparentYes -- sorry, my comment about critics may have come across as aimed at you, but it wasn&#x27;t!I was thinking more of all the other times this has come up in the past and I have to say, \"you understand it&#x27;s not just a text editor with network access?\"It has pretty much unique capabilities, and as another commenter has said, it&#x27;s even remarkably agnostic as to the _kind_ of remote container. For example you can run the editor on Windows with the remote as WSL, and it really blurs the boundaries between them in a way that cannot possibly be a coincidence for Microsoft. reply dvdgsng 15 hours agorootparentprevJetbrains Gateway offers remote editing as well. It&#x27;s still Beta and certainly has some rough edges, but it works ok-ish as a daily driver and is actively developed. The last update few weeks ago even added Dev Containers support (to an extend).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;remote-development&#x2F;gateway&#x2F; reply bemusedthrow75 15 hours agorootparentOoh, that&#x27;s interesting, thank you. reply petabytes 4 hours agorootparentprevAnother great feature is the refactoring plugins, haven&#x27;t seen that in any CLI editors reply Osiris 11 hours agorootparentprevAre you talking about Live Share? JetBrains also has collaborative sharing, inspired by Live Share.Even though I primarily use WebStorm, when I’m working with people on a contract gig, I frequently use Live Share as a pairing tool whether to help debug something or just for training&#x2F;mentoring. reply bemusedthrow75 10 hours agorootparentNo. Though it’s the basis for the live sharing mechanism as well.I’m talking about the remote dev environments. Editing inside VMs, inside WSL, inside Docker containers or via SSH to remote machines, where the editing environment runs seamlessly on the remote, can have extensions, can do version control, run language servers etc.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;remote-overviewBasically a part of the editor is running remotely, and yet can be managed as if it were local (e.g. an extension can be installed locally or into the remote). So your code is operated on entirely by the remote.It is, as far as I am aware, unique in its scope. reply rcme 16 hours agorootparentprevYou can disable plugin suggestions. reply sah2ed 15 hours agorootparentPlease tell me how. reply rcme 15 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;57664187&#x2F;how-do-i-turn-o... reply moonchrome 14 hours agorootparentprev> So I need 1-to be able to write text, 2-syntax highlighting.If you just need those two things there&#x27;s plenty of options - why are you forcing yourself into vscode ?

Satya has a good PR operation and many people fall for the “wow it’s the new Microsoft”.I negotiate with them. They are way more difficult and hard nosed to deal with than in the Ballmer era. The salespeople work under a sword and while they aren’t Oracle, they are in that path.Trust doesn’t mean much with companies of this scale. You need to understand your contracts and the KPIs that drive decisions at the deal desk.If you are an individual, why are they giving you this bounty? With Google, their motivations are very clear, and they quickly course correct (ie kill the product) when their objectives aren’t met. reply simondotau 9 hours agorootparent> With Google, their motivations are very clearWhen people have said they don’t trust Google, that’s precisely the reason they give. Conversely I trust Microsoft and Apple more because their motivations are also clear, and less in conflict with my interests.I’ve no doubt that Google, Microsoft, and Apple are all equally horrible when it comes to negotiations behind-the-scenes. I’m sure they abuse KPIs as much as each other. As a customer none of that matters to me. reply anotherevan 11 hours agorootparentprev> Tech people are pretty gullible.Yeah, I&#x27;d believe that. reply duxup 16 hours agoparentprev> UncriticallyBlindly pick one to trust sure that’s a poor choice.But we make choices based on our experience and what information we have. I won’t trust anyone forever blindly, but I will pick some for now over others who I find untrustworthy. reply bemusedthrow75 16 hours agorootparentRight -- I mean if I was compelled by some weird fascist law to pick one brand to trust, I&#x27;d probably pick Apple. The fascists with the nicest things, for one thing, but they have also made commitments to privacy against which they can be measured.But I find it uncomfortable how much brain time we allow for making value judgements about brands -- it&#x27;s a purely one-way emotional judgement, because as a general rule, not a single one of the people who run them would so much as piss on you if you were on fire in return.[ Edit: This is not particularly to be taken as an argument for open source; I don&#x27;t think people in the open source space are inherently more trustworthy; they have just built mechanisms where I don&#x27;t have to trust them individually or severally.We have to stop supporting \"teams\" in the tech world -- even at the level of employee loyalty. It&#x27;s damaging, and not just to open source, but to human progress more generally. ] reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentIMO the fact that the open source folks built those mechanisms indicates they they are inherently more trustworthy. I mean, in many cases the honest party is also the one happy to do things in the open. reply bemusedthrow75 15 hours agorootparent> I mean, in many cases the honest party is also the one happy to do things in the open.This may be true, but there are longstanding figures in open source who I would not trust as far as I could spit.It&#x27;s a mistake to see the openness of open source or open access as a guide to trusting the people who produced it. Dual_EC_DRBG is a good example of why. reply rhaway84773 16 hours agoparentprevTrust doesn’t mean I think they’re angels.I think MS is an awful company that tries to win by destroying the competition using all sorts of legal and illegal tricks to do so.At the same time, it MS starts a new product, I would trust them to support it for a reasonable amount of time and give a reasonable amount of transition time if they did decide to wind it down based entirely on their history.OTOH, 4 years ago I thought that Google was a much better supporter of Open Source but even then I wouldn’t trust them enough to not sunset a new product with months of notice at best to actually use something new they came up with. reply bemusedthrow75 15 hours agorootparent\"On the side of the angels\" !== \"angels\". Just means tending to have the right motives.But at any rate the hosted product and the open source code are orthogonal, right?You can&#x27;t use one to guide your opinion of the other. This is the point I am making: we are interchangeable consumers, and yet we invest emotional energy in the pretence that we are not.Nobody in their right mind would believe that Coca-Cola would prefer you on some emotional level not to be a Pepsi drinker. And yet we, as consumers, allow brand interpretations (Coca-Cola is classic and Christmas, Pepsi&#x27;s logo looks like an obese person&#x27;s belly) to gain emotional strength; we extend our personal identities with brand loyalty.I am slightly late to this party; I perhaps used to think that brand loyalty in customers was something that was meaningfully measured and acted on, and I suspect until the mid-eighties it was, to some extent. But companies are beholden so completely to the whims of their shareholders, or worse their private equity owners, that it&#x27;s impossible to believe that the continued happiness of customers matters much.(Nothing to me underscores this more than people overexerting themselves to find positive things to say about Apple&#x27;s Vision Pro launch, which was so terrifyingly dystopian and anti-human that it made me feel physically sick as a long-term Apple customer, and yet I type this on a Macbook that I would generally say is an object I emotionally value using!) reply midoridensha 3 hours agorootparentprevThis just tells me that Google is by far the more trustworthy company. You don&#x27;t have to worry much about them trying to destroy all the competition, and thus removing your choices. The key to Google is to simply not trust that their non-core products will actually last. reply candiddevmike 17 hours agoprevThis is a dumb take. They&#x27;re both equally untrustworthy. VSCode has an insane amount of telemetry turned on, ChatGPT is monitoring everything you type, and GitHub was abused to train a LLM.

Never ever put ads in any configuration menu of the operating system. That clearly says, it&#x27;s not my computer, its MS&#x27;s and they try to squeeze every penny out they can get. So they aren&#x27;t any different from Google, they even try to push you to the Cloud and then make mistakes a cloud enterprise shouldn&#x27;t make reply dizhn 16 hours agorootparentBack in the dot com boom era they would give you a whole computer for free just so you would look at their ads.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to write a licence that allows you to do things with the software that the licence forbids. reply zztop44 16 hours agorootparentI think that’s mostly my point. GP release source code, presumably under a license that permitted this use. It’s okay to not be happy that it was used this way… but that’s life reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentIt is a new angle of attack that the authors of the code didn’t know was coming.I think it is pretty obvious that lots of GPL authors wouldn’t want their code to be productized in ways that don’t contribute back to the community, because they had the ability to use a BSD or MIT license and didn’t take it. reply moonchrome 14 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t want people to learn from your code then don&#x27;t open source it. Learning via LLM vs person learning is a distinction that sounds unenforceable in practice. reply bee_rider 13 hours agorootparentThe stealing open source code is generally extremely difficult to prevent in practice; nobody knows by default if you copy-paste some open source code into a closed code base. But this shouldn’t prevent us from calling out bad behavior when we do see it.Legally, of course, LLMs are not people. They don’t have the same rights as people, and it isn’t obvious whether or not they can legally generate new IP. They operate by a complicated but essentially mechanical process, and it is pretty novel to say that such a process could be used to remove copyrights. reply rectang 13 hours agorootparentprevThere will eventually be a court case where an LLM reproduces creative code verbatim which clears the de minimis threshold. For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mitsuhiko&#x2F;status&#x2F;1410886329924194309But the defendant won&#x27;t be Microsoft — they just provided a tool, and that&#x27;s legal. No, the defendant will be the downstream consumer who incorporated the code spat out by the LLM.It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the LLM \"learned\" — intent is irrelevant and the defendant will have committed copyright violation regardless. The LLM can&#x27;t copyright-wash the code — nobody can. reply lvass 15 hours agorootparentprevNo license except CC0&#x2F;unlicense permits laundering authorship like Copilot does. reply rectang 12 hours agorootparentYes, this is exactly true among the popular FOSS licenses.The attribution licenses such as ALv2, BSD, MIT, etc. which are generally considered to be \"permissive\" still require attribution, and this condition is not upheld by popular LLMs.Of course, the copied material has to be judged substantial enough for the license to apply in a court of law, which is a human-arbitrated threshold.It will most likely be a copyleft author who eventually brings a court case, but the attribution licenses do not allow for LLM usage either unless the LLM provides attribution and preserves notices as spelled out in the licenses. reply bippihippi1 16 hours agorootparentprevno, foss means free and open source. you&#x27;re still able to use a license that dictates how it can be used reply bastardoperator 11 hours agorootparentprevOSS people complaining about licenses while simultaneously ignoring the license they granted Github is peak irony. I&#x27;m totally fine with it, it&#x27;s why I do it, I don&#x27;t need accolades and I&#x27;m not straddling a user with legal agreements, that&#x27;s not freedom in my mind. reply rectang 4 hours agorootparentGitHub only has the FOSS license because the TOS applies only to the owner of the repo, but contributors to the code in the repo are not required to agree to the TOS. None of the popular FOSS licenses except CC0 grant rights which allow LLM training — they all require attribution at least and the copyleft licenses require reciprocity (when the copied code is substantial enough for the license to apply). reply CoastalCoder 17 hours agorootparentprev> Turn off telemetryI may be working from old information, but doesn&#x27;t Windows 10 still have unstoppable, and unauditable, telemetry? reply wiseowise 16 hours agorootparentThe original comment was talking about VS Code, wasn&#x27;t it? reply CoastalCoder 16 hours agorootparentI was speaking more generally about MS vs. Google. reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentprev> UnstoppableUse a PiHole? reply CursedUrn 16 hours agorootparentThis is trivial for Microsoft to bypass.

For example, if you plan a holiday, Google, Meta, and others know it. If your wife suffers from a serious condition, Google, Meta, and others know it. Corporate has extensive databases and every person is potentially profiled with a lot of detail.Advertisers don&#x27;t usually receive detailed information, instead they are promised that their advertisements are targeted correctly. To do that the data about people is used.But with this data Corporate gets too much power. Corporate needs to follow Human Rights, like states. One aspect is that there is no due process in case of conflicts, like someone being wrongly excluded from using a Corporate service. We also need transparency about how this data is used exactly and who else gets views.Europe is trying to establish transparency with the GDPR, however is foiled by malicious compliance by Corporate. It does not help that Europe is clumsy. reply cypress66 17 hours agoparentprevGithub wasn&#x27;t abused to train LLMs. Whatever website existed that openly hosted OSS repositories would have been scrapped if it had such a large number of repos.

Looking at a corporation consisting of >100k employees to me means that any notion of trust is a very diffuse concept. You could talk to multiple small towns worth of humans and interact with their products & services without ever seeing the other half of the business.I believe I \"trust\" (in terms I think we are using here) Microsoft more than Google - for purpose of business - simply because of decades worth of inertia and ongoing happenstance. Not because of some principled notion of good vs evil manifest as corporate anthropomorphism. Little things like \"I can still directly run my 90s code on my windows 11 box\" provides very strong degrees of this for me - but only in isolated scopes. Who knows what the hell the xbox or office teams are doing over in their dark corners? Blowing away all this detailed nuance for \"aggregate name good&#x2F;bad\" is (to me) the most hilariously shitty way to go about navigating technology when working with vendors who have trillion dollar market caps.On the other hand, I would \"trust\" Google to entertain me more than Microsoft via their products & services.

I use Android because the alternative is to use iPhone, which is even worse. If a free alternative becomes more realistic to use, I&#x27;ll switch in a heartbeat.I worked for Google (through acquisition), and I know people who worked for Microsoft. I&#x27;d never apply to work for Microsoft. At least based on the impression I&#x27;ve received from people who work there. Of course, there are plenty of businesses Microsoft owns but doesn&#x27;t actually \"run\", and things are probably very uneven across the board. Same is true for Google.So, when it comes to trust... It&#x27;s obviously a very complicated subject. Different divisions in different organizations will have very different ability to generate trust. In my own experience, and when it comes to things that mattered to me throughout my career, I developed a strong distaste for anything branded with Microsoft&#x27;s name just based on technical merits alone. Everything Microsoft was making for developers was designed to impress the rich people in the management who probably don&#x27;t as much as own a computer. Since forever and to this day, Microsoft&#x27;s products seem like idiotic ideas implemented by legions of slaves, who don&#x27;t care about the outcome, but the complicated system of equally unmotivated slave drivers ensures the minimum acceptable quality.Google, on the other hand, gives out a very different vibe: there are a lot of motivated and competent people working for the company, and on an odd day once every few years they get to make a decent product. And then they move on and the product dies.Based on this completely personal and based on no thorough research feeling, I&#x27;d trust the first to make the worst but functional programs and the second to make programs of very uneven quality -- more of a gamble, but with much higher payoffs, if you win. reply frankohn 15 hours agoprevI do not like when people take a shortcut and say that ChatGPT is from Microsoft.

Yes, they&#x27;ve largely disappeared from public view: so what? Page and Brin still exist and still control Google even if they have a lower profile than eg. Zuckerberg and even if they aren&#x27;t jumping up and down in public like the current owner of Twitter: see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Object_permanence .

The fact that he hasn&#x27;t done the latter is simply a choice that he has made.)Some people are too young to remember, and some seem to have forgotten, how much Google&#x27;s rise to dominance was enabled by the perception that Page and Brin were two fine young men who could be relied on to act with restraint and a sense of public responsibility—a perception which Google itself of course encouraged. If they&#x27;d had the same public reputation as Bill Gates or Larry Ellison then the early history of would likely have been very different. (Now, more fool the rest of us for putting stock in that perception, of course, but that doesn&#x27;t let Page and Brin off the hook either.)So, what happened there? HR scandals and maybe health issues seem to have helped drive them out of public view. The end of Google&#x27;s all-hands meetings also seems rather significant, though it doesn&#x27;t seem clear whether it was more a cause or a consequence of other changes (Back in 2019 Steven Levy wrote \"That’s why, when Google said Thank Goodness It’s Finished, it ended a lot more than a weekly meeting.
