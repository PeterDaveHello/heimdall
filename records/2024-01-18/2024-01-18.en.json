Ask Question Asked 6 years, 6 months ago Modified 2 years, 6 months ago Viewed 196k times 424 votes Save this question. Show activity on this post. Locked. This question and its answers are locked because the question is off-topic but has historical significance. It is not currently accepting new answers or interactions. My 1-year kid has a plastic ball that is decorated with all 26 letters from the English alphabet and besides each letter is an image. I suppose the images are of words in English that begin with each of the letters. That works for all of them, except for the Y, which image looks like an axe to me. I searched for synonyms for axe (hatchet, tomahawk) but could not find one that starts with Y. Following is a picture I took from the ball where the Y and it's image can be seen. Y is surrounded by Queen, Nail, Worm, Elephant and Kangaroo, I suppose. Can someone help me identify which English word is depicted in Y? The complete list of letter/symbol pairs, for those asking, is Apple, Bear, Cat, Dog, Elephant , Frog, Giraffe, House, Ice, Jet, Kangaroo, Lion, Mouse, Nail, Owl, Pig, Queen, Rainbow, Snail, Tiger, Uboat (submarine), Volcano, Worm, Xylophone, Y / axe, Zebra. And thanks to @jkej's Google sleuthing, another view of the ball may be seen at the site fishpond.com. I bought the ball in a store called Lojas França, located in a mall called Bourbon Shopping Wallig in Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil. Edit - I was looking for any sign that could help us identify the manufacturer of the ball and all I could find were the letters DNE near the air valve. Following is an image of that part of the ball, in case it helps: single-word-requests Share edited Jul 10, 2021 at 5:54 Matt E.

The question is about English.

Stellar badge for a stellar question. – Mari-Lou A Jul 5, 2017 at 12:10 1 @Draakhond the question stops being about language and more about graphic design and illustration. The title asks what word begins with Y, so it's best to focus on that. – Mari-Lou A Jul 17, 2017 at 21:12 3 @DanBron Thanks again for your effort. Since you're done editing your answer and it has strong evidences that the y-axe is, indeed, an yxa, I'm marking it as accepted. About the image, I posted it in the chatroom, so that this question remains focused on the y image – gmauch Jul 26, 2017 at 13:37 Comments disabled on deleted / locked posts / reviewsShow 9 more comments 17 Answers Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 822 votes Save this answer. +200 This answer has been awarded bounties worth 200 reputation by hairboat Show activity on this post. A suspect I think the manufacturer of your son's ball mixed in a Swedish word: Yxa Swedish, n.: an axe The photograph above is page 22 of the Swedish children's book Vill du läsa I (\"Would you like to read [vol I]\") by painter Elsa Beskow. The J above it is for julgran, the Swedish word for Christmas tree. Forensics I say this on the basis that: I checked several thesauruses, like you, as well as Wikipedia's category for axes, and while I found adze, chopper, cleaver, hatchet, mattock, tomahawk, twibill and so on, I found nothing approaching a word with an initial y. I used OneLook.com's reverse-dictionary functionality to search for \"words starting with a y and having a meaning relating to axe\"¹ and the only thing suggested was yataghan: \"a long Turkish knife with a curved blade having a single edge\". An image search tells us that no ball-maker would confuse this sword-like blade for an axe. Going one step further, I checked Wikipedia's comprehensive list of bladed weapons, and from all countries, throughout all history, only 3 start with an initial y: yanmaodao (Chinese), yari (Japanese), and yatagan (Turkish). These are all sword-like weapons, not axe-like, and as mentioned in the previous bullet, of the three, only yatagan has made it into English dictionaries. I used an online tool named Translatr to translate both axe and hatchet into 90+ languages, and cross-checked these with the manual translations on Wiktionary, and literally the only word of those ~200 options which started with a y was Swedish yxa. Cross-checking the translation from Swedish back into English confirmed that Swedish yxa is English axe. And indeed it is used in Swedish children's primers to illustrate the letter y, as you can see from the children's book excerpt above. The crime scene As for the other symbols on the ball, we can analyze which letter-symbol pairings make sense in each language. Here I've tagged each pairing with ✅ to indicate \"the name a toddler would shout out for the depicted object starts with the corresponding letter\", ❌ for \"no, it doesn't\", and ❓ for \"this pairing merits further discussion\". In English, the pairings are Apple✅, Bear✅, Cat✅, Dog✅, Elephant✅, Frog✅, Giraffe✅, House✅, Ice✅, Jet✅, Kangaroo✅, Lion✅, Mouse✅, Nail✅, Owl✅, Pig✅, Queen✅, Rainbow✅, Snail✅, Tiger✅, Uboat❓, Volcano✅, Worm✅, Xylophone✅, Y / axe❌, Zebra✅. In Swedish, these correspond to Äpple❌, Björn✅, Katt❌, Hund❌, Elefant✅, Groda❌, Giraff✅, Hus✅, Is✅, Jet✅, Känguru✅, Lejon✅, Mus✅, Spik❓², Uggla❌, Gris❌, Drottning❌, Regnbåge✅, Snigel✅, Tiger✅, Ubåt✅, Vulkan✅, Mask❌³, Xylofon✅, Yxa✅, Zebra✅. As you can see, because most of these words are loanwords to both languages (like kangaroo or giraffe), or are loanwords from English to Swedish (like jet[plane]), or have [proto-]Germanic roots shared by both English and Swedish (like house and mouse), or are completely artificial coinages (like xylophone) most pairings are sensible in both languages. All told, in Swedish there are 8 words which simply do not fit, not to mention that, as @jkej points out, a Swedish ball would also have to present the letters Å, Ä and Ö, and would possibly choose to omit W. This rules out the possibility that this is a ball made for the Swedish market. For English, on the other hand, outside the mysterious Y, all the pairings use straightforward, non-suspicious common nouns an English-speaking toddler would be familiar with4. Except for one. That U-boat is Swedish-fishy. A new clue Almost no one refers to submarines as U-boats in contemporary English. Quoting @tchrist's response to that information: ... especially how a submarine or “U-boat” picture that got used for the U, given how uncommon a word for a sub that U-boat is in English these days — and to a toddler rather than to a great-grandfather who might actually remember them. Which is evidence against the maker of the ball being completely familiar with English as she is spoke. There's also positive evidence for \"U\" is for \"U-boat\" in Swedish children's primers. Quoting @jkej in the comments: The submarine could be seen as circumstantial evidence (although not very strong) for some kind of Swedish mix-up explanation. Although U-boat is an English word, it seems a little strange to use it in this context. But in Swedish ubåt is the only word for submarine. I used Google Image to examine some English alphabet posters and it seemed like almost all of them used umbrella or unicorn for U, but none of them used a U-Boat. Similarly, I found several Swedish alphabet posters with ubåt for U, although uggla (owl) was more common. I can also confirm that yxa was very common for Y. And indeed it's easy to turn up Swedish pedagogical material having both Y = yxa and U = ubåt, like this one from the Swedish site imgrum.com: But it doesn't stop there. Following the footprints Following @jkej's lead on Fishpond.com, I found the manufacturer is Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.5 This is page 32 of their online catalog (you need to install Adobe Flash; their PDF catalog is broken6): Item G: 54-4155; #10 A-Z Phonics; 0-33149 04155-9 However, though Fishpond.com listed \"Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.\" as the ball's manufacturer, upon visiting BB&S' site, one immediately notices the headers and copy all immediately point to another name: Structurally, Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc. was once a subsidiary of Hedstrom, and through a series of fits and starts in the last century, eventually took ownership of the Hedstrom brand, and now is doing business as Hedstrom. That is, Hedstrom is the ball manufacturer's preferred name for branding purposes. Which is interesting, because the name \"Hedstrom\" is Scandinavian; per Wikipedia's article on the surname: Hedstrom, Hedström and Hedstrøm are surnames of Swedish and Norwegian origin Tailing the suspect So is the name Hedstrom indicative of Swedish influences on the ball's manufactoring process? The Smart Business article linked above on BBS taking ownership of the the Hedstrom brand notes: BBS owns 98 percent of U.S. and Canadian rubber ball markets and a growing percentage of the rotational molding market. No mention of international markets. However, one influence I can find of non–North American interests in Hedstrom is that these sources confirm that manufacturing is done in Asia, as other answers and comments suggest: BB&S’s Hedstrom Entertainment Division makes play balls and other toys in Asia But what about Sweden? I've read several different histories of Hedstrom. The accounts are confusing and at points seemingly contradictory, involving many name changes. But the salient event was in 1981: Eagle Rubber started making balloons out of a garage in 1916. The company grew and spawned an industry that led to Ashland becoming the balloon capital of the world. The company eventually added lines of plastic play balls. It was bought out by Hedstrom Inc. in 1981, which went bankrupt in 2004. But if Eagle was the company who built up the play ball business, whence the the acquiring company, Hedstrom? According to this column of Harry Rinker, who is an antiques appraiser and thereby somewhat of an historian: Carl H. Hedstrom, E. Gustaf Hedstrom, Knute W. Hedstrom, Wilfred P. Shuffleton, and Walter Beaman founded the Hedstrom Company, Gardner, Massachusets in 1915. ... The Hedstrom Corporation still exists. Its Bedford plant produces outdoor gym sets, play balls, toys, etc. The Dotham operation is toy focused. Thus the name Hedstrom originates from three Swedes in 1915. The catalog above is dated ~2012, and page 32 lists several of the playballs as new, but not the phonics one, so it's not clear when the ball was first produced. But certainly a century passed between the reason for naming the company Hedstrom and producing the ball. So, with a century and countless mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings intervening, the Swedish name Hedstrom, while intriguing, cannot be adduced as evidence that the Y stands for yxa. The interrogation I reached out to Hedstrom via their online contact form, Twitter, and Facebook. They replied to me this morning via Facebook: They confirm your ball is not an official Hedstrom A-Z Phonics ball. The official ball has a yo-yo for the letter Y. The Hedstrom ball also has a UPC and producer's mark. Further, Hedstrom confirms they do no business internationally (outside Canada, one assumes), and they're not aware of any specific producers who have a known history of copying their designs. A second customer service representative actually responded separately to my contact via their website, instead of Facebook. She did her own forensics, and corroborated that Hedstrom's opinion is that this is a knock-off ball: Thank you for visiting our website and for your online inquiry about an ABC Playball. Unfortunately, I do not believe this ball was manufactured by Hedstrom. I've attached an image from our QA files of our ball for your reference. Some of the things that tip me off that this is not our ball are the elephant and kangaroo colors. Also, there is considerably more white space on you ball whereas ours has more designs. So, just for fun, I visited our samples department hoping to find this ball and I was able to find and inflate a sample of our ball. Our playball has a Yo-Yo for the letter \"Y\". Another way you can tell is whether or not there is an official Hedstrom legal patch. This patch would contain our name, Hedstrom Corporation, our address, our website, made in China in three different languages, a UPC barcode with the number 0-33149-04155-9 and a four-digit date code. Our inflation valve should be concealed in the Robot \"R\" picture, too. I'm not sure if your ball has our legal patch or not or where your inflation valve is located, but these are just a few of the way we identify our products. It's probably not impossible for another manufacturer to find and use our designs as these are rather old for us and are not licensed or trademarked. Hope that helps solve the mystery for you. But we are of the opinion that this is a knock off and not an official Hedstrom produced playball. One last follow-up, and she shared the history of the ball, to the extent she was able to dig up: The records that I can still access tell me we created this ball in 2004 and first sold it in 2005. The last one was sold in 2008. Our records don’t indicate ‘who’ might have been the designer at the time. Going under cover So that trail runs cold. The ball is a knock-off. Let's examine it in more detail for clues. Indeed, additional analysis reveals that your ball and the Hedstrom ball are very similar, but not identical. There are some differences which have to be taken into account. In particular, @H Walters points out that the layout — that is, the positions of the symbols relative to one another — are different in your photograph than in the catalog thumbnail for the Hedstrom ball: K and E are shared designs between the two images. The neighborhood around K and E are very different, however; in the OP image K and E are adjacent and at each others' \"9 o'clock\" (E being oriented differently); Q is at K's 6, and Y at K's 7. In the catalog K and E aren't even adjacent; we can see E's entire neighborhood (from 1 to 12: BMDGHL), and K's neighborhood that can be seen is JIDA. So at the very least, if they're the same ball, K and E are repeated, which makes little sense. And, as @m69 further points out: It's not just that the lay-out is different; look at which part of the letter E is covered by the elephant's ear; that's different too. Note also that in the photo of the ball that Hedstrom sent me, V is used for vase, not volcano, R is for robot, not rainbow, and the drawing of the nail for N is a slightly different style than on your ball. The stake-out Finally, at @jkej's prompting: It would add to the \"circumstantial\" evidence if we could find out the full set of pictures/words used on the original Hedstrom ball. Particularly, it would be very interesting if we could confirm that: All words that are not sensible in English (i.e. Yxa and U-boat) were absent from the original. All words not sensible in Swedish were present on the original. If (2) holds it is possible that all words added to the knock-off were taken from a Swedish source. Given the pictures of the original that we already have, we only need to confirm that Owl, Queen and Worm were on the original to prove (2). I asked my contact at Hedstrom, and she replied: The ‘U’ has a red and white UMBRELLA. The ‘O’ has a brown and yellow OWL. The ‘Q’ has a QUEEN with white hair and a yellow crown with red & blue jewels. And ‘W’ is an orange and red WORM. Based on this, @jkej's analysis is: I'd like to underscore that I think the answer from Hedstrom was a BIG step forward. It may seem like a dead end, but it conclusively tells us that A) the pictures on the ball came from two distinctly separate sources, B) the general impression of an English ball can be fully explained by one of the sources, C) the pictures from the second source are better explained in Swedish. These were things we could only speculate about before. DNE evidence So a third-party made a knock-off version of the ball, not unusual in Asian manufacture, and introduced these differences, and perhaps picked up some Swedish contagion in the process. To confirm that, we'll have to pick up the scent of this mysterious DNE you found near the valve of your ball. But to do that, we have to start at the other end of the trail. I've reached out to Lojas França via email and Facebook. The email bounced, but there's still hope they'll reply on Facebook. A hot lead! Meanwhile, an informant, @Brad Koch, has it from some good sources in shady corners of the internet that the ball has been found. From @thedrake on HackerNews: I found the BALL manufacturer!!!! https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html And what do we spy in the SW and SE corners of the right image (zoom in): Y: U: Our suspects! Hiding in China, right where our intelligence said they'd be. And all the other images match as well. Now to track down the manufacturer of these knock-off balls. The chase afoot From the Alibaba link, we find (one) producer of these balls is Shanghai Jianhuiling Sporting Goods Co., Ltd. Tracking down the markets they operate in leads us to: Nature of Business: Exporter‚ Manufacturer Industry: Toys & Games Product/Service Range: Toys and Games Major Market(s): • Eastern Europe • Western Europe A final fingerprint So while Hedstrom is not responsible for the axe on your ball, there is one last piece of evidence that Y=yxa. We find the ball again on a Swedish user's Pinterest page. In fact, this one of only 3 sites I could find anywhere on the Internet with an image of your ball7. Case closed open After all this, one thing is certain. Since the original designer of the ball, an American company whose employees are native speakers of English, used yo-yo to illustrate y, we know the intended word is not English. Overall, adulteration of the ball with Swedish words seems indicated, though far from definitive. But it's the best theory I've got. Except of course for @Vincent Fourmond's conclusion that we're dealing here with a yakety axe. ¹ I also tried \"and related to\": hatchet, chop, and cut, even though the latter two words are verbs and all the other symbols on the child's ball represent concrete nouns. Nothing material emerged. ² We could make a case for N also fitting for Swedish, as @konaya points out, by observing the depicted object could as easily be a tack, which is nubb in Swedish. ³ Note that the E and K which are on the northermost latitude in the photograph have different orientations, and the symbol always has the same orientation as its letter (i.e., the top of the symbol shows you where the top of the letter is) so there is no concern that the W for worm might be M for maggot or anything. I say this because I wondered for a moment whether the illustrator mistook Y for an upside-down h in hatchet. 4 Which, taken as a holistic pattern, makes the yellow theory very dubious. 5 Since this question was asked, the Fishpond.com product page has been removed, with no redirect. Likely that's due to the the popularity of this question causing many people to hit that page (which listed an out-of-stock item), causing needless load from their perspective. But through shrewd parameter hacking, @biolauri got Google to serve up a cached version. A screenshot is available here, for when the cache inevitably gets flushed and also disappears. With the cached Fishpond.com page in hand, @H Walters did some source snooping and noticed a number of references to the same number as in the Fishpond.com URL: 0033149041559. Many of these references were meta tags and hidden input fields, variously labelled barcode as inor gtin13 as in . It also exactly matches the code in the catalog (see caption under catalog screenshot; there it is listed in component form Indicator-Company Prefix–Item Reference-Check Digit), and a barcode search confirms the company prefix 0033149 is indeed owned by Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc. An interesting discrepancy, however. While the Fishpond.com and BBS catalog barcode item reference match (04155), the associated \"part numbers\" do not. The catalog shows 54-4155: that is, group number 54 (likely \"decorated play balls\"), species 4155 (same as bar code item reference, less the leading 0). But Fishpond.com shows Other Information: 54-4246T, which is the same group number (54, decorated play balls), but a different species 4246T. 6 And we also know the wholesale price per dozen as of April 2013 was $1.77, thanks to this price sheet (file name \"HedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls\") tracked down by @Mari-Lou's UPC hunting skills. Note that the UPC / barcode is the same as in the catalog, 0-33149-04155-9, but the item number differs. The ~2012 catalog has 54-4155, but the 2013 price list has 54-41554. This may be a typo, or it may be additional substantiation that one UPC may be used for different versions of the product. 7 One potential risk here is that the Pinterest.se page was dynamically generated just for me, based on cookies set during the course of my research into \"Swedish\" and a young child's toy. Note the Swedish header translates to just a generic a \"check out these fine products\", and all the products offered are to toys for young children, related to reading, and all the descriptions are in English. But I think the risk here is low: I found the site through a reverse image search on Google, which suggests it pre-existed my research.

Chinese children learn ABCs but likely before they speak English. So possibly this image was used on another ball designed for Chinese, and was not changed.

Show activity on this post. It is not an axe! It's crystal-clear that the illustration style has solid, even-width, non-abstract black edges on color pools, to represent real objects: As far as we know, there are no exceptions to this. But. The illustration in question deliberately has an \"abstract\" soft edge: Also, note that, Extremely simply, axes don't have wibbly river-like handles. My deep fear: It's not an axe. As others have pointed out, this was drawn almost certainly in 30 seconds by a commercial illustrator with no knowledge of English or Swedish. My guess: It was an abstract representation of \"yellow\" (it makes me think of \"color coming from a paint tube\"). Indeed, here - we could ask? - are we seeing a rare expression of what we could call artistic sensibility, a personal stroke, from a \"factory-line art worker\" - and then, for reasons which - tragically - it is extremely unlikely we will ever know, some other illustrator came along, and, decided to add something on the end (possibly - and we can only guess here - not realizing it was meant to be a, we could even say artistic, abstract representation of \"yellow swish!\") so as it make it more sensible; that person may have thought it was an axe handle, and knowing nothing about English characters just drew on an axe head - or - and here, I'm going to introduce a twist - I really think it may not be an axe head, but rather it was meant to be some other object we can only guess at. Note that an object such as \"a brush\" or \"a paint dispensor of some type\" would make ideal sense here. Indeed note that - and we can only put this in the chapter \"speculative\" - one could possibly argue that the illustration is \"suspicious\" in the vicinity of the line joins in question: It can be difficult when a bright-eyed, cheerful investigation by - let's face it - rich people with computers and electronic panlingual dictionaries, leads us to not merely a conclusion, but, shall we say, leads us face to face with the incredibly microscopic - but no less powerful for it, far from it - psychological dramas that play out \"on the line\" of the world of Skyscrapers and Shanties, Lamborghinis and Slums, that is children's ball manufacture, today. Have we even thought ...... what dramas could be found ..... on the other side of the ball?

I think this is what happened: In an office somewhere in Asia. A - Do you know a word that begins with the letter Y? B - Why? A - Yes. B - ... A - Well, do you? B - Do I what? A - Do you know a word beginning with Y? B - What do you need it for? A - Some company from the US with a Swedish name asked me to design a playground ball with phonics printed on it. Can you think of something with Y? B - Yes! A - That's right. But I don't know how to turn yes into a picture. B - Oh, I didn't mean yes, I meant: yes, I know such a word. A - ... B - Yak! A - Yuck? That's even harder to picture! B - No yak, that's like an ox. A - Oh, okay, didn't know that. Thanks, it's a good one. B - And yellow of course. A - Thinking to himself - So yok is a kind of yellow axe? You learn something new every day. But then again, language was never my strong suit... Or is it a Yatch?

It is not my intention to ridicule Asia in any way. It is highly likely though that the ball is manufactured in China. I think Chinese and English are totally different languages, so that might explain the assumed mistake in translation. (Follow my links te serious answers under 'Just kidding'). In my story, A and B should be talking some Asian language to each other, but my knowledge of these languages is practically zero, so I am the one that would really get lost in translation! – Draakhond Aug 3, 2017 at 9:18 Add a comment41 votes Save this answer. Show activity on this post. I think that the answer is likely to be more simple than most people here are proposing. Given that so much is manufactured in China and that 'Chinglish' is a well known phenomenon (Google it), then I believe the manufacturer has simply got the word for axe wrong.

There are lots of children's toys made in China where the designer's just haven't got a clue to some of the cultural references, and the toys are just bizarre. There's random mixing and matching of stuff that makes no sense. – fixer1234 Jun 24, 2017 at 9:47 17 I agree with this answer (and +1!), but the intriguing question was what did the manufacturer think the word for axe was? What was he trying to spell? Merely yaxe? Probably not. The fun thing is reverse engineering the error from the forensic evidence. – Dan Bron Jun 24, 2017 at 12:59 3 This is the correct answer, but there's more to it.... – Fattie Jun 24, 2017 at 14:14 9 @fixer1234 What’s a designer’s just? :) – tchrist ♦ Jun 24, 2017 at 15:30 7 or even, like this. – Eliot G York Jun 25, 2017 at 15:26Show 2 more comments 37 votes Save this answer.

I found this on the Glossary of YesterdayTools.com: Yankee axe: a term used to describe the lighter weight American style of axe as compared to a European style or Spanish style of axe. Also refers to axes and hatchets that include a flat poll as compared to the rounded European style of axe without any poll. a general pattern of axe developed around the turn of the 19th century that was basically square and without the ears that had previously been included on many axes. Mari-Lou brought to my attention the following illustration: Source: Eric Sloane's book \"Americana: American Barns and Covered Bridges, Our Vanishing Landscape, and American Yesterdays\" The illustration shows various heads named after various regions of America including one labelled \"Yankee\". Note that YesterdayTools says that the term \"Yankee\" was used to refer to American style axes, suggesting that the regional distinction was disregarded outside U.S.A. where all American style axes would be refered as a Yankee axes. What we find if we look at the history of axes, we find that a lot of evolution and specialization tailored to the different types of trees found in each region and the techniques used to process such wood. Part of the problem of focusing attention on the American axe arises from the fact that the earliest ones used here were made in Europe, and certainly the first ones made here were European in character. Thus, in the earliest colonial times a dividing line could not be drawn between the two categories. As a matter of fact, the object was really a European-American axe. Because iron, unlike wood, is similar regardless of the place it was made, the essential substance of an axe does not help to identify its origin. Short of some identifiable maker’s mark, the manufacturers of most of our early axes must remain anonymous. It seems certain that most of the first axes made in North America were made and used on the Atlantic seaboard, a few exceptions occurring when trading companies brought in blacksmiths to their centers of exchange to repair and resharpen axes. As settlers moved westward and southward, their needs were supplied by smiths who went with them and were responsive to individual needs. This procedure was the beginning of very high specialization in the forms of axes, a differentiation which was picked up by the big manufacturers in the nineteenth century. The axes were mostly of the felling variety, but there were other purposes for which an axe was needed. The pace of specialization increased; as evidence of this trend, one manufacturer informed the writer that at one time the company manufactured about three hundred different types. The president of the Mann Edge Tool Company, in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, reported that in 1969 they were producing seventy different patterns; however, the bulk of their production involved only about twenty. Henry J. Kauffman, in his introduction to \"American Axes\" (1994); As quoted in the book \"An Ax to Grind - A Practical Ax Manual\" (1999) Addendum: Why would axes have curved handles? Aside from cartoony graphics... A curved handle has the effect of doubling the effective length of the \"Fore-section\". (Because the...)

I knew there must be specializations of the tool axe not covered by Wikipedia's article on bladed weapons. The tool and the weapon are different things, and the picture on the ball definitely looks like the tool-type! So now we have Yankee axe (Modern English), yaxe (Middle English), yxa (Swedish), and yue (Pinyin), as 4 words that mean axe and start with a y! This is why SE is amazing. – Dan Bron Jun 25, 2017 at 18:11 9 I find this hypothesis very unlikely, but I'm upvoting it for the research. – J.R.

One other possibility, that is actually an English word, is yaxe, a variation of axe/ax1. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the spelling yax was used briefly in the 15th century, and yaxe was used in Scottish English in the 18th. This latter usage is also included in several 19th century collections of Scottish terms, such as Thomas Brown's A Dictionary of the Scottish Language: Comprehending All the Words in Common Use in the Writings of Scott, Burns, Wilson, Ramsay, and Other Popular Scottish Authors, 1845: YAXE, s. An axe. And in the 1906 Scottish Notes and Queries, John Malcolm Bulloch, Ed., there is a note Most likely E prefixed to Achnach is intended to represent the sound of Y, which is frequently and in different languages prefixed to initial vowels to facilitate the pronunciation, as in the Ayrshire yae, yin, yill, for ac, ane, ale; and Aberdeenshire yaxe, yaik, yirl, for axe, aik, earl. Illustrated alphabets for children originated in the period when this word was apparently in current use (see Wikipedia), so it seems plausible that some Scottish battledore was the model for this ball. 1 Forms: OE acas, äx, eax . . . 15 yax, 18 (Sc.) yaxe . . . . — \"axeax, n.1.\" OED Online.

I spent several hours after finding the ball looking for an axe or a hatchet or an Ubåt to no avail of the exact image... This is NOT what the designer would search as they most likely do NOT speak English (Chinese made from earlier research above of the ball manufactuer) Me getting into the shoes of the designer: Assumptions: 1. The designer is in a hurry. 2.

It's interesting that this ball was re-designed recently enough that Google Images 1.) Existed and 2.) Delivered the same results today as it did when the designer performed their search. This suggests that this ball was designed relatively recently. – John Page Jul 1, 2017 at 16:20 Add a comment20 votes Save this answer. Show activity on this post. Not an axe. Not a tube of yellow paint. A spraycan with yellow paint. The graphic artist wasn't aware that it needed to fit in a constrained space. The editor lopped off the can portion of the graphic so that it would fit on the ball... and not obstruct the queen.

Show activity on this post. I think the manufacturer of the ball meant the word yellow, as @Yosef Baskin suggested. As I said in a comment, I scrolled through Etymonline, words beginning with y. This is not as insane as it sounds, because there are not many words beginning with y. I did not find any words in my scan that could be an axe. Then I scanned through my very old copy of Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (Copyright 1961 by C. & G. Merriam Co.) -- and found yataghan. Yataghan was not in Etymonline. My dictionary says: yataghan, also yatagan, (Turk.) A long knife, or short saber, without a crosspiece, common among Mohammedans. But as Dan Bron said, the picture does not look like a long knife or a short saber, and the word would not be in a child's vocabulary. But yataghan is a word in an English dictionary! However, I am convinced that the word is yellow. Addendum (June 30, 2017): I've realized for two or three days that Dan Bron is right. I was wrong. It is yxa. It isn't yellow. I thought about deleting this answer, but am letting it stand as part of the historical record of this historic question.

I saw a video on YouTube that started with: The Y Axes. Singular: Y-axis Plural: Y-axes Axes is the only word in English that is used as the plural of three different singular noun forms: 1) ax, 2) axe, and 3) axis. The manufacturer probably saw somewhere the plural form mentioned above and put two and two very strange ones together!! Y and Axe do come together in this weird way! Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, the only image available through it, is a low resolution version from Google's image cache. I downloaded the low-resolution image and used it in a new Google search by image. This effort led me to a high resolution version. Note the tell-tale water mark in the lower left corner! The water-mark led me to a page on a Chinese website that might belong to the artist. Edit: Here is a translated version of his page. The term \"Xinyang\" can be translated to \"belief, faith\" according to Janus Bahs Jacquet. (See his comment below for more) Is this nipic user, an individual artist, a graphic design group, or a reseller? The profile picture of the young boy makes me think this is the personal page of an individual. It would be interesting to ask him what his intent was when he designed the Y/Axe graphic. Here is the artist's profile picture: Edit: On the same website, nipic.com, Mary-Lou A found this image. Similar axe, but a different \"Y\".

Btw, here is the picture as uploaded by Xinyangtcdj. The last picture in your post was already found by Mary_Lou A some 12 hours before you. This find led to some additional breakthroughs which you can read all about in the comments to Dan Bron's answer. Your first find is still of interest though, because the upload is dated to 2008-03-11 making it the earliest record of the axe picture we have found so far. – jkej Jul 1, 2017 at 23:40 2 Xinyangtcdj cannot really be translated as anything. Xinyang is probably either 信仰 xìnyǎng ‘belief, faith’ or 心痒 xīnyǎng ‘intense desire’, but tcdj is probably just an abbreviation representing the initial letter (in Pinyin transcription) of four syllables that we have no way of knowing for certain what are. When typing Chinese, you can just type the first letter of each syllable and it guesses at a likely meaning; tcdj yields 天长地久 tiāncháng dìjiǔ, which does mean ‘everlasting and unchanging’ (lit. ‘as far as the heavens, as long as the earth’), but that’s just one possibility. – Janus Bahs Jacquet Jul 2, 2017 at 9:38 Add a comment5 votes Save this answer. Show activity on this post. Edit : After some discussion with other user in the comment section, I now think it was a production mistake. One of the graphic meant to be printed on the Swedish version of that toy was mistakenly printed on the English version instead. (basically agree with the top answer from Dan Bron) ~ originally my answer was as below: There have to be a mistake somewhere -- Q-Queen, W-worm, N-Nail pairings make sense, but 'Y' and 'Axe' pair doesn't, because the word Axe doesn't begin with Y. I think the original design was [X-aXe]. The point of this design was to match an alphabet with an easily remembered common word, thus help children to better remember the English alphabet; since there is no common word begin with the alphabet X, the designer made an exception and paired Axe with X, because the pronunciation of Axe is similar to X. There are two rules in choosing a word to match an alphabet in this design. 1. the word has to begin with the same alphabet. 2. the word has to be common enough for kids to remember. The designer couldn't follow both rules for the alphabet X and decided rule #2 is more important because this is a design for helping kids to remember alphabets. Although the word 'axe' doesn't begin with 'X', but 'axe' does contains 'X' and it is the prominent alphabet in the word. The handle of the axe is supposedly the missing lower left part of the alphabet X, which should be painted green to complete the alphabet. It was either the designer's idea, thinking people would get the idea that the missing part of X was replaced by the axe's handle. Or it was a production error that painted the axe handle with different color. I am a retired graphic designer.

Show activity on this post. Another connection between the letter Y and axes might be the Epsilon Axe. According to Wikipedia the Epsilon Axe is named after the greek letter epsilon (Ε,ϵ). In some language like German, the latin letter Y is called \"Ypsilon\", after the greek letter Upsilon (Υ,υ). Other languages like Portuguese also use some variants of that name for both the greek and the modern latin letter. Since Epsilon and Ypsilon sound very similar, it's conceivable that someone accidentally confused Epsilon Axe with Ypsilon Axe, which may got simplified to just an axe in the design.

And did you know some English prescriptivists insist on ax for the tool and axe for the weapon? That's something new I learned while researching this question. It's also a reason I'm somewhat unsatisfied with my link to Wikipedia's comprehensive list of bladed weapons. Who's to say there isn't an axe tool not on that list, which may begin with a y (not that a toddler would have that word, whatever it is, in his vocabulary, of course). – Dan Bron Jun 24, 2017 at 18:44 1 @DanBron the only way of knowing why the manufacturer chose an ax, axe, or hatchet is by writing to them or visiting their website. It's worth noting that no other European word for \"yellow\" begins with Y, in Swedish it's gul – Mari-Lou A Jun 24, 2017 at 19:19 @Mari-LouA No, that's not the only way. Just as it's not true that the only way to know if a suspect actually mustered a victim is y asking him. You collect and analyze evidence and present a case. That case is convincing or not. Here, the form factor of the axe tells us it's the tool axe (likely a hatchet, one handed, but being that definitive is probably beyond the scope of analyzing a cartoon). Compare it to the hatchet in my answer or the one I posted under Fattie's answer.

That doesn't explain the weird u-boat thing, though. reply rob74 2 hours agorootparentThe \"weird u-boat thing\" further supports the Swedish hypothesis - \"ubåt\" or \"undervattensbåt\" are the standard terms for a submarine in Swedish (https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ub%C3%A5t). The word \"U-boat\" is also used in English, however with the meaning \"German submarine during WW1/2\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-boat) - but I don't think it's widespread enough (or appropriate) to be eligible for a toy. reply porphyra 3 hours agorootparentprevThat is completely unlikely. As ximeng says, it's an archaic word for a special weapon, but also: * Most of the other letters on the ball work well in English but would not work well for Chinese words with pinyin * Children do not learn the alphabet by studying pinyin since pinyin only has a subset of letters. The initials in pinyin are: b, p, m, f, d, t, n, l, g, k, h, j, q, x, zh, ch, sh, r, z, c, s, w, and y. As you can see, there is no 'v'. Children in Chinese-speaking countries would still use English to learn their ABCs. reply ximeng 5 hours agorootparentprevThat’s an uncommon historical term for axe.

It’s also what they’re going to do with math about 75% of the time. reply throwaway167 4 hours agorootparentprev> how much water is in that well? Given the viscosity of air vs. water, one might assume there's no water in the well. Also, given some surface area of a bear, and air pressure from a cushion of air formed under the falling bear, the fall speed does seem a little high, at least for a calculation with that number of decimal places, but perhaps the well was located in the crust of the earth where gravity's a tad higher. Living bears are also buoyant, and will be slowed down considerably on meeting the water, so the bear is unlikely to have reached the bottom of a water-filled well for a long period, if at all. To answer OP, I'd say the bear is brown, because of the mud from the base of the (somewhat empty) well. However to an outside observer, given the lack of light in the well the shade of brown might not be discernable. A human in the well with the bear will see the colour of the bear as a low relative concern compared to A) being in a well and B) being in a well with a bear. reply Ekaros 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat is definition of bottom of the well?

I also really enjoy assembling portuguese words out of japanese phonemes. The pronunciation of japanese and portuguese is remarkably similar and I often find that even the most innocuous japanese vocabulary sounds like portuguese slang or swear words. Sometimes they sound like complete portuguese sentences. The full names of actual japanese people can sometimes be literally transcribed into extremely unfortunate portuguese sentences. Just imagine the amount of bullying targeted at Brazil's immense japanese immigrant population.

The only nitpick I'd have on this incredible dissertation is on the \"U\" association with \"U-boat\" - this is an anglicized form of the German word \"Unterseeboot\" (undersea boat) which was itself shortened to \"U-boot\" (presumably the etymology of the Swedish \"ubåt\"). The first known use of the term \"U-boat\" is 1914, while the Germans and Swedish armed forces were commissioning submarines around a decade prior (in 1906 and 1904 respectively). reply lolinder 11 hours agorootparentIt looks like it could also be an anglicized version of the modern Swedish word for submarine, which appears to be Ubåt [0].

Similar problems exist with S for Sun, C for (a yellow) crayon etc. Also the handle is what has been drawn superimposed over the letter. Still, confusion with A for axe isnt any better than S for sun or whatever.

I would seriously doubt that anyone teaching Chinese would use this word to illustrate the letter 'Y' in English or Pinyin, especially to toddlers. There are plenty of child-friendly words starting with 'Y' that could be used instead. reply thaumasiotes 3 hours agorootparentWell, more to the point, someone teaching Chinese would be unlikely to think that illustrating a particular letter was a concept that made any sense. Pinyin is a syllabic system, not an alphabetic system. For example, the letter Y in the syllable \"yue\" is notionally silent -- making it an especially terrible choice of something to illustrate! -- and \"yue\" could appear in the same row of a pinyin table as \"wu\", since they both start with the same consonant (or, more accurately, neither of them starts with a consonant at all). But Y in \"yang\" is not silent; it represents the same sound you'd expect if you were familiar with English. By the same token, \"i\" represents a very different vowel in \"shi\" than it does in \"ni\". And interestingly enough, although \"ni\" rhymes with \"xi\" and doesn't rhyme with \"shi\", the traditional analysis says that \"xi\" and \"shi\" use the same vowel (again, it's supposed to be a lack of a vowel, not a vowel that exists) while \"ni\" is doing something that is somehow different. Modern analysis would disagree with the traditional claim about vowels, but can support the idea that \"yue\" and \"wu\" both begin with a zero onset. reply plaidfuji 9 hours agoprevAnybody who has bought children’s toys on Amazon before would immediately think, “oh, it’s because it’s a knockoff made in China, this is not worth further investigation”.

That's not how smoke works. And the \"yurt\" itself is clearly depicted as a wedge. With the \"smoke\" attached to it as a cylinder.

The evidence against the Swedish explanation is that the ball says c for 'cat' and d for 'dog', but in swedish the translations are 'katt' and 'hund' respectively. This may be a case where the most upvoted answer is likely wrong, but because it was so entertaining and took so much effort, it was upvoted much more than the boring (but probably correct) answer.

Apologies for the confusion. reply sebzim4500 11 hours agoparentThe most upvoted answer doesn't say that it's a Swedish designed ball, rather that it is a Chinese knockoff where they moved things around and replaced some of the symbols with ones from books/toys for Swedish kids.

But it's still not clear why they would use \"u-boat\" for u. While apparently correct english (never heard it), it being Swedish ubåt seems higher likelihood to me. I'm wondering if they might have combined mixed two designs, as a lot of the letters works in both. Maybe they looked at two pictures and didn't realise one was for another language? It seems possible to me that they'd design the ball based on product pictures, and those are often not showing all angles of a product.

In that case I have a possible explanation. When the ball was copied, they may have worked from images. You need more than one image because the ball is round. Could the copycat have used an English version for one of the sides, and Swedish for the other? By looking at the images and letters around the Y, they actually make more sense in Swedish The poster may have made a mistake by interpreting the \"W\" for \"worm\". If the Swedish theory is right, it is actually an \"M\" as worm is translated to \"mask\" in Swedish. They also seem unaware that a picature of the nail can also be translated as \"nagel\". E - Elefant N - Nagel M - Mask / Metmask K - Känguru To me it looks like that side fits the Swedish words perfectly. The \"Q\" (queen) is copied from a different picture that comes from the English version Edit: One of the comments on Stack exchange seems to suggest the same theory. The symbols seem to be a mix of at least two different sources.

    "originBody": "Featured Losing my son Lars Doucet Dec 2, 2023 • 10 min read On October 20th, my seven year old son Nikolas suffered cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure at the hospital to treat an underlying congenital condition. The doctors performed CPR and succeeded in reviving him but ultimately he suffered catastrophic brain damage. My wife and I were in the hospital for nearly a month at his bedside as we awaited his ultimate prognosis. What is there to say? First, I'm devastated. Second, I'm not going to be giving more details beyond what I write here for now. Third, I'll address those the most common questions, and concerns. Fourth, I'm making major changes to my life. Fifth, I will describe a bit about what this situation feels like from the inside. If you have not experienced this kind of tragedy, it will likely surprise you, as it did me. Devastation There's three things everybody says to me now: \"I can't imagine what you're going through.\" \"I don't know how you're handling it.\" \"That must be so hard.\" These statements are true. If you haven't been through this, you don't get it. So let me tell you all about it. It'll be okay. Well, actually it's not okay, but it's okay that it's not okay. My son is alive, but all of his higher mental functions have been wiped out. He still sleeps and wakes, breathes under his own power, and responds to certain stimuli, but he makes no intentional movements. He moves reflexively, and occasionally smiles and even laughs, but he can't speak and it's not clear what degree of awareness he still has of his situation, if any. The MRI results were conclusive that the damage was widespread and severe, and to such a degree that short of an outright miracle, there is no hope for regeneration through brain \"plasticity\" or any other known path towards recovery. People don't come back from this kind of injury. That's important to say. I believe in miracles, but part and parcel of that belief is the acknowledgement that miracles are by definition rare, and the faith that God is able to grant them must be paired with a complete lack of presumption of receiving one (Daniel 3:17-18, emphases mine): 17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. 18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. I would be delighted to hear Nikolas' voice calling out to me tomorrow morning, but I hold no lingering hope that this will happen. That's what it takes to get me through my day. I'm reminded of one the little flavor quotes in Act VII in my game Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten: My friend James Cavin, the game's writer, wrote those words over a decade ago, and I couldn't think of a better way to describe the strangeness of my current situation. While hope yet remained, I suffered the most. The most devastating moment in the hospital was opening the MRI report. Up until then we were clinging to hope, and afterwards there was nothing left to do but to live with the loss. Our crushed hopes allow us to get on with the long road ahead. As for \"I can't imagine how hard that must be\"– Turns out, unfathomable tragic loss isn't very hard. It's easy, in fact. Easy in the same way that falling off a cliff is \"easy\"–gravity does all the work for you. It's not like climbing mount Everest, desperately putting one foot in front of the other. It's not like struggling to answer questions in a final exam. Tragic loss is just something that happens to you. It's not hard, just terrible. The grief is different than people expect, too. I cried a lot, but after a certain point you only have so many tears left to cry. I can't cry all day, every day, for months on end. And honestly, at this point crying feels good. Crying isn't really when I feel like I'm suffering the most, although I think people on the outside sort of had that expectation. There's this implicit assumption from other people that you will have a very legible grief, to \"put on sad-face,\" so to speak. But! This isn't one of those essays where the author describes their personal suffering in great detail and then passively aggressively berates all the readers who haven't suffered to the exact same level for being somehow morally deficient, as has become vogue in the popular press over the last ten years. Because guess what – two months ago I would have been just like most of you! Two months ago, if I were talking to someone who was in the position I find myself in now, I'd ask all the same \"insensitive\" and \"inappropriate\" questions, all the while being desperately afraid I was being insensitive and inappropriate. So everyone should just relax. I lost my son, it's terrible. No, you're not a bad person for asking me how I'm doing. Yes, everything's weird. I know you don't know what to say. I don't know what to say either. Nobody does. It's fine. What We're In For My son is alive, severely brain damaged, bedridden, and unable to care for himself. We took him off of all medical supports and moved him into home hospice care. This means that we stopped the artificial ventilator and IV's, as well as all medicines and treatments other than those aimed at comfort and pain relief, and moved him into a hospital bed we have installed at home. The doctors initially thought he would quickly die after being taken off the ventilator, but he has persisted for about a month now. He receives food and water through a feeding tube, medicine for pain relief and comfort, and daily care from my wife and I as well as from hospice nurses who visit during the week. The fact is, Nikolas could very well live for years or even decades to come, and my wife and I will take care of him up until that moment. We do not stand for euthanasia, but neither will we prolong his life through heroic and artificial life support measures. Food, water, comfort, and daily care–these he will receive from us, indefinitely. This is not the sort of thing that can be easily outsourced unless I were to commit my son to a facility, which we will not do as it would drastically reduce our ability to see him on a daily basis. This puts a large daily burden of work, material expense, and restriction on personal freedom. We take this burden gladly. Fortunately, we have been able to qualify for public medical assistance in this regard and it looks like we are going to be financially okay for the time being. I am grateful that I also have a strong private support network should I have to lean on it. To be 100% clear, I am not asking for money and I neither need nor want anyone to offer me any. Changes My nearly complete game, Defender's Quest 2: Mists of Ruin was originally supposed to ship at the end of 2023, but that's now been obviously delayed. I'm very grateful to our publisher, Armor Games, for being understanding in the midst of this tragedy. A couple things are changing from the original plan before this all happened. First, this is the end of my professional game career. There will be a lot I have to say about this in the future, but the short version is with all the obligations I now have (particularly ongoing medical expenses) I am suddenly in the need of a much more stable, predictable, and boring career. I was successful early on, but as the years went by I found myself having to juggle development with any number of day jobs and side gigs due to the inherent instability of indie game development. I've loved my time in games, but I have to move on. I will write a post-mortem of my 10+ years in games sometime, as I have had some real accomplishments above and beyond the two Defender's Quest games that I am quite proud of to this day. Second, I am no longer a daily member of the DQ2 development team. This is particularly painful for me given that I was nearly at the end of a ten year journey for a game that's been in development since before any of my three children were born, but losing one of those children has upended my priorities. But DQ2 is neither cancelled nor abandoned. It was always Level Up Labs, LLC, not Lars Doucet, who bore the ultimate responsibility for the game's development, and I am but a part of that company. My co-founder, Anthony Pecorella, has heroically stepped up to the plate and coordinated the final stages of development in my absence. I am still in an advisory role and will make sure the final game is a good one, but I simply no longer have the capacity to do this with the new daily burdens in my life. I will try, if possible, to make sure we fulfill all of the pre-order campaign obligations (I've kept all the records), but I will ask for people's understandings if we fall short in certain regards or some of the goodies wind up being delayed. As always, if you are unhappy with your preorder for any reason, email leveluplabs@gmail.com and we will cheerfully refund your money. Third, GameDataCrunch.com is officially defunct for good, at least under my direction. I still have all the source code, scripts, databases and other stuff for it, so anyone with decent web development skills (it's mostly just a pile of php, javascript, cron jobs, and MySQL) could easily resurrect it and keep it going. I have some people in mind for this already, but if you want to make your own pitch for why I should turn it over to you I'd be more than happy to hear it: email me at lars dot doucet at gmail dot com. Fourth, I now have one and only one job, which is working on real estate mass appraisal valuation technology for the purposes of accurately and credibly measuring the value of land separately from buildings and improvements. This is the kind of straightforward, steady, stable, boring work that I need to support my family right now. It also conveniently lines up with my niche interests. And with that, I'm left with the new normal. It's Strange I'm shocked at how quickly our family adapted to the situation. Our two girls (ages five and ten) have proved remarkably resilient, and help with Nikolas' daily care with eagerness and calm. We still read to him at bed time, pray with him, and sing his favorite songs. I know that he almost certainly can't hear us in his current physical form, and though I don't know how eternity relates to the physical world that's welded to the arrow of time, I like to think that Nikolas watches us from Heaven and hears us in that way (and perhaps I am watching there alongside him from the other side). The best metaphor I can give for the daily home hospice care of your own seven year old son is a monastic vocation. It's menial work, tied to the hours of the day, an obligation and an obedience, for the rest of my life, or his, whichever comes first. Nikolas has becomes a living altar to his own memory. I do not want to paint an overly rosy picture. I re-experience the trauma of losing him every time I see him, and it is deeply painful to see him in his reduced state. But all I have left to give him is my love, expressed in his daily care. There are many costs, and not just in terms of time and money. My wife and I can no longer leave the house at the same time without finding someone with adequate training to watch over Nikolas while we are gone. I'm grateful that we were fairly boring homebound personalities, as this means we have been forced to give up much less than other couples would experience in this situation. I won't be traveling much in the future, for obvious reasons, but we will find a way to make the most essential trips should the need arise. The other thing I want to convey to people is that although I'm sad and experiencing a great loss, I cling relentlessly to joy. Since I was a small child I always hated a particular kind of tragic story, and I still feel that way today. I did not hate tragedies in general, or any story with a sad ending, but specifically the kind of story where not only does something terrible happen to beloved characters, but the kind of story where it's very obvious that the author is making some kind of nihilistic statement in doing so, sort of turning to face the reader, saying, Now do you see, you naïve moron? Life is naught but pain, and you're a fool and a worm for not being as miserable as me! Enough. Look, the news media inundates us every day with endless tales of genuine horror and suffering, because in a world with billions of people that will always be happening somewhere. Life is and will always be fundamentally unfair, and the vale of tears filled with a never-ending parade of horrors. And yet, it's also true that for the median person on Earth, life is much better today than ever before in human history. My own story is exactly one such example – the fact that I'm devastated to lose my son to a crippling injury highlights another fact–that this very thing has become so rare in my country as to be \"unimaginable.\" We should rejoice at this! Losing a child used to be so unremarkably commonplace that everyone, even emperors and kings, routinely suffered it until approximately yesterday. The correct adjective for the tragedy I'm experiencing is not \"unimaginable\" but unfathomable. I can imagine it just fine because it's happening to me, and you can imagine it too now because I'm describing it to you. And because we can imagine it, we can turn and face it, and, with God's grace, we can lift up our cross and bear it, somehow. But what none of us can do is to measure–to fathom–the depth of it. Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw back a little and have a cup of tea. — Elder Sophrony of Essex",

Even though I didn't experience the same severity of pain as my wife or in-laws, I was still there through all of it. I saw my parents-in-law taking care of their dying son, who only a few months ago was a promising ornithology student, and the fittest player on his soccer team. What you wrote resonates a lot with what they said, and what I saw them go through. Thank you for including the reference to Daniel 3, it has been a source of strength for my in-laws too. My brother-in-law got a lot of his strength from Philippians 1:21 \"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.\" The love and care that you provide to your son does not go unnoticed or unseen.

It's always been in the back of my mind. Now the hardest thing is realizing she'll never know her granddaughter, and vice-versa. Not to mention how much my daughter looks like her.

Can’t imagine what they must be going through. When I was 10 my oldest sibling went through a coma and after coming out of it some time later she did some things that my parents were not happy about. My family was going through some things and me being the youngest was completely neglected. I was shoved in a room and my family being well off all the problems were tried to be solved by money. Then just as things were getting a little better for me between 11-12 I was molested a few times. I was too scared to talk to anyone. My parents were not bothered much. 19 years later today I have PTSD and I struggle with anxiety depression panic. In my entire life I had no one to talk to and no one loved me. I was unable to make any connections in life. I do therapy which helps a little. I fell in love with someone 12 years ago which was the only time I felt something in life but she never liked me and till this day I hope for a miracle. There was a time few years ago I was unable to leave my room without panic attacks as that was the only place I felt safe. Somehow I was able to work my way into a graduate degree in computer science from a top school and a job. However I still spent the last 3 days crying alone. I deal with it every single day every single hour of my life. Life gets better some days and worse some days. Anyway my point is that your children and your spouse need you the most right now. This is a turning point for everyone in the family. Hold them close. Talk to them. They may show they are strong and handling it well but they need you more than you might think. Some things cannot be undone. Some things cannot be changed. But many are in control today and a lot will be decided about the future at this time. So please just hold them close and tell them you love them. I will pray for you and your family. reply l33tbro 5 hours agoparentHeartbreaking that you went through all that.

I’d like to say it is all my fault because I am still emotionally unavailable but it takes two. As for advice I think as we all relationships, communication is key. I dropped the ball here because honestly the first year I only got out of bed to go to the liquor store. Year two, I drained my retirement to live while staying 24/7 obliterated and not dealing with what can only be called a complete loss of one’s identity and self. I don’t think it is healthy for us to stay together because she took the loss much easier than I at least from all outward appearance. Years 3-5 was a very introspective and healing time where I went through periods of depression and hopelessness. I’m now in the rediscovering who I am phase because I kind of lost that along the way. So in conclusion, a combination of LSD and therapy(CBT) allowed me to start moving forward with life and slowly getting out of a never ending cycle of grief.

This is real pain. When life hits you like this, it's important to just endure, rather than escape. Trying to escape the pain can lead to addictions and behaviors that bring more problems. Some people are hit with pain like this and live a whole life trying to escape it, but never do. Best thing is accept, grieve, and continue on. Regardless, you will not be the same person, this will change you. Sometimes life just sucks, and there is no way of saying it doesn't, only time and love can help. However, the sun comes up every morning, and there is a sunset every night. This is for anyone out there suffering some acute trauma like losing a loved one, or a chronic trauma like abuse over many years. I have experienced both, and it took me over 15 years to realize what had happened and to recover. I originally chose escapism. I didn't realize it at the time, but that's what it was. I was always into something, eventually even substance abuse. Ironically, escapism is how I ended learning to code, which was an escape for me. However, I also ended up being around even worse things and witnessing more death, while living broke and stressed out. This dragged me into even more suffering to the point of wanting suicide every day, but I just couldn't do it. This was a combination of escapism, and being around people with the same negativity as me. Fortunately in time, I found myself, and realized everything that had happened, and how life can just be like that. But also how beautiful and exciting life can be as well. This would not have happened had I not met certain people that showed me what it means to love, and to be mentally strong. Also, by reading and learning you can find inspiration and love from someone that you will never meet in real life. Regardless, we need support of strong and positive people around us. We are a social species after all. When dealing with death/loss, remember the good times, be thankful for the time we had, and leave it at that - easier said than done.

    "originBody": "Research AlphaGeometry: An Olympiad-level AI system for geometry Published 17 January 2024 Authors Trieu Trinh and Thang Luong Share Our AI system surpasses the state-of-the-art approach for geometry problems, advancing AI reasoning in mathematics Reflecting the Olympic spirit of ancient Greece, the International Mathematical Olympiad is a modern-day arena for the world's brightest high-school mathematicians. The competition not only showcases young talent, but has emerged as a testing ground for advanced AI systems in math and reasoning. In a paper published today in Nature, we introduce AlphaGeometry, an AI system that solves complex geometry problems at a level approaching a human Olympiad gold-medalist - a breakthrough in AI performance. In a benchmarking test of 30 Olympiad geometry problems, AlphaGeometry solved 25 within the standard Olympiad time limit. For comparison, the previous state-of-the-art system solved 10 of these geometry problems, and the average human gold medalist solved 25.9 problems. In our benchmarking set of 30 Olympiad geometry problems (IMO-AG-30), compiled from the Olympiads from 2000 to 2022, AlphaGeometry solved 25 problems under competition time limits. This is approaching the average score of human gold medalists on these same problems. The previous state-of-the-art approach, known as “Wu’s method”, solved 10. AI systems often struggle with complex problems in geometry and mathematics due to a lack of reasoning skills and training data. AlphaGeometry’s system combines the predictive power of a neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine, which work in tandem to find solutions. And by developing a method to generate a vast pool of synthetic training data - 100 million unique examples - we can train AlphaGeometry without any human demonstrations, sidestepping the data bottleneck. With AlphaGeometry, we demonstrate AI’s growing ability to reason logically, and to discover and verify new knowledge. Solving Olympiad-level geometry problems is an important milestone in developing deep mathematical reasoning on the path towards more advanced and general AI systems. We are open-sourcing the AlphaGeometry code and model, and hope that together with other tools and approaches in synthetic data generation and training, it helps open up new possibilities across mathematics, science, and AI. It makes perfect sense to me now that researchers in AI are trying their hands on the IMO geometry problems first because finding solutions for them works a little bit like chess in the sense that we have a rather small number of sensible moves at every step. But I still find it stunning that they could make it work. It's an impressive achievement. Ngô Bảo Châu, Fields Medalist and IMO gold medalist AlphaGeometry adopts a neuro-symbolic approach AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system made up of a neural language model and a symbolic deduction engine, which work together to find proofs for complex geometry theorems. Akin to the idea of “thinking, fast and slow”, one system provides fast, “intuitive” ideas, and the other, more deliberate, rational decision-making. Because language models excel at identifying general patterns and relationships in data, they can quickly predict potentially useful constructs, but often lack the ability to reason rigorously or explain their decisions. Symbolic deduction engines, on the other hand, are based on formal logic and use clear rules to arrive at conclusions. They are rational and explainable, but they can be “slow” and inflexible - especially when dealing with large, complex problems on their own. AlphaGeometry’s language model guides its symbolic deduction engine towards likely solutions to geometry problems. Olympiad geometry problems are based on diagrams that need new geometric constructs to be added before they can be solved, such as points, lines or circles. AlphaGeometry’s language model predicts which new constructs would be most useful to add, from an infinite number of possibilities. These clues help fill in the gaps and allow the symbolic engine to make further deductions about the diagram and close in on the solution. AlphaGeometry solving a simple problem: Given the problem diagram and its theorem premises (left), AlphaGeometry (middle) first uses its symbolic engine to deduce new statements about the diagram until the solution is found or new statements are exhausted. If no solution is found, AlphaGeometry’s language model adds one potentially useful construct (blue), opening new paths of deduction for the symbolic engine. This loop continues until a solution is found (right). In this example, just one construct is required. AlphaGeometry solving an Olympiad problem: Problem 3 of the 2015 International Mathematics Olympiad (left) and a condensed version of AlphaGeometry’s solution (right). The blue elements are added constructs. AlphaGeometry’s solution has 109 logical steps. See the full solution. Generating 100 million synthetic data examples Geometry relies on understanding of space, distance, shape, and relative positions, and is fundamental to art, architecture, engineering and many other fields. Humans can learn geometry using a pen and paper, examining diagrams and using existing knowledge to uncover new, more sophisticated geometric properties and relationships. Our synthetic data generation approach emulates this knowledge-building process at scale, allowing us to train AlphaGeometry from scratch, without any human demonstrations. Using highly parallelized computing, the system started by generating one billion random diagrams of geometric objects and exhaustively derived all the relationships between the points and lines in each diagram. AlphaGeometry found all the proofs contained in each diagram, then worked backwards to find out what additional constructs, if any, were needed to arrive at those proofs. We call this process “symbolic deduction and traceback”. Visual representations of the synthetic data generated by AlphaGeometry That huge data pool was filtered to exclude similar examples, resulting in a final training dataset of 100 million unique examples of varying difficulty, of which nine million featured added constructs. With so many examples of how these constructs led to proofs, AlphaGeometry’s language model is able to make good suggestions for new constructs when presented with Olympiad geometry problems. Pioneering mathematical reasoning with AI The solution to every Olympiad problem provided by AlphaGeometry was checked and verified by computer. We also compared its results with previous AI methods, and with human performance at the Olympiad. In addition, Evan Chen, a math coach and former Olympiad gold-medalist, evaluated a selection of AlphaGeometry’s solutions for us. Chen said: “AlphaGeometry's output is impressive because it's both verifiable and clean. Past AI solutions to proof-based competition problems have sometimes been hit-or-miss (outputs are only correct sometimes and need human checks). AlphaGeometry doesn't have this weakness: its solutions have machine-verifiable structure. Yet despite this, its output is still human-readable. One could have imagined a computer program that solved geometry problems by brute-force coordinate systems: think pages and pages of tedious algebra calculation. AlphaGeometry is not that. It uses classical geometry rules with angles and similar triangles just as students do.” AlphaGeometry's output is impressive because it's both verifiable and clean…It uses classical geometry rules with angles and similar triangles just as students do. Evan Chen, math coach and Olympiad gold medalist As each Olympiad features six problems, only two of which are typically focused on geometry, AlphaGeometry can only be applied to one-third of the problems at a given Olympiad. Nevertheless, its geometry capability alone makes it the first AI model in the world capable of passing the bronze medal threshold of the IMO in 2000 and 2015. In geometry, our system approaches the standard of an IMO gold-medalist, but we have our eye on an even bigger prize: advancing reasoning for next-generation AI systems. Given the wider potential of training AI systems from scratch with large-scale synthetic data, this approach could shape how the AI systems of the future discover new knowledge, in math and beyond. AlphaGeometry builds on Google DeepMind and Google Research’s work to pioneer mathematical reasoning with AI – from exploring the beauty of pure mathematics to solving mathematical and scientific problems with language models. And most recently, we introduced FunSearch, which made the first discoveries in open problems in mathematical sciences using Large Language Models. Our long-term goal remains to build AI systems that can generalize across mathematical fields, developing the sophisticated problem-solving and reasoning that general AI systems will depend on, all the while extending the frontiers of human knowledge.

At the same time, I'd like to point out that it was clear Geometry had to be the first topic to give up against AI (i.e., smart knowledge and inference-method indexing) Among math olympiad topics, Geometry problems are often the most \"mechanical.\" Once you can express the problem in terms of coordinates (think XY or complex plane) you're looking at a finite set of steps a computer can use to find a solution. Of course, time limits and human error get in the way of this being practical during the IMO itself. Back in the day, I'd use WolframAlpha to verify geometry proofs for problems I designed (+conjectures) using this approach. Algebra (especially inequalities) can be similar – pull off some intense calculations and you often have your answer. Where I'm really excited to see intelligent systems make progress is with Number Theory and Combinatorics problems. The search spaces are far more complex and they often require proving that something is impossible. These are the problems that would be difficult to solve with brute force computation. reply fovc 6 hours agoparentAs a consumer of those problems, first of all, thank you! Even decades on from high school I occasionally enjoy working on them. But agree that geometry was obviously going to be first. From what I’ve gathered here, it’s not “brute forcing” in terms of relying on algebraic geometry, vectors, or complex number solutions, but it is brute force in that it’s exhaustively looking for “interesting” constructions. Geometry was always my worst subject, but even so I felt like if given the right construction the problem was much easier. Unfortunately I never developed the intuition to hit on those constructions quickly. It seems this AI doesn’t either, but it can churn through them much faster — There are only so many perpendiculars and parallels and bisectors you can construct which you can more or less mechanically evaluate (map out all angles and ratios, try power of a point, etc.) While this is incredibly impressive, it seems like Deep Mind:Kasparov::AlphaGeo:Terry Tao in the “engine vs AI” sense. I agree Algebra is likely next. Like geometry, more often than not you “just” need a clever substitution or 3, of which there are only so many options to choose from. Some combinatorics problems I think would also be amenable to this search strategy (e.g., finding things to count 2 ways), but that seems like a bridge further away, and only gets you a subset of problems. Number theory would be my guess for the final frontier before a perfect 42. reply Dracophoenix 3 hours agoparentprevHow did you get into such a position? Is there an application process of some sort?

A transformer is trained on millions of elementary geometry theorems and used as brute search for a proof, which because of the elementary geometry context has both a necessarily elementary structure and can be easily symbolically judged as true or false. When the brute search fails, an extra geometric construction is randomly added (like adding a midpoint of a certain line) to see if brute search using that extra raw material might work. [edit: as corrected by Imnimo, I got this backwards - the brute search is just pure brute search, the transformer is used to predict which extra geometric construction to add] Also (not mentioned in the blog post) the actual problem statements had to be modified/adapted, e.g. the actual problem statement \"Let AH1, BH2 and CH3 be the altitudes of a triangle ABC. The incircle W of triangle ABC touches the sides BC, CA and AB at T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Consider the symmetric images of the lines H1H2, H2H3, and H3H1 with respect to the lines T1T2, T2T3, and T3T1. Prove that these images form a triangle whose vertices lie on W.\" had to be changed to \"Let ABC be a triangle. Define point I such that AI is the bisector of angle BAC and CI is the bisector of angle ACB. Define point T1 as the foot of I on line BC. Define T2 as the foot of I on line AC. Define point T3 as the foot of I on line AB. Define point H1 as the foot of A on line BC. Define point H2 as the foot of B on line AC. Define point H3 as the foot of C on line AB. Define point X1 as the intersection of circles (T1,H1) and (T2,H1). Define point X2 as the intersection of circles (T1,H2) and (T2,H2). Define point Y2 as the intersection of circles (T2,H2) and (T3,H2). Define point Y3 as the intersection of circles (T2,H3) and (T3,H3). Define point Z as the intersection of lines X1X2 and Y2Y3.

When it runs out of new deductions, the transformer is asked to suggest possible extra constructions (not randomly added). reply nybsjytm 14 hours agorootparentThanks for the correction, it looks like you're right. reply killerstorm 13 hours agoparentprev> it's still pretty striking how far away the structure of it is from the usual idea of automated reasoning/intelligence. How so? Reasoning is fundamentally a search problem. The process you described is exactly the process humans use: i.e. make a guess about what's useful, try to work out details mechanically. If get stuck, make another guess, etc. So the process is like searching through a tree. People figured out this process back in 1955 (and made a working prototype which can prove theorems): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist but it all hinges on using good 'heuristics'. Neural networks are relevant here as they can extract heuristics from data. What do you think is \"the usual idea of automated reasoning\"? Some magic device which can solve any problem using a single linear pass? reply jhrmnn 11 hours agorootparentI think the intuition here is that an “intelligent” system would lean much more heavily on the heuristics than on the search, like humans. It’s hard to quantify in this case, but certainly in the case of chess, when engines were about as good as best human players, they were doing orders of magnitude larger search than humans. Which made them feel more like chess _engines_ than chess AI. AlphaZero certainly made a step in the right direction, but it’s still far from how humans play. reply killerstorm 11 hours agorootparentThe comment above mentions \"brute force\" incorrectly. It's fundamentally impossible to brute force googol combinations... reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentThe key insight is this whole thread is that this Alpha Geometry only works because the search field is not a googol combinations. So, it doesn't really generalize to many other fields of math.

Seem to me the symbolic domains are well formed to allow such generation of data, which while low value in each instance, might allow valuable pre-training in aggregate. Putting these elements together is an approach that could get us quite far. The key milestone will be moving away from the need to use specific formal / symbolic domains, and to generate a pretrained system that can generalize the skills learned from those domains. reply gizmo686 15 hours agoparent> The key milestone will be moving away from the need to use specific formal / symbolic domains, and to generate a pretrained system that can generalize the skills learned from those domains. You do not need to solve everything at once. This approach has the potential to revolution both math and programming by moving formal verification from being a niche tool into a regular part of every practitioners toolbox. It also completely solves (within the domain it applies) one of the most fundamental problems of AI that the current round is calling \"hallucinations\"; however that solution only works because we have a non AI system to prove correctness. At a high level, this approach is not really that new. Biochem has been using AI to help find candidate molecules, which are then verified by physical experimentation.

Surely it must be doing better than random chance, but is it throwing out thousands of constructions before it finds a good one, or is it able to generate useful proposals at a rate similar to human experts? They say in the paper, \"Because the language model decoding process returns k different sequences describing k alternative auxiliary constructions, we perform a beam search over these k options, using the score of each beam as its value function. This set-up is highly parallelizable across beams, allowing substantial speed-up when there are parallel computational resources. In our experiments, we use a beam size of k = 512, the maximum number of iterations is 16 and the branching factor for each node, that is, the decoding batch size, is 32.\" But I don't totally understand how 512 and 16 translate into total number of constructions proposed. They also note that ablating beam size and max iterations seems to only somewhat degrade performance. Does this imply that the model is actually pretty good at putting helpful constructions near the top, and only for the hardest problems does it need to produce thousands? reply kingkongjaffa 15 hours agoparentthanks TIL what Beam search is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search reply refulgentis 14 hours agoparentprevIMHO: this bumps, hard, against limitations of language / human-machine analogies.

But that same single step, if you translate into a low-level DSL, could be dozens of different steps. For an example, check out this formalization of a solution to a non-geometry IMO problem: https://gist.github.com/mlyean/b4cc46cf6b0705c1226511a2b404d... Roughly the same solution is written here in human language: https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1972_IMO_Prob... It's not precisely clear what counts as a \"step\" but to me this seems like roughly 50 steps in the low-level formalized proof, and 5 steps in the human-language proof. So, my conclusion is just that I wouldn't necessarily say that a 150-step automated proof was inelegant. It can also be that the language used to express these proofs fills in more of the details. It's like the difference between counting lines of code in compiled code and a high-level language, counting the steps is really dependent on the level at which you express it. reply marojejian 16 hours agoprevAlphaGeometry paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5 reply treprinum 14 hours agoprevWhat happens to science when the most talented kids won't be able to compete in ~2 years tops?

Some human proofs of theorems also have a bit of this flavor of inscrutable lists of highly technical steps, especially the first time something is proven.

Subscribe Throughout the last few months, I’ve written about various tech “behind-the-scenes” in Big Tech, such as Meta's internal serverless platform and Google’s internally-loved code review tool. Apple, on the other hand, is not as public with their infrastructure. I wanted to find out how Apple built iCloud and in this article, I cover everything I know. Apple uses FoundationDB and Cassandra for iCloud and CloudKit, their cloud backend service. And yes, the title is not incorrect: Apple really does store billions of databases in their extreme multi-tenant architecture. Timeless Real-World Lessons Before reading, these are the applicable lessons and guidelines. I found that a lot of the lessons from the paper and from Apple track very closely to the lessons of Meta’s architecture of their serverless platform. Both use asynchronous processing smartly in order to make user functionalities smoother. Meta uses their serverless stack for non-user-facing functions. Apple uses async processing for almost all of the Record Layer’s functionalities (explained in-depth down below) in order to hide latency from the user. Both utilize stateless architecture liberally, knowing that they have intense scalability needs. Both isolate resources logically for reliability and availability. Both handle diverse ranges of needs simply. Apple mentions how it’s “tempting to provision and operate separate systems to store ‘small data’ and ‘big data.’” However, this increases operational complexity, and instead, they handle all types of data needs with one abstraction. Meta does the same with their serverless platform providing one abstraction for all kinds of function loads. Both build layers of abstractions in order to make the developer experience better. Application developers shouldn’t have to worry about scalability needs - that’s handled deeper down the stack by distributed system engineers. Know your user. Each layer, API, and design decision provided by Meta and Apple is guided by clear knowledge on who the user of the specific technology is, whether it be an application development team or an observability team. Cassandra Cassandra is a wide-column NoSQL database management system. It was originally developed at Facebook to power the Facebook inbox search feature. Interestingly, Meta themselves have replaced much of their Cassandra usage with ZippyDB instead. iCloud is partly powered by Cassandra. Apple runs one of the largest Cassandra deployments in the world, according to DataStax. They report: Over 300k instances/nodes Hundreds of petabytes of data (if not exabytes) Over 2 PB per cluster, with thousands of clusters Millions of queries per second Thousands of applications Source Other snippets of Cassandra in iCloud show that there are exabytes of data under management. There are multiple Cassandra nodes per server, and the teams at Apple are smart about blast radius and sharding. This makes sure iCloud data availability is near 100%. Cassandra is still actively improved upon at Apple. Scott Andreas of Apple gave a talk about the future of Cassandra last month. On Apple’s jobs page, they commonly mention Cassandra when hiring for distributed systems engineers. However, CloudKit + Cassandra ran into two scalability limitations, which led to their adoption of FoundationDB. Within a single zone, only one operation can happen at a time, even if different records are being edited. This can be problematic for apps where multiple users or devices need to work on shared data simultaneously. When updating multiple records simultaneously in an atomic operation, the updates are limited to a single Cassandra partition. These partitions have a maximum size they can handle, and as a partition's size increases, Cassandra tends to slow down. FoundationDB and the Record Layer solved both of these issues. FoundationDB Apple is much more public about FoundationDB. They acquired FoundationDB in 2015 and have since published various papers detailing their use of FoundationDB. FoundationDB is an open-source, distributed, transactional key-value store. It’s designed to handle large volumes of data and works well for both read/write workloads and write-heavy workloads. It’s also ACID-compliant. Apple uses the FoundationDB Record Layer extensively for CloudKit (Apple’s cloud backend service). Source: FoundationDB Record Layer: Open Source Structured Storage From their GitHub: The Record Layer is a Java API providing a record-oriented store on top of FoundationDB, (very) roughly equivalent to a simple relational database, featuring: Structured types - Records are defined and stored in terms of protobuf (Protocol Buffer) messages. Protocol Buffers were first designed by Google. Indexes - The Record Layer supports a variety of different index types including value indexes (the kind provided by most databases), rank indexes, and aggregate indexes. Indexes and primary keys can be defined either via protobuf options or programmatically. Complex types - Support for complex types, such as lists and nested records, including the ability to define indexes against such nested structures. Queries - The Record Layer does not provide a query language, however it provides query APIs with the ability to scan, filter, and sort across one or more record types, and a query planner capable of automatic selection of indexes. Many record stores, shared schema - The Record Layer provides the ability to support many discrete record store instances, all with a shared (and evolving) schema. For example, rather than modeling a single database in which to store all users' data, each user can be given their own record store, perhaps sharded across different FDB cluster instances. Very light weight - The Record layer is designed to be used in a large, distributed, stateless environment. The time between opening a store and the first query is intended to be measured in milliseconds. Extensible - New index types and custom index key expressions may be dynamically incorporated into a record store. From the FoundationDB Record Layer paper, they write: “[FoundationDB Record Layer is used] to provide powerful abstractions to applications serving hundreds of millions of users. CloudKit uses the Record Layer to host billions of independent databases, many with a common schema.” Why is the FoundationDB Record Layer used? The structure of FoundationDB, Record Layer, and CloudKit looks like this: Source: FoundationDB Record Layer: Open Source Structured Storage FoundationDB does all the distributed systems and concurrency control work. The Record Layer serves as a relational database to make FoundationDB easier to work with. CloudKit is the highest layer on top and provides features and APIs for application developers. CloudKit isn’t the only thing built on top of the Record Layer, but there are also other layers on top built internally for things that need structured storage, like a JSON document store. The Record Layer allows Apple to support multi-tenancy at scale. Actually, that’s somewhat underselling it. The Record Layer is used for extreme multi-tenancy, where each user of each application gets independent record stores. This means the Record Layer hosts billions of independent databases sharing thousands of schemata. That’s better! And much, much more impressive. Source: FoundationDB Record Layer: Open Source Structured Storage The Record Layer is engineered to handle multi-tenancy at such a large scale thanks to two fundamental architectural decisions. The layer operates statelessly allowing for effortless scaling of the compute resources by simply adding more of these stateless instances. This stateless architecture simplifies the task for load balancers and routers since they only need to focus on the location of the data rather than the capabilities of the compute servers. Additionally, stateless servers have a reduced set of resources to distribute amongst clients. The layer uses record store abstraction to manage resource allocation and scalability effectively. This abstraction represents the entirety of a logical database, comprising serialized data, indexes, and the operational state. Each record store is allocated a specific key range, which guarantees logical separation of data for different tenants. Transferring a tenant's data, if necessary, becomes a straightforward process of relocating the assigned key range to a new cluster, as all the information required to manage and use the record store is contained within this range. This is a good stopping point for a cursory glance of how Apple built iCloud. For those who are interested in the technical aspects of CloudKit, FoundationDB, and Record Layer, read on. I write about real-world software engineering. If you enjoyed this overview and want to see more, please subscribe! Subscribe How CloudKit uses FoundationDB and Record Layer Source: FoundationDB Record Layer: A Multi-Tenant Structured Datastore In CloudKit, an application is represented by a 'logical container' which follows a defined schema. This schema outlines the necessary record types, fields, and indexes to enable efficient data retrieval and queries. Applications organize their data into 'zones' within CloudKit, which allows for grouping records logically for selective synchronization with client devices. For each user, CloudKit designates a unique subspace in FoundationDB. Within this subspace, it creates a record store for each application a user interacts with. In essence, CloudKit manages a massive number of logical databases—multiplying the number of users by the number of applications—each containing its own set of records, indexes, and metadata, amounting to billions of databases. When CloudKit receives a request from a client device, it directs this request to an available CloudKit Service process via load balancing. This process then interacts with the specific Record Layer record store to fulfill the request. CloudKit converts the defined application schema into a metadata definition within the Record Layer, which is stored in a separate metadata store. This metadata is augmented by CloudKit-specific system fields that track the record's creation, modification times, and the zone where the record is stored. Zone names are prefixed to primary keys to enable efficient access to records within each zone. Alongside indexes defined by the user, CloudKit also manages 'system indexes' for internal purposes like managing storage quotas by keeping an index that tracks the size of records by their type. FoundationDB and the Record Layer together solve 4 key problems for Apple that either Cassandra alone or FoundationDB alone could not. Problem Solved: Personalized full-text search FoundationDB helps solve personalized full-text search for users to quickly access their data. Their system utilizes FoundationDB's key order to allow for quick searches on text beginnings (prefix matching) and also for more complex searches (like finding words that are close together or in a specific order - proximity and phrase search) without no extra overhead. In traditional search systems, you often need extra processes running in the background to keep the search index up to date, but Apple’s system does everything in real-time, which means as soon as data changes, the search index is updated instantly—no extra steps needed. Problem solved: High-concurrency zones With FoundationDB, CloudKit handles many updates happening simultaneously in a smooth way. Previously, with Cassandra, CloudKit used to rely on a special index that kept track of changes in each zone to synchronize data across devices. When a device needed to update its data, it would check this index to see what's new. But this system had a drawback: it could cause conflicts when multiple updates happened at the same time. But with FoundationDB, CloudKit uses a special kind of index that keeps track of the exact sequence of each change without causing conflicts. This is done by assigning a unique 'version' to every change, and when CloudKit needs to sync, it looks at these versions to figure out what updates a device has missed. However, when CloudKit needs to move data across different storage clusters—perhaps to distribute the load more evenly—things get tricky because each cluster has its own version numbers that don't match up. To solve this, CloudKit gives each user's data a 'move count' (called the “incarnation”), which increases every time their data is transferred to a new cluster. Each record update includes the user's current “incarnation” number, ensuring that even after a move, CloudKit can still figure out the correct order of updates by looking at both the incarnation and version numbers. When they switched to this new system, CloudKit faced the challenge of dealing with old data that didn't have these version numbers. They cleverly overcame this by using a special function that sorts old updates using the previous system before the new ones. This meant no complicated changes to the app or leaving behind outdated code. This function took into account the incarnation, version, and the old update-counter values to maintain the correct order of records. Problem solved: High latency queries FoundationDB is designed for high-concurrency, not low latency. This means it can handle a lot of tasks at the same time rather than focus on the speed of individual tasks. Source: FoundationDB Record Layer: Open Source Structured Storage To make the most of this design, the Record Layer does a lot of its work 'asynchronously'— it queues up tasks to be completed in the future, allowing for other work to be done in the meantime. This approach helps to cover up any delays that might occur during these tasks. However, the tool that FoundationDB uses to communicate with its database is designed to do one thing at a time using a single thread for networking. In earlier versions, this setup caused a traffic jam in the system because everything was waiting for its turn in this network thread. The Record Layer had been using this single-threaded approach, which led to a bottleneck. To improve this, Apple reduced the workload on this network thread. Now, complex tasks seem faster because the system is working with the database on several fronts at the same time, rather than forming a queue. This way, the latency, or the apparent slowness, is hidden because the system doesn't wait for one task to finish before starting another. Problem solved: Conflicting transactions In FoundationDB, if one transaction is reading certain keys and another transaction modifies those same keys at the same time, it causes a 'transaction conflict'. FoundationDB allows precise management of these conflicts by providing control over the sets of keys that can cause these conflicts when read or written to. A common method to avoid unnecessary conflicts is to perform a special kind of read that doesn't cause conflicts, known as a 'snapshot' read, on a range of keys. If this read finds important keys, the transaction will only flag those specific keys for potential conflict, rather than the entire range. This ensures the transaction is only affected by changes that actually matter to its outcome. The Record Layer uses this strategy to efficiently manage a structure known as a skip list, which is part of its ranking index system. However, manually setting these conflict ranges can be tricky and can lead to bugs that are difficult to identify, especially when they're mixed in with the main logic of the application. Therefore, it's recommended that systems built on top of FoundationDB create higher-level tools, like custom indexes, to handle these patterns. This approach helps to avoid leaving the responsibility to relax conflict rules up to each client application, which could lead to mistakes and inconsistencies. Thanks for reading!

Fundamentally they do the same thing, and are sort of just optimizations for particular problem-sets. A database is great for data that has proper indexes, a file system is great for much more arbitrary data [1]. If you’re a clever enough engineer, you can define a file system in terms of a database, as evidenced by iCloud. Personally, I have used this knowledge to use Cassandra to store blobs of video for HLS streams. This buys me a lot of Cassandra’s distributed niceties, at the cost of having to sort of reinvent some file system stuff. [1] I realize that this is very simplified; I am just speaking extremely high level. reply gumby 17 hours agoparent> there’s not really a difference between a database and a file system. Fundamentally they do the same thing, and are sort of just optimizations for particular problem-sets. Conceptually that is quite true, though the domain dependencies make a lot of the code end up looking quite different. But the first true database (pre-relational!) was developed for SABRE, American Airlines' computerized reservation system, in the early 1960s. Before that tickets were issued manually and the physical structure of the desks and filing systems used to make reservations reflected the need! Unfortunately I can't find the paper I read (back in the mid 80s) on the SABRE database but I remember that record size (which is still used today!) was chosen based on the rotational speed of the disk and seek latency. Certainly there was no filesystem (the concept of filesystem barely existed, though Multics developed a hierarchical filesystem (intended to be quite database-like, as it happens) around the same time. The data base directly manipulated the disk. I don't know when that changed -- perhaps in the 1970s? Like I said I can't quickly find the paper on the topic, but here's a nontechnical discussion with some cool pictures: https://www.sabre.com/files/Sabre-History.pdf. A search for \"American Airlines SABRE database history\" finds some interesting articles and a couple of good Wikipedia pages. reply oneplane 16 hours agorootparentI think direct manipulation never went away, but the abstractions that were provided for general use were too useful to pass up for most workloads. Some kinds of storage like cloud-scale object storage use custom HDD firmwares and custom on-disk formats instead of filesystems (±2005-era tech), we also have much newer solutions that do direct work on disks like HMR (not to be confused with HAMR or HAMMER2) where the host manages the recording of data on the disk. There are some generally available systems for that, but we also have articles like this: https://blog.westerndigital.com/host-managed-smr-dropbox/ (Which mostly focuses on SMR but this works on CMR too). As for the record size in the DB vs. Disk attributes, that's probably not used like that anymore, but I do know that filesystem chunks/extents/blocks are calculated and grouped to profit from optimal LBA access. If you run ZFS and have it auto-detect or manually set the ashift size to make it match the actual on-disk sector size. This was especially relevant when 512e and 4Kn (and the various manufactures 'real' and 'soft' implementations) weren't reliable indicators of the best sector access size strategies. reply kevin_nisbet 14 hours agorootparentI could be wrong, but I sort of think when I learned Oracle back when I was in school (mid-2000s) supported dropping a database on a raw block device. So it's been around a long time, but would be uncommon in some tech circles. reply HillRat 13 hours agorootparentYeah, until the mid '00s you would run your db directly to raw disk devices, both in order to optimize the use of larger contiguous disk regions (disk drives were slow in those days!) and, crucially, because if/when your server went down hard any pending OS-buffered writes would result in a corrupted database, lost data, and lengthy rebuilds from logs (generally after having to do a long fsck recovery just to get back into the OS). It wasn't until journaled filesystems became common and battle-tested that you saw databases living in the filesystem proper. reply ChuckMcM 16 hours agorootparentprevGood old ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) before DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) took over. (Aren't you glad IBM didn't win the \"name the things\" contest? :-)) I'm going to guess that by \"domain dependency\" you're talking about how handle = open(\"foo.txt\"); Looks semantically different than err = db->exec(\"SELECT * from DIRECTORY where NAME = 'foo.txt';\", &result); So yes in that regard they certainly \"feel\" different, although at some point I needed a file system for an application than built a wrapper layer for sqlite that basically gave you open/read/write/delete calls and it just filled in all the other stuff to convert specialized filesystem calls into general purpose database calls.[1] The best thing you can say about the way UNIX decided to handle files was that it forced people to either use them as is or make up their own scheme within a file itself (and don't get me started on the hell that is 'holey' files) [1] In my case the underlying data storage was a NAND flash chip so the result you got back which was nominally a FILE* like stdio had the direct address on flash of where the bits were. read-modify-write operations were slow since it effectively copied the file for that (preserving flash sector write lifetimes) reply rbanffy 15 hours agorootparentFunny enough, DASD is now, for the first time, more accurate than \"disk\". But yes. Talking to mainframe people is a bit like talking to astronauts, in that their jargon is completely impenetrable to the uninitiated. reply jasomill 5 hours agorootparentIn addition to disks, IBM direct-access storage options available in the middle sixties included a variety of magnetic drum devices and the short-lived, tape-based Data Cell Drive[1]. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_2321_Data_Cell reply rbanffy 15 hours agorootparentprevI love that Amdahl mainframe (page 6) with that humongous 20\" CRT console. Most likely showing a 24x80 3270 console session, with 8x16 character cells (if that much), but, still, quite awesome. I'm not aware of any that ended up in a museum, sadly. For those with sufficiently cool IEEE memberships, there is quite a lot about Sabre in the Annals of the History of Computing magazine archives. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/397059 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1114868 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/279229, which is not about Sabre, but Air Canada's system.

Even \"has proper indexes\" is not something we'd agree on. In my case, for example, I am extremely happy with the fact that my indexes are computed in my app code, in my language, and that I am not restricted to some arbitrary concept of database-determined \"indexable fields\" and \"indexable types\". Then there are correct transactions, versionstamps (for both keys and values), streaming large amounts of data, all of that in a distributed database, it's really nothing like a filesystem. reply toolz 15 hours agorootparentI'm interested in having you expand on these thoughts, so I'll play devils advocate here. I personally don't have strong opinions on the subject. > has proper indexes Does it matter where in the code the index lives? Are you arguing that databases don't have proper indexes or that filesystems don't? I'm not sure I'd agree with either argument. > correct transactions filesystems and databases have transactions, which one is \"incorrect\"? > versionstamps (for both keys and values) filesystems have timestamps, not sure what a versionstamp is but I suspect it's some domain specific name for a more general concept that both databases and filesystems utilize. > streaming large amounts of data many databases stream massive data and filesystems certainly do > all of that in a distributed database every major PaaS has some form of distributed filesystem reply drewbug01 12 hours agorootparentVersionstamps are not a simple timestamp; it’s a cluster-wide order-able unique id. https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/data-modeling.html#vers... reply toolz 11 hours agorootparentHow do they differ from vector clocks? Just a different implementation of the same thing maybe? Either way, distributed filesystems definitely have the same general concept. reply azurelake 10 hours agorootparentVector clocks give a partial ordering. FDB version stamps give a total ordering by having a single process issue them for the entire cluster. There's a good breakdown here: https://blog.the-pans.com/notes-on-the-foundationdb-paper/ reply timc3 13 hours agorootparentprevI suggest you write a file system, then write a database and then re-evaluate whether you still think the same way. reply mike_hearn 17 hours agoparentprevYou don't really need to be a clever engineer, there are pre-made implementations out there for you. For example if you have an Oracle DB, then it has a feature called DBFS that does this already: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/2... You can instantiate a POSIX compatible FS using database tables, and then mount them using FUSE. From there you can export it via NFS if you wish. You can also export the FS via WebDAV and thus mount it over the network using the WebDAV support built in to Windows or macOS. If you want to work with the FS transactionally, you have to do that using PL/SQL. POSIX doesn't define APIs for FS transactions, so some other approach is needed. Because it's stored in the DB you can use all the other features of the RDBMS too like clustering, replication, encryption, compression and if need be, you can maintain indexes over the file content. reply divyenduz 1 hour agorootparentPlug, wrote something along these lines. It is a FUSE file system and the storage is SQLite https://github.com/divyenduz/zoid-fs reply tombert 17 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely, I was referring to the cleverness of the engineers that actually made those implementations. Making a FUSE file system is sort of a bucket list thing I haven’t gotten around to doing yet. Maybe I should hack something together while I am still unemployed… reply hansoolo 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks for that one. I just started a new job, where they use only Oracle DBs and that could be useful. reply j33zusjuice 15 hours agorootparentI’m so sorry. reply mannyv 16 hours agoparentprev\"there’s not really a difference between a database and a file system\" The BeOS filesystem was basically a database. But there are a lot of differences between a database and a file system. A better way of thinking about it is that a filesystem is just a specialized database. From an old school, a data base is really just a collection of data. An RDBMS = relational database. A filesystem is just another kind of database. etc etc. reply mike_hearn 13 hours agorootparentBeFS wasn't really a database as we'd normally understand it. It had no transactions, for one. It only understood string and numbers as datatypes as well. It had what was basically a normal UNIX filing system, complete with /dev, /etc and so on, and it had support for indexing extended attributes. Your app was expected to create an index with a specific API at install time, and then after that writes to the indexed xattr would update a special \"index directory\". The OS could be given a simple query predicate with range and glob matching, and it would answer using the indexes, including a live query. This was neat, but you could implement the same feature in Linux pretty easily. Nobody ever has, probably because xattrs historically didn't work that well. They don't get transmitted via common network protocols and have a history of getting lost when archiving, although I think these days every archive format in real use supports storing them. There's also the question of how it interacts with POSIX file permissions. BeOS was an aggressively single user system so just didn't care. On Linux you'd need to think about how files that you can't read are treated in the indexing process. Multiple devices also poses problems. BeOS simply required that apps create an index on a specific device themselves. If you plugged in a USB drive then files there just wouldn't show up in search unless the files had been created by not only BeOS, but an app you had previously installed. Note that installing an app post-hoc didn't work because creating an index didn't populate it with existing files, even if they had the right xattrs. And of course it only worked with files. If you had content where the user's conception of a thing didn't map 1:1 to files, it was useless. For example you couldn't index elements within a document this way. Spotlight can index app states and screens, which also obviously BeOS couldn't do. So there were a lot of limitations to this. The modern equivalent would be writing a search plugin: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corespotlight/maki...

But filesystems officially came after databases, as early databases were designed to make best use of hardware and storage devices to store and retrieve data efficiently, making it easier and faster for computers of the time to use the data. So databases were, effectively, the first filesystems. But the distinction is pretty small. Both filesystems and databases are just wrappers around a data model. The former is primarily concerned with organizing data on a disk (with respect to space, speed, location and integrity), and the latter is primarily concerned with organizing and querying data (with respect to ease-of-use, speed and integrity). People today seem to think relational databases were the first and only databases. But there many types of database: flat, hierarchical, dimensional, network, relational, entity–relationship, graph, object-oriented, object-relational, object-role, star, entity–attribute–value, navigational, document, time-series, semantic, and more. The earliest filesystem, CP/M filesystem, was basically a flat database. Successive filesystems have taken on other data models, such as hierarchical, network and navigational. Since filesystems are used as a low-level interface to raw data, they didn't need more advanced data models or forms of query. On the other hand, IBM DB2, Hadoop, and Google File System are all forms of database filesystems, combining elements of both databases and filesystems. reply dboreham 15 hours agorootparentQuick note that CP/M isn't even close to the \"earliest filesystem\". reply jerf 14 hours agoparentprev\"there’s not really a difference between a database and a file system.\" It depends on how abstracted you're getting. I sometimes talk about the 30,000 foot view, but in this case, I might stretch the metaphor to say that from Low Earth Orbit, there is indeed not much difference between a database and a file system. In fact, there's not much difference between those things and some function calls. You put some parameters out, you get some stuff back. From just slightly higher one realizes or remembers, it's all just numbers. You put some numbers into the system and get some other numbers out. Everything is built out of that. You can build a database out of functions, a file system out of a database, functions out of a file system (albeit one beyond a blob store, think /proc or FUSE rather than ext2), you can mix network streams into any of these, anything you like. And while it's helpful to be aware of that, at the same time, you are quite into architecture astronautics at that point and you are running low on metaphorical oxygen, and while the odd insight generated from this viewpoint might help here or there, if one wishes to actually build iCloud, one is going to have to come a great deal closer to Earth or one is going to fail. Still, in the end, it's all just numbers in response to other numbers and the labels we humans put on exactly how the numbers are provided in response to other numbers are still the map and not the territory, even in the world of programming where arguably the map and the territory are as close as they can possibly be and still be in reality. reply blago 10 hours agorootparentOne can probably say that there exists a level of abstraction where there’s not really a difference between a database and a file system.

There was a nice video about how it is really hard to implement file systems because disks just don’t do what you expect. Databases are a layer up and assume that they can at least write a blob somewhere and retrieve it with certain guarantees. Those guarantees are a thousand hacks in the file system implementation. reply jandrewrogers 13 hours agorootparentMost non-trivial databases run on what is essentially their own purpose-built file system, bypassing many (or all) of the OS file services. Doing so is both higher performance and simpler than just going through the OS file system. Normal OS file systems are messy and complex because they are serving several unrelated and conflicting purposes simultaneously. A database file system has a fairly singular purpose and focused mission, and also doesn't have the massive legacy baggage of general purpose file systems, so there are fewer tradeoffs and edge cases to deal with. The more sophisticated the database kernel, the more the OS is treated like little more than a device driver. reply aeyes 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat database are we talking about?

I still remember the hype from back then, in my opinion totally justified, too bad that things didn't come to be. I legit think that that project could have changed the face of computing as we know it today. reply mike_hearn 17 hours agorootparentThey tried to adapt SQL Server iirc but it wasn't the right approach for a desktop OS. The issue with the filesystem-as-database concept is that unless you're doing it as a serverside thing to get RDBMS features for files, it doesn't give you much more power without very serious changes to applications. The first problem is that databases are most useful when they index things, but files are just binary blobs in arbitrary formats. To index the contents you have to figure out what they are and parse them to derive interesting data. This is not best done by the filesystem itself though - you want it to be asynchronous, running in userspace and (these days) ideally sandboxed. This is expensive and so you don't want to do it on the critical file write path. Nowadays there are tools like Spotlight that do it this way and are useful enough. If you don't do that then when it comes time to sell your shiny fs-as-a-db feature for upgrade dollars, you have to admit that your db doesn't actually index anything because no apps are changed to use it. Making them do so requires rewriting big parts from scratch. In that era I think the Office format was still essentially just memory dumps of internal data structures, done for efficiency, so making Office store documents as native database tables would have been a huge project and not yielded much benefit over simple text indexing using asynchronous plugins to a userspace search service. Another problem is that databases aren't always great at indexing into the middle of blobs and changing them. Sometimes db engines want to copy values if you change them, because they're optimised for lots of tiny values (row column values) and not small numbers of huge values. But apps often want to write into the middle of files or append to them. Yet another problem is that apps are very sensitive to filesystem performance (that's why the fs runs in the kernel to begin with). But databases do more work, so can be slower, which would make everything feel laggy. So yeah it was a beautiful vision but it didn't work out. Note that operating systems started with databases as their native data storage mechanism in the mainframe era, and that was moved away from, because there are lots of things you want to store that aren't naturally database-y (images, videos, audio, source code etc). reply bombcar 17 hours agorootparentEven now we see many cases where \"files are stored in the database\" eventually migrates to \"we store files on the filesystem and pointers to them in the database\". I know at least a few projects that have done that migration at some point. reply vel0city 14 hours agorootparentSome databases even ship with this out of the box. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/b... reply edgyquant 17 hours agorootparentprevSo basically there is a difference between a DB and an FS reply randomdata 14 hours agorootparentNo. The takeaway is basically that there is no reason for Windows to use a relational database for storing information about files when a hierarchal database does it better for the vast majority of use cases its users encounter. It is, perhaps, possible another product with a different set of users with different needs could still find value in a relational filesystem, but Microsoft was unable to find that fit. reply orand 15 hours agorootparentprevIn theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. reply wayfinder 16 hours agoparentprevAnd you start on the journey when you first learn about hash maps or binary trees. reply kennethrc 17 hours agoparentprevThat was the idea behind the (ill-fated) ReiserFS, IIRC? reply mike_hearn 17 hours agorootparentReiser argued that if you optimised a filesystem for very tiny files, then many cases where apps invent their own ad-hoc file-systems-in-a-file could be eliminated and apps would become easier to read/write and more composable. For example, instead of an OpenOffice document being a zip of XMLs, you'd just use a directory of XMLs, and then replace the XMLs with directories of tiny files for the attributes and node contents. Instead of a daemon having a config file, you'd just have a directory of tiny files. He claimed that apps weren't written that way already because filesystems were wasteful when files got too tiny. Git is an example of a program that uses this technique, to some extent at least (modulo packfiles). In reality, although that may have contributed, there are other reasons why people bundle data up into individual files. To disaggregate things (which is a good place to start if you want a filesystem-db merge) you also have to solve all those other reasons, which ReiserFS never did and as a project that \"only\" wanted to reinvent the FS, could not have solved. Apple hit some of those issues when they tried making iLife documents be NeXT bundles: 1. Filesystem explorers treat files and directories differently for UI purposes. Apple solved it nicely by teaching the Finder to show bundle directories as if they were files unless you right click and select \"Show contents\". Or rather partly solved ... until you send data to friends using Windows, or Google Drive, or anything other than the Finder. 2. Network protocols like HTTP and MIME only understand files, not directories. In particular there is no standardised serialisation format for a directory beyond zip. Not solved. iLife migrated from bundles to a custom file format partly due to this problem, I think. 3. Operating systems provide much richer APIs for files than directories. You can monitor a file for changes, but if you want to monitor a directory tree, you have to iterate and do it yourself. You can lock a file against changes, but not a directory tree. You can check if a file has been modified by looking at its mtime, but there's no recursive mtime for directory trees. You can update files transactionally by writing to a temporary file and renaming, but you can't atomically replace a directory tree. Etc. So the ReiserFS concept wasn't fully fleshed out, even if it had been accepted into the kernel. Our foundational APIs and protocols just aren't geared up for it. I've sometimes thought it'd be a neat retirement project one day to build an OS where files and directories are more closely merged as a concept, so files can have sub-files that you can browse into using 'cd' and so on, and those API/protocol gaps are closed. It wouldn't give you a full relational database but it'd be much more feasible to port apps to such an OS than to rewrite everything to use classical database APIs and semantics reply zer00eyz 15 hours agorootparent>>> 2. Network protocols like HTTP and MIME only understand files Love when someone says something that makes my brain work! For the most part you're spot on. HTTP has multipart messages that in theory could be extended to be composite of anything. So we could have those bundles! Oddly we can send to the server with a multipart message (forms)!! I think that MIME is an interesting slice the OTHER way. You could store versions of the same document in a directory so HTML and JSON and XML OR a video or image in two formats and serve them up based on the MIME request. Now if we could make one of those a multi part message... reply mike_hearn 13 hours agorootparentThe problem is the case where you want to upload or attach >1 document that's actually a directory. You need a way to signal that the first 3 files are a part of document A, and the next 5 are part of document B, and although you could invent a file name convention to express this nothing understands it. Email clients would show 7 attachments, web server APIs would show 7 files, browsers would need to be patched to let you select bundles in the file picker and then recursively upload them, how progress tracking works would need to change, etc. And then how do you _download_ them? Browsers don't understand MIME at download time. None of it is hard to solve. But, nobody ever did, and the value of doing things this new way is usually going to be lower than the value of smooth interop with everyone's different browser/OS/email/server combos. reply api 15 hours agoparentprevAFAIK theoretically any database can be built on top of a key value store, and any transactional database on top of a key value store that also has transactions.

If you care about Time Machine back ups you probably want your whole filesystem with point-in-time restores. That's a lot more data for Apple to hang onto, for a small segment of its target market. Of course, Apple does have 2TB+ iCloud+ plans, but I would bet that the average iCloud+ subscriber is using nowhere near their limit. reply Snow_Falls 17 hours agorootparentBut apple charges for storage space?

Unless I take up a photography hobby it'll be a long time until I get close to that 2TB, and I'd wager this is what Apple expects.

Syncing apps and preferences shouldn't be that difficult, but unless they're App Store applications the binaries would take up a lot of space. Most of the apps I care about are from outside of the App Store. AFAIK our iOS backups don't actually back up application binaries. The way I was looking at it is that Apple has successfully sold iCloud+ 2TB plans to a lot of people who don't need much more than 200GB. If everyone on the 2TB plan used even close to 2TB, I'd bet they'd have to charge me a lot more to make up the provisioning and usage costs of storage. reply hot_gril 16 hours agorootparentWonder if there are economies of scale storing multiple users' backups that may partially contain a lot of the same data.

Compared to the \"anywhere you have permission to `open()` on disk\" approach on macOS, iOS developers don't have as many options for where/how to store data. This probably makes backup / restore an order of magnitude simpler / reliable. reply rollcat 16 hours agorootparentprevAt one org, we went for the highest-tier Google Drive plan (with unlimited storage), because we've had this 1% of our internal users who would really, really benefit from having it. We could only go all or nothing (and the lower tier would meet the needs of the 99%), but the cost-benefit of enabling it for everyone was still pretty good. I suppose Apple is keeping track of these numbers as well (keep in mind they know exactly how much storage each Mac has - because you can't expand it). I am also hoping it's under intensive internal testing; the quality of their software has been going downhill for a while, no power user would ever care if they shipped another broken product. reply lelandfe 16 hours agorootparent> you can't expand it They’ve brought back SD slots in recent years: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102352 reply arrowleaf 16 hours agorootparentEven better, external NVMe SSD enclosures over Thunderbolt 3 can reliably read at 2500 Mbps and write at over 1500 Mbps.

This is the architecture that inevitably results from when you start with boxed, native, desktop software and incrementally move towards cloud based storage and collaboration. You have to be really good at doing schema changes and version migrations, because they're happening at fantastic scale without administrator intervention: not when you launch, but when each individual customer chooses to use the next version. Quite different from a SaaS-first approach where it actually makes sense to do \"customer id column\"-based multi-tenancy and one-migration-at-a-time schema changes that I think most of us at less-than-Apple scales are familiar with. reply meowtimemania 12 hours agoparentIs there any writing about these types of schema changes? It's something I run into using dynamodb. reply AtlasBarfed 5 hours agorootparentAt least with Cassandra, there are cell-level timestamps which are very useful for doing data migrations while active writes are still incoming. You can simply mirror the writes to both systems, and then migrate the old data underneath. As long as the data transfer preserves the cell level timestamps, the read path resolves any differences and compaction will eventually clean up any duplicates. (and sstable loads will have the timestamps) Dynamodb does NOT have cell level timestamps, I believe they have row level timestamps. How it is doing globally replicated data and mutation merges: I have no idea.

For example, if you use avro/protobuf, the decoder will handle it for you. If that's not the case, you would have to implement the migration by yourself. There is a paper[1] on this subject called \"Online, asynchronous schema change in F1\", which explains how to implement it. 1: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/2536222.2536230 reply zaking17 9 hours agorootparentthanks, i'm really enjoying that paper reply yosito 11 hours agoprevGreat! If only I could manage which of my files stay local, and which get offloaded to iCloud I might be impressed.

Personally, I've found it much easier to use than an SQL DB for web apps I've made, but I've heard others who've always used SQL say they were frustrated with it. reply randomdata 14 hours agoparentThe thing with SQL databases is that the API they offer is designed for low-latency operation. This is not a big deal (ideal, even!) when the application and database share the same memory space where latency is imperceptible. And when it was originally designed, that was the norm, but at some point someone got the idea that they could expose the same API over the network. The network where latency is higher. That is where things start to fall apart. It is nothing you cannot overcome with the right hacks (what can't be overcome with the right hacks?), but it is frustrating that the network-based API wasn't designed for high latency use from the start. It didn't need to use the exact same API that was designed for a low-latency environment, but that's what we got. As SQL and web apps typically means MySQL or Postgres, that means you are apt to encounter the API design problems. Granted, it seems there is renewed interest in SQLite to move the SQL database back to the way it was designed to be used. Which isn't surprising as all things in computing come and go in cycles. Once we round out that cycle and get back to \"database on the network\", maybe we can get a more well designed API meant for high latency to remove those frustrations. reply kjkjadksj 13 hours agoprevIf only large downloads from Apple like iCloud pulls didn’t time out and you weren’t trapped in these databases as a result reply ultra-jeremyx 16 hours agoprevThis sounds a lot like AWS Aurora, which (I'm simplifying here) is a database interface on top of a distributed file store, (S3). reply jahewson 14 hours agoparentI assume you mean AWS Athena - but no this is quite different from FoundationDB.

    "originBody": "Hacking into a Toyota/Eicher Motors insurance company by exploiting their premium calculator website Eaton • Jan 17, 2024 Copy Link Key Points / Summary An Eicher Motors premium calculator website on a Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India subdomain exposed Microsoft corporate cloud credentials. The email sending API returned sending logs to the client, which contained the email account’s password. The password could be used to log into the “noreplyeicher@ttibi.co.in” Microsoft email account. No two-factor authentication was enabled on the account. The email account had a record of everything they have ever sent to their customers, which is: 657k emails (~25 GB) containing things like customer information, insurance policy PDFs, password reset links, OTPs, and much more. Other Microsoft cloud resources were also accessible, including but not limited to the corporate directory, SharePoint, and Teams. Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India took down the vulnerable API more than 2 months later after my report, but still have not changed the email account’s password. New year, new automaker industry hack! As part of my automaker research projects last summer, Eicher Motors made its way up my list to investigate. In my efforts to find interesting exploits on Eicher Motors systems, I accidentally ended up compromising a different company in the process: Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India (“TTIBI”). A perfect storm of multiple issues culminated in me gaining control over the “noreplyeicher@ttibi.co.in” Microsoft email account, which not only had a record of everything they have ever sent to their customers, but also provided a foothold into their Microsoft cloud. Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India and Eicher Motors Everyone knows Toyota, but not everyone knows about Toyota Tsusho Insurance Broker India (“TTIBI”). Toyota is comprised of a vast network of different companies. TTIBI is under the Toyota Tsusho Insurance Management Corporation in Japan. TTIBI was established in 2008 and is “a leading Insurance Broker across India“. Eicher Motors is one of India’s leading automakers. They manufacture motorcycles under Royal Enfield Motors and commercial vehicles under VE Commercial Vehicles (VECV), which is a joint venture with Volvo Group. Both companies have some type of insurance partnership because there is a dedicated Eicher subdomain on the TTIBI site. The Premium Calculator While analyzing the MY EICHER Android app, I came across an inconspicuous URL inside an API interface Java class that was a link to a premium calculator: Visiting the link in a browser revealed it: Looking at the source code of the website (literally right-click, view source), I quickly found some very interesting code: This caught my eye because this was a client-side email sending mechanism. If it worked, I could send a email with any subject & body to anyone, and it would come from a genuine Eicher email address. However, seeing the Bearer Authorization put a damper on my excitement because it was clear you needed to be logged in somehow to use this API. Despite that, I decided to try crafting the API request to see what would happen. I was expecting it to come back with “401 – Unauthorized”, but what actually came back surprised me. Not only did the email successfully send, It came back with a server error that revealed an email sending log: If you look closely, you can find the base64 encoded password. Being able to abuse this send email function was serious enough, but the leak of the email account password elevated this to a new level of severity. The email account This isn’t just any email account – it’s a noreply email account. noreply accounts are generally used for sending automated emails to customers. For example, when you reset a password, the link is likely to come from a noreply account. In many cases it can just be an alias on SendGrid, Postmark, etc, but it can also be an actual account that you can log in to. The noreply account could be the most important account in an organization because it could potentially have a record of everything they have ever sent to customers. In TTIBI’s case, that is exactly what it is and the amount of information revealed is enormous: Exploring the impact The email account is jam packed with personal/private information. To start, you can see all the insurance policies sent to customers – here’s a few examples from different insurance companies: You could also view one-time-passwords (OTPs) and password reset links. With this, you could easily take over someone’s insurance account. And you could of course access resources on their Microsoft cloud, such as the corporate directory, SharePoint, and Teams: A perfect storm of security issues The vulnerability was so severe because it was enabled by 5 unfortunate security issues/oversights. Developers and IT administrators should take note of all of these and make sure similar issues do not exist in your organization. Issue #1: Client-side sending email mechanism Don’t create an email sending function that the client has control over. Someone malicious can abuse it to send bad emails from your genuine account, leading to email reputation loss and phishing. Issue #2: Missing API authentication It looks like the frontend developer knew the email sending API should have been authenticated, but the backend developer missed the memo. If the server had actually checked the token, it might have entirely stopped this exploit. Issue #3: Leaky API response If something goes wrong when processing an API request, don’t give too much information back to the client. In this case a password managed to leak out, which is one of the worst things that could happen. Issue #4: No two-factor authentication Logging into the Microsoft account was surprisingly easy. There was no two-factor authentication set up or any other login verification prompts. If there was, it probably would not have been possible for me to successfully login. Issue #5: Email retention The final issue is that all emails the account had ever sent/received were retained, making it easy to access substantial amounts of customer information. Retention policies vary by industry, but this is a great example where having a policy in place could have softened the customer data exposure impact. Password remains unchanged More than 5 months later, TTIBI still have not changed the password of the email account despite being aware of the vulnerability. I checked it again today and I am still able to log in (proof). If I were them, I would not want a random stranger having access to their corporate cloud for 5 months. This is very disappointing, and I hope they improve their security posture so their customers’ data doesn’t leak out. As an aside, I’m a little surprised that they weren’t alerted by Microsoft in some way to the unusual login. Or maybe they were, and the alert was ignored or not seen. Timeline TTIBI is not covered under Toyota’s HackerOne vulnerability disclosure program, which is a shame because the team behind that has been quick to resolve several issues I have reported to them in the past. I reported the issue to India’s CERT-In instead. August 7, 2023: I send a comprehensive email to CERT-In to report the vulnerability. August 8, 2023: Response received from CERT-In. A case ID was issued, and they stated they will reach out to TTIBI. September 1, 2023: I ask for an update. September 6, 2023: Response received confirming they reported the vulnerability to TTIBI and will share further updates as they receive them. October 8, 2023: I noticed the affected website was taken offline. However, the vulnerable API was not. I inform CERT-In. October 11, 2023: Response received confirming TTIBI has fixed the vulnerability. I check this and confirm the vulnerability is not fixed. October 18, 2023: I noticed the vulnerability is now fixed – the email sending API now requires authentication. I ask CERT-In if TTIBI can offer a bug bounty reward. Everything after October 18 is a back-and-forth between CERT-In and me trying to determine if there would be a bug bounty reward. TTIBI never responded to the question, so I decided to close the case on December 22 and CERT-In sent me a nice appreciation letter.",

So they get what they want to hear and don’t want to hear what’s wrong. - Thinking this coming from the same team or from the same company is wrong. They silo developers like crazy. There likely was an API developer, an Office 365 developer, frontend developer (so specific it is down to the framework or stack!) and the developers themselves will not touch anything they aren’t “certified “ in. - I have been in meetings on $100 million projects where they will seriously argue over the cost of sendgrid.

Folks from India and elsewhere that just blindly churn out code according to literal instructions and don't give any thought as to how that code might not be safe/efficient/whatever. That being said, I blame the company, not the people. You could easily end up in a similar mess here in the states if you don't take some time to vet. (note: watching someone code on an interview aka pair coding isn't vetting, even take home assignments don't. If you do either of these, you aren't vetting, you are subconsciously looking at speed/accuracy/ability to think quickly, which may also mean you are discriminating based on age/disability -- i.e. people that code slower or think slower tend to be older or have a disability -- which is a violation of federal law here in the states.) reply Tryanasorus 15 hours agoprevSeeing Fiddler takes me back to the UT days.

I still am, but other obessions have reduced the relative weight of this interest. It was during those years that I made a regular pilgrimage to the MIT Flea Market. I bought many of the components for my first computers there. I also found this important piece of computing history, a full set of 4.3 BSD manuals, Virtual VAX-11 Version from April, 1986. The first thing I noticed was that this set includes two identical copies of the index. It was a multi-user system, and having two copies of the index would have come in handy! The index was prepared using an automatic indexing program written at Thinking Machines Corporation, Cambridge, MA. First page of index The rest of the books all contain the familiar nroff-formatted manual pages, though some are much shorter than the ones you’ll find today in a modern UNIX-decendent’s man program. Opened to a random page. I assumed file was much newer than this. The cover of each book features the familiar “Beastie” Daemon mascot with trident, representing “forking” of processes. Cover of main index Inside the front cover reveals a really interesting connection between early UNIX systems and modern culture. Cover design by John Lassetter, Lucasfilm, Ltd. That’s the same John Lassetter who would later write and direct “Toy Story,” “A Bug’s Life,” and “Toy Story 2,” and “Cars,” and “Cars 2.” These books have a publishing date of April, 1986, and Pixar was spun off from Lucasfilm in February, so John was already there by that point. Lassetter wasn’t the first to draw this, but his version became the most popular. Inside front cover of main index Comments? There’s a great conversation going on at Hacker News.",

About four years after this Lasseter drew his widely known take on the BSD Daemon for the cover of McKusick's co-authored 1988 book, The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD Operating System.[8] Lasseter drew a somewhat lesser-known running BSD Daemon for the 4.4BSD version of the book in 1994. 1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Daemon reply divbzero 12 hours agoparentIs there a connection between Sam Leffler the BSD contributor at Lucasfilm/Pixar and BSD as the basis for NeXTSTEP/OS X at NeXT/Apple? As far as I can tell, there is no direct connection. Sam Leffler contributed most to the 4.1BSD and 4.2BSD while at Berkeley [1], while NeXTSTEP was based on Mach which was based on 4.2BSD and developed by Richard Rashid and Avie Tevanian at Carnegie Mellon [2]. Perhaps the indirect connection is that, before Linux, BSD was the natural choice for an open-source UNIX derivative, and Steve Jobs had an instinct for seeking out the leading edges of computing at the time.

Third, KDE plasma support is a work in progress (read: most people do not get KDE plasma on an OpenBSD installation today, although it won't stay like this forever).

Why did we make Willow? If you read only one specification, let it be this one All of the specifications Data storage which never goes offline. You get always-available storage for arbitrary data (e.g. text, media). You can have as many of these stores as you want, keyed to different namespaces. When stores from different devices belong to the same namespace, they deterministically sync with each other. Private and end-to-end encrypted. Other users can't find out what you’re interested in unless they already know about it themselves. And if they get that far, they still have to be able to decrypt synced data to make any sense of it. Total erasure of data. Distributed systems use tombstones to communicate deletes, but even these leave metadata behind. Prefix pruning deletes many entries and all of their metadata in their entirety, leaving a single tombstone in their place. Fine grained capabilities. Restrict read and write access by semantically meaningful ranges of data, or time range. Use your favourite existing capability system, or try our Meadowcap system. Partial sync. Have a lot of data, but don't want to sync the whole thing to a particular device? Choose which data to replicate by what, when, or who. Destructive edits. When you update a value, the old values and associated metadata are overwritten. Locally delete data you don’t want to store, even if it was authored by someone else. Peers can communicate resource budgets, so devices with very limited memory can sync too. You choose the transport and cryptographic primitives suited to your use-case. Authors can write from multiple devices concurrently. Yay.",

Should namespaces be identified via human-readable strings, or via the public keys of some digital signature scheme? That depends entirely on the use-case. To sidestep such questions, the Willow data model is generic over certain choices of parameters. You can instantiate Willow to use strings as the identifiers of namespaces, or you could have it use 256 bit integers, or urls, or iris scans, etc. > This makes Willow a higher-order protocol: you supply a set of specific choices for its parameters, and in return you get a concrete protocol that you can then use. If different systems instantiate Willow with non-equal parameters, the results will not be interoperable, even though both systems use Willow. Help me out here - isn't the point of a protocol that two independently developed systems don't have to agree on how to implement the protocol? What value does Willow have if two systems that both purport to be \"Willow-compatible\" aren't compatible with each another? reply cobertos 19 hours agoparentBy having a more generic protocol on top, it allows the same tools to be used for different specific end results. So shared libraries and common debugging tools can benefit more use cases. You might even make a \"higher-order\" tool that can work with any willow data, at the cost of specific UI affordances that can be used when you know more about the underlying data. This is sort of how ActivityPub is a thing, but it underpins multiple, sorta-but-not-really interoperable systems like Lemmy and Mastodon. reply Joker_vD 18 hours agoparentprev> What value does Willow have if two systems that both purport to be \"Willow-compatible\" aren't compatible with each another? That you can claim to support Willow, or be Willow-compatible, without actually having to interoperate with your competitors. See e.g. the usage history of x509 in the nineties. reply layer8 17 hours agoparentprevProtocols can have parameters. The protocol will be interoperable between parties who choose compatible parameters. For example, SSH only works if both sides support and can agree on the same cryptographic algorithms, which is something that SSH is parametrized over. reply wavemode 17 hours agorootparentUnless I missed it somewhere, Willow has no specified handshake procedure. So there's no standardized way for the two sides to come to an agreement on how to communicate. (Willow appears to be completely agnostic even of the data encoding used to communicate in the first place.) In that sense it is even more high level and abstract than parameterized protocols like SSH. reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentTrue, it was an example of how “the same protocol” doesn’t necessarily imply compatibility. The algorithm negotiation procedure doesn’t guarantee that there will be an agreement, so it is somewhat secondary to the argument. reply sph 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd I think it's a good idea. Take HTTP for example. It is much more than its protocol. Freeing it from those details means that what is valid today: GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Could have the same semantics in any format: { \"method\": \"GET\", \"version\": \"1.1\", \"headers\": [{\"name\": \"Host\", \"value\": \"example.com\"}] } Of course a server accepting the former won't be able to communicate with the latter, but that's just an implementation detail that Willow does not want to commit to at this stage, and does not make it any less complete. Just a bit impractical. reply sillysaurusx 10 hours agorootparentThe history of cryptography failures suggests that it’s better for a protocol to be opinionated and complete rather than open ended. reply ianburrell 7 hours agorootparentprevFormat agnostic layers are a good thing. HTTP2 depends on it with different encoding but same meaning. But have to choose some encoding for communication to happen. Otherwise it is a meta protocol. reply jcul 11 hours agorootparentprevNot all protocols have to have a handshake to negotiate how they will communicate. Sometimes you just need to have both sides configured the same way. E.g. PTP clocks being in the same domain, having the same delay request mechanism etc. reply skissane 6 hours agorootparent> Not all protocols have to have a handshake to negotiate how they will communicate. Sometimes you just need to have both sides configured the same way. True, but the industry has been moving away from \"you have to configure both ends\" towards autonegotiation. e.g. RS-232 you had to configure data rates (e.g. 9600 baud) and encoding (e.g. 8N1 - 8 data bits, no parity bit, 1 stop bit), and if you didn't have the same config at both ends, communication wouldn't happen. USB, the primary successor, determines stuff like that by negotiation. Or similarly, with Ethernet autonegotiation, you no longer have to worry about manually configuring speed/duplex on each end–which I can remember being a big drama 20 years ago. reply jcul 2 hours agorootparentYeah, that is true. And even as I typed that I thought, PTP can be fairly hand off and auto negotiates most stuff. I guess E2E vs P2P it can't really because they can represent different physical infrastructure. Probably not the best example, I just happened to have the PTP spec open at the time! reply alex-mohr 10 hours agoparentprevWillow appears closer to a \"Protocol Construction Kit\" than a protocol itself. As a construction kit, it has value for people who want to make protocols where they'll control both ends, but don't have to re-implement basic table stakes. reply binary132 18 hours agoparentprevFWIW, HTTP allows subprotocol / backwards-compatible negotiation. Perhaps that could be similar to how implementations of this might need to cooperate. reply whizzter 17 hours agoparentprevI think the idea here is that Willow is meant to handle \"higher order\" issues like encryption and the especially prickly sharing encrypted data within a more cooperative environment, so that application builders can focus on their more specific applications. Say that I want to implement something Figma-like for designing drug-runner operations, Willow seems to be an excellent building block (Yes, the example is kinda out-there but it's meant to indicate that genericity intended here). reply conradev 15 hours agorootparentI wish the web page came out and said what Willow actually provides and what is up to the developer. As far as I can tell, this is primarily a crypographic specification, like Noise (http://www.noiseprotocol.org) except for a stateful key-value store instead of stateless connections reply rklaehn 18 hours agoparentprevThink of it like const generics in languages like rust or C++.

So \"some nonsense\" might be a bit strong... reply smaudet 16 hours agorootparentProtocols are useful, and as such the costs are high to using a bad one. Confused verbiage does not instill confidence that the authors know what they are doing, or that there is real benefit. So, perhaps it is strong language, but I think it is a reasonable reaction. reply black_puppydog 18 hours agorootparentprevHuh? I'd understand your phrase \"protocol generator\" to be the equivalent of \"higher order protocol\" in the same way that a \"higher order function\" can be seen as a \"function generator\"... reply smaudet 16 hours agorootparentThe difference would be that a function, order non-withstanding, is (a) callable (site). \"Higher order\", merely means one that takes/returns other functions, but they are still fundamentally, functions (callable sites). A protocol has the property that it is implementation independent, but that it has a defined interface (i.e. it is immediately usable). This is neither (not a defined interface, implementation dependent). If it doesn't share either property with a protocol, then you can't claim that it is truly a protocol, \"higher order\" or otherwise. This confused verbiage is what should be cause for concern - note that I can claim a \"higher order\" protocol with JSON or gRPC - its all the basic building blocks for a protocol, just both sides need to implement the same stuff! Except, neither JSON nor gRPC are crazy enough to claim to be a \"higher order\" protocol, which to me puts this in the rubbish bin of over-complicated technologies looking for a problem, like SOAP, JavaBeans, OSGi - all of these could also be claimed to be \"higher order\" protocols as well. The term is meaningless, and so I assume, is this project. reply jazzyjackson 16 hours agorootparentits wild to me that you would dismiss a project as meaningless because you can't immediately understand it reply smaudet 16 hours agorootparentOh I might read their specs: \"Willow is a family of specifications:\" https://willowprotocol.org/specs/index.html#specifications This part looks useful. But is it useful to be a \"willow\" family of protocols? Probably not. Their claims on the front page are extraordinary. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and heading the page with nonsense is not a good start. reply mplewis 14 hours agorootparentPretty rude to dismiss a project without reading any of its documentation. reply tenebrisalietum 13 hours agoparentprevIs IP useless because the other end might not support UDP or TCP? More practically/less absurdly: is SSL useless because side A doesn't support the same ciphers as side B. Perhaps a Willow negotiation protocol would be needed to reconcile, but it's a bad idea from a security perspective because it enables downgrade attacks. reply smaudet 12 hours agorootparentComparing apples and oranges. A protocol is allowed to have presumptions, and then provide an interface. Its not allowed to have no interface at all and no presumptions (A void). reply waterheater 17 hours agoprevAnother webpage compares Willow to other protocols like IPFS: https://willowprotocol.org/more/compare/index.html#willow_co... According to them, data on IPFS is immutable, stateless, and globally-namespaced, whereas data on Willow is mutable, stateful, and conditionally-namespaced. I interpret Willow as an authenticated, permissioned, content-based, globally-addressed, distributed database system, where an address has the hierarchy and expressiveness of a URL. One particularly nice feature about the documentation: if you hover over an underlined word (https://willowprotocol.org/specs/data-model/index.html#data_...), a pop-up box provides a definition or explanation. Importantly, some terms in the pop-up are underlined themselves, so you can dig down into the terminology with great ease. More projects should implement this functionality. reply tux3 20 hours agoprevHow does this compare to IPFS? I personally found IPFS very disappointing in practice, so I'm very hopeful for a successor. (The promise of IPFS is great, but it is excruciatingly slow, clunky, and buggy. IPFS has a lot of big ideas but suffers from a lack of polish that would make Augías look clean. And as soon as you scale to larger collections of files, it quickly crumbles under its own weight. You can throw more resources at it, but past some point it just falls over. It just doesn't work outside of small-scale tests.) reply pera 19 hours agoparenthttps://willowprotocol.org/more/compare/index.html#willow_co... reply rklaehn 19 hours agoparentprevif you are looking for something similar to ipfs but a bit more minimalistic and performance oriented, check out iroh https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh .

One part of iroh is a work in progress implementation of the willow spec. The lower layers include a networking library similar to libp2p and a library for content-addressed storage and replication based on blake3 verified streaming.

They made very similar choices than we (iroh) did. Rust, ed keys, blake3. They seem to do their own streams, while we are adapting QUIC to a more p2p approach. Also the holepunching approach seems to be different. But I would love to get more details. reply ramrunner0xff 14 hours agorootparenthttps://yewtu.be/watch?v=Kb1lKscAMDQ this was the presentation at DC'31. i will also check out iroh! thanks for working in building something in this space, it is much much needed! reply rklaehn 13 hours agorootparentThanks. This is awesome. I think they are doing more work themselves in terms of crypto, whereas we rely on QUIC+TLS more. Regarding holepunching, our approach is a bit less pure p2p, but has quite good success rates. We copy the DERP protocol from tailscale. I am confident that we have a better story regarding handling of large blobs. We don't just use blake3, but blake3 verified streaming to allow for range requests. Also I wrote my own rust library for blake3 verified streaming that reduces the overhead of the verification data. https://crates.io/crates/bao-tree I tried to get on their discord at https://veilid.com/discord, but I get an invalid invite. You know a better way to get in touch? reply ramrunner0xff 11 hours agorootparenthmm this is strange, i tried the invite and it worked for me.

Although I am concerned that while dumbpipe does mention cryptography, sendme's webpage makes no mention of it (?). 0. https://www.dumbpipe.dev/ 1. https://iroh.computer/sendme reply rklaehn 3 hours agorootparentIt's using the same transport. Basically sendme is like dumbpipe, but adds blake3 verified streaming from the iroh-bytes crate for content-addressed data transport. reply orthecreedence 12 hours agorootparentprevHi, I'm super intrigued by Willow and your work on iroh. Do you have any kind of documentation on how iroh deviates from Willow, or what parts of Willow are planned to be implemented vs omitted? reply binary132 18 hours agorootparentprevInteresting — does the Rust crate export a C API then? reply rklaehn 18 hours agorootparentNot officially. We currently have bindings for rust, python, golang and swift. These were the most asked for bindings (python for ml, golang for networking and swift for ios apps). We are using uniffi https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/ Would you need C or C++ bindings? reply binary132 12 hours agorootparentAh, I see. Hm. I might be interested in a C API since that could be used in C, C++, and Lua equally well. I really was just wondering what the common implementation between the bindings was since it struck me as unusual that there would be a number of bindings but not C (which is AIUI the only interface besides Rust that Rust can really export.) reply rklaehn 3 hours agorootparentSo, I am not the one that is doing the bindings, so take this with a grain of salt. It seems uniffi does create C compatible bindings in order to make bindings for all these other languages. But these are internal bindings that are ugly and not intended to be used externally. reply ComputerGuru 16 hours agoparentprevWillow solves the biggest problem I have always had with IPFS: it’s content addressable, which is nice for specific things but not generic enough to make the protocol actually practical and usable in the real world outside of specific use cases. (Namely you can’t update resources or even track related updates to resources.) (Mathematically, a name-addressable system is actually a superset of content-addressable systems as you can always use the hash of the content as the name itself.) reply nayuki 14 hours agorootparent> a name-addressable system is actually a superset of content-addressable systems as you can always use the hash of the content as the name itself It's a superset in that sense but not a superset in another sense. In a content-addressable system, if I post a link to another piece of content by hash, then no one can ever substitute a different piece of content. Like, if I reference the hash of a news article, no one can edit that article after the fact without being detected. This is a super-useful feature of CAS that is not a feature of NAS. Other implications: * I can review a piece of software, deem that it's not malware in my opinion, and link to the software by hash. No one can substitute a piece of malware without detection. * Suppose you get a link from a trusted source. Now you can download a copy of the underlying content from any untrusted source, without a care about authentication or trusted identities. This describes BitTorrent. reply rklaehn 13 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, IPFS does offer not just content addressing but also a mechanism for mutability with IPNS. You can think of a willow namespace (or iroh document) as a key value store of IPNS entries. The problem with IPNS is that the performance is... not great... to put it politely, so it is not really an useful primitive to build mutability. You end up building your own thing using gossip, at which point you are not really getting a giant benefit anymore. reply unshavedyak 11 hours agorootparentIs the performance a critical design flaw or just an implementation issue? reply rklaehn 1 hour agorootparentDifficult to answer. IPNS uses the IPFS kademlia DHT, which has some performance problems that you can argue are fundamental. For solving a similar problem with iroh, we would use the bittorrent mainline DHT, which is the largest DHT in existence and has stood the test of time - it still exists despite lots of powerful entities wanting it to go away. It also generally has very good performance and a very minimalist design. There is a rust crate to interact with the mainline DHT, https://crates.io/crates/mainline , and a more high level idea to use DHTs as a kind of p2p DNS, https://github.com/nuhvi/pkarr reply tadfisher 5 hours agorootparentprevImagine if DNS supplied every URL and not just domain names. You need some mechanism to propagate resource changes. IPNS has two practical mechanisms: a global DHT that takes time to propagate, and a pub/sub that requires peers to actively subscribe to your changes. reply wharvle 18 hours agoparentprevBeing written in Go may have made development of the reference client fast (that was the creators' contention when I asked, anyway) but killed its growth as a standard. Inability to have a portable lib-ipfs that could quickly, easily, and completely give almost any language-ecosystem or daemon ipfs capabilities is a real drag. reply detourdog 18 hours agoparentprevCan you quantify the breaking point of IPFS and the number of files. I was considering it for a project that has fewer than 200,000 entries. reply tux3 17 hours agorootparentIt depends on how many files you have, but also the file size. My understanding is that IPFS splits files into 256kB chunks with a content ID (CID), and then when you expose your project, it tries to advertise every CID of every file to peers. 200,000 files could take a while to advertise, but from memory it should work, should hang for less than 15 minutes. But depending on your hardware, file size, quality of connection to your peers, alignment of planets, etc. If you add one order of magnitude above that, it starts to become tricky. Manageable if you shard over several nodes and look for workarounds for perf issues. But if you keep growing a bit past that point, it can't keep up with publishing every small chunk of every file one by one fast enough. But it's also very possible perf has improved since the last time I tried it, so definitely take this with a grain of salt, you might want to try installing and running the publish command and see what happens. reply snvzz 9 hours agorootparent\"hang\" sounds pretty bad. Even if there's a lot of sharding and propagating and whatever to do, it should happen in the background, and never interfere with user experience. From your description, it seems their implementation has serious issues. reply foobiekr 15 hours agorootparentprevI'd be very curious what project you have for which IPFS is a good solution. reply detourdog 14 hours agorootparentI'm not sold on IPFS but the idea of using a file system as a top level global index is attractive to me. I find the 2 best references for human information is global location and time. I think an operating system structured around those constants could be a winner. I'm not sold on IPFS and will look at Willow and IROH. reply foobiekr 12 hours agorootparentA global hash-based index is literally an undergraduate project to do well. You could even ride atop bittorrent if you really had to. reply throwaway2562 18 hours agoprevStill confused here.

Sorry if a dumb question. reply bo1024 18 hours agoparentYeah, it would have helped me if they walked through what it actually means to \"use\" Willow. Do I install something like Dropbox on my computer? Do I write code that calls Willow as a library? reply jbverschoor 15 hours agoparentprevSame here. no clue what it does.. It could be a syncthing/dropbox something. It could be some sharing protocol. I dunno reply layer8 18 hours agoparentprevIt’s like Dropbox, including sharing, but without a centralized service, instead peer-to-peer. reply dirkf 17 hours agorootparentSo something like https://syncthing.net/ ? reply rklaehn 17 hours agorootparentIt's more generic than that. Syncthing is designed specifically for file system sync (and does a very good job). Willow could be used for file system tasks, but also for storing app data that is unrelated to file systems, like a KV store database. You should be able to write a good syncthing like app using the willow protocol, especially if you choose blake3 as the hash function. reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentprevSyncthing doesn’t have sharing support AFAICS, but yes, Willow could be used as the underlying protocol for something like Syncthing. reply jauntywundrkind 17 hours agoparentprevIt should be able to underpin most apps. The sky is the limit. Or your imagination is the limit; whichever comes first. This is a protocol for generic shared information spaces, where each person still owns & can manage permissions for their pieces of data in the space. It's a general idea that's present & implicit in most existing online spaces. reply catapart 20 hours agoprevSo this is pure spec?

Quick googling did not give me a proper grasp of the use cases for iroh/IPFS vs iRODs. Would you be willing to list the benefits of iroh vs IRODS? reply rklaehn 18 hours agorootparentI was not aware of iRODS. Iroh is named by a certain fictional character that likes tea. Any similarity is a coincidence. But it seems like iRODS is much more high level than iroh. E.g. iroh certainly does not contain anything for workflow automation. You could probably implement something like iRODS using iroh-net and iroh-bytes. reply jw_cook 16 hours agorootparent> Iroh is named by a certain fictional character that likes tea. \"The file was in my sleeve the whole time!\" reply b_fiive 18 hours agorootparentprevwow, thank you for pointing me to IRODS, I was not aware of the project! Big difference I'm seeing as I read the docs for IRODs is a datacenter-grade data management _service_, whereas iroh is a multiplatform SDK for building your own applications. Seems like one would want IRODs if they have massive amounts of highly sensitive data that needs fine grained access control.

Very cool. reply KomoD 11 hours agoprevI really like the illustrations reply ynniv 18 hours agoprevTotal erasure of data. This is disappointing. What's been read can never be un-read; to say otherwise is deceptive. reply black_puppydog 18 hours agoparentIn the same way, once an attacker can exploit some weakness in a system, it's game over. Yet defense in depth is a thing and makes it much less likely that bad things happen. In this case, yes, it's impossible to guarantee that some malicious peer doesn't ignore my \"plea to delete\". But combined with the fact that my data will only be replicated to/by peers I already have a trust relationship with (as opposed to e.g. on a blockchain) it provides another layer of protection that a system without deletion simply doesn't have. Not perfect, but not useless either. reply ynniv 18 hours agorootparentYes, but that's not what \"Total erasure of data\" means. The project's goals are hard and noble. It would be better to under-promise and over-deliver than to make everyone question their claims. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man at this point, but there are already too many caveat emptors in computing. They could have said \"better\" erasure of data. reply rklaehn 17 hours agorootparentPrefix pruning is a very different approach than tombstones. An update will actually remove data, and not just mark the data as removed. Maybe \"total erasure of data\" is a too strong promise, but the fact that you can not force nodes that you don't control to unsee things is common knowledge, so in my opinion this does not need a qualifier. reply wharvle 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's a handy feature to have in the protocol if you're operating detached networks using it, and can control all the clients. If you're using it as internal infrastructure. Which, personally, is the only way I've ever been interested in using these sorts of things. You're right that it's nigh-meaningless for a public cluster. reply ynniv 18 hours agorootparentOk, but where exactly is that when the FBI is pulling Bitcoin private keys out of files accidentally synchronized to iCloud Files? These are hard problems. reply wharvle 18 hours agorootparentI don't understand your concern. Guaranteed (if you control the clients, for ordinary values of \"guaranteed\", not, like, mathematically-rigorous ones) deletion is a handy feature if you need to be able to comply with regulations, or just want to be sure you're not wasting disk space on stuff you intended to delete, without having to do extra work. Attackers are a whole other matter, and their existence doesn't make the feature pointless, for the above reasons. reply ynniv 18 hours agorootparentdeletion is a handy feature if you need to be able to comply with regulations This is a good point, and \"GDPR compliant erasure of data\" would be a great way to explain it. As a user I can guess what that means, and as an engineer it doesn't sound like magic. reply detourdog 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat is the point of noting trying to accomplish hard and noble things. I'm sure there are plenty of people willing to take shortcuts. I appreciate people trying to do something hard and noble. reply ynniv 18 hours agorootparentMe too! But let's be honest about how things work. reply detourdog 15 hours agorootparentI thought I was. I don't think it has much to do with the way the world works. I think it might have more to do with how one works the world. There are plenty of people that don't want to try the impossible but the impossible should be explored. reply xpe 12 hours agoparentprevI can appreciate the spirit of the comment. I'm more pedantic than is typical -- perhaps even more than is healthy! Even so, I don't think the claim is deceptive. Willow's claim has to do with erasure of the _networked_ data. It doesn't claim that copies people make are destroyed. Almost everyone understands and expects that if you can view data, you usually can somehow make some kind of copy of it. The question usually comes down to: how good of a copy? Perhaps the best way to prevent perfect copying of data is to prevent someone from viewing it on a device they control. reply aidenn0 12 hours agorootparent> Almost everyone understands and expects that if you can view data, you usually can somehow make some kind of copy of it. This is true for the target audience of the article, but certainly not for people in general. It might be true for people in their 20s, but I strongly doubt it's true for any other age range. reply orthecreedence 12 hours agoparentprevI don't really get what your nitpick is here. There is no conceivable way in the universe to unshare information that has been shared. The idea here is that you can stop further sharing of that information.

But it is worth noting that not everything has to scale globally. E.g. in iroh-sync (which is an experimental impl of the willow protocol) you are not concerned with global scaling. You care only about nodes that are in the same document. So while if you request hash QmciUVE1BqKPXMSvTTGwHZo1ywYdZRm9FfBvEJkB6J4USb via ipfs, you are trying to globally find anybody that has this hash, which is a very difficult task. If you ask for some content-addressed data in an iroh document, you know to only ask nodes that participate in this particular document, which makes the task much easier.

    "originBody": "Context: When I was laid off from Google, I knew I'd be deluged with questions. I wrote this FAQ to share with friends and family, to prevent repeated explanation. But my other goal was to help so many of my co-workers process and understand the repeated waves of mass layoffs. What happened? Google just did another big round of layoffs. I was part of them, along with hundreds of others. Many of us had long tenure or seniority; my run was 18 years! Oh no! But why were you targeted? I wasn’t personally targeted, I didn’t mess up. In fact these layoffs were extremely impersonal. Google seems to be carrying out generic initiatives to save operational cost. I was an Engineering Director with “only” 35 reports (rather than a typical 80+ people), and so it’s likely that some heuristic decided that the business could do fine without me. This is unfair! After all you’ve done, how could Google do this to you? Please understand: Google is not a person. It’s many groups of people following locally-varying processes, rules, and culture. To that end, it makes no sense to either love or be angry at “Google”; it’s not a consciousness, and it has no sense of duty nor debt. Are you OK? I’m so sorry! How are you coping? I’m fine. :-) Google culture changed dramatically last year with its first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall. I’ve been preparing myself for this (increasingly inevitable) event for months now – which included plenty of time for all the stages of grief. If anything, I have a mixed set of emotions: enormous pride in building a Chicago Engineering office over decades, and achieving really cool things in the Developer, Ads, and Search divisions; deep gratitude in getting to work with some of the most intelligent, creative people in the world; a sense of relief. The conflict between “uncomfortable culture” and “golden handcuffs” was becoming intolerable. What happens next? I’ve seen long-tenured leaders exit Google and go into an identity crisis; that’s not me. :-) I have a zillion hobbies and shadow careers – plenty of things to do and paths to follow. The first order of business, however, is probably a long-overdue sabbatical. After 25+ years in tech, I need a few months to rest and recover! I’ll soon publish a couple of ‘post-mortem’ stories. The first will be about my own career at Google, and the second will be about how I’ve seen Google culture change over time. image: the first three software engineers at Google Chicago, 2006 published January 10, 2024",

It is amazing how alien and out of place early Google sounds in today's corporate environment. They have completely eroded the perception that Google is this kind of place: > Google is the opposite: it's like a giant grad-school. Half the programmers have PhD's, and everyone treats the place like a giant research playground [...] Every once in a while, a manager skims over the bubbling activity, looking for products to \"reap\" from the creative harvest. The programmers completely drive the company, it's really amazing. I kept waiting for people to walk up to me and ask me if I had declared my major yet. They not only encourage personal experimentation and innovation, they demand it. Every programmer is required to spend 20% of their time working on random personal projects. If you get overloaded by a crisis, then that 20% personal time accrues anyway. Nearly every Google technology you know (maps, earth, gmail) started out as somebody's 20% project, I think. Even if this was only half-true back then, there's very little you could do to convince me that it's true at all now. This culture and the public perception of it has been squandered. [1]: https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2005-09-25-FirstWee... reply dekhn 10 hours agoparentThat was an absolutely spot-on description of what it was like when I joined in 2007 or 2008. Within 2 year of joining, I had approval to use all the idle cycles in prod for protein design, folding, and drug discovery, and I had a front-row seat with some of the best programmers in the industry. By and large, employees were fun people to interact with, and the management was generally understanding of our hijinx. The main struggle I had was to convince the leadership to move faster into the cloud (\"But we have appengine!\" and \"But profits aren't as good as ads\", until MSFT ate their lunch). As soon as it was possible, I built and launched the cloud product I had wanted Google to make even before I joined! It really did just feel like grad school with better funding. For me it lasted until around 2014 (wow, 10 years ago) when a director stole my ideas and bad-mouthed me to a bunch of senior folks. I hung on a bit longer (working for a close friend of the author of this FAQ on 3d printing and making stuff) and then a couple stints with ML hardware, before I finally concluded that the company was well on its way to enhittifying everything it did. Sundar is sort of the complete opposite of this. He wants a large pool of completely anonymous programmers and a small number of directors who know how to turn those programmers into growth products, but those directors don't have a clue. For example, with gChat, one day the head of chat told TGIF that chat was changing, that japanese teen girls were the primary target, and they wanted emojis. He didn't even get that there was this enormous number of professional workers using gmail/gchat/gcal/gdocs and that by fucking up the product, he lost their trust. Oh well. Sundar is why we can't have nice things. reply ants_everywhere 5 hours agorootparentOne of the things that makes me sad about this is that Sergei and Larry seem so checked out. They were mostly gone when I was there, but I've always gotten the feeling that Google was like grad school because Larry and Sergei wanted it that way. I get that they've made a ton of money, but it also seems like they really wanted to spend their lives making awesome stuff and doing things like scanning books and making them free. And it feels a bit like the market forces took Google away from them. They put Sundar and a bunch of other McKinsey alums in charge. And McKinsey is, from what I can tell, basically the opposite of grad school. Whenever I did see Larry or Sergei make an appearance they always looked a little dead inside and like they were just going through the motions. And from what I can tell, the original sin was taking VC funding. Once they took VC funding, they had limited actual control over what happened to their company. So while they talked in 2004 about not wanting to be a conventional company, and while they warned in 1998 that ad-driven search engines were biased against their users, they still had limited ability to be unconventional in any way that was unattractive to investors. And that includes, in a sense, just being too different. A large company will eventually need to be run by professional management, and professional managers need a thing that looks and drives like a conventional company. reply rawland 4 hours agorootparentTo put the picture together: So VC money, the DoubleClick merger, and McKinsey ‘culture’ eroded Google (culture)? reply heyoni 7 hours agorootparentprevJesus.

Truth, morality and the quest for knowledge be damned. \"Picking\" is more than what the word suggests. It involves shutting others out, stealing ideas and actual work, propagandizing, giving out freebies but keeping the kickbacks hidden, buttering people for favors, building and fostering inner circles etc. All this is the politics. No surprise that the ones who are left and thrive are self driven narcissists and ruthless cold blooded creatures painted in playful colors. Google is the equivalent of the Ivy league. Hopeless, clueless and on a path to irrelevance fostered by a thousand leeches. Some argue, the world is better because of what Google produced and hence entitled to such inner workings. Same argument as the Ivy's. That's missing the forest for the trees.

Chromium was created in 2008 and only after Google had already captured a third of the browser market share (according to Statista) did they fork it (April 2013). The fact that basically all of the big companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple) use Webkit or Chromium shows that it's very difficult to build and maintain one successfully IMO. I think that Mozilla are essentially the only ones developing something that's somewhat competitive, not to mention that most smaller companies (e.g. Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, Island etc.) all use Chromium. I'm not saying that it's easy to succeed with a product even after you've bought it, or started it from a fork (see less successful Chromium/Webkit forks). I'm just saying that it was not something built from the ground-up in Google. For example, v8 was and really changed a lot of things in the JavaScript world including Node, Deno etc. reply reissbaker 7 hours agorootparentI think v8 and the multi-process model were the big differentiators of Chrome when it first launched, and how it originally got marketshare! Regardless, I think \"ground-up\" building isn't a great way to measure product building; after all, macOS is \"just\" a BSD fork, as others have pointed out Webkit was originally a KHTML fork, etc. And just about any web product runs on Linux and is effectively a wrapper around libc, which wasn't ground-up built by any modern tech co. reply edgyquant 4 hours agorootparentMacOS is not a fork of BSD but uses some of its use land.

I think you missed the point, there's two forks in the history of Blink (Chromium). Yes, Blink is a fork of WebKit, but WebKit is a fork of KHTML. So it's not like it originated at Apple either, it originated at KDE. reply linkgoron 34 minutes agorootparentI did not miss the point, I just don't see why it's relevant. This isn't a thread about Apple's products and their success. The fact that Apple started from KHTML is not really relevant. However, it's clear that at the beginning Google was very dependent on Webkit and Apple, and there's a good reason why it took them five years of gaining development expertise and market share before forking Webkit. I've already stated that Chrome's success is not just because that it was forked from Webkit (e.g. v8, and other things that people mentioned here as well), but it was a huge jumpstart for them, and it would've taken them much longer to get a leading browser without it. e.g. Microsoft basically gave up on developing their own engine after failing with IE and the original Edge - and are now also based on Chromium. Chrome is (IMO) much better than Safari, Maps is (IMO) a great product, Youtube is a a huge success and much bigger than it was when they bought it (homegrown Google Video failed), Android was also essentially an acquihire, as others have mentioned (using a lot of Google's resources) and is hugely successful.

I would love to work at a place like this. reply neilv 7 hours agorootparentI also want to know the answer to this, but I'm starting to think I might not recognize it. Part of Google's perceived aura (IMHO) when they started was that they seemed to be like the nebulous group of pre-Web Internet-savvy techies. Which were a smart group, tending towards altruistic and egalitarian, and wanting to bring Internet goodness to people, and onboard people into Internet culture. What seemed like one sign of this was times that you'd see old-school techies outside of Google treating Google like stewards rather than exploiters. And when they said \"Don't Be Evil\", I thought I knew exactly what they meant. Well, the dotcom gold rush happened, huge masses of people rushed in looking for what it was about, huge money rushed in and soon tried to landgrab and then exploit those masses rather than onboard them, Doubleclick acquired Google :), techie job interviews started looking like rituals to induct affluent young new grads into their rightful upper-middle career paths, unethical behaviors became so commonplace that people can't even see them, and academia was infected a bit. Which I think means... ...If another Google happened, would we even recognize it? From where could it draw its culture that's not pretty completely overtaken by big money and all that attracts and builds? Maybe the next Google can't be in the space of computing/communications/information at all, because big money and and coattail-riders would be all over that too quickly. Maybe it would instead arise from people that really love to study insects. And they have a cooperative community around that, and have been trying to explain the importance of insects to the world for years, but not many care. Then it turns out that insects are the key to averting an imminent Earth extinction-level event. So the bug nuts get huge infusions of cash, and can work on all the problems they've wanted to. And it'll be at least a few years before people with no interest in insects, other than chasing money, can really take over and start perverting the field, set up gatekeeping to pass people like them, while excluding the actual people who created and loved the field and saved the world, etc. Personally, I have always disliked bugs, and will never be a candidate for Bügle. reply ants_everywhere 6 hours agorootparent> Maybe it would instead arise from people that really love to study insects.

The unique combination of parameters with early-Google were: - Small, relatively young company. - Absolutely gargantuan amounts of revenue You can't run a company this way unless you have a very large money firehose. The last time this happened was early-Facebook. I don't think there has been a single company since then that fit the description - which IMO is fine, the celestial alignment of factors is pretty rare. Companies nowadays have kind of the opposite problem: lots of hiring, but not enough revenue to show for it. Some tried to build a similar culture on VC funding but imploded once the cash ran out. You really need an intensely profitable product to make this formula work. reply ramraj07 7 hours agorootparentGoogle was like this before they identified the ad firehose.

I don't know that something like this can ever happen again, barring another major upset. Many people don't realize or remember how transformative the dot-com era really was. The amount of money firehose that was there to go around was staggering. We're just at a much more mature point in the market. Ironically, a lot of the people that make it difficult/impossible to have the money firehose are the ones that made their fortune from that environment! It's still possible for a one-off startup here and there to maybe get into this boat, but at this point the big tech players are there to slurp up the real money makers early and often and assimilate them into the borg. If this sort of environment were what I wanted to work in, I'd probably look at specialized teams/niches inside of big corps. Surely very difficult to find, but they do exist. reply Animats 7 hours agorootparentprevRoblox was like that for a while.

Are you thinking of an instance? Anger typically locks in the status-quo by causing people to fight each other. Greed on the other hand has pushed us from farming monkeys into modern society with a material existence that was hitherto unthinkably comfortable. Harnessing greed created and powers the modern engine of wealth creation. And greed works best when people are thoughtful, patient, kind and calm. Typically anger just makes people do things that are hasty and stupid. I'm not thinking of situations where I've seen it get much done. It isn't an emotion that can power long term, strategic plans - or at least not good ones.

I am transgender, for example, and while having 1 mildly hostile family member would be a somewhat-problem, most of my extended family only wants to talk about that thing, and that one thing, with me, to the point where it effectively creates a wall. That at least is my experience of the issue, it's not quite the same, but I've definitely experienced the \"questions dynamic\" within other, much-more-mild scenarios, and generally, IMPE, I really dislike it unless I'm actively getting something interesting out of it, which I'm oftentimes not!

He didn't mention coming to the office as a complaint of his so I don't think it is one. reply refulgentis 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's not quite that, TL;DR: performance review system was 'de-complexified'. Googlers will say \"GRAD\", and people outside assume it has something to do with RTO because of timing (which is still ~fake at Google. No one knows the secret # to get a nasty email, but 3 times in 6 weeks doesn't get it). - 80% get average grade. 2% get worst, 6-8% get between worst and average. That covers 90% of the distribution. - The below-average grade is a death sentence to your career there. - The rest, people recently found out, is half-eaten by people who get promoted. - There's now _precious_ little incentive to put in an effort in a culture that was already known for it's rest-and-vest-ness. - The quotas are enforced 3-4 levels up from bottom, and managers are expected to warn anyone who might get below average. In practice, that means 15-20% of people are being told they might get a scarlet letter. - There is ~nowhere to transfer internally since late 2021. 100 applicants for every open role. - The internal orgs all love to do whatever the opposite of \"yes, and\" is. And each were told to Focus™, so that leads to people having an easy excuse to turning down _any_ request. It's much more efficient to shit all over the other org and not do the work and tell your director it's their fault than it is to enable bottom-up action. - The simplification of performance reviews also meant it shifted from being 80% peer feedback and 20% management to 95% management. And Google, like anywhere, is full of people at their worst, and their best. It's lead to a, frankly, gob-smacking amount of chicanery that I thought I left behind at immature companies. Even your average gossip-y early startup is better, because there's a certain sense of reality, instead of ad dollars that magically convert to paychecks. - Constant, ever-beating drum of firings. There was the huge one last year, and then the sizable one recently in a couple orgs, but it's been near-constant. - The firings are absurdly post-modern sterile. You wake up, locked out of your laptop, locked out of the office, and have an email in your personal inbox telling you they're cutting your team. - They have to \"cut teams\" instead of do layoffs because of the legal / cost ramifications of just doing layoffs to drive up profits. But that opens up some of that chicanery I mentioned: have it on good authority from 2 sources that the political movers who came into the Assistant org. for Bard would ship people onto \"classic\" Assistant teams just to fire them. It's really hard to explain concisely, but basically, I'm not sure I'd recommend anyone come close to that place unless they're sub 100K in savings. Nothing makes sense, nothing is real, everyone knows it, and you have a bunch of the world's smartest people optimizing for how to do the least without being the least. A lot of that involves saying no and telling everyone it's someone else's fault, and like any hierarchical organization......... reply swozey 10 hours agorootparentThat's really thorough and unfortunate. I hadn't heard about all of that. I had a committee interview there maybe 8 years ago and already that was such an impersonal feeling that I really disliked my experience and didn't continue, not that they'd have hired me in the end. I had 2 referrals for the team I wanted to join and I thought I'd be interviewing with that teams members who knew me from various foss projects or at least knew of the projects. When I heard it was by committee my anxiety went through the roof. I hope things improve for everyone. reply dmoy 10 hours agorootparentIt's more like two committees in fact. There's the not-quite-randomly-selected people who interview you, and write feedback. Then there's the completely separate set of people on the hiring committee who make a decision reading the feedback and other stuff (referrals, resume, etc). The latter group doesn't talk to the former group though, just the written feedback. reply jeffbee 9 hours agorootparentIt's not clear that hiring people you know directly into your team is even a good idea. I liked the Google interview system, and since leaving I have only seen worse ones. reply swozey 9 hours agorootparentYou like the possibility of someone being placed onto your team without anyone who is part of that team having interviewed them? Maybe that does happen at some point, I forget. Long time. If it doesn't.. I think I would absolutely hate that. I don't interview people I know personally or refer or know from projects but I absolutely want 2-3 from my team to be speak to them and us do the technical tests. But I'm an SRE and not a SWE and there are a lot fewer operation/platform people compared to the 6-10 dev teams of 6-12 people doing various languages one sre team supports so there are usually plenty of SWE specific people to bring on committees. My team is 6 who support 80 SWEs so there are just a lot fewer proficient IAC writers on staff. reply jeffbee 9 hours agorootparentYes, I do prefer choosing new team members from among people who got hired into level by a team-neutral process, because I have seen too many instances of a hiring manager throwing out all the standards to hire a person they want into a particular role, which can be detrimental to companies because hiring people who don't really meet your standards is one of the worst things you can do as a company. reply refulgentis 8 hours agorootparentSomeone managed to pull this off in 2021 at Google and I'm still very, very, confused as to how reply pb7 6 hours agorootparentprevThe type of nepotism that you were hoping to get you in isn't actually a good thing.

If not, leave. reply dmoy 10 hours agorootparentPedantic notes: 1. The 4% number comes from the Trinity study, which found that 95% of the time you have >$0 after 30 years. If you're >30 years from death now, a more appropriate benchmark might be 3% or possibly 3.5%. 2. $100k/yr post tax is more than $100k/yr pretax, even if it's mostly long term capital gains and dividend taxes. 3. Health insurance $$$. So the number for you is probably a little higher maybe $5m to switch to 3% and add an additional $50k for tax and health insurance costs. But yea the general point stands.

Conveniently there's no appropriate subject (or object) to feel about. I think the shorthands he attacks, though they're literally untrue, are also really helpful metaphors. Large organizations have a character that no one person is responsible for and personifying them and assessing how we feel about their actions is a useful tool for reflection and assessment. Each member of those \"groups of people\" should reflect on how they as individuals (and their group) contributes to it. A company isn't \"just\" an aggregate of all people in it - but it is mostly that.

Here you've got a guy, 18 years at Google, probably earning somewhere between 500k-1mil per year, probably $5-10 million in his Schwab account without breaking a sweat. With a little blurb at the top of his blog about \"How to Leader\", feeling the need to explain whether any of this is \"fair\" or why it's ok that \"Google did this to you\". Honestly, as an industry--we need to grow the fuck up. Using the wrong part of speech or talking about what is or isn't \"fair\" are things I do with my three-year old when she's throwing a tantrum. Not something I expect from an emotionally mature professional in his 40s or 50s who's likely earning a million/year or more. Google is a trillion-dollar, global multinational with shareholders, and a board, and a stock price. If you don't deliver, you will be cut, period.

There are whole industries that exist 100% because of regulatory capture and systems of control they've set up to protect themselves and are a million times more worthless. Tech is a shining star of people getting paid a lot to just try to figure out new ways of doing things and throwing off more value than any where else in the economy on an off day, and the industry was 1000 times better even with the wastefulness before than it will be if it becomes just some shit corporate world like old style companies. reply jart 8 hours agorootparentIt's worth mentioning that tech didn't just invent better products. Tech also figured out a way to give them away for free. Tech also figured out how to ensure people of all classes and backgrounds got equal access to superior products for free. Tech furthermore figured out how to ensure it wasn't just the American classes that got free stuff, but that the free better products could be enjoyed by people from all nations. reply eldavido 9 hours agorootparentprevSo I think it's worth discussing this a bit. Maybe there was a time when this wasn't true. I spent a lot of the 2010s working in San Francisco tech jobs. It was quite enjoyable and I just got back from a guy's wedding who I worked with closely 2012-2015. Three different startups, one mine, other two as an employee. All three crashed and burned. I think there are three possibilities. One is that tech is somehow different/exceptional and bound to stay that way forever. I doubt it. The second is that we were always lying to ourselves, it was always just \"a job\", but we were all young, stupid, and naive. This feels too cynical. The third, which I feel is most accurate these days, is that tech was different, but now is a more mature industry, and is, as you put it \"just some shit corporate world\". Maybe there was a time when it was genuinely true that people got \"unlimited vacation\", that \"titles don't matter\" and that the CEO ate with the hoi polloi. But I think those days have passed. Everything's different now. The people coming into this industry today are 4.0 GPA high school kids, not misfits tinkering with computers in their basement. Competitive parents no longer feel they have to justify why their kid is going into tech rather than law, finance, or medicine. Salaries have increased 3-5x (!!). Tech influences elections, mints billionaires, and controls many facets of American life. The problem is that the attitudes haven't kept up. These days, Google, facebook, etc are just standard American megacorps. They are some of the most valuable companies in the world with huge lobbying budgets, and tremendous pressure to deliver shareholder value. The simple fact is that margins always get compressed as industries mature. Google has been under greater and greater margin pressure over the last decade as Apple demands higher payments to be their default search engine, OpenAI starts to steal share, and more people head directly to Amazon for search results. Google of course is going to blame the pandemic for this, but the actual issue is long-term erosion of margin. It's hard to see how any of this is going to reverse course over time. reply tracerbulletx 9 hours agorootparentThank you for the thoughtful response. I hope my comment wasn't too inflammatory. I just have a strong visceral reaction that something important and beautiful is lost if the west coast computer company that works hard, plays hard, treats their employees like professionals that can act independently and cares a lot about research and craft even at the expense of some reasonable amount of efficiency turns into mostly just a bunch of IBMs or Oracles. reply jart 8 hours agorootparentDon't doubt yourself Atreyu.

What was different about tech was that there were so many young companies that simply hadn't had the time to degrade.

I don't understand what Apple is actually doing from this tweet/thread. Are they are somehow managing to force even payment links from ordinary web sites in an ordinary web browser (Safari?) to go through them as payment processor? (How?) Or is this a new rule for app store apps (what is the new rule?) Or a new payment structure for in-app purchases? (what was the change?) Or no change, but pointing out how awful the status quo is? Other? reply skygazer 10 hours agoparentNo. They’re allowing alternate payment processing with a link from an an iOS app to a webpage, and reducing their commission to either 12 or 27% representing a 3% discount for not doing the payment processing themselves. They’re basically following the ruling based on some California law being applied nationally that the Supreme Court declined to hear on appeal. The judge said Apple would have to allow links out to alternate payment and would be required to collect their commission, which she suggested might be a bit high, but didn’t order any changes because everyone else also charges 30%, too. They are basically trying to act as an affiliate or partner with commission, which is pretty much the way it was before, but accounting gets more complicated now. (The judge was okay with Apple continuing to collect commission on sales.) Apple is still requiring they also make Apple in-app purchases available for the same digital goods. And also being pretty restrictive on how to link out. I have no idea if that is in the spirit of the ruling, but I think so, because the law that was cited had to do with allowing links to app publisher’s site for alternate payment, and that Apple couldn’t deny apps including such links. reply NoPedantsThanks 9 hours agorootparentI wonder how Apple thinks they're going to measure the transactions that take place. Simply clicking on the link and visiting the third-party-payment site doesn't prove anything, because the user could bail out before paying. reply turquoisevar 6 hours agorootparentMainly two ways. One is by tracking outgoing links via a specific framework that needs to be used, the ruling only provides for Apple having to allow linking out, no restrictions on Apple’s part for requiring a certain way of doing it. The other is the courts explicitly affirming Apple’s right to audit as a part of them stating that the commission will still be owed regardless. The latter is important because it allows Apple to claim a legitimate interest in defense if somehow a case is brought specifically about Apple’s requirements on how to link to a URL outside the app. Think: “Judge you said the commission would still be owed and you stated we can audit, you even lamented on how cumbersome it would be for all parties involved to settle the commission owed to us if third party payment options would be used, us requiring a specific framework to be used to link outside the app alleviates some of that. We have a legitimate interest in imposing these requirements because it helps us measure links to external purchase flows, which in turn helps us automate measuring these external transactions.” If you read the appellate court’s judgment, the annoyance towards the district court is palpable. Because the district court both stated the unlawfulness of the anti-steering provision under California statutes as well as stating how cumbersome after the fact collection is of the commission as well as stating that the commission is still owed. All of this is marginally contradictory, but because the district court didn’t err in sufficient ways for the appellate court to step in and all of it ultimately is in line with the law and standing jurisprudence, the appellate court’s hands were tied, because the appellate court isn’t for do-overs, it’s merely there for significant errors that cause harm. SCOTUS refused to take up the case, so until further notice the law of the land is that a) developers are allowed to steer users away from the the app while b) Apple remains entitled to their commission regardless because c) there's nothing inherently illegal about Apple's commission because d) it primarily is a payment mechanism for usage of Apple's IP by virtue of how it's structured in the developer agreement and e) as such it's legal because Apple can't be forced to give away their IP for free. reply threeseed 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause iOS apps talk to the Notarisation Service on launch.

Epic got what they asked for on this point because they were technically correct on the merits, but both the judge and the appeals court were skeptical that demanding it would do anyone any good: > IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple’s intellectual property. Even in the absence of IAP, Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission. > In such a hypothetical world, developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple's innovation and intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions, among other methods. Of course, any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time costs to both Apple and the developers. https://casetext.com/case/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc-2 reply jahewson 6 hours agorootparentprevMore expensive not to do it. reply sunnybeetroot 2 hours agorootparentprevApp installs does not equal transactions. reply a_wild_dandan 9 hours agorootparentprevThat metric doesn't work accurately even in the simplest case (buying an app), let alone for more nuanced transactions -- in-app purchases, subscription tiers, etc. It's unclear how how Apple-the-middle-man can insert itself to effectively rent seek from customers/developers now. reply tomrod 7 hours agorootparentCharging both sides of a market _typically_ results in crash of the two sided (platform-hosted) market.

And there is more to this issue than people realise. Apple has had major lawsuits over the years [1] due to kids racking up large credit card bills via in-app purchases. And similar concerns exist for gambling apps. So this explains why they need to show such a large warning because they don't want to be held responsible for actions of a third party. Which is fine because most companies do this. It will also likely be their argument (whether it's true or not) about why they won't allow developers like Epic to offer a third party, one-click, in-app purchasing system and instead force users to go to the home page and take deliberate actions to buy the product. [1] https://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/15/apple-settles-app... reply extheat 9 hours agorootparentThis sounds even worse for Apple. If it’s too easy to make an in-app purchase, why don’t they make it harder to complete one by adding password requirement for payments through their App Store? Of course they won’t do that because it hurts /their/ bottom line.

Biometrics is offered as an alternative after the first time, but it is opt-in. If you restore or transfer settings then it’ll ask for password first time and then honor biometric preference if that’s what you opted-in for on the other device. reply turquoisevar 6 hours agorootparentprev> If it’s too easy to make an in-app purchase, why don’t they make it harder to complete one by adding password requirement for payments through their App Store? They do. Passwords are required for every purchase, they just give the user the option to either disable this or to use biometrics by default instead, which is considered a password analogue in the security chain of Apple. But if you don’t have biometrics setup then you’re always asked for a password and if you do have it setup then after the first time asking for a password it’ll ask if you want to use biometrics instead going forward. Even on a new device, if you’ve transferred your settings eland other stuff, it’ll still ask for your password the first time before honoring your transferred setting to use biometrics instead. > Following this logic, letting people complete payments outside of Apples control should absolve Apple of the legal liabilities between payments made between the user and a third party. It should absolve them of liabilities, but that doesn’t stop people from trying to sue Apple and being able to point to a warning will increase the changes of getting a summary dismissal. > If this is not the case, can you sue Apple for unauthorized payments made over Safari? You can sue Apple for any reason. I can sue you too tomorrow for whatever reason I think warrants a suit. In fact, it is standing practice for trial lawyers (and they’re welcome to pitch in) to sue any party that remotely can be tied to a cause of action as a co-defendant, especially if they have deeper pockets than the party that would be the most logical primary defendant. This increases the chances of a pay out and there’s a marginal effort and cost to lump them into the case while you’re at it. So in an example related to the matter at hand it’s very likely that someone would sue the third party developer and Apple, regardless of their precautions. Because the world’s most valuable and richest company (or second most valuable company, courtesy of MS) is great to have on the other side to take a shot at, if only because they might simply settle because the cost/benefit analysis on their side to litigate it might favor a quick settlement. reply NoPedantsThanks 9 hours agorootparentprevI think they did this.

Fortnite is free to play, but makes billions of dollars based on in-game microtransactions for things like in-game cosmetics. Apple charges developers 30% on each of these transactions. Epic didn't like this and so started offering users a way to pay on their own site instead of going through Apple, with a large discount. Apple responded by kicking Fortnite off their app store, and so Epic sued them for anticompetitive behavior. The gist of the trial and appeals (to date) is that the judge ruled that Apple must allow developers to advertise non-apple means of payment. So Apple responded to this by allowing developers to include exactly one reference (in the entire program), in plain text (non-hyperlink), to an an outside payment site, and has changed their terms to require that developers must now also pay them 27% off all revenue from these outside transactions as well.

If you want to include a link to an website for payment of digital goods, you have to request an entitlement from Apple. 2. As part of that entitlement, you agree to pay Apple a 27% commission on any purchases made when users click those links, for up to 7 days after the link is clicked. 3. You agree to send Apple monthly sales reports. 4. You agreed to give Apple a right to audit your books at anytime. That's the meat of it. It's a self-reported cost-per-conversion, which isn't exactly unheard of. Developers are in arms because they don't believe Apple deserves any money for distributing their app on their App Store. That's the heart of the disagreement. Apple believes they have a right to charge developers a fee for access to the users who shop through the App Store. There are developers who believe that the App Store should exist as a free-thing Apple provides to developers, to encourage them to write software for the iPhone.

Rephrased - Developers are up in arms because the cost of distribution on iOS is artificially high. It's artificially high because the cost is not subject to market forces. It's not subject to market forces because Apple has a vertical monopoly on hardware and software distribution. Vertical integration is illegal. reply dkonofalski 9 hours agorootparentThat's not true in the slightest, though. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Steam all take 30% for distribution and hosting, same as Apple. It's not artificially high if it's in line with the rest of the tech industry and if you want to try and claim that it's because of some monopoly, vertical or otherwise, then you have to explain why the other storefronts are also monopolies.

On Android I could use a separate AppStore and Google would get nothing… In other words, in all those platforms devs can opt in to participate on a centralized store taking 30%, or keeping an alternative channel with higher revenues. On iOS, not so much.

It's a major contributor to food deserts. It's not a cartel because the main players aren't acting in concert, but they are attempting to monopolize regionally. Walmart has also concentrated way too much power, but that's the 800 lb gorilla no one wants to touch. That said, gas stations and grocery stores deal in commodity products. The video game companies are much more integrated with many games that will only run on one system, stores will only run on one type of hardware, and games are not transferrable between competitor systems. Competition is extremely restrained because of these exclusive and limited distribution agreements. The fact that they all maintain the same line on prices is a very clear signal of cartel behavior when you take the context into account - they are using control of a distribution chokepoint to control competition and pricing power. That's the essence of why antitrust laws passed in the first place. reply s1artibartfast 7 hours agorootparentI dont have an opinion on regional monopoly, just the cartel issue, because I almost never hear it used correctly. reply selectodude 7 hours agorootparentprevEpic has a game store charging 12 percent and nobody seems to care much about it. reply arrosenberg 7 hours agorootparentProbably has to do with market power.

Epic had to pay developers, a lot, to bootstrap the Epic store so that there were games there that mattered. And even now, with a decent selection, most PC gamers still use Steam. Because all their games are on Steam already. And every game they care about is on Steam. So Steam can charge 30% and Epic can charge 12% and nothing really changes. reply kevingadd 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is not accurate. Do more research. Steam has a tiered cut they introduced to keep big players on their store, for example. Google and Apple both offer a lower rate for small business. And alternative stores on PC successfully operate with much lower cuts (EGS, GOG, itch, humble). It's not \"in line with the rest of the industry\", it's \"no higher than the other bad ones\".

No, because like all things, it's about how you use it. Per the FTC - Exclusive dealing and exclusive distribution arrangements may be anticompetitive, however, if they are used to raise rivals' costs, exclude (or foreclose) competition, or facilitate tacit collusion. Exclusive dealing contracts may raise rivals' costs when the contracts are made with so many retailers, and lock up so much capacity at the retail level, that competing manufacturers are unable to attain minimum efficient scale in either the production or the distribution functions. Apple is dealing with itself - maybe that argument holds in court (certainly has a shot with the current junta). It would certainly help if Congress would update the law for the 21st century. It's close enough to the line that it can be argued, and they are clearly nervous about it. > How about this: Apple can charge Epic the same outrageous* 12% that Epic charges game developers.

Raising the rev share they take makes the developers less incintivized to develop for the platform. Lowering the rev share makes developers more incentivized to develop for the platform. Apple is competing against other app platforms over developers of which there is a limited amount of. So for Apple to lower the amount they take there would need to be another platform that is stealing developers from Apple's ecosystem. If developers stop developing apps for Apple's devices then that makes them less desirable for users so they would be incintivized to let developers keep a bigger portion of the revenue. reply Someone 9 hours agorootparentprev> Vertical integration is illegal.

Not at all. Both the district court as well as the 9th circuit who affirmed the district court’s judgment explicitly stated that only the anti-steering guideline needs to be scrapped, that Apple is still entitled to their commission because it serves as payment for their IP and that Apple would be entitled to include an auditing provision in their developer agreement. In fact, the courts noted how cumbersome this auditing process and after the fact collection of the commission would be. In other words, this is not only fully sanctioned by the courts, but the expected outcome. > But at the same time they put in as much friction as they could, including reframing the charge to developer as a lead commission There was no reframing. It was always defined as such. Or to be more specific, the developer agreement always designated Apple as an agent to the developer, akin to a literary agent, and explicitly defined the commission as a payment for those agent services and Apple’s IP. The commission has also never legally been tied to IAP or payment through the App Store, but rather directly tied to sales in general. All the big parties that are now acting “shocked” that Apple would do this, such as Epic and Spotify, etc, have well paid legal departments that explained all of the above to the people in charge, so none of this is a surprise to any of them. They just bank on you not knowing so you’ll be a willing pawn in their push to make their profits go up. > Of course epic is going to challenge the spirit of the implementation but this definitely makes it murkier - can you still claim a monopoly if developers can technically allow purchase outside and have a choice?

Epic charges $100 per game in their store, vs. Apple's $99/yr for access to the store, and the latest tools. This is pretty much a wash, unless you're not regularly releasing games. Epic charges 12% for their game store. For most developers, those earning less than $1M, Apple charges 15%. So again, pretty much a wash. Epic doesn't take a fee for DLC if games use their own payment system, but presumably takes the same 12% if you use them (it's not at all clear)... but one of the benefits Apple gives customers is that you don't give your payment details to everyone, decreasing the odds it gets mishandled. Again, smaller devs aren't going to have a lot of DLC, or DLC revenue, and would have to pay someone to handle all the transactions. Epic also uses its market power to direct large customers to use their store. It waives Unreal Engine fees for anyone using Epic as a payment processor, which would normally be 5% if you go over $1M in sales.... for those large customers: $1M+ Using unreal: Apple would be 30%, plus 5% to Epic. + 30% DLC PC/Steam would be 30% to steam, plus 5% to Epic. + 30% DLC PC/Epic 12% to Epic for Epic store+Unreal. + 12% DLC $1M+ Not Unreal: Apple would be 30%. + 30% DLC PC/Steam would be 30% to steam. + 30% DLC PC/Epic 12% to Epic for Epic store. + 12% DLC The fight, most likely, is over these numbers. Instead of being an extra 3% for a small developer, it's an extra 18-23% for the larger developers. A large enough percent of a large enough pie to fight for. Does that make Apple evil? Epic would have you think so. But Epic also just needed to layoff a bunch of people, despite Fortnite being a money printing machine, despite their Engine royalties, and despite their own store's fees. Sure, Apple has cash to spare, but should we really be legally forcing Apple to adopt a business model that is failing Epic itself? I'm not so keen on forcing successful businesses to ruin themselves. Especially when the claimed reasons for doing so don't seem to make any sense, and don't benefit who they claim to benefit.

Steam does not sell iOS software. They sell games for Mac, Windows and Linux which you can buy also directly or at a competitor such as GOG, if the developer chooses to. To sell into the iOS ecosystem as a Dev you can only do it via Apple so far. Epic wants to sell their own iOS multiplayer games and in app lootboxes without forking 30% to Apple.

So I don’t think there’s much insight to be added there. But you do bring up an interesting point by mentioning sideloading. The courts have established in this case that Apple can charge their commission regardless on the premise that it’s a payment in exchange for the use of their IP. All in all not a shocking decision really because it just continues on the standing law regarding property rights. But it might have ramifications for sideload apps, unless you really want to get down and dirty those will be using Apple’s IP as well and in some cases there’s not even an alternative unless the iPhone is jailbroken. Because the developers of those app will be using Apple’s IP, Apple can extract payment from them. Perhaps not the full 30% because presumably they wouldn’t have agreed to Apple’s developer agreement, but it won’t be $0 either. Similar legal gaps exist in the impending EU regulation. Believe it or not, they too have well established property rights surrounding IP and there too there are courts who will be the final arbiters in this. Many seem to think that just because the EU says or does something it’s the law of the land, but like with legislation in the US it can be fought and I’d say even more so there because a lot of the regulations originate from the EU Commission, which is just the EU’s sparkling executive branch.

Both from my own personal experience helping friends and family as well as professional experience working in IT the act of switching away from apple is always an incredibly stressful and more often than not a significantly disruptive event for the user. A good example here is the elderly. The energy and effort that goes into learning how to use a new phone is significant for most people 70+ and a huge factor when they're trying to decide to upgrade or switch their current phone. Very often, this daunting task is legitimately not worth it for them even if it that means letting apple take advantage of them simply because they don't think or truly know that they don't have the bandwidth to take on learning another smart phone. Here you have a vulnerable class of people who just can't simply switch over to another OS even when they have the means, ripe for financial abuse. Apple is a multi-trillion dollar company and governments ought to be doing whatever needs to be done to protect the millions of people who are functionally stuck using their platform from being abused. In regards to the rest of your comment I don't feel knowledgeable enough to comment. All I really wanted to say is: (a) millions of people are negatively impacted by this to the benefit of a small few. (b) a huge majority of those people likely aren't aware that they're being taken advantage of and even if they did, a meaningful amount of them couldn't do much about it without some help and/or incurring considerable amounts of stress throughout the switch. (c) What Apple is doing here is exactly the behavior I believe governments ought to be trying to prevent. reply robertlagrant 44 minutes agorootparent> millions of people are negatively impacted by this to the benefit of a small few. Can you justify this? These sorts of phones were unthinkable only 20 years ago, even for a billionaire and now they're extremely affordable.

They haven't done as much with UE or any other tools, outside of actually charging for non-games (I'm honestly surprised that the Mandelorian was able to be made with no kick back to Epic at all). Historically Epic has been relatively lenient for how it taxes developers. Say what you want about Sweeny and Fortnite and the Games Store, but I can definitely tell he still takes pride and empathizes with being in the gamedev trenches once upon a time. Can't say that about too many other gaming execs of today. reply aurareturn 8 hours agorootparentThey're developer friendly because they're trying to get marketshare. They're competing with market leader in Steam which charges 30%. Don't think for a second that they wouldn't charge 30% once they get enough market power. In fact, in the Apple lawsuit, it was revealed that the Epic Game Store was operating on a $300-$400m loss in order to acquire marketshare. Epic has to increase commission fees in order to break even and make a profit eventually. Epic isn't a non-profit. Here's a preview how they might treat customers of their own app store if they have market power: Epic Games, the company responsible for Fortnite, agreed to pay $245 million to settle FTC allegations related to in-game purchases. According to the FTC, the company charged parents and gamers of all ages for unwanted items and locked the accounts of customers who disputed wrongful charges with their credit card companies. https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds reply nirvdrum 7 hours agorootparentIsn’t that how competition works? Ideally, no company becomes so large that they don’t feel the pressure to remain competitive. Of course there’s countless examples of big players stagnating and becoming rent collectors with a captive market. But, I see that as all the more reason to have competition. I think it’s rather optimistic to believe the Epic Games Store going to overtake Steam. If that’s the criteria for raising their cut, I wouldn’t expect it to happen anytime soon. Outside of annoying exclusive distribution rights on some games, having another store has given game developers another way to sell and players a way to purchase games cheaper. With that said, I’d guess their real gambit is to create enough pressure to drive the standard 30% down. Maybe 30% made sense at one point. Maybe it does now. It strikes me that there have been efficiencies that haven’t been passed along to the consumer. Having a competitive market would let us find out. reply johnnyanmac 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm still optimistic, but I wouldn't be completely gobsmacked if I was wrong. I would have argued 20 years ago Valve would have done more to lock in their market (I was kind of right, but they are much more clever with it and it doesn't impact consumers). I also would have argued 20 years ago that Sony would topple Nintendo in the portable market. >Here's an example showing how they're just like any other company: They aren't really too special on the consumer facing front, I agree.

It must be consistent without exceptions (i.e. not just Amazon). The issue is not the gratuitous fee, it is the lack of choice. iOS is more ubiquitous than macOS yet more restrictive--it cannot last.

The argument that it's their App Store and therefore they can do whatever they want is a dubious defence. They owe their loyal developers more than this. reply nostromo 9 hours agoparentI will risk an avalanche of downvotes and steel man Apple's argument. :) Have you ever gotten stuck with a monthly fee for something that's hard to cancel? It's a real pain the butt, no? But that never really happens on Apple devices, because Apple makes it incredibly easy to cancel subscriptions. You don't have to call anyone, you don't have to struggle with a bad website -- you just click cancel on your phone and it's done. And it's all in one place too -- no bank statement required. They are also a check on other dark patterns, like silently increasing charges without a clear notification to customers. I don't even get spammed because Apple proxies my emails from app developers. One of the main reasons I buy things from Apple (on my device) and Amazon (if it's a physical good) is so that I have a company I sorta trust to do the right thing if things go sideways (cancelations, returns, fraud, etc.). Once every app developer is pushing me to enter my credit card on their website, that all goes out the window. Dark patterns common on the web and on Android will take over the iOS ecosystem too. I also am going to take an unpopular opinion and say that Apple probably earns that fee. The fact that Android isn't that valuable to app developers proves that Apple's reputation and standards are what drives a lot of their app store revenue. App devs feel like they're providing all the value, but I suspect it's often not truly the case. I know this is an unpopular opinion amongst us devs. I don't even know if I truly buy these arguments, but I thought it'd be more interesting here if there was at least one comment defending Apple. reply OsrsNeedsf2P 9 hours agorootparentThe main argument that you buy Apple because you can trust the payment system doesn't really go against the anticompetitive argument Epic is making.

It sounds shocking and unfair, but if you read what they said they point out that this is a pretty standard practice among similar industries. The App Store isn’t just a payment processor.

That SDK saves you the effort of writing all that code yourself as the app developer. The court from the start basically declared that this is what everyone else does. Epic themselves operate this way - check out the licensing model for Unreal Engine. There was no antitrust issue being litigated here. We can all believe that there should be, but there isn’t, and this isn’t the right type of court for that issue.

I was a mobile app developer at the time and before the App Store the usual way for people to buy games on their phones was by sending an SMS to a shortcode. You would then get a reverse-billing SMS (a.k.a. premium SMS) with the download link. The telco’s would usually take around a 50% commission on that SMS. 50% of your revenue, for delivering up to 140 bytes to a phone. Note that delivering a message was the only thing they did. You had to write the code to handle the incoming SMS message and send the reply. You had to host this service and serve the downloads (meaning you had to also pay for hosting and bandwidth). You also had to set this up for every single country you want to offer it in. None of this was discoverable, so you had to advertise your game/app as well. Also, the development tools were absolute shit (and you had to pay for those as well). In comes Apple, who lets you keep 70%, provides excellent dev tools (I know it’s trendy to hate on Xcode, but even early versions of Xcode were heaven compared to the absolute shit show we had to deal with before). They host the app, they make it discoverable in their app store, they handle payments and make it all available worldwide. So yeah, I’d say it was more than reasonable.

More broadly — a competitive market would allow innovation on many many variables, not just different rent-taking numbers. reply danbruc 8 hours agorootparentprevThe cost of distributing an app is not tied to its price, it probably mostly depends on things like size and so should be a reasonable prize. reply johnnyanmac 8 hours agorootparentprevI think 30% is reasonable in a vacuum. But as a TLDR for a long winded rant: I don't care what a distributor takes as long as I have other options (even if it's economically inefficient. That just proves their rate is the best option) . And IOS gave none until this crumb of an olive branch popped up. But what's happening is that this 30% is more or less a lock-in cost for the only official way to do business on IOS. And before this ruling, you weren't even allowed to mention in the app that consumers can also pay on your website. And now we come to this article saying \"okay, you can show your website were still going to charge you 90% of our rate despite handling none of those transactions\". And that's where things get really dicey. With this new perspective, the question shifts to \"is apple's 27% for distribution (minus payment processing) reasonable?\" and I'm less sure. Especially when Apple can throw out my app for any reason whatsoever. To use android for comparison, I can throw an APK up to download with relatively minimal effort, with zero regards for Google's rules and I owe Google 0% of my revenue. They still take 30% for using Google play as distribution. But it's nice knowing I could theoretically host it elsewhere if I don't agree with Google's pricing (minus some bribing issues Google is currently being taken to court for). There's none of that for Apple. Firefox is just a Safari skin because Apple says so. Emulator apps are in flux based on Apple's whims. Your app may be taken down for nudity as Apple profits millions from a few dozen games that barely try to hide it. reply hnfong 6 hours agorootparent> I don't care what a distributor takes as long as I have other options > this 30% is more or less a lock-in cost for the only official way to do business on IOS As an app developer you're pretty much \"screwed\" TBH. You don't have a choice as to what platform your users choose (as long as you want to be in the market). Let's say Apple allows sideloading, but it is somewhat tedious and most users choose to stick to the official App Store -- then you're back to where you were, because you still want to sell your app/services to the users who stick to the official app store, and presumably your app is not so essential that users will actively switch if you dropped support for the official App Store. If as an app developer you could influence the platform your users choose, then you would have asked them to move to Android and directly download your APK already, instead of bickering with the App Store (or even Google play store). The fact that you aren't proves that you're still at mercy to your users decisions, and whether they decide installing your app via sideloading is worth the trouble. I'm not trying to denigrate you, but I suspect you might have unrealistically rosy expectations of the world where Apple is forced to allow sideloading. reply danbruc 33 minutes agorootparentLet's say Apple allows sideloading, but it is somewhat tedious and most users choose to stick to the official App Store [...] There is no reason that sideloading is tedious. If it is, then that is a deliberierte choice, going from no sideloading to no sideloading that anybody will care to use. Just as Microsoft was forced to suggest alternative browsers to users instead of simply bundling Windows with Internet Explorer and Edge, one could even imagine to force Apple to let the user pick an alternative app store during setup. reply jkestner 7 hours agorootparentprevA good way to find out would be to let the market choose from other app stores. reply tstrimple 8 hours agorootparentprevThey are the terms the developers on the platform agreed to. reply paulddraper 8 hours agorootparentThat is the correct answer to a different question reply dvt 10 hours agoprevFeels like Apple is really tempting fate at this point. They essentially won v. Epic (as of yesterday, SCOTUS rejected the appeal). I'm not sure why they feel so emboldened to add a 27% tax on web purchases as well. Completely wild, but I guess shareholder value must always go up. reply threeseed 10 hours agoparentBecause this isn't a tax on web purchases. As a developer you need to pay the 30% commission similar to how if you're using Unreal Engine you need to pay 5%. You can legitimately argue this fee is way too high but the courts have already said that they are allowed to charge it. reply ado__dev 10 hours agorootparentI don't think the issue is how high the fee is, the issue is Apple forcing developers to use their payments platform. Apple is within its right to charge whatever they want. Unreal Engine is free to charge whatever fee they want. But you're not forced to use UE. You are forced to use Apple IAP system, or their alternative now, is to allow you to use your own system, but still pay them a ridiculous fee, for what exactly? reply matthew-wegner 9 hours agorootparentFrom apps. That Apple is hosting, and providing testing and updating machinery for, along with many backend services, SDKs, etc. What is the fair price for that? 27% is absurdly high, for sure, but you seem to be arguing from a position that it should be free...? The other large discussion thread has already been linked with more specifics. The very short version is that Apple has been arguing the fees are to run their services, and the commission has historically been a convenient way to collect them. This is them collecting those fees outside of their payment systems, because legally they have to allow such a thing. So you could release an app for \"free\" on the app store, and require side channel payment to really use it. You're just going to have to pay for the quotation marks. reply insane_dreamer 10 hours agorootparentprev> You are forced to use Apple IAP system only if you want to release your app on Apple's platform; you're free to release it on Android, Windows, Linux, Unreal, etc., each of which has their own set of fees (or none) reply threeseed 10 hours agorootparentprevAs a developer I am not forced to write iOS apps. Just like I am not forced to use Unreal Engine. Apple charges 30% if you do choose. Epic charges 5%. Apple argues that what you're paying for includes SDKs. Epic does too. reply cyberax 8 hours agorootparent> As a developer I am not forced to write iOS apps. Yes, you are. If you're writing a mobile app, you HAVE to support iOS or go bankrupt. There are no other options. Welcome to the land of monopolies. reply insane_dreamer 10 hours agorootparentprev> you're not forced to use UE. you are forced to pay Epic 5% of sales (if your game makes more than $1 million), so pretty much like Apple (fees are lower of course) reply ado__dev 9 hours agorootparentBut again, you have the choice of not using Epic. You can use Unity, or any other game engine, or even make your own if you're so inclined. With Apple, you don't have a choice if you want to be on iOS (which has close to 60% marketshare in the US). And I'm not arguing that apple needs to reduce the fee. They can charge whatever they want for their IAP system. But, other companies that have software/services that are cross-platform, should be allowed to use their own payment processors without paying additional fees to apple imo. Apple should be able to put up the message that hey, you're leaving our ecosystem, you're on your own, blah blah. But I don't see a reason why they should also get a cut at that point. reply dkonofalski 9 hours agorootparentiOS is not a market segment. Smartphones is the segment and so you do have a choice. The courts have already ruled that Apple doesn't have a monopoly in their segment. reply asadotzler 8 hours agorootparentThat's not what the courts have been saying lately. iOS app distribution and Android app distribution have both been called relevant markets in recent trails. reply insane_dreamer 8 hours agorootparentprevreleasing on Unity instead of Unreal is similar to releasing on Android instead of iOS reply thaumasiotes 5 hours agorootparentNot especially; if you release on Android but not iOS, the customers that you would have reached on iOS are not reachable. (Except for the people who simultaneously use an iPhone and an Android phone...) Nothing similar is the case for Unity vs Unreal; the customer base is the same either way. reply carlosjobim 8 hours agorootparentprev> With Apple, you don't have a choice if you want to be on iOS And with Epic, you don't have a choice if you want to use the Unreal Engine. How can this argument go on and on and on? All your arguments can be used in reverse with the Apple competitors. Nobody is forced into anything, especially not developers. reply grishka 10 hours agoparentprev> I'm not sure why they feel so emboldened Because they feel like they own the relationship between the user and the developer by virtue of it happening on a device they made, regardless of how much their contribution, if any, was to the formation of that relationship in the first place. reply insane_dreamer 10 hours agorootparentthe same could be said of any game developed on Unreal and required to pay an (admittedly lower) percent to Epic reply grishka 9 hours agorootparentYou have a choice to use a different engine to build your game (including rolling your own). You don't have a choice to not use the app store to distribute your iOS app. reply dkonofalski 9 hours agorootparentYes, you do. You have the choice to put your App on Google Play or host it yourself and make it available for Android. reply grishka 8 hours agorootparentI'm talking about iOS apps specifically. Don't pretend that not making your app available for the second most popular mobile OS is acceptable. reply dkonofalski 8 hours agorootparentYou're not forced to make apps for iOS or any Apple product. Making your app for the second most popular OS is acceptable because that's what iOS is. I know you tried to make it seem like Android is but, worldwide, Android is far more popular than iOS. The fact that there even is a 2nd most popular mobile OS proves that Apple doesn't have a monopoly. reply grishka 8 hours agorootparentThat doesn't make it any easier for people who have iPhones but can't install your app because your app is incompatible with whatever Apple demands. Trust me, most people who buy iPhones are completely oblivious to the app store rules and review process. reply heavyset_go 8 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, iOS has the majority of the market share, so it is the first most popular mobile OS. reply grishka 1 hour agorootparentAnd in Japan iirc. In the rest of the world, though, the usual situation is around 2/3 Android and 1/3 iOS. reply jchook 10 hours agorootparentprevThat's not an apt comparison because Apple banned alternative app stores from their devices. reply jasode 10 hours agoparentprev> I'm not sure why they feel so emboldened to add a 27% tax on web purchases as well. Because the judge's ruling still left the option open for Apple to continue to charge a commission fee for external payment processors. Over 2 years ago, observers correctly predicted that Apple would still charge 30% for external payments. Example story: https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/14/apple-can-still-charge-its-ap... So Apple's new policy in 2024 is no surprise and the only difference is that Apple is charging 27% instead of the predicted 30%. reply lolinder 9 hours agoparentprevThey feel emboldened because the judge specifically called out that this was the most likely outcome from them being forced to unbundle their payment processor: > First, and most significant, as discussed in the findings of facts, IAP is the method by which Apple collects its licensing fee from developers for the use of Apple’s intellectual property. Even in the absence of IAP, Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission. > In such a hypothetical world, developers could potentially avoid the commission while benefitting from Apple's innovation and intellectual property free of charge. The Court presumes that in such circumstances that Apple may rely on imposing and utilizing a contractual right to audit developers annual accounting to ensure compliance with its commissions, among other methods. Of course, any alternatives to IAP (including the foregoing) would seemingly impose both increased monetary and time costs to both Apple and the developers. https://casetext.com/case/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc-2 reply FreeTrade 8 hours agoprevA law requiring hardware manufacturers to allow owners to run any software on their device would solve a lot of these Apple problems over time. Thats the root of the problem. Apple has a monopoly on the social status associated with their devices, and leverages the monopoly in many unscrupulous and toxic ways. I consider Apple the most cynical and toxic of all the tech giants. reply lolinder 7 hours agoparent> Apple has a monopoly on the social status associated with their devices, and leverages the monopoly in many unscrupulous and toxic ways. Status-signaling consumer products are always overpriced. It's what makes them useful as status signals. You used to buy expensive impractical clothes to show you could afford to buy expensive impractical clothes. Now you buy Apple devices to show that you can afford to buy overpriced tech. If you bring the price of the status symbol down to a more natural level it ceases to be a status symbol. Apple's defense of their control over the platform (and the higher-than-necessary prices they charge) isn't destructive to consumer welfare, it's the very thing consumers are paying for. reply CydeWeys 8 hours agoparentprevOh I wouldn't put it past Apple to take away your blue bubbles (or whichever one is the \"good\" one) if you do install non-Apple, non-Apple-app-store software on your phone. reply s1artibartfast 7 hours agoparentprevyou would also have to require them to ship software tools and actively support development by those that want to use their devices. reply jojobas 7 hours agorootparentYes, break them up and require hardware-apple to treat software-apple on the same terms as any other software vendor.

What should be surprising is that developers willingly submit themselves to be tolled. Of course, the web platform is \"worse\" since it cannot utilize native capabilities until the mobile OS's support it via the browser, but it's toll free.

    "title": "Why I Love Obsidian: Enhancing Note-Taking and Productivity",
    "originLink": "https://www.ddanieltan.com/posts/obsidian/",
    "originBody": "Why I like Obsidian obsidian A tool that helps me manage pretty much everything Author Daniel Tan Published January 17, 2024 The start of my Obsidian journey 21 January 2021, that’s the date I created in my first note in my Obsidian vault. Back then, it was just an experiment in my ongoing quest to find the perfect note-taking tool. Evernote, Roam Research, and even the good ol’ pen and paper took their turns on my desk. But ever since I started using Obsidian, I never used another tool again. Since that day, Obsidian has been my constant companion through learning adventures, career changes, study sessions, and moments of personal reflection. What started as a simple app transformed into an indispensable tool, the backstage manager of my life, keeping everything in check. Obsidian’s Features What really makes Obsidian unique? I think it boils down to 3 features: 1. Obsidian allows structure to grow organically Most note-taking tools require you to decide upon the structure of your note before you record the note. For example, say I am taking notes while going through one of deeplearning.ai’s excellent Generative AI LLM courses, before writing down my notes, I might have to decide on my folder structure. Perhaps I should structure my notes by their topic ├── Instruction Fine Tuning │ ├── Single Task │ └── Multi Task ├── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) ├── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA) ├── Model Evaluation Metrics └── LLM benchmarks Or perhaps I should structure my notes based by date so I can track my learning progress over time ├── 2024-01-01 ├── 2024-01-02 │ └── Instruction Fine Tuning ├── 2024-01-03 │ └── Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) ├── 2024-01-04 │ └── Low Rank Adaption of LLMs (LoRA) └── 2024-01-05 Either way could be valid, depending on how I plan to revise and reorganise my notes in the future. But having to decide upon a structure upfront before I get the chance to start recording my notes never feels good. Internal Links Obsidian offers a powerful feature to solve this problem - Internal Links. Here is an example of Internal Links in action: By wrapping any idea/noun/topic in double [[]] brackets Obsidian creates a dedicated new notes for that item, as well as the connection between the note I am currently taking and the one that was just created. In this short paragraph, I have linked both a date 2024-01-02 and several key topics e.g. (In-context learning), which means that when I want to revisit or reorganise my notes, I can do so either by topic or by date. With internal links, I enjoy keeping my notes in a flat hierachy but I have seen vaults that still prefer folders. Obsidian supports both preferences equally well 🙂 This flexibility enables me to build my vault out with an organic structure that adapts to my learning needs. 2. Obsidian helps me link atomic ideas into greater understanding Knowledge is a mosaic crafted from interconnected ideas. What my vault started as What my vault grew into Here is the graph view of my Obsidian vault in my 1st year. Every node in this graph is a single note. It is clear that when I was first starting out, I was writing down disparate, unconnected notes. I was probably writing down a lot of interesting ideas, but I had not taken the time to connect these ideas to gain a broader understanding. As I continued using Obsidian, I started to link notes together. This could be done either when the notew was first created, or when I scheduled time to review these notes again. Soon, I saw clusters of ideas organically forming into broader topics. My deep dive into Scala, my exploration of Causal Inference and a whole variety of subjects that interest me came out of these clusters. And today, I have a nice graphical topology of sorts that represents my learning journey and keeps me motivated. 3. Obsidian’s choice to work with plain text files make it future-proof Lastly, my favourite feature of Obsidian is that by deafault, it chooses to work with plain text files. This simple decision means that Obsidian notes: Can be used offline Can be editted with any text editor Can be viewed with a variety of text readers Can be easily synced on iCloud, Dropbox or using git Is yours, forever! Obsidian’s CEO Steph Ango wrote a dedicated blog post on this philosophy that went deeper into this philosophy. He shared that all software is ephemeral and Obsidian wants to give people ownership over their own data, which is an approach that builds trust for its users.

    "commentBody": "Why I Like Obsidian (ddanieltan.com)267 points by ddanieltan 20 hours agohidepastfavorite326 comments dustincoates 20 hours agoI like Obsidian, too, having recently switched over from 9 years of OneNote (the fact that there's a tool to import my OneNote notes helped a lot). The most important tip for getting started with Obsidian, in my mind, is to absolutely ignore all of the Obsidian \"power users.\" I'm 99% convinced that no one actually uses zettelkasten seriously, but even if so, it's overkill for when you're just checking out the app. And, please, don't buy one of these $500 Obsidian courses. It's just not necessary. With that said, I have started extending out my own setup, and one of the plugins that I like the most is DataView, which allows me to automatically link to other notes, or pull in tagged text, or to-do items. It has allowed me to really take daily recaps reliably for the first time ever, because, even if I have nothing to write, I at least have a repository of what I was doing for that day. reply behnamoh 19 hours agoparentI tried it a few times but had to stop because: 1. Obsidian imposes its own take on Markdown. For instance, why can't we disable \"indent using the tab key\"? It's so annoying to accidentally indent/quote text while pressing tab to do something like \"accept autocomplete suggestion\". Obsidian's response to users' complaints about this was not reassuring: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/option-to-disable-tab-to-indent/... 2. I had to install tens of plugins to give Obsidian the features I needed, which felt too hacky and unstable in the long term. 3. I don't want to learn a new set of keyboard shortcuts for simple things like expand/collapse the sidebars. You can customize lots of things but at that point, why not stay in your IDE (e.g., VSCode) and simply add Vim Wiki extenions? reply geoelectric 4 hours agorootparentYeah, I wasn’t super-thrilled with their response. OTOH, I eventually came back to using it, my (arguably justified) snit in that thread notwithstanding. I kept trialing alternatives like VimWiki, Joplin and Logseq, but everything else is even quirkier. Org-mode is about the only thing that seemed really competitive, but since I’m not an emacs person there’s a big ramp there for me. Plus, as with most of the alternatives, that loses Markdown compatibility entirely. Re learn new hotkeys, that’s actually not been a huge issue. Most of them simply aren’t mapped by default, which is its own pain. I did a lot of bouncing between VSCode hotkey lists and the Obsidian hotkeys UI to align shortcuts. At least they do enable you to remap most every UI action. I haven’t used the built-in vim bindings, but supposedly they also work fairly well, fwiw. For now, Obsidian + Obsidian Tasks just does way too good a job for my work journaling for me to completely ignore. Plugins do work around most of the more questionable behavior, though it does sometimes make for an inconsistent experience. reply muwtyhg 16 hours agorootparentprev> Obsidian's response to users' complaints about this was not reassuring This is my main worry about choosing Obsidian for the long run. The devs seem very opinionated about a system that is meant to be customizable to each user's workflow. Their Vim implementation does not support setting hard line breaks, making modal editing a little funky (every paragraph is just one long line and any action working on a line will work on the entire paragraph, such as \"dd\"). Came from Vim-Wiki (and Org-mode and some other short-lived note-taking systems) and I think the plugin hell of Vim/Emacs (or VS Code) is much worse than Obsidian. You can get by without any addons in Obsidian as it's built to be a notetaking system first, not a general text editor. You can't do the same with Vim (hence needing \"Vim-Wiki\" plugin). reply rchaud 15 hours agorootparentI've also noticed that Obsidian hides text automatically inside ofor other HTML elements if they contain the property \"markdown='1'\", thereby blocking you from writing perfectly valid HTML inside of a Markdown file which was designed to be HTML-compatible. reply pcthrowaway 11 hours agorootparentIs the markdown=1 attribute part of the HTML spec? I can't find any indication that it is. reply awill 18 hours agorootparentprevAgree. I generally dislike relying on a bunch of third party plugins. Over time they don't get updated and you're left with a mess. reply behnamoh 18 hours agorootparentThis, and also since they're not built by one team/dev, sometimes they don't play well with each other. reply woleium 17 hours agorootparentsounds like we need an opinionated supported remix version? Seems like there are a few folks here who would get involved… reply johnmaguire 17 hours agorootparentprev> I don't want to learn a new set of keyboard shortcuts for simple things like expand/collapse the sidebars. You can customize lots of things but at that point, why not stay in your IDE (e.g., VSCode) and simply add Vim Wiki extenions? This is what I used to do with Vim, but I had two problems: (1) I would often forget to `git push`, (2) I wanted to easily access notes on my phone. Importing into Obsidian and paying for Sync made both issues go away. reply imbnwa 17 hours agorootparentCould write your notes to a dir in your iCloud folder or equivalent; bind keys to the dir in netrw or whatever your choice of filetree explorer plugin reply dsp_person 17 hours agorootparentprevFor #2 could you share some of the plugins you needed? reply behnamoh 17 hours agorootparentOff the top of my head, things like \"Paste URL into Text\" (which VSCode Markdown supports out-of-the-box), an extension for being able to define shortcuts for heading 1, 2, etc., connecting to Zotero, converting links to Markdown before exporting PDF, exporting PDF using pandoc templates, \"Zoom\" in sections while hiding the other sections (it was a neat extension), etc. reply akkad33 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat note taking system do you recommend ? reply singhrac 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat were the features that you needed from Obsidian? reply BenFranklin100 19 hours agoparentprevAs a heavy OneNote user, I was stymied by Obsidian for a long while as the mental models are different. OneNote is best thought of as an actual paper notebook, where pages can inserted, re-arranged to one’s liking, images pasted into the page, etc.. Obsidian is better thought of as a sophisticated overlay to the file system. It’s ultimately more powerful than OneNote, but does have some frustrating limitations for the OneNote/Notion/Scrivener user as not being able to manually sort notes. For now I’m using both but ultimately will switch to Obsidian as it develops (hopefully) further. reply smusamashah 18 hours agoparentprevAs a OneNote person for two years now, how do you deal with the added friction of linear notes in Obsidian (or any other plaintext based tool)? In OneNote I can just dump down anything literally anywhere (because each page is an infinite canvas). It feels as easy as having a pen and random free papers. But with my notes increasing, I do want to have some way to manage this data which OneNote fails at. I can do basic text/OCR search but that's it. There is no linking etc. All note management is manual. I usually search for an actual open source OneNote alternative (with easy jottable infinite canvases) every 6 months or so. Obsidian has added Canvases but they are definitely not a OneNote alternative at the moment. reply behnamoh 17 hours agorootparentI never understood the appeal of infinite canvas. Something about it makes me feel like I'm not in full control of my notes/documents. I like it when the information is clearly structured. reply smusamashah 17 hours agorootparentI don't use the width of the canvas, but what I do love/appreciate is the way I can click anywhere and start writing. It feels as easy as pen and paper. I can go in any direction. It doesn't have to be infinite canvas in practice, just allow enough width and length to let you put down your cursor anywhere and start writing/pasting images or whatever you wish. reply mey 17 hours agorootparentObsidian added a Canvas document type in the last year that you may be interested in. https://obsidian.md/canvas reply smusamashah 16 hours agorootparentTried it and this canvas is nowhere close to OneNote at the moment. It is very janky if you do try to use it like OneNote. reply vondur 16 hours agorootparentprevI use OneNote at work, but it's just for mostly plain text and a few images pasted here and there. However, OneNote seems to get really flaky when the Notebooks themselves become too big or have too many PDF attachments inserted. reply dustincoates 14 hours agorootparentprevI ultimately just didn't end up missing it as much as enjoying what I gained. I do miss how in OneNote I could keep a list of study questions next to the notes, but it's okay that I don't have it in the end, because I'm taking better notes in Obsidian. reply bloopernova 18 hours agoparentprevI tried zettlekasten and found I just didn't use it enough to justify the effort involved. Instead I just have an org-mode folder that I dump documents in. I search across them with Deft in Emacs. Sure, the links between documents can be incredibly useful to some people, but I've found I'm more chaotic than that. reply kstrauser 17 hours agorootparentI’ve written off Zettelkasten. It’s not for me. It seems to be optimized for turning notes into publications, but that’s not my own goal behind taking notes. For me, good ol’ wiki style interlinking is much more useful (and vastly easier). I use the “Map of Content” ideas to have a few quick indexes, like “Current work projects” or “orders from restaurants we like”, but that’s about the most formal organization I do. If I had a career in writing, I might seriously consider Zettelkasten. But even then, I’d be cautious with its output. I’ve seen some results that looked like it was great for shoving words onto paper, so long as you don’t worry about the quality of the end result. reply JoeJonathan 16 hours agorootparentI do write for a living, and I found Zettelkasten too high friction to be worth using. Plus, as Cal Newport has argued, it solves the wrong problem. The whole pitch of ZK is that you can jump into your notes and quickly generate new ideas. But experienced writers and researchers rarely struggle to come up with ideas—rather, the real challenge is execution. reply kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentHuh, interesting! That makes sense, though. We're all suckers for processes that promise to solve all your problems, aren't we? reply safety1st 18 hours agorootparentprevI have read a bit about Zettelkasten and watched a video explaining it, and to me it feels like a pretty random collection of mostly good ideas on organizing information. Right up there with drinking coffee on exactly two specific days per week... https://zettelkasten.de/posts/practical-integration-deep-wor... I think this stuff is esoteric and personal enough that we are under no obligation to follow it to the letter. reply jslakro 12 hours agorootparentEsoteric and personal are both adjectives I didn't find before to describe what Zettelkasten represents.

And when I notice a really important group of pages I make an index page. reply ssgodderidge 19 hours agoparentprev100% agree. The barrier to using Obsidian can seem intimidatingly high before jumping in. I tried and failed a few different systems before I just started using the daily notes as scratch pads. From there, I figured out more and more slowly over time. I’m now at a kind of system that works for me, but probably won’t work for anyone else. This is the way. reply theshrike79 16 hours agorootparentObsidian has the sama problem as Bullet Journaling does. It's really simple and not complicated unless you want it to be, but then you watch a video about one Mega User who is really into the System and get demoralised by the amount of crap and whizbangs you see. reply rchaud 15 hours agorootparentWhy would anybody get demoralized? Does the tool get the job done or not? Your goals are not the same as the person making a Youtube video. Nobody's going to put down \"Highly Proficient with Obsidian\" on their resume in hopes of it giving them an edge in the job search. reply npunt 10 hours agorootparentThe problem is that in niche tools / gear / whatever, the message 'you must do it this way' plays to the curiosity and concerns of new users looking to get into something. A cottage industry of people have thus sprung up around providing this content, and recommendation algorithms and search results wind up being dominated by this content. For a new user who's just heard about something, the path is often straight to this content, which then leads some to bouncing off of it because it seems too daunting. reply ssgodderidge 16 hours agorootparentprevyeah exactly. The problem is that the Mega Users are the ones who are most likely to share their system. People who say \"I just use X as a notepad\" aren't as likely to share. reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparentIn case it helps anyone: I use Obsidian as a notepad. I put in text in notes and sometimes put those notes in some folder if it seems to make sense. It works great and the only plugin I added for editing is a latex helper. You don't need a system or many modifications to be a happy Obsidian user. reply jasonpeacock 16 hours agoparentprev\"I'm 99% convinced that no one actually _understands_ zettelkasten\" Fixed that for you ;) For real, anyone interested should go read the original book (How to Take Smart Notes[1]) and you learn that it's not about creating backlinks between your notes (that's just a wiki or personal knowledge base). It's about capturing ideas inspired by your reading, etc. and linking them other ideas. Yes, building your own personal knowledge base can be very powerful, but that's something different. [1] https://a.co/d/5Ntl43P reply 121789 15 hours agorootparentThat was one of the worst books I’ve ever read. I went into it expecting practical advice and found mostly vague hyperbolic promises of the magical benefits. If the hypothesis was that this note taking method produces lower effort, higher quality output, then the author either didn’t use the system or the book is evidence against its effectiveness reply kstrauser 14 hours agorootparentThank you. Those are my thoughts exactly. The title was wrong: it should've been \"Why to Take Smart Notes\". I'd already decided I was interested before I ever bought the book and I wish it hadn't wasted 3/4 of pages trying to further convince me. I finished it and still had no idea how to practically implement the magical system it described. I've also never read a book so packed with redundancy. reply SnowingXIV 9 hours agoparentprevMe too, one of my favorite pieces of software (I've been using Obsidian for a few years now). The fact that there are courses is hilarious, but anyways. I found it enjoyable to start from the absolute bare install and add notes like a regular to-do. Eventually adding up additional plugins that you need. My use case is daily software engineering notes, and I have a simple button/command that creates a new note for the day in a specific format. I love that there isn't so much extra junk that came along with the big note taking apps. Other than that, I have vim mode and a few other things, but not much. Themed it to match the rest of my setup and terminal, it feels like an easy extension to the workflow. I have a few folders broken out for commands and constants I like to refer back to (and can search for!) Maybe a neat one-liner. Plenty of code snippets. reply klum 19 hours agoparentprevAgreed on the power-user stuff and the courses. I use Obsidian in a simple way, but it's nice that the extensibility and the community is there. Unlike VS Code, Obsidian is (for me) an actual example of an Electron app that feels fast. The quick open/command palette features are more responsive than similar features in native Mac apps I've tried. As mentioned elsewhere, users frequently ask for Obsidian to be open source, but the fully transferrable file format is enough for me. I don't think most of those drive-by open-source commenters have thought about the work that goes into running an open-source project. In other words, on some theoretical plane I'd like Obsidian to be an open-source native app, but in reality those things haven't bothered me at all. The app is as simple as I want it to be, as complex as I need it to be, and it's regularly improved in a thoughtful way. reply Ballas 4 hours agorootparent> Unlike VS Code, Obsidian is (for me) an actual example of an Electron app that feels fast. The quick open/command palette features are more responsive than similar features in native Mac apps I've tried. VS Code feels fast to me (on linux), but perhaps I'm just slow. I remember when VS Code came out, I was surprised at how responsive it felt, compared to Atom which felt like typing with a molasses membrane keyboard. Actually, I realize now that I'm using Codium with lots of things disabled that made it less responsive to me (like code completion), so I'm probably an outlier. reply behnamoh 18 hours agorootparentprev> Unlike VS Code, Obsidian is (for me) an actual example of an Electron app that feels fast.

Dude, VSCode is a freaking IDE, running all sorts of processes in the background (at least one terminal, language servers, type checkers, linters and formatters, possibly extensions, etc.) whereas Obsidian is just a text editor. reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparent> running all sorts of processes in the background (at least one terminal, language servers, type checkers, linters and formatters, possibly extensions, etc.) That's a terrible excuse. Your terminal is a separate process and should not affect how the editor itself feels. The language server exists out of process. The linters / type checkers exist out of process. (Or at least shouldn't block the main interaction/GUI thread) If those things make editing slow, either the design or the implementation is bad. Sublime text runs the same stuff for me and works much faster than vscode. No excuses. reply behnamoh 7 hours agorootparent> Sublime text runs the same stuff for me and works much faster than vscode. No excuses. Okay but this discussion is about electron apps. Sublime isn't. reply viraptor 5 hours agorootparentThis is an example for context. We've got 3 cases: Obsidian (non-ide/electron/fast), vscode (ide/electron/slow-ish), sublime (ide/non-electron/fast). My point was that neither the electron not the ide part is an excuse for vscode not being responsive, because we've got counterexamples for each. reply klum 14 hours agorootparentprevNot arguing with that. In discussions about Electron, there are often comments along the lines of \"Electron apps can be fast if done right, just look at VS Code\" and that just doesn't hold true for me. reply georgejfrick 19 hours agorootparentprevYou can paste images now as of the latest version; it was driving me crazy as well.

Completely agree. Not everything needs to be open-sourced. If I'm looking for a framework/library to build something upon, sure, I'll prioritize open-source.

No affiliation, just a happy user for over a year now. If you take kindle highlights when you read, the https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin plugin is amazing for auto generating source files with those highlights in (and other templated sections you wish to include in a review). reply KolenCh 18 hours agoparentprevOne tip I’d have is to go easy on plugins. One can try to explores what are available, but when committing (to have it enabled and relying on it) be cautious about its implications on performance and startup time (there is a setting that can show you plugin load time at every startup.) And as you scales the number of plugins and files, test it on multiple platforms. P.S. I learn this the hard way that each time I open Obsidian on iPhone (14 Pro which is not slow) it will hangs indefinitely without being able to open a file. On iPadOS it is ok albeit slow to start. I suspect it is related to having too many files (including git and git sub modules) inside and relying on iCloud sync. But basically I tested out things works great on Mac without constantly checking how well it works on iPhone and then now I’m in a situation it’s difficult to roll back some of the decisions I made. reply Jakob 18 hours agorootparentiCloud removes files from local storage randomly and downloading them again is very slow and gets stuck often. I think that is the main reason why obsidian hangs at the start on the iPhone. I have not yet figured out, how to keep iCloud files reliably on local storage on iOS. It seems independent of free storage and file size and is driving me mad. Very sad that Apple does not succeed in syncing files. The same issue was there with iTools, mobile me, and now iCloud. reply KolenCh 16 hours agorootparentPeople using Obsidian Sync said it solves these issues (I guess by using a database rather than directly via file I/Os.) There are other solutions via plugins too. E.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, or GitHub. There was a post earlier in HN which is a reimplementation of Obsidian Sync, but it seems their reversed engineering uncovered something not secure there and Obsidian soon made a patch breaking that. There might be workarounds to fix it, but I haven't closely follow it. When I have the time to do the refactoring and cleaning, I will probably choose one of these alternatives (or even an alternative of Obsidian if there are better solutions for me.) reply lolive 14 hours agorootparentAt one moment, WorkingCopy (on iOS) was considered a valid option for syncing Obsidian vaults. reply KolenCh 6 hours agorootparentThat’s what I was alluded to when I mentioned GitHub.

Some more are probably not available there. And an insanely large amount of them also seems to be already broken, abandoned or having a rather poor quality or just duplicating each other's features with a slight twist in flavor.

I'm not suggesting that paying for software is a bad idea, but the free distribution of it led me to believe that it is FOSS, and it is not. https://obsidian.md/pricing reply KolenCh 18 hours agoparentI made the choice at the time I knew this, and preferred FOSS, but the alternatives just wasn’t as usable, so in the end I still chose this, partly because at least I still have complete control over the data (not true for some alternatives. P.S. my comparison was done probably a few years ago and the landscape could have changed quite a bit. One solution I tried was a code extension that promised to do something similar. I thought it would be good as I use vscode all the time. Then I find out it is bad because exactly of that. Obsidian and the like is dedicated to notes taking so this single software is unambiguously for that task. In vscode there’s just too much other things going on as distraction. reply hiAndrewQuinn 18 hours agoparentprevIt's what caused me to pick it.

What you missed is that the paid offer didn‘t stop the developers to lose interest and… start Obsidian! reply spinningarrow 19 hours agoparentprevWhile Obsidian may not be FOSS at all, my understanding is that in general needing to purchase a license is orthogonal to whether something is FOSS - correct? reply Zambyte 18 hours agorootparentIf you cannot use the software however you wish (including for profit) then it is not Free Software. The developers can choose to not distribute the software to you unless you pay, and they can choose to provide support if you pay (which if you're making a profit from their software is a reasonable thing to pay for), but with Free Software the developers cannot decide how you use it once they have distributed it to you. reply brightball 19 hours agoparentprevThe big win for Obsidian here is that everything is just saved as markdown, so you're not locked in even with their license. reply arnejenssen 19 hours agorootparentWhat I am wondering about is that although the basic files are markdown, some of the plugins might be proprietary. So that the part of the contents in the markdown files in effect creates a lock-in? reply AJ007 19 hours agorootparentI would suggest editing and reading the markdown files in other editors to make avoid getting \"locked in.\" You certainly could create your own lock-in by making some unique workflow that requires a combination of plug-ins to function. The plugins are all third party, some of them are just annotating the existing markdown files, some are just visual. reply swozey 17 hours agorootparentSo you only use Obsidian for its vaults/syncing? reply theshrike79 16 hours agorootparentMy workflow isn't reliant on Obsidian's plugins, they just make stuff easier. Like having a template for my Daily Note that also automatically includes all files tagged #todo using Data View. Or a few global shortcuts via Keyboard Maestro that open specific notes on Obsidian. I could maybe whip up a similar system in a day on top of any editor that can render Markdown and handle links, but now I don't need to. reply georgejfrick 19 hours agorootparentprevNo, becasue the plugins are just JavaScript running against markdown that generally produce more markdown. You might get a plugin that produces an image and that would \"stop working\"; but it hard for the JS to be locked down/etc. reply brightball 19 hours agorootparentprevPotentially. I don't use many of the plugins so I can't say with authority. reply D13Fd 4 hours agoparentprevThis doesn't bother me. If there was a FOSS alternative I'd be all for it. But I can't fault them for charging for good software. reply benhurmarcel 17 hours agoparentprevI think it’s pretty likely that a lot of Obsidian users use it for their professional activity without paying. Personally I haven’t considered it because of that. I have no use for a complex notes app in my private life, and there’s no way my employer would pay for the subscription. reply theshrike79 16 hours agorootparent> I have no use for a complex notes app in my private life I thought so too, but then I noticed I was searching the internet for the same things over and over again. (Or asking it from GPT). Then I started writing stuff down as I searched it, with a sentence or two of my own text + a few tags.

But then maybe I'm missing the point of Obsidian? reply tester457 18 hours agorootparentThe killer feature of Obsidian was the wikilinks, but now that other editors are getting that feature it is replaceable. But the other killer feature is avoiding vendor lock-in. With some apps your notes are on their servers in an inscrutable data format, and some apps don't even let you export without paying. With markdown notes on the other hand you can take your notes anywhere, sync them with git, dropbox, syncthing, etc. You're not bound to obsidian, and your markdown notes format will always be readable, unlike many of today's formats!

I was hoping that we could simply transfer the folder structure over and just have it work, but no such luck. Evidently it requires not only transfer, but some kind of transformation that they do in their cloud, and I'm not interested in another cloud subscription, particularly one so specific. (Happy to pay for the software & updates, just not to maintain the subscription and maintain the concern about another connection in the loop) This was a couple years ago. Perhaps this has changed, or there's now a plugin to make such a bidirectional transfer work? TIA for any suggestions! reply david1302 2 hours agorootparentI can highly recommend to use Git, the Obsidian Git plugin on Desktop and Termux on Android for syncing. Works great! I have documented my setup here: https://github.com/davidkopp/termux-scripts/ reply Levitz 17 hours agorootparentprevThere is a popular method which I use. Syncing the vault between devices with Syncthing.

Once you actually understand how sync works in details it does wonders. reply nickloewen 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat were the problems you encountered? Obsidian creates a hidden directory in your “vault,” which contains plugin files, plus metadata about your settings, currently opened files, etc. If those settings don’t work equally well on both systems, that would be a hassle. Maybe try copying all the files from inside the directory (so that you don’t grab that hidden dir when you do) instead of grabbing the whole directory. You might also want to look at the git-obsidian plugin. It takes a little setup, but seems to work well once it’s going. reply hn_burner_2038 18 hours agorootparentprevI just backup and sync the files with google drive and everything works well, but I also don't have any plugins installed so I can't vouch for those. reply trinsic2 13 hours agorootparentprevMainly I prefer to be able to move my data around.

On principle, I will not support systems that design their products to lock you into platforms. reply yurishimo 19 hours agorootparentprevI think it depends on what you use notes for. Just a scratchpad of random, mostly ephemeral ideas or simple folders? Notes is probably good enough. Obsidian is designed for those people that want to minmax their note taking and find reasons to increase productivity by providing robust linking and search capabilities within any document. The photos in the OP are a good example of how many people use Obsidian. That said, I'm not an expert (never used it personally), but that's how I understand it. reply runiq 18 hours agorootparentprevI'm syncing using Syncthing, across three devices which are only syncing intermittently (home laptop, smartphone, work computer), and it appears to work fine. I cannot recall ever having a sync conflict. But then again, I'm hardly using any plugins in Obsidian. reply samrolken 19 hours agorootparentprevYou can sync just fine without a subscription.

It truly lets you operate how you know best, making very few assumptions on how you use it. Case in point: one of my favorite productivity plugins is a full-fledged Kanban board. It has deep integration into Obsidian features: - https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban reply rubymamis 20 hours agoparentYou might like my own note-taking app, Plume[1] that's built with Qt C++ and QML. You can integrate a Kanban board (with underlying Markdown text) right within your document[2]. It's still a work-in-progress, so this is why it's not featured yet on the website. But I'll finish implementing it very soon. Unlike Obsidian, Plume's editor is a block-editor. That gives it the flexibility of Notion (to put advanced blocks like Kanban within the same document, to do drag & drop, etc.) with the performance of native apps by utilizing Qt C++ and QML (actually, Plume is 4x faster than the fastest native block editor on macOS - benchmarks on the website). EDIT: Also, Plume is opinionated compared to Obsidian. That means much better ease-of-use at the cost of extensibility. I believe this is a trade-off worth to be making. I know first hand the intimidation of starting to work with something as complex as Notion or Obsidian. Plume is taking the block editor abilities of Notion with the familiar Apple Notes UX/UI while all the data is still plaintext underneath.

Why withhold the remaining 1%? If you aren't so confident about your decision to open source, there's no need to commit to that decision now. It's good that you are leaving the door open, but keep in mind that if some folks suddenly become successful with a service that can turn any GitHub repo into a nice looking SaaS, at the click of a button and for a super low fee, I'm pretty sure you'll be hesitant to open source all your hard work so it can harvested. reply rubymamis 17 hours agorootparentBecause I'm very much still a believer in open source.

Notion, for example, can do it. reply PurpleRamen 18 hours agoprevI like Obsidian, but I really dislike the annoying design-philosophy which restricts my usage. For example, it's not possible to open any random folder with it, you need to first register the folder as a vault, and then can open the vault. It also doesn't handle file links under Linux correctly. For whatever reason, any link pointing to a file inside the vault, disappears. Probably some flaw in their file system-abstraction, but that made several workflows for me impossible. And then there is the problem with every vault having its own isolated configuration. Basically, every vault has a folder \".obsidian\" which contains all installed plugins, configurations and whatever. For any new vault, you need to link this folder, and for whatever reason they are still unable to let obsidian handle this automatically. Overall, Obsidian is designed to have mainly one, or at least just a very low number of vaults. But considering how poor obsidian scales with file numbers, this is not working well for every one. For me, this removed any motivation to use Obsidian for everything. reply D13Fd 4 hours agoparentYeah it's just not meant to do that. That's how these apps have worked for over a decade. Obsidian is far from the first app to work this way. Notational Velocity, nvalt, Bear, Ulysses - they all worked that way IIRC.

I'm glad it works for you, the in-between applications trying to do notetaking is a pain. I settled on OneNote because I'm always trying to capture context with my notes, codify my knowledge. Usually that means screenshots, handwriting, file copies, rarely video or audio embeddings. I'm not going to try to convince you to use onenote, I want to instead complain about how this makes me boring and uncool, I see how trendy/popular the 'markdown files plus some goodies' notetaking applications are, but somehow I just don't get why those have enough ROI for my usecase, but still, my ego of not being a cool 10x developer who uses only certified organic grass-fed markdown files for my notes means I write rant comments like this. Anyways, that's much ado about nothing on my part, again, thanks for sharing! reply pomatic 18 hours agoparentI love the way OneNote handles images - and the ability to include ink annotations. I wish there was a FOSS equivalent on Linux with a similar UI experience (Obsidian image handling is incredibly clunky), although the improved availability of various exporters from OneNote makes me less leery about committing to a proprietary database format and the risks associated with potential dataloss from a random bug or database corruption. reply lawgimenez 19 hours agoparentprevSpeaking of boring, my entire life runs on Apple Notes.

At least it’s all text files - no proprietary files to corrupt. reply jodrellblank 16 hours agorootparentLovehate OneNote; the easy paste and type and draw, all WSYWIG, is great. But it feels like a place to lose notes and never find them again. \"OneNote for Windows 10\" gives a weird hierarchy view of notebooks on the left, which slides into folders and pages; \"OneNote\" shows the same data as a dropdown list of notebooks at the top, tabs along the top for folders and tabs down the right for pages; why so different?

On top of the ease of writing and linking together notes, it also allows me to simultaneously tie in my pre-written lore with the session notes I take, so I don’t forget stuff that happens or that my players are supposed to pick up on. I’ve also encouraged my players to use it, so that if they are taking notes on the right things, they can piece together stuff or make their own assumptions to inform how they choose to play. It works for us, I get it’s not for everyone. But versus my old DM Binder in OneNote, it works perfectly for my needs! On a similar, yet separate note, I’ve found the folder/note structure to be conducive to learning new TTRPG rules and essentially having my personal SRDs for different games (currently chunking my way through the Shadowrun 6e SRD and making my own notes or expansions on it to make it make more sense). reply BrandoElFollito 12 hours agoparentA lady that gives a lot of tutorials about Obsidian on YouTube users it as a DM as well.

I would say the one downside is that it's only \"free\" for those that have the technical knowhow to setup git sync.

When they landed and the connection resumed, it synced everything back to the pre-takeoff state and erased their work.

Every text file created by Logseq has a starting bullet point (\" - \") because it is an outline. But this makes it impossible to render the file as a web page in a Markdown-friendly CMS as they all require frontmatter at the start of the file. reply recfab 11 hours agorootparentIt's been a while since I've used Logseq, but IIRC you can use yaml front matter. The very first block in the page is special and if you enter YAML there, the underlying markdown will have that yaml block without any bullet points. It renders just like the `foo:: bar` properties. There was a limitation though that it didn't handle nested YAML. (Obsidian has the same problem I believe though I haven't tested recently) reply CrypticShift 18 hours agoprevSo the author is keeping notes in a flat hierarchy and then using the graph. He stated that the goal is \"greater understanding,\" and then he just (in all honesty) states that the nice graphical topology represents my learning journey and keeps me motivated. That is exactly the problem: motivation and a history of learning do not always lead to \"greater understanding.\" On the contrary, I find that our 'notes' are often transient while our internal understanding morphs subtly yet swiftly (especially when learning something new). That is why I think 'organic linking' works better for very large AND more definitive content. Wikipedia is the best example. For personal use, I prefer more structure. The outliner/database combo (like logseq) is the best tool for that. And Frankly as long as I can easily download my data in a readable format, I'm OK with any tool. It does not have to be built as plain text files. But I do like Obsidian :) reply aaarrm 13 hours agoparentI often hear of people using Obsidian or other feature-ful not taking and task organization apps creating PKMS (personal knowledge management systems) in then. They often state that linking things together, categorizing and organizing them well, and using appropriate tools to help view these associations that it results in... \"realizations\", or \"understandings\"? But I've yet to see anyone mention a concrete example of what they mean by this. I can use my imagination to come up with some potential examples, but I'm curious these conclusions actually often occur or if people are just chasing some idea, when in reality they just get enjoyment from the organization process. Either way, I use Obsidian lightly and am trying to refine how I use it, but I'm definitely not \"there\" yet. I mostly enjoy having a personal wiki basically of any information that I've researched or need to keep on hand somewhere. Main downside I've run into is that I'm not a huge fan of the layout / UI (maybe there's plugins for that) and tables are horrendous in it (I know they just added an update for them recently but I've already offloaded my table-style data elsewhere and I don't plan on bringing it back). reply Brajeshwar 19 hours agoprevBtw, I also like the CEO's[1] writing and philosophy.

Obsidian out of the box is a bit limited; plugins are great and add tons of features, but then you start hitting issues with plugin maintainers abandoning plugins you rely on, or needing to make a decision between three different plugins that all do the same thing slightly different. Depending on your use case and expectations that may not be a big deal, but I really missed not having what I personally saw as core features not being officially supported. (Also, FWIW, the sync service is a bit pricy for what it is. I get that it's how they're trying to monetise it, but...I would have preferred another pricing model, even if the total cost was just as high.)

No live edit mode in Markor. You can either edit or see the live preview. (Not sure if that's changed in recent times). 2. Here's the most thoughtful killer feature IMO of the Obsidian mobile app: it let's you configure the order of formatting tools that appear on the toolbar above the keyboard.

There is no mention of that in the roadmap ( https://obsidian.md/roadmap/ ). reply ezst 11 hours agoprevUnpopular opinion: I dislike obsidian. I came to the realization that any reasonably large collection of notes requires structure, which goes by the definition of types (for people, places, organizations, ...). Obsidian is very rudimentary in this regard: it offers properties, folders and templates. Those are workable at first but fall apart soon enough: you can derive many instances of a type from a certain template, but obsidian will happily let you change the template later on without offering the means to propagate the changes to existing instances, leaving your notes in an inconsistent state with no way to tell. Anytype, SiYuan, LogSeq have the same problem. Notion is a bit better considering its \"databases\" help finding and patching such discrepancies, but is also limited in that it doesn't let you extend types (polymorphism). None of them support cardinality (should there be one or multiple references) nor defining forward and backwards relationships when the property is relational. As I was about to give up, I found out about Trilium which checks all the good marks when it comes to data modeling and consistency, in a super simple and straightforward manner. And on top of that, it's opensource, local first, self hostable, syncable, has a web UI so you don't have to install anything if you can't, and lends itself to emacs levels of hackability. IMO, anyone claiming to be managing a large collection of notes should give it a serious look. reply eternityforest 10 hours agoparentLooks really cool, aside from the lack of Android support or a managed cloud option. My big issue with Obsidian is just performance. Android likes to kill the background process and you're waiting 10 seconds or more just to be able to write a 5 word shopping list entry. I eventually switched to Google Keep, with always listening assistant turned on. reply ezst 1 hour agorootparent> Looks really cool, aside from the lack of Android support or a managed cloud option. For Android, you can use trilium as a PWA currently, I do that and it's not bad at all, but offline isn't supported yet. I would say that the UX through the PWA isn't worse than that of Obsidian. If offline on your phone is a requirement, you should be able to run trilium server there (haven't tried): https://github.com/Nriver/awesome-trilium#-android There is managed hosting too, at a very fair price I'd say (compared to the alternatives): https://trilium.cc/ reply hiq 18 hours agoprevA few weeks ago I started splitting knowledge between that which is worthy enough (for me) to remember via flashcards and spaced repetition, and that which I don't need to even write down anywhere. Meaning, in practice, that I don't feel the need to have a proper note-taking system. I just need proper flashcards, which I already have in Anki. I just started this split so maybe I'll come back to it, realizing limitations I'm not aware of yet, but at least for now I feel way better not having a proper note-taking workflow. Compared with Zettelkasten-based systems, this might make it harder to add connections between pieces of knowledge, but I never got around to actually using a Zettelkasten so I am not entirely sure what I'm missing. On the other hand, one's brain is IMHO the best way to connect pieces of knowledge together, and recalling the vertices frequently might be enough to recall the edges of this knowledge graph as well. I haven't seen this (lack of) \"approach\" mentioned before so I'm curious if I'm alone with this realization and mistaken somehow. reply machomaster 4 hours agoparentWhy not combine both? Make notes in Obsidian, but add the information worth memorizing as Anki cards inside the Obsidian? reply senjin 13 hours agoparentprevThis is basically what I tried to do using the spaced repetition plugin for Obsidian but it's just not very good yet. I just checked and the author asked for a co-maintainer yesterday. I really hope they can find someone to put a bit of time in because it's a great idea and a great foundation. https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition/ reply MichaelNolan 16 hours agoparentprevYou’re not alone. My “note taking” is essentially what you described. I do have a single google doc where I paste temporary notes though. This gives me a space where I can properly decide to either delete the content, or ankify it. reply mortallywounded 16 hours agoprevI tried Obsidian for a while and the whole \"second brain-thingy\" until I watched a video about complex procrastination (basically, using tools like Obsidian as a means of not doing actual work). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baKCC2uTbRc reply rchaud 15 hours agoparentAnother term for it is \"knowledge p*rn\", basically getting off to the idea that you're learning by watching another power user video, or reading another blog post, instead of simply doing the work. reply boiler_up800 19 hours agoprevA friend has a very popular post on obsidian templates. Never really followed it until he told me it was the most visited post on his site by a large margin, https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/ reply rabbitofdeath 20 hours agoprevJust last week I fully committed to Obsidian with the git sync plugin. It took some fiddling and a bit of trust to sync 4 years of notes. (Previously I was just using Sublime Text and my notes folder as a project hooked up to my gitea instance.) But now, its like second nature and I'm looking for neat plugins that you cant live with out. reply TSiege 20 hours agoparentCan you share a link to the git plugin you're referring to? reply llimllib 19 hours agorootparentI use this one, and I presume they do too: https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git reply rabbitofdeath 19 hours agorootparentThis is the one - it works great. I also use it in iOS, but I needed to use the Working Copy workaround to get the initial sync complete. https://forum.obsidian.md/t/mobile-setting-up-ios-git-based-... reply jmhammond 8 hours agorootparentDoes the obsidian-git plugin run reliably on iOS? I have a license for Working Copy, so I use that alone with shortcuts, but I’m always interested in a solution with fewer parts. reply stemlord 19 hours agoprevObsidian is too clunky for a daily driver text editor. Compare to Sublime. Obsidian also sometimes breaks. Last week it gave me a fully white window, I couldn't use it at all despite a reinstall. It should be ported to a C lang or similar. reply stared 19 hours agoprevI really like the calendar plugin - it makes it easy to write daily notes, https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin. reply mtriassi 13 hours agoprevI've really fallen for Obsidian myself. I became somewhat of an evangelist for it in my office. Much like the author i tend to use it as a \"backstage for my life\". In the interest of sharing my system with my colleagues i even turned my work vault into a template of sorts [^1]. Though that's also the most interesting part about Obsidian. What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another. When i presented my template to my colleagues i definitely got some comments like: \"oh man, my brain doesn't work that way\" or \"this feels overly complex\". It's interesting how a simple markdown editor has become this analogue for some of our brains. [^1]: https://github.com/m-triassi/obsidian-workvault-template - This is still a work in progress, but if anyone has suggestions or things they'd like to share i'd be open to feedback or even PRs! reply ryangs 19 hours agoprevLinking is an exceptionally good idea. It is very transformative to how I think about organizing information and doing it with Obsidian the past few months has felt great. Besides future proofing, I love the speed of processing a simple text format like markdown (plus local first) allows. Everything opens instantly, which feels very different from things like Google docs or Microsoft Word. About the only note tool it doesn't replace for me is spreadsheets that use math. There are plugins but it doesn't feel quite as clean as Google sheets for this purpose. reply n8henrie 15 hours agoprevMy setup is a little complex, but I'm very happy syncing plain-text notes between my Mac, several Linux machines, and my iPhone. I'm still using (and loving) Notational Velocity on my Mac. Thankfully it's open source, so I was able to hack together arm64 support even though I don't know C/ObjC/C++ [0]. On my iPhone, I've been very happy with 1Writer, which has a similar interface, and is scriptable with JavaScript for power users. I have NV configured to store plain-text notes that are stored in 1Writer's iCloud folder, so syncing happens seamlessly between them. Finally, I sync that same directory with Syncthing to my Linux machines, where I mostly use neovim for editing. The only feature that I'm often wishing I had is shared editing with my wife. At some point I whipped up some launchd scripts to automatically move notes tagged with `#shared` to a shared subfolder, but it never worked very well. Thankfully my wife is not really all that interested in sharing notes, so we just use Apple Notes when needed. Tried Obsidian but was miffed at the inability to recognize / store as .txt files instead of .md (or perhaps it was vice versa) without a community plugin, and I prefer FOSS, so uninstalled after a couple days. Have LogSeq installed but can't convince myself to use it, what I have fits my needs well enough. I'm also concerned about their funding model and the longevity of the project, the other side of the coin of FOSS I suppose.

I’ve never really gotten into synch. since I tend to monocompute a lot. I write things in Org Mode. Not a power user of that thing, just the markup I use. I don’t use links in Org but I would like to. I sometimes make very informal and tedious links. So that would be a welcome feature. > Obsidian’s choice to work with plain text files make it future-proof Future-proof yes. It is. But as a customer this doesn’t sound that exciting. A company could offer to print all my data and mail it to me when I terminate the plan. That’s also future-proof. Ditto with > Obsidian allows structure to grow organically I haven’t read the links but 95% of the time this means “because there isn’t any structure (YOLO)”. Yeah okay I am free as a bird, cool. But I can’t make a decades-spanning personal wiki based on completely unstructured data and links alone. All in all: most MD tools kind of fade into the background for me. People want all kinds of bells and whistles with that semi-language like a dedicated editor so that they can write headers and unordered bullet lists with a preview. Overall the marketplace feels excessive. reply pers0n 19 hours agoprevIf you want an open source alternative use Zettlr or Logseq reply paradite 19 hours agoprevCurrently using Joplin with self-hosted NextCloud WebDAV. It has a couple of minor UI/UX issues, even with the plugins. Anyone tried both? How does Obsidian compare against Joplin? reply theshrike79 16 hours agoparentI moved from Joplin to Obsidian pretty much only because Obsidian has all the files as regular files. Joplin has its own weird-ass database system. It was also really janky 4 years ago when I used it, might've gotten better since. reply aprdm 17 hours agoparentprevI tried both and am using Joplin. Has less fuss around it and I focus more on simply taking notes .. the syncing is also cheaper and you can use for work reply ElCapitanMarkla 15 hours agorootparentI've been using Joplin for over a year after spending too much time testing all of the options out there. Joplin's syncing sealed the deal for me, free and it works well. Obsidian was something like $100 USD a year just to get things synced to my phone. reply weberer 16 hours agoparentprevI've tried both. No UI issues to complain about in Joplin. But Obsidian seems to use its own style of title bars, and it uses the GTK file chooser when my OS is using KDE. reply tamimio 18 hours agoprevWhat I like about obsidian is how it’s a very good front-end for my notes, that’s it, just a front end, in case of anything or if obsidian tomorrow ceases to exist, all my notes are in my git and they are also backed up daily somewhere else, I don’t feel I’m locked to anything or any company. The addons too are very nice extra touch but it isn’t why I like obsidian. reply hiAndrewQuinn 20 hours agoprevObsidian is my IDE for Markdown, if that makes sense. reply nigamanth 17 hours agoprevAs a high school student, I also use Obsidian over more mainstream alternatives such as Notion or OneNote. I find it primarily useful because of the no-internet feature and I find the linking ability to be extremely useful since most ideas are related to other ideas, and in totality this creates a concept. reply Biganon 9 hours agoprevWhenever I read about Obsidian or similar software, I feel like it's great, but I also feel ashamed, because... I have absolutely no idea what I'd write in them. What do you people write about? Do you really have genius ideas all day long that you need to write down? Or do you want to keep track of everything you've seen / discussed? Maybe I'm just an idiot reply pilgrim0 16 hours agoprevObsidian is nice, I use it to write articles. But I don’t like to take notes in it. IME notes are something transient, so recording them as files generates too much pollution/trash. Having paper notebooks around is much more fun, gets me in a flow easier, there’s close to no commitment with structure, the mind works better, can use colored pens, etc. Plus, it’s so much fun to go through old notebooks, it has historical weight, it makes me remember other aspects of my life surrounding the events, you can tell the mood of the writing, etc. So, my take: Use the tool relevant to the desired output format. reply timetraveller26 16 hours agoparentNot disagrreing with you but it's sorta funny that you say files pollute more than paper. reply basedrum 20 hours agoprevI prefer logseq over obsidian reply olenczyk 20 hours agoparentCan you elaborate? I need to chose one among those two reply mofosyne 20 hours agoprevAnyone tried Dendron (https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron)? It feels like it could almost become a competitor to Obsidian and plus is essentially a vscode plugin, so you get the benefit of using vscode as your code editor as well. Too bad the project has ended as there is no clear approach for the Dendron team to make it financially sustainable (with their cloud sync subscription, much like Obsidian Sync). But it's basically opensource now so hopefully can be forked and the lessons learnt from Obsidian be applied to it (e.g. Any folder of textfile should be openable under Dendron. Unfortunate at the moment you have to initialize a separate repo and then port it over) reply jodrellblank 17 hours agoparentI quickly switched to Dendron from Obsidian because I preferred it being open source, and I liked the creator's views on the hierarchical search and categorization instead of just a tangle of wiki links, and liked the idea of it being a VSCode extension and then other extensions would also be available. I think Dendron is high quality, and encourage everyone interested in markdown notes and Obsidian to check it out, and watch some of the creator Kevin Slin's introductory and overview videos or read the blog posts. He worked for Amazon and had to remember too many things and find them quickly, and that drove the Dendron hierarchical layout and features for managing lots of notes. But personally, I'm not a big fan of VSCode or markdown; mostly what I want is to take quick screenshots and stash them for later - \"here's how it looked before\", \"here's where to find this option\" - and markdown is not great at that, you need to open 'markdown preview' to render your notes and see images. So you get a VS Code interface, and the editing window and the preview window. It's computing pre-WYSIWYG. And no way to draw on images like in OneNote. Similar with snippets of code and command lines, having to write them in markdown fiddling with word wrap and then preview the markdown to see them rendered properly in monospace isn't very convenient. And of course hierarchy isn't free, it depends on me organizing and categorising (does this command go in \"computers.aws.s3\" or \"software.amazon.s3.cli\" or \"tickets.12345678-Amazon-s3-client-weirdness\" ?) which I'm not very committed to. reply candiddevmike 20 hours agoparentprevI used dendron with vscode and the extension really screwed up vscode for me. It seems to hook into a lot of things within vscode and created quite a few annoying prompts and added some weird markdown previewing issues. reply jddj 20 hours agorootparentInteresting. Maybe codium for notes and code for code? reply poulpy123 18 hours agoparentprevI used it for a while but I started to have issues of it becoming slow. I'm not 100% sure dendron was responsible of it but I switched to Joplin. The interesting things was is integration with VSCode that I use for coding reply 75 more comments...

    "originBody": "Hi, welcome to the brand new website, HN Reads. I enjoy reading Hacker News and I love buying books (and reading), and I also love data, so what better than doing some processing of data about books to find some interesting results?! It also gives me the opportunity to write about books that I find interesting. Here are the top 40 books recommended by HN readers in 2023. How I generated this list: get stories that contain the word “book”, but not “macbook”, “chromebook”, etc. That were posted in 2023, and also try to only get “ask HN” stories, by excluding stories that have a url in them. get the comments for the stories for each comment, use the OpenAI gpt3.5 chat API to extract a list of book details in json format: [{\"match\":\"xxx\",\"title\":\"xxx\", \"author\":\"xxx\", \"link\":\"xxx\"},... ] standardise titles, e.g. “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid” is converted to “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. Any leading “the” is also removed. I end up with a title column and an orig_title column in my data. If there are that have the same title, but different subtitles, for example “Javascript: the good parts” and “Javascript: the Definitive Guide”, this isn’t too much of a problem, as the authors are different. aggregate the resulting information. There was some manual adjustment to standardise the book titles and authors names, for example Gödel was sometimes spelled “Godel” and Douglas Hofstadter was sometimes returned as “Douglas R. Hofstadter”. I also shared some details about this process at my blog. It’s nice to see one of my favourite series appearing on this list, the Hyperion Cantos. I don’t usually go for books with horror elements, but the story is so good, and the science fiction elements are cool too. A couple of controversial figures don’t rank in the top 40 of 2023: Elon Musk’s new biography wasn’t recommended once in an “Ask HN” about books, although there were plenty of stories on Hacker News about him and Isaacson’s book. Also Ayn Rand’s books weren’t mentioned often enough in 2023 to make the list.

(Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's always a good idea to pay attention to the selection criteria, as selection effects are everywhere. For example, it would also make sense to exclude such threads, to get a more representative idea of what books HN comments tend to talk about in natural contexts.) reply mindcrime 6 hours agoparent'Ask HN' posts that have 'book' in their title\". Yeah, that kinda puts a damper on it for me. Only selecting \"book\" Ask HN's leaves out a lot of stuff. Just to illustrate: I was initially surprised not to see The Four Steps to the Epiphany on the list. Heck, I probably mentioned it 6 or 7 times last year on my own. But when I went back and searched, it seems like all the times that I mentioned that book were in threads that weren't about books per-se. And I'm sure plenty of other people will have similar anecdotes. For example, it would also make sense to exclude such threads, to get a more representative idea of what books HN comments tend to talk about in natural contexts.) Yes, exactly. I'd like to see a similar analysis done, but excluding those threads for the same reason. reply hammock 6 hours agorootparentIt seems like with LLMs this year it ought to be easy to look at the whole comment base and pull out the book titles without having to use a “book” keyword reply moomin 44 minutes agoparentprevGlad to see I helped get Rudin into the top 10. :D More seriously, I remember many of these questions and it’s important to understand sentiment matters.

I click the textbook link and now the paperback link is to an identical looking $16.45 book, the only difference I can tell is that it is the \"reprint\" edition (aren't they all reprints given the original was published in 1945?). The reviews and most information other than weight and size are the same. Which do I choose? Will I regret not having whatever was worth $53.54 in the original link. There doesn't seem to be anyway to know if I am buying some fly-by-night poorly printed edition for $16.45 or getting a good deal because they all seem to be the same product. I've seen so much garbage on Amazon lately, I just don't trust anything, not even the books. reply krick 8 hours agoprevOfftopic, but is it just me who struggles to treat seriously any post that has \"I used GPT\" somewhere in the beginning?

    "originLink": "https://jyn.dev/2024/01/16/the-rust-project-has-a-burnout-problem.html",
    "originBody": "the rust project has a burnout problem Jan 16, 2024 • jyn • audience - developers the number of people who have left the rust project due to burnout is shockingly high. the number of people in the project who are close to burnout is also shockingly high. this post is about myself, but it’s not just about myself. i’m not going to name names because either you know what i’m talking about, in which case you know at least five people matching this description, or you don’t, in which case sorry but you’re not the target audience. consider, though, that the project has been around for 15 years, and compare that to the average time a maintainer has been active … what does this look like (i apologize in advance if this story does not match your experience; hopefully the suggestions on what to do about burnout will still be helpful to you.) the pattern usually goes something like this: you want to work on rust. you go to look at the issue tracker. you find something you care about, since the easy/mentored issues are taken. it’s hard to find a mentor because all the experienced people are overworked and burned out, so you end up doing a lot of the work independently. guess what you’ve already learned at this point: work in this project doesn’t happen unless you personally drive it forward. that issue you fixed was opened for years; the majority of issues you will work on as you start will have been open for months. you become a more active contributor. the existing maintainer is too burned out to do regular triage, so you end up going through the issue backlog (usually, you’re the first person to have done so in years). this reinforces the belief work doesn’t happen unless you do it personally. the existing maintainer recognizes your work and turns over a lot of the responsibilities to you, especially reviews. new contributors make PRs. they make silly simple mistakes due to lack of experience; you point them out and they get fixed. this can be fun, for a time. what it’s teaching you is that you personally are responsible for catching mistakes. you get tired. you’ve been doing this for a while. people keep making the same mistakes, and you’re afraid to trust other reviewers; perhaps you’re the only reviewer, or other reviewers have let things slip before and you don’t trust their judgement as much as you used to. perhaps you’re assigned too many PRs and you can’t keep up. you haven’t worked on the things you want to work on in weeks, and no one else is working on them because you said you were going to (“they won’t happen unless you do them personally”, a voice says). you want a break, but you have a voice in the back of your head: “the project would be worse without you”. i’m going to stop here; i think everyone gets the idea. what can i do about it “it won’t get done if i don’t do it” and “i need to review everything or stuff will slip through” is exactly the mindset of my own burnout from rust. it doesn’t matter if it’s true, it will cause you pain. if the project cannot survive without you personally putting in unpaid overtime, perhaps it does not deserve to survive. if you are paid to work on rust, you likely started as an unpaid contributor and got the job later. treat it like a job now. do not work overtime; do not volunteer at every turn; do not work on things far outside your job description. the best way to help the project is to keep contributing for it for years. to do that, you have to avoid burning out, which means you have to treat yourself well. what can team leads do about it have documentation for “what to do about burnout”; give it just as much priority as technical issues or moderation conflicts. rotate responsibilities. don’t have the same person assigned to the majority of PRs. if they review other people’s PRs unsolicited, talk to them 1-1 about why they feel the need to do so. if someone is assigned to the review queue and never reviews PRs, talk to them; take them off the queue; give them a vacation or different responsibilities as appropriate. ask people why they leave. i know at least one person whose burnout story does not match the one in this post. i am sure there are others. you cannot solve a problem if you don’t understand what causes it. take these problems seriously. prioritize growing the team and creating a healthy environment over solving technical issues. the issues will still be there in a few months; your people may not be. what can the rust project do about it one thing bothering me as i wrote this post is how much of this still falls on individuals within the project. i don’t think this is an individual problem; i think it is a cultural, organizational, and resource problem. i may write more about this once i have concrete ideas about what the project could do. be well. be kind to each other. i love you. remember: EMPATHY WITHOUT BOUNDARIES IS SELF DESTRUCTION pic.twitter.com/HbBwEj4hc3 — 𖤐ARCH BUDZAR𖤐 (@ArchBudzar) October 6, 2020 acknowledgements thank you @QuietMisdreavus for the burned out rust kid club art. thank you @Gankra, @QuietMisdreavus, @alercah, @ManishEarth, @estebank, @workingjubilee and @yaahc for discussion and feedback on early drafts of this post. any errors are my own.",

The only thing not included was the comments from overly entitled users that saps whatever morale and energy you have left. Probably best he did not include that though as that is what all discussion would be about. I am not sure what to do about the burnout problem. The way he described it is very on point though. Since everyone working on the project is overloaded there is a great feeling of things only get done if you do them. Most of my open source work was in the pre-GitHub days when we used mailing lists, not pull requests, to build community. I do think there was something better about that for the project itself as it encouraged a lot more discussion and community building. PR's and Issues become silos and are not great for general discussion. I think they also encourage drive-by contributions which honestly are intoxicating initially but once you see people are not coming back become defeating. reply markphip 20 hours agoparentFollowing up on my previous comment, I managed to never become fully burned out, but it required changes to myself, not the project. I had to become less emotionally invested in the project, realize I could not solve everything and step back a bit and do some other things. I guess it would be great if the project were reinforcing these ideas to its contributors to prevent burnout, but that also does not seem realistic. And \"the project\" is made up of others going through the same problems. The large OSS project I contributed to thankfully had other contributors that were good role models for these behaviors and it helped seeing them disengage to do other things for a while. reply jynelson 20 hours agorootparentthis is a wonderful comment, thank you for writing itThis is a good description of what life is like working on almost any significant open source project. Open contributions project. An open source project does not necessarily have to accept random contributions, issues or hatemail from the general public. [1] They just need to make the source available with a permissive licence, period. I believe that Linux with its idiosyncrasies in its communication model (mailing list vs the ease of Github, strong dictator running the show) works as a great filter from entitled users, and that's an underrated feature in open source.

That's a useful distinction and a good term. So in total projects can be classified as: - Source available or not - Open source or not (a subset of source available) - Open contributions or not (also a subset of source available) - BDFL or community driven That's a lot of variation and may explain why so many conversations about open source sound like people are talking past each other-- they're talking about different kinds of projects! PS: Regarding: > 1: Yet hell will freeze over before Github lets maintainers turn off the PR tab which would lessen this problem a bit. I wish there was a standardized way of declaring this, I always feel so awkward writing the \"no PRs\" disclaimer on my toy projects. reply marcosdumay 18 hours agorootparent> That's a lot of variation and may explain why so many conversations about open source sound like people are talking past each other Most of the discussion is people suffering through GitHub-style social networks. I don't see a lot of people talking through each other, as much as I see people assuming this is the way, and others pointing out it's just one option. At some point we have to acknowledge that GitHub is a toxic social network. The toxicity is way more hidden than Facebook and others like it, but it's there too. Every universalist social network is toxic. reply delfinom 17 hours agorootparentGitHub is absolutely toxic which is why we develop on GitLab instead. The reduction in the slowly creeping \"social features\" and non-existence of drive-by activism is great. reply sph 11 hours agorootparentGitlab's approach to the problem is making every UI redesign even worse than the one before, so people have to click through 3 menus just to file an issue. The latest redesign is egregious to say the least. reply berkes 20 hours agorootparentprevI strongly believe GitHub has the same dynamics as most \"big tech social media\". Where anything that drives \"engagement\" gets prioritized. From algorithms that make alt-right/neo-nazi's more visible because the controversy drives \"eyeballs\" to features that are removed or never implemented because they would lower engagement. I'm confident that GitHub has a good prediction on what will happen if they roll out features that lower the burden of maintaining a FLOSS repo. And am rather certain that several of these features also lower the engagement. And therefore will not be implemented. In other words: the needs and goals of GitHub/MSFT and those of Open Source maintainers don't align perfectly. Yet the power balance is way off, so open Source maintainers will experience pain to a level that they almost walk away in great numbers. reply ninkendo 19 hours agorootparentIt would be a baffling decision for GitHub to make any product decisions based on engagement. They don’t even serve ads, what benefit do they have to an engaged user? reply berkes 19 hours agorootparentEngagement isn't just driving ads. It's driving engagement: The \"toothbrush\"-factor we called that in app-development: do you have an app that people pick up like their toothbrush: without much thought, several times a day? Engagement means people have you in their workflow, on their radar. I would love it if Github is something that I don't have to think of, that is invisible and out of my mind. I'd love it if it's something I never have to visit, open, see or interact with; as as little as possible. I'd love it if it were preconfigured to take work from me rather than impose yet another inbox, timeline, bookmarks, \"likes\" and so on. And if you consider \"advertisements\" very liberal, that's exactly what Github is: a place for companies to attract eyeballs and engagement on their software. reply ninkendo 18 hours agorootparentI think I know what engagement is, but I’m wondering why you think Microsoft benefits from me being engaged with GitHub? reply andrewaylett 17 hours agorootparentBecause the known system effect means that the more arbitrary developers engage with them, the more likely it is that at least some of them will drive corporate adoption and, by extension, sales. Tailscale put it well: https://tailscale.com/blog/free-plan > increased word-of-mouth from free plans sells the more valuable corporate plans reply ninkendo 11 hours agorootparentWhy is it a given that GitHub slowing me down by making me engaged with the site more, will make me spread more word of mouth/etc? Everyone in this thread is just assuming a link here, but I don’t see it at all. GH annoys the shit of me by making me click more shit to get my job done, it “increases engagement”, and then… what exactly? My annoyance is supposed to lead to me… thinking about GitHub more? And thus I’ll pressure my org to use it? This makes no sense. I hate engagement-based metrics as much as the next person but I’m not sure MS is as brain dead as to intentionally make the UX worse, to make engagement higher, and assuming that will somehow increase sales. There’s no link here. reply alwaysbeconsing 17 hours agorootparentprevIt means they keep position as dominant Git forge, mindshare: people are most familiar with them, then think of them first for Enterprise contracts, are interested in other paid product/feature (Copilot e.g.).

Part of the problem is that overly-entitled maintainers can be as equally dangerous to actual progress in the project by stonewalling useful code on invented reasons that have never been applied to previous PRs and that the maintainer does not apply to their own commits. reply jackcviers3 19 hours agorootparentprevGithub marketplace has a close pull request action[1]. You also need to close issues after a set amount of inactivity[2]. If there is a bug without a CVE, or a feature someone wants fixed that users don't want to submit a fix for themselves AFTER it has been discussed with the maintainer in an issue with a replication or strawman proposal and the owner has created a draft pr and asked you to work on it, it probably needs to come with a Patreon donation[3]. This can help alleviate maintainer burnout by allowing the maintainer to hire someone to make the contribution. A software shop wouldn't operate without some kind of iterative plan. Large open source projects with single maintainers shouldn't either. Scheduling 1 or 2 hours a week for issue triage, hosted in an online meeting, and limiting WIP in terms of open PRs to be discussed during this triage meeting should allow for both community interaction and strong governance for the project and prevent burnout for the maintainer. All of this can be placed into the Readme or Contributor guide and a CLA that contributors have to sign. Otherwise, people can fork and maintain the project themselves. If you want to prevent flame wars, or demotivating comments, something like a comment sentiment analysis app[4] might even be a good idea to add to your project. There are plenty of models available that you can delegate to for this in the wild, and it's worth automating moderation to prevent burnout. Finally, really toxic users can and should be banned[5]. It's not worth it to deal with anonymous negative contributors all the time. 1. https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-pull-request 2. https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-triage 3. https://github.blog/changelog/2023-10-03-sponsor-projects-th... 4. https://github.com/marketplace/comment-sentiment-analyzer 5. https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safe... reply delfinom 17 hours agorootparentThe point is Close Pull Request shouldnt be an action.

When things are too organised or categorised it just becomes another business/todo list. reply janoc 19 hours agorootparentThe problem *is not the organization/categorization*. Any larger project is completely unsustainable if it is a disorganized chaos, with issues falling through the cracks because they can't be kept track of as the scope and team grows. These tools are a great help there. The problem is this tooling is used for the wrong job. If the only \"discussion\" about an issue is the bug report/pull request, that's wrong. That should be only the first/last step. Unfortunately, for many projects there is no other communication channel anymore. So then people use what exists and is available - PRs and issues on Github. Which are both very poorly adapted to any sort of discussion. But if all you have is a hammer ... It used to be that the first things a new project got set up was a mailing list, then maybe an IRC channel, perhaps a shared code repository (likely CVS or Subversion) and only then an issue/bug tracker (usually Bugzilla, Track) when the project grew large enough to need it. In that order. This culture of project community discussion has been largely lost with the younger generation of contributors that don't use e-mail and many don't even have an e-mail account (or don't use it except for signing up for services). Mailing lists have been seen as \"old school\" and poor UX, so have been largely replaced first by silos in the form of web forums and then later by Discord, Reddit, etc. All that makes it great and easy for anyone to come in and post something there (the signal to noise ratio is usually not great) - and absolutely terrible to find anything, to actually coordinate work of a distributed team or to track multiple busy projects. E-mail comes to you and can be automated - forums, Reddit, Discord, etc. you have to actively seek out, follow and manage. Poor project maintainer having to deal with that ... There are good reasons why projects like Linux kernel still use mailing lists for coordination or even sending patches (!), despite the huge size of the project - it simply makes the life of the maintainers (i.e. the people doing most of the actual work!) easier. reply markphip 18 hours agorootparentWell said, this is what I was getting at as well. I think the barrier to contribution was too high in the old days, and that is where GitHub brought improvements, but it came with the loss of community. Everything becomes about PR's and Issues and Discussion was just lost. In the Apache community, the expectation used to be that everything had to happen on the mailing list. Even if someone created an issue, there was an expectation it had to come out of a mailing list thread. I am not saying this was perfect or even better. Just that the side effects were different. Probably a lot of people did not bother contributing because the barrier was too high, but overall I think it created healthier community dynamics and it was not uncommon to see people begin as users asking questions, and evolve into users answering questions and eventually contributing to the development. reply oaiey 20 hours agoparentprevNot only open source. Also anyone taking ownership in companies end up like that. The difference is: The person gets paid and is ideally not emotional involved. reply tristor 20 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, people who take ownership and accountability are often the same people that take pride in their work, which means they aren’t emotionally detached. As long as you're emotionally attached to your work, burnout is a real risk whether you get paid or not. Ironically, the solution from my perspective is the opposite of most advice. It’s not for everyone to become drudging zombies apathetic about their work and just kicking the can, it’s that more people take pride, ownership, and accountability in all aspects of their lives. Having gone through burnout and a lot of therapy, my conclusion was that my burnout (and I think others too) was caused by being a caring decent person in an uncaring world. There are far too many people who surround all of us who are apathetic and/or incompetent, yet are entrenched, and being “forced” to carry their burden has an amplified effect on the misery we feel when doing that work. When you work with a team that only has accountable, competent, engaged people it becomes energizing rather than draining. Realistically even if I am entirely correct above, this isn’t a solution. This is just a confirmation that in my experience the old adage “hell is other people” is true and the primary driver of burnout. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparent> my conclusion was that my burnout (and I think others too) was caused by being a caring decent person in an uncaring world Yikes! That hits way too close to home. You didn't have to attack me like that. In seriousness, this is a very astute and correct observation. Noticed it in myself and several others as well. It really pays off to correct your level of caring with what you see from your superiors and colleagues (and peers, in non-commercial activities). reply Buttons840 18 hours agorootparentI also see some truth in that insight. A problem I have is I don't know how to work if I don't care. At my last job I tried to not care and succeeded, but then got fired for poor performance. Are there sufficiently productive people who don't care? Or does everyone care, but some hold themselves to impossibly high standards? I don't know how to separate \"lower standards\" and \"stop caring\". They are the same to me, because lowering my standards requires not caring about the things that comprise my high standard. reply pdimitar 18 hours agorootparentOh, that one is easy IMO. Create a backlog of tasks that you would want to do in a week. Then do it in a month. Not caring doesn't mean slacking off. It means to reduce your output. reply Dalewyn 17 hours agorootparentprev>Or does everyone care, but some hold themselves to impossibly high standards? That's your answer right there. Do you know the age old saying \"That is above my paygrade.\"? It means you shouldn't care more than what you are paid to do, which in turn will hopefully prevent you from burning out. >I don't know how to separate \"lower standards\" and \"stop caring\". You need to remember that your personal satisfaction (\"I did good work!\") is independent from your peers' satisfaction (\"He did good work!\"), and that correlation is not causation. Life is short, draw a clear line between your personal and professional lives and budget your limited capacity for passion appropriately. reply Buttons840 14 hours agorootparentThat explains how to set time boundaries, that's easy, set a timer, use the clock, etc. It's a mechanical process to adhere to time limits. I'm thinking about things like finding millions of real user passwords in the test database. I complain and push and eventually we delete all the passwords from the database which breaks everyone's test build and in the end I don't make any friends. Did I care to much? I harmed my career because I cared. Early in the project we agreed to organize our code into modules a certain way, but that fell apart and the code was not organized. I never knew where my code should go, the existing code was not organized, it bothered me a lot. How do I stop caring about that? Shortly before I was fired a unit test I had written was passing even though it shouldn't have. The code was something like \"assert(x == 1); assert(x == 2);\" and the test was passing, it was impossible. It was some custom TypeScript stack and I got on the phone with the guy who created the tech stack and he agreed something was off, but none of us had time to look into what's up. I was fired before we ever got to the bottom of it. These are the most recent examples, but I've had similar issues at other jobs. Imperfections, big or small often bother me more than other, and, again, I don't know how to lower my standards without also stopping caring, but without caring I have a hard time working. reply Dalewyn 9 hours agorootparentAgain, you need to consider what you are paid to do. Are you paid to care about \"finding millions of real user passwords in the test database\"? About caring how or whether your code is organized? About what should be happening in a unit test? If you are paid to care about it, absolutely do so because that's your job. If you aren't, though, at most you should inform someone who is paid to care about it and then forget about it because it's not your concern. Life is short and there is only so many waking hours in a day, so we need to budget them accordingly. If you can't bring yourself to be less passionate about your work even though you realize it's actually causing you and your coworkers problems, perhaps it's a sign you need to change professions entirely. reply Buttons840 8 hours agorootparentThey say I'm paid to deliver working software, but I'm not able to do that with confidence until lots of things with the system are fixed. Their actions, though, say that they want someone who hustles and creates bugs and then puts on a good show fixing the bugs they themselves created. Saying it like that, I guess the solution is to just get out, but it's hard to accept \"just find another job\" as the solution when I'm not even employed right now. reply pdimitar 8 hours agorootparentprevI agree with your comments a lot, just want to point out that questions like these: > Are you paid to care about \"finding millions of real user passwords in the test database\"? ...are never clearly answered, in 99% of all jobs everywhere. reply jynelson 20 hours agorootparentprevi think this is partially true, but i hesitate to call people zombies. the vast majority of people in the rust project are competent and engaged. the problem is they have different priorities and collaboration is hard when everything is bottom up. i have some more thoughts on this here: https://tech.lgbt/@jyn/111771440884089084 reply tristor 19 hours agorootparent> i think this is partially true, but i hesitate to call people zombies. To clarify, I was more responding from the perspective of the workplace rather than the Rust project. That said, I have been an open source contributor off and on since 2003 and my observation has been the situation isn’t much different. In a project, rather than apathetic coworkers, you deal with users of the project that have complaints and expectations but without the ability or motivation to contribute themselves. I imagine Rust has slightly less of this than the consumer-focused projects I have worked on, but people are people at the end of the day. Contributing to any large project is largely thankless because there will always be one more complaint/demand issue, or one more PR from someone that didn’t read the contribution guidelines. It can turn what you’re passionate about into a slog, and while the form may differ, it’s not meaningfully different from having apathetic or incompetent coworkers dragging you down. To be honest, dealing with open source slog is slightly worse, because it takes much longer for the hope to die. Somebody that submits a bad PR seems to care somewhat, it’s not total apathy. Somebody that submits a whiny issue at least demonstrates that they used the project and cared enough to write. But both demand your attention without demonstrating competent contribution in and of themselves. It’s somehow worse than the coworkers that are on an in-office vacation. reply jynelson 19 hours agorootparenti agree! i hadn't realized you were talking about people who weren't already team members. they're usually well-meaning, but it's true that some drain a lot of contributor time on things that aren't important. rust has a conflict avoidance problem. i think rust could be much more effective at saying no, and saying it more quickly. i want to talk about that in my next blog post. reply markphip 20 hours agorootparentprevIt is a fair point, but I think your last sentence hits on the problem. People that contribute regularly to OSS projects are nearly always emotionally invested. It brings a lot of pleasure initially which I think also contributes to the eventual burnout. These are hard problems. reply mjw1007 20 hours agoparentprevI think, from observation, that the Rust project has worse burnout problems than most other similarly-sized open source projects. I'm not sure whether it's more to do with the way the project is organised, the state of the codebase, or the sort of person that's attracted to working on Rust in the first place. reply Buttons840 19 hours agorootparentMaybe it's because Rust is new and well designed. People who have adopted it probably care about this and want to maintain it and that's hard. Maybe it's my perfectionism, my desire to build and live in an ivory tower, but I feel this as a Rust user, a fear that they might break some perceived perfection that I care about. I've commented before that \"at least C++ developers are free from the burden of using a perfect language\", which was me projecting this feeling. reply FpUser 19 hours agorootparentRust is far from \"perfect\" in my opinion as any other language. It tackles couple of particular and important problems but since it can not completely solve it for general case it bends people to think in a certain \"perfect\" way. Not sure it is ok when one has to jump hoops on what should be perfectly valid and logical code just because compiler can't figure out that it is actually safe. Also as a generic tool I think it ought to support multiple paradigms and it does not. Just because they (language designers) believe that doing thing their way is superior to what others might find more appropriate does not make them right. Personally - I would use Rust if clients insists which so far has never been the case, otherwise I would take a subset of C++ any time over. reply jynelson 20 hours agorootparentprevi have some thoughts on it here: https://tech.lgbt/@jyn/111771280764615511. i'm planning to make this the subject of my next blog post. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparentprev> the sort of person that's attracted to working on Rust in the first place What's that even supposed to hint at? reply mjw1007 19 hours agorootparentI was thinking something along the lines of people who tend to set unusually high standards for themselves. Rust has something of a self-image of always being best-of-breed in everything it attempts, so I could believe that it might be particularly attractive to those sorts. Other possibilities might be that Rust developers skew younger than average (I don't know whether that's true), or that its six-week release cycle attracts people who think that a year is a long time. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparent> people who tend to set unusually high standards for themselves I would agree, at least I am like that when using Rust (though I don't contribute). And it's true that this is a shortcut to burnout. > or that its six-week release cycle attracts people who think that a year is a long time I don't speak for the Rust project but to me this always sounded like a measure to avoid stagnation. Having six week slices helps remind people that this is not only a labor of love; many people out there are counting on you to get your stuff right. Obviously Rust isn't governed like a commercial project (and thank the gods for that) and obviously many things still take years to complete but for me at least the six weeks release cycle would serve as a periodical poking a la \"Hey, is your stuff progressing even a little?\". Don't know though, could be just my interpretation. reply darthrupert 18 hours agorootparentFrom the outside, the Rust project seems to be governed like a government project. Is that markedly better?

Usually there's either two lists, one for discussion and one for patch submission and review; or users use filters to divide them out (if $h_Subject contains \"PATCH\" -> send mail to \"patches\" dir). For large projects, you can use deeper filters to entirely drop mails in areas of the project that you don't care about. reply mpol 19 hours agorootparentprevYes. The way to make it work is to use fiters in your mailclient. All mail to dev@ goes to its own folder, all mail to discussion@ to its own folder, all mail to support@ to its own folder.

For us, it was the worst day we had experienced in years. For her, it was Tuesday. She had other people waiting in the room next door, and had to go from solemn to bright and cheery over the span of ten footsteps, and she has to do that every day. Her job is often to put a very real price tag on the life of a beloved companion. \"I'm sorry, but keeping him alive will be $10,000... or we can humanely put him down for much, much less.\" It's grim business.

People scan be quite entitled and want to boss everyone around and tell them the project is run wrong - if you don’t actively run at least some of them off the devs will curl up and disappear. Also having a defined procedure for “hiatus” helps quite a bit - make it easy for a dev to say “I’m off” and it can be indeterminate - this allows them to easily come back later. Encourage devs to use it liberally. reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparent> People scan be quite entitled and want to boss everyone around and tell them the project is run wrong - if you don’t actively run at least some of them off the devs will curl up and disappear. As an Eastern European I always found fascinating how many Westerners are struggling hard with this. To me and many of my peers (and apparently to Linus Torvalds and a good chunk of the entire Nordic culture, probably?) it's the easiest thing in the world to say something like: \"Listen up dickhead, I do this in my free time. If you don't like the direction of the project or the urgency with which your issues are [not] being addressed, you are free to not use it, and it also costs you nothing to not comment at all. I got better things to do than to reply to entitled cunts, now piss off.\" It's very amusing what a huge drama many Westerners make out of just... being direct. Honest. Straight to the point. \"But he won't ever contribute and he might infect others with the opinion that the project leaderships is toxic!\" OK. That's a price I am willing to pay. My mental health > the second-hand opinion of people who were only 0.1% likely to contribute anyway. The math is very easy yet so many Westerners struggle so much with these [to me and many] mega obvious solutions, like \"be a bit of a dick when necessary\". This is really very similar to the discussions I had with a lot of women long time ago. It goes like this: they tell me: \"I have to go tell X and Y about event A because otherwise Z will tell them lies and they'll think something wrong about me.\" To which I reply with a cold expression: \"Then you don't need X and Y in your life, if they can be so easily influenced by lies and won't even ask you about what truly happened.\" Their expressions were priceless. The cognitive dissonance can hit us all VERY hard. Back to the topic at hand, yes, I firmly believe all open-contribution projects need a Linus type of person. It's also a fact that many devs are introverted and can be chased away by entitled and insolent loud people. So somebody must put a shield in front of the devs. reply lbalazscs 19 hours agorootparentI guess you missed the part where Linus Torvalds has apologized for years of being a jerk. https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/linus-torvalds-apolo... reply pdimitar 19 hours agorootparentI did not, but I have my doubts as to whether he was made to do it or if he truly meant it. I tend to believe in the former because it's always accompanied by \"stepping back for a while\" and \"get help on how to behave better\". Seems like a standard procedure after somebody manages to overpower you (in whatever hierarchy they have there). Were cursing and expletives necessary? Absolutely no. They don't drive any point forward. But: is showing people the door when they are entitled or unprofessional necessary? Very, very much yes. Feel free to read into the article as your beliefs incline you to. I've known many people like Linus and they don't get \"change of hearts\". They simply get sick and tired of being misunderstood and just remove themselves from the situations that cause it. reply V_Terranova_Jr 14 hours agorootparentThere's more to the Linus-style jerk phenomenon than just telling entitled people to piss off (I would be reluctant to call that being a jerk if that's all it was). See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33058906 for an example thread and associated comments. If you're just ranting or passing off subjective POVs as truth and obvious and those disagreeing with you as doing so out of incompetence or malfeasance, that isn't being direct, honest, or straight to the point. It's being a dick.

Ever. The \"Rust is safe\" is not some kind of absolute guarantee of code safety. Never has been. Anybody who believes that should probably re-take their kindergarten year, and stop believing in the Easter bunny and Santa Claus. It's an exaggeration. Means that he disagrees with people who blindly repeat something that, on the level Linus operates, is objectively not true. I have no context on the broader discussion but it seems both sides haven't equalized the plane on which they discuss. In that context I'll agree Linus was a dick. But, consider what was said upthread: many high-profile open source contributors hear the same crap every day. No matter how gracious you start off, you'll start rolling your eyes and ultimately resort to sarcasm. And some go even further: start insulting. Ask anyone who works in retail. So again, to me Linus' statement basically uses an exaggeration to illustrate a point: \"Stop repeating something as if it's unequivocally true. It's true only in your context (userland application development). It's not true in kernel context.\" That people get offended by that says more about them than about Linus. Finally, I'll agree it can and should be toned down. Not disputing that. But it's also not so difficult to extract out the true point in such a rant and move on. reply V_Terranova_Jr 14 hours agorootparentWe probably won't get much further going back and forth on this. For what it's worth, you seem very reasonable, I've appreciated your comments for a long time, and I'm sure we'd get along fine if we were to work together. I think you could let Linus off the hook by trying to find the kernel of truth as you suggest, and that seems to be the way key Rust team members work. There's been plenty of needless rancor in HN comments about Rust and you can see people like @pcwalton just not engage with the emotional content while still continuing to engage with the technical points. I'm personally impressed by this, but wouldn't be surprised if it contributed to the burnout. Should we all aspire to be like that? Doing so seems like the human communication equivalent of Postel's Robustness Principle, which sounds great but in practice leads to shitty implementations getting away with being shitty because of the \"robustness\" on the other side. Maybe the better play here, especially with asynchronous communication, is to expect people come back to their message draft when they are not so pissed/emotionally triggered and then snip out tangential emotional crap. Especially the ragey condescending stuff. reply pdimitar 9 hours agorootparent> I'm personally impressed by this, but wouldn't be surprised if it contributed to the burnout. I think that people who contribute to languages are of a certain psychological type. They are generous, nice, kind, they want to contribute and are not interested in the social and people drama. They are a special breed of people whom I admire. At the same time, and as you point out, that makes them more vulnerable to burnout because the social / people drama always creeps in, and they seem less well equipped to deal with it (though I've known of very impressive exceptions). Personally I found out that bottling up negative emotions is futile; they inevitably erupt and the longer you have bottled them up, the more violent the explosion and the worse the ramifications for your mental health. That's my main reason for not mincing words anymore. I prioritize my mental health. I am OK if that means I part ways with people and companies.

Which only works as long as you have the power behind the powerslam putdown (in a personal project you do) and can deal with the consequences of cutting people off (which you say you are willing to). For everyone who doesn't have that power, and needs to work with others, it's not an option. Compare a physically large man saying \"I find it funny that people don't just stare others down and threaten them like I do\" and thinking that will work for everyone in every situation. If that's your project selection criteria - \"don't be thin skinned, man up, grow a pair!\" - it's not-meritocratic; like a selection based on wealth or social class or accent or nationality isn't. If you want X and Y's skills (public project) or contacts or signoff (professional work) then you will have to face their susceptibility to Z's manipulations and deal with it.

Were their priceless expressions \"you solved my problem, my hero!\" or were they \"you have no clue that my life is different to yours and with no attempt to empathise or understand, you expect the first thing you thought of will solve my problems and want me to be impressed?\" Women generally have less power in society, in companies, far less physical intimidation, less respect, fewer options, and need to depend more on social networks and support and building consensus to get along in life or get things done. Cutting off the network and getting a reputation as difficult to be friends/work with risks a lot more for women than it does for you. That \"I'm colder, more vicious, than you so I win. Empathy and emotions are weakness.\" is so ... last season. > \"It's also a fact that many devs are introverted and can be chased away by entitled and insolent loud people.

Again, fine for your personal project, but having a shouty vicious bouncer is turning away the porentially useful contributions of unknown people who don't want to fight their way into that kind of workplace. Consider @dang here at HN doesn't take the easy way out of shouting people down, swearing at them, putting them in their place; instead he patiently links the HN rules and politely explains what he's doing and why (your account is doing A, against the rules here, will be banned in this time, please do this or that specific thing), over and over and over.

Obviously yes, what's your point here? I don't get angry at work (where I don't have the power to tell people off) which is a double win. I got stuff to do, sometimes others get in the way, sometimes I make bad calls. Oh well, I made my peace with the fact that things can't happen as quickly as I want them to. And it's not even about \"thick skin\", it's more \"giving up on perfectionism\". > If that's your project selection criteria - \"don't be thin skinned, man up, grow a pair!\" - it's not-meritocratic; like a selection based on wealth or social class or accent or nationality isn't. The hell are you even talking about, and even bringing class / accent / nationality to the picture? It seems you just wanted to get stuff off of your chest and I was a convenient target. You're not even talking to me, again, you are talking to some fictional guy who does not exist. > That story shape is a perfect fit for \"everybody clapped\" meme, you feel superior to the stupid women who didn't even think of this power move, and wait for your applause. Your snark does not change the undeniable fact that I gave them advice that would have helped them with their mental health. Whether they accept it or not is on them. Those who didn't accept it also taught me a good lesson: to mind my own business and only give advice if I am asked to. It was a valuable life lesson that I am utilizing often (though definitely not always). And yes, some people were mind blown... though they did not clap. :D You got one thing right at least. > Cutting off the network and getting a reputation as difficult to be friends/work with risks a lot more for women than it does for you. Context matters a lot here. I was talking about completely optional interactions where zero work / money / influence was involved. They were \"buddies\" for 10+ years and their main goal was to basically outdo each other. Extremely toxic and I pointed that out to them. Some of them listened and said it felt very liberating to just stop. The rest I was not interested in communicating further with because they had a tendency to bring the same drama to our extremely casual communications, which naturally led to them fading away with time. > That \"I'm colder, more vicious, than you so I win. Empathy and emotions are weakness.\" is so ... last season. For the third time: you are not even talking about me. I am not cold at all, I simply learned to pick my battles. Seriously no idea what made you explode with so many assumptions, it must be somebody in your past and I probably reminded you of them. You should probably go talk to them though, not me. > Again, fine for your personal project, but having a shouty vicious bouncer is turning away the porentially useful contributions of unknown people who don't want to fight their way into that kind of workplace. Nowhere did I even implied I want a \"bouncer\" or that he/she must be \"shouty\". Stop projecting (4th time now). Also that phrase of yours reeks of FOMO. I am sick and tired of being a victim of FOMO. Somebody doesn't like that I called them out for being entitled and spamming my OSS project's issue tracker and as a result they go away and won't contribute anything ever? Cool! Win for everyone. You conflate a very classic case of \"fear of missing out\" with \"showing rude a-holes the door\". > Consider @dang here at HN doesn't take the easy way out of shouting people down I have considered him and other moderators a long time ago and found that I don't have what it takes to be a moderator, I don't want to have it and I am very fine with that. I am impressed by people who manage to keep the peace without alienating anyone except the biggest detractors but this is a non-goal for me, especially in the open-source contributing scene. I don't moderate forums and don't want to, and I'd be terrible at it. Again, I pick my battles. > Trying to build a community of disparate people is much harder than being a dictator who can tell disagreeable people to piss off. Another non-goal for me. When I start doing more open-source I'll be looking for people who contribute astute observations (\"You made mistake X in file Y\") or code. If somebody politely asks \"is this feature on the roadmap?\" I'll also politely say \"yes but it's a low priority for me, what's your use-case?\" and we can continue the interaction from there. But, somebody doing a drive-by saying \"I tried your project and it couldn't do X, your project sucks lol\" then I have zero qualms blocking them and removing whatever they posted. Did they have the worst day this year? I don't care. I had days after which I wondered if I even want to continue living, and nobody around me was none the wiser. They only saw a very tired guy who wasn't chatty, nothing else. I can protect people from my bad moods and bad days. I expect all people I interact with to do the same. And I am very fine with cutting off those that can't do it. --- No idea why you fixated on me as some sort of an enemy but you have aimed wrongly. Severely so. What I was saying is that I don't feel the need to smile politely at a-holes and use a soft language. And I don't. The rest is a plethora of projections from your side. That's one side of the coin. The other side is: if you are Linus, you have heard the same dumb questions or obviously wrong assertions, thousands of times.

Parent comment is fine but some of the replies are quite out there, calling this \"arrogant\" and \"dumb\". Let me provide my own opinion. IMO content over style. Nobody owes you adherence to a particular set of rules, nor do they owe you their thoughts at all. If the writer's style is a bridge too far for you, kindly just close the tab, don't complain about it. Certainly don't use hateful words to describe them. Remember, the same English teachers who taught you to capitalize also taught you that there is no singular \"they\" and that you should use \"he/she\" instead. reply Rudism 17 hours agorootparentI think that while authors are obviously free to make whatever stylistic choices they want, it's also valid for readers to point it out when those choices are so distracting that it interferes with the intended message of the writing (as long as it's done civilly). It reminds me of another recent-ish article that was posted to HN that used uncommon ligatures looping between certain letters, where a large part of that discussion was centered around how distracting that was. As an author, if you notice that your style choices are generating more interest and discussion than the actual content of your writing, it's probably worth considering whether the reasons that led you to those choices are really worth taking away from the messages you're trying to convey. Seeing as how the author of this post chimed in here to call their use of lowercase an \"asshole filter,\" I suppose it's clear where they stand on that question. I can see a future where we'll have browser extensions that use generative AI to \"correct\" style and grammar of articles to match the preferences of the reader, at which point stylistic choices may cease to matter as much. reply tredre3 12 hours agorootparentprev> Nobody owes you adherence to a particular set of rules, nor do they owe you their thoughts at all.

It’s not that people can’t understand various modifications and incorrect writing, it’s that it is harder for them, so you’re basically asking your readers to give more of their time to save you a bit of yours. And it’s especially bad in a blog or similar, where there is one writer and multiple readers. I spent maybe a few seconds on this post, but it will be read five, ten, fifty times.

It would be the easiest way to convey information. Alas, we don't have that ability, so we resort to the written word. If your goal is to spread something interesting don't make it more difficult for your readers by hiding your point behind a style choice that directly contradicts the readers' expectations. Capitalization goes hand-in-hand with punctuation. A period is only part of the formula that tells a reader that a complete thought is done. Capitalizing the next letter is a signal that the next complete thought is starting. The reader doesn't have to continually guess whether the punctuation was incorrectly or accidentally placed. I pushed through your style choice and read the article because what you had to say was interesting and important. But not all readers are going to grant you the same courtesy. If you really want the widest distribution possible do your readers a favor and capitalize things according to the rules. You used paragraphs and correct spelling, as well as avoiding things like run-on sentences and sentence fragments. It's obvious you want people to your read your work. Whatever reasons you have for choosing to not use capitalization, those reasons are not as important as the message you are trying to spread. reply zozbot234 19 hours agorootparentOP might be a non-English language speaker. Many languages don't use capitalization at all.

First: actor intentionally disrespected someone. Speaking in a movie theater, especially after being shushed. Using the letter \"u\" to mean \"you\" in formal business communication. Second: actor unintentionally disrespected someone. Clipping your fingernails in class. Badly misspelling someone's name in a critical business communication. Third: actor unintentionally makes an inconsequential error. Native English speakers misusing \"it's\" or \"your\" and their respective homophones, or missing antecedents (\"As an expert, it's important to do X and Y\" rather than \"As an expert, I think it's important to do X and Y\"). Fourth: actor intentionally makes an inconsequential error. Wearing obviously mismatched socks. Consistently writing in all lowercase. The key, for me, is evaluating intent and impact. Group #1 is asshole: they mean to hurt or annoy. Group #2 is incompetent: they make mistakes that matter. Group #3 is hapless: they make mistakes that don't matter. Group #4 is quirky or aloof: they're not hurting anyone, and they're OK if people draw negative inferences about them, so hey, it's a free country. You might reach different conclusions about the groups, or subdivide the groups further. (Anticipating critiques of my examples: yes, I really do think that misspelling the English pronoun \"you\" is disrespectful. Misspell your own name if you want to move from Group #1 to Group #4, but please don't misspell the word that you're using to represent me. And clipping your nails in class is such over-the-top behavior that I believe it's more about upbringing than intentional disrespect.) reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agoparentprevI admit it annoys me more than it should.

But it didn't start off that way. I shepherded it -almost entirely alone- for a decade, before I found a dedicated, motivated team that I trusted to take it over. They have done wonders for it. Most of its explosive expansion has taken off, under their watch. Walking away from it was the best thing that I could do for it. The last thing these folks need, is a \"Benevolent Dictator,\" peering over their shoulders, and giving suggestions. During the gestation decade, I had to be a not-so-benevolent dictator, many times, as people tried to take it over, change it to suit narrow sub-demographics (at the expense of everyone else), and even change its entire raison d'etre. I got a ton of pretty vicious hate mail and there are people that still hate me (I cry myself to sleep over that, every night), after a decade. In one instance, I had to wait until one nasty old bastard popped his clogs, before I could spread it to the entire Pacific Northwest. During that time, I learned how not to behave. A lot of that hate, was because I'm actually pretty good at slapping back, but I really needed to learn diplomacy. Even when they are nasty, and we are right, we often need to just swallow our pride, and let the dervishes whirl. I don't miss working on it, and I'm really glad the new team are doing so good with it.

CI is good. more tests are good. but there's a limit to how much they can catch. here is an example: there is an internal type checking API called [`resolve_vars_if_possible`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/...). this needs to be called on the output of almost any call to `.normalize()`, or you will get an internal compiler error. the conditions under which you get an ICE are quite complicated; sometimes you need 6 or more items in the crate with `impl Trait` or type_alias_impl_trait or const generics involved. but it's very easy to see there's a bug just by looking at the code and seeing the missing `resolve_vars()` call. how can we automate this? well, rustc has a mechanism for \"internal lints\", but they're somewhat annoying to write - you're basically writing a new compiler pass, and it needs to not have false positives. it's much easier to just catch this one instance. so the reviewer, who's already burned out, does this quick manual review instead. reply pas 10 hours agorootparenthm, is it possible to ... add these trivial-by-look-but-hard-to-script things to a checklist as an auto-comment to PRs? is there a list of these? anyway, thanks for writing this post, and for featuring that awesome message/art/logo/thing at the end \\m/ reply jynelson 8 hours agorootparentyes, it's possible! that list doesn't exist today but i would love to create it. i wrote a draft a few years ago before shifting to other work; someone recently expressed interest in reviving that project: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1463“it won’t get done if i don’t do it” and “i need to review everything or stuff will slip through” is exactly the mindset of my own burnout from rust. I've already caught myself getting into this mindset a few times. For one particular issue, I got a bit mad because it felt like I was the only one trying to move a critical issue forward, and other people were treating it as a distant priority. In that case, what helped was moving away from the issue for a few days, and seeing other people pick up speed and make progress on it in the meantime. Having supportive colleagues is super helpful. I don't know how much this will be a problem in the coming year.

Writing C makes certain classes of sloppy assembly bugs unwritable, like accidentally using the wrong calling convention, forgetting to preserve a register, or forgetting to pop something off the stack. Similarly, Rust makes classes of sloppy C bugs unwritable, like using a dangling pointer. Why do you view that as an attack on C programmers? It's no more an attack on them than C was an attack on assembly programmers. reply uecker 13 hours agorootparentThe attack is the idea that everybody needs to have the same priorities that Rust has and so everybody else is wrong. With regard to memory safety, this even something I could partially agree with, but then there is another problem: In contrast to Cyclone, which was a safe version of C, Rust changes a lot more than simply adding memory safety features. It is not at all like C but has completely different syntax, different conventions, and complexity similar to C++. So in many ways, I find it inferior to C (although I agree that memory safety is good), but Rust people think it is superior in every way and behave like this. reply cangeroo 17 hours agoprevI'm excited for the Rust project. But to add a superficial observation: It seems that the Rust project is not very diverse. Could that contribute to culture problems? It seems to have a disproportionately high, relatively to society, percentage of white, male, strongly LGBT-oriented personalities, who usually have a female Japanese cartoon character, or maybe a furry, as their profile picture on GitHub. Which is fine, whatever, but I worry that it suffers from groupthink and excludes different minds. Maybe it's hostile to plain people that just want to focus on programming? I suspect that people like Torvalds wouldn't survive long, and that's a shame. And if you want to be really critical: Maybe the leadership is happy that specific people are leaving? Maybe burnout is a tool? Maybe it's a way of social control and censorship?

Some of the PRs I submitted were pretty dumb and a complete waste of someone's time to review/reject but they showed enough patience to help me get \"over the hump\" and to eventually get commit access to the repo -- which didn't really help with getting features implemented because I have an apparently unlimited supply of dodgy ideas and would get \"why is this needed?\" a lot. I also had a habit of getting code to about 80% there before doing a PR \"for discussion\" knowing full well the lead maintainer would fix up the remaining 20% if it were a valuable enough addition.

    "originBody": "WhisperSpeech If you have questions or you want to help you can find us in the #audio-generation channel on the LAION Discord server. An Open Source text-to-speech system built by inverting Whisper. Previously known as spear-tts-pytorch. We want this model to be like Stable Diffusion but for speech – both powerful and easily customizable. We are working only with properly licensed speech recordings and all the code is Open Source so the model will be always safe to use for commercial applications. Currently the models are trained on the English LibreLight dataset. In the next release we want to target multiple languages (Whisper and EnCodec are both multilanguage). Progress update [2024-01-10] We’ve pushed a new SD S2A model that is a lot faster while still generating high-quality speech. We’ve also added an example of voice cloning based on a reference audio file. As always, you can check out our Colab to try it yourself! Progress update [2023-12-10] Another trio of models, this time they support multiple languages (English and Polish). Here are two new samples for a sneak peek. You can check out our Colab to try it yourself! English speech, female voice (transferred from a Polish language dataset): whisperspeech-sample.mp4 A Polish sample, male voice: whisperspeech-sample-pl.mp4 Older progress updates are archived here Downloads We encourage you to start with the Google Colab link above or run the provided notebook locally. If you want to download manually or train the models from scratch then both the WhisperSpeech pre-trained models as well as the converted datasets are available on HuggingFace. Roadmap Gather a bigger emotive speech dataset Figure out a way to condition the generation on emotions and prosody Create a community effort to gather freely licensed speech in multiple languages Train final multi-language models Architecture The general architecture is similar to AudioLM, SPEAR TTS from Google and MusicGen from Meta. We avoided the NIH syndrome and built it on top of powerful Open Source models: Whisper from OpenAI to generate semantic tokens and perform transcription, EnCodec from Meta for acoustic modeling and Vocos from Charactr Inc as the high-quality vocoder. Whisper for modeling semantic tokens We utilize the OpenAI Whisper encoder block to generate embeddings which we then quantize to get semantic tokens. If the language is already supported by Whisper then this process requires only audio files (without ground truth transcriptions). EnCodec for modeling acoustic tokens We use EnCodec to model the audio waveform. Out of the box it delivers reasonable quality at 1.5kbps and we can bring this to high-quality by using Vocos – a vocoder pretrained on EnCodec tokens.

The key here is that the Whisper multilingual ASR model has been trained on a huge amount of data, so its encoder output is a very good representation of the semantic content of speech. This can be used as an open-source, drop-in replacement for the semantic encoder in model architectures like SPEAR-TTS/VALL-E/etc (whose semantic encoders are not publicly available). This is then used to predict acoustic tokens (the output from the quantized/low-bandwidth Encodec audio codec) which is then upsampled/denoised/enhanced with the Vocos vocoder. I know someone is working on Hindi but it would be great to see this extended to other languages for a properly open-source [1], multilingual TTS platform. I think the main bottleneck at the moment is finding people who can procure/clean compliant datasets.

Voice quality, emotional awareness / inflection and support for foreign languages are top-notch, it's that last point that OpenAI seems to have the most issues with. If you find a good voice to clone, the latest models can even replicate somewhat unusual accents and speaking styles. For plain old English TTS with a stock voice, there isn't that much of a difference (although Eleven Labs still wins IMO), but if you need either voice cloning or foreign language support, nothing else comes even close. With that said, Eleven is extremely pricy, something like Azure TTS (which is the best among the cheap options) may be a better fit for less demanding applications. reply reissbaker 2 hours agorootparentThe quality difference between Eleven and OpenAI is IMO pretty small, but the price difference is enormous: for 50,000 characters (approx 1hr of audio, by Eleven's estimates), you'd pay Eleven Labs $9 assuming you're in their highest $330/month payment commitment tier; for OpenAI there's no minimum commitment and the same number of characters would cost $0.75. If you're generating speech once and replaying it many times (e.g. making podcasts), the difference is negligible and you might as well go with Eleven Labs, since it's more customizable and possibly slightly higher quality. If you're doing interactive speech with customers, $9/hr is incredibly expensive (higher than hiring a minimum-wage worker in the U.S.!), and OpenAI's TTS is a very close second best and much more reasonably priced. If you're trying to integrate speech into an AI product, Eleven makes your hourly costs pretty unfeasible since you have to at minimum charge your customers more than it costs to hire a human being to do a task. Azure's \"Neural\" line of TTS is the best of the big cloud offerings, but it's pretty mediocre compared to either OpenAI or Eleven Labs IMO. And it's actually more expensive than using OpenAI: it's $0.80 for 50,000 characters (~1hr), unless you're willing to commit to over $1k monthly spend, at which point it's barely cheaper than OpenAI at $0.64 per 50k characters.

Whisper and self-hostable LLMs had a cambrian explosion about 1 year ago, I attended a GPT4 hackathon last March and in 48 hours saw people hook up Speech2Text -> LLM -> Text2Speech pipelines for their live demos. I thought we would all have babelfish by June. Months later I later attended some conferences with international speakers that really wanted to have live, translated-on-the-fly captions, but there wasn't anything off the shelf they could use. I found a helpful repo to use whisper with rolling transcription but struggled to get the python prerequisites installed (involving hardlinking to a tensorflow repo for my particular version of m1 CPU). It was humbling and also hype-busting to realize that it takes time to productize, and that the LLMs are not magic that can write these applications themselves. In the meantime even Google hasn't bothered to run the improved transcription models on YouTube videos. They are still old 80% accurate tech that's useless on anyone with an accent. reply huijzer 4 hours agorootparent> on the contrary I'm really disappointed in how long its taking anything to get into production. I agree. I was thinking about making a Jarvis like bot which should be pretty easy at this point. The main problem was that my iPhone doesn’t easily allow for pressing a button upon which it starts listening. You always need to unlock first at which the whole screen gets unlocked too. Maybe these kind of GUI-focussed interfaces are blocking a lot of ideas?

The gap between nothing and a proof of concept is, in some ways, much smaller than the gap between proof of concept and commercial product. reply colechristensen 4 hours agoparentprevThis is the structure of revolutions, particularly of this kind. Exponential growth looks like this. In particular with the generation / recognition abilities of ML models, they have this feature of being a curiosity but not quite useful... so if a speech recognition program goes from 50% accuracy to 75% accuracy it's a huge accomplishment but the program is still approximately as useless when it's done. Going from 98% to 99% accuracy on the other hand still cuts the errors in half, but it's super impressive going from something that's useful but makes mistakes to making half as many mistakes. Once you hit the threshold of minimum usefulness the exponential growth seems like it's sudden and amazing when it's actually been going on for a long time. At the same time, we've had a few great improvements in methodology with how models are designs (like transformers) and the first iterations showed how impressive things could be but were full of inefficiencies and we're watching those go away rather quickly. reply RockRobotRock 2 hours agoprev [–] holy shit what. how? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

WeasyPrint is implemented as a from-scratch and specific-purpose rendering engine, so yeah, it’s different. But wkhtmltopdf uses WebKit, meaning it’s much the same as htmldocs, just backed by a different browser engine. It’s important to realise, though, that using an existing browser engine doesn’t mean everything’s hunky-dory: in fact, when it comes to some of the things you care about with producing PDFs, some things will be worse, and the WeasyPrint approach has significant advantages. Because browsers don’t care about your use case at all. From time to time they’ll improve things incidentally, but all browsers are missing things like a lot of CSS Paged Media stuff, stuff that’s often been specified for a decade or more, where things like WeasyPrint have had them for years and years. reply monax 15 hours agoparentAs the maintainer of wkhtmltopdf @ Odoo I can tell you it's not WebKit. Instead it's outdated WebKit from 2014 running on top of QT4 '^^ reply elmo2you 12 hours agorootparent@monax Since you're the maintainer, I'll assume you no doubt will know more about it than me. But from what I (vaguely) recall, it's worse than that. Not at liberty to elaborate on exact details, but not so long ago I had to deal with wkhtmltopdf, when it turned out to be the (still preferred/recommended) PDF rendering solution as part of a major popular web middle-ware framework, at a large corporate client. I was rather shocked to see a top-tear prestigious international institution working with such outdated tech (albeit certainly in ignorance), but never mind that. What struck me most was the nature of the bugs I encountered. Probably one of the most baffling: seemingly randomly changing formatting of the output. In the end it turned out to be a Windows specific problem, where multiple administrators logged onto the Windows Server hosting the web application. Because of different workstation display geometries on their end, they effectively kept changing the display DPI settings of that server (a headless machine, only accessed through RDP). That in turn affected the rendering internals of wkhtmltopdf. Rather hilarious when I finally figured it out. That's when I learned it best never again use wkhtmltopdf on any Windows system (if anywhere at all, for that matter). Wasn't the WebKit core even older than 2014? Maybe something about it being older but then just maintained independently until 2014 .. or something like that? Or maybe my memory is just messed up and failing me. Either way, what I do remember is my amazement about seeing this (at best) 10 year old code (arguably of questionable quality to start with and certainly outdated by now) still in use as a go-to solution for rendering PDF from HTML. Ended up replaced it with a puppeteer-based solution. Arguably with its own problems, but less of a black hole than wkhtmltopdf. Especially considering it was (also) rendering user-supplied data. What could ever go wrong, right? reply monax 10 hours agorootparentIt seems you have more information about this situation than I do, as I recently took on the role of project maintainer and wasn't involved from the start. I find the bug you mentioned interesting, and I'll promptly investigate to determine if it still exists. If I remember correctly, there's a --dpi option that may have already resolved this issue. I share your concern about the code's state; it's problematic as it's currently leaking file descriptors and memory all over the place. We experimented with Puppeteer as an alternative, but its speed and memory usage were too high for our specific use case, so we're currently stuck with the current wkhtmltopdf. reply elmo2you 9 hours agorootparentJust to clarify, I'm not bashing wkhtmltopdf. I think it is a great tool (or at least it was), for what it was initially designed for. I've used it myself several times, to great effect. Albeit mostly long ago (about a decade or so). I'm not even concerned all that much about the code's state itself, rather that it still shows up today. In situations it was probably never designed for. Adding to that, it now often appears wrapped inside some interfacing layer/code, binding it to whatever other software it is embedded in. But then only exposing part of wkhtmltopdf. Case in point, the --dpi option you mentioned (which indeed might fix the mentioned bug), was simply inaccessible through how the framework interfaced with wkhtmltopdf (which was a design cluster-F# in its own right). However, the bigger elephant in the room for me is that the HTML/CSS support has changed considerably over the last decade, with wkhtmltopdf pretty much stuck in time. It's just pretty much a random hit or miss when it comes to rendering any modern web content. Only for carefully crafted (legacy) content does it still make a good use case. I won't blame wkhtmltopdf for that though, but I sure haves questions for those who apparently still consider it a valid tool for integration into modern web frameworks. I guess part of that comes down to unintentional ignorance, not knowing what they are actually integrating. Another reason might be that I've not seen much of a better sort-of-drop-in replacement for wkhtmltopdf, so people stick to it far a lack of a proper alternative. Maybe some of the people who integrated wkhtmltopdf elsewhere are even very well aware of all the limitations/dangers. Still, little use of that if that knowledge is lost on those who subsequently end up using it, primarily just as consumers. Puppeteer is a very different beast in its own right, regardless which engine/browser you end up using. But if more modern html/css features are required, it can be a valid replacement (regardless of numerous downsides nonetheless). Still, I (also) doubt that it will work as a good replacement for all of wkhtmltopdf's use cases. If nothing else, I got some free entertainment out of it all .. watching the shocked expression on the faces of top-level suits, when I explained to them what they had been blissfully unaware of. They had good reasons to be worried, because this exposure should have been caught by their rigorous technology-review procedures. However, it had been an ad-hock dependencies that was introduced as part of a legit feature request. The dev had probably never even noticed, because it appeared as a native framework functionality (hiding any obvious reference to using wkhtmltopdf under the hood). Anyways, wkhtmltopdf is certainly not to be blamed for that. Still, it does illustrate the dangers of modern-day software integration. I think especially in (web) frameworks, where the name of the game often appears to have turned towards a popularity contest (with competing frameworks) and \"making things as simple as possible\". Something about a road paved with good intentions. reply tharos47 18 hours agoparentprevYou can use paged.js (https://pagedjs.org/) it's a polyfill for CSS Paged Media to generate good PDFs with modern HTML/CSS. reply cubefox 17 hours agoprevSee also native CSS support for paged media: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/ When I looked into it several years ago, browser support for some critical features wasn't there yet. Not sure whether this has improved. In principle, this would be a great alternative to proprietary PDF rendering libraries which require you to design your document completely in (e.g. Java) code, and to the typical LaTeX approach. You really appreciate the elegance of HTML+CSS once you had the misfortune of having to do a simple fucking table in LaTeX. reply lelanthran 16 hours agoparentI dunno about that. For simple stuff, sure HTML and CSS is great, but when I want something print-perfect I use LaTeX. A simple table in LaTeX is no harder than in HTML, assuming the same level of knowledge in the tool. But then when you throw in a simple requirement like \"left margins on even pages and right margins on odd pages need to be larger\", HTML becomes hell to work in. HTML and CSS, even with a media query for print, sucks. reply kelvinzhang 16 hours agorootparentI think in the long term, HTML/CSS will win out once there's better support for CSS Paged Module Level 3, and you'll be able to achieve that requirement with just @page :left { margin-left: 20mm; margin-right: 10mm; } @page :right { margin-left: 10mm; margin-right: 20mm; } instead of needing to install/import different LaTeX packages. I think for most of my current use-cases level 2 has been sufficient but I can see if I can include Paged.js polyfill support by default so there's more support for customizability on that front. reply x905 16 hours agorootparent@Page { size: A4; margin: 20mm 10mm 10mm 25mm; } Do my print specifics (hidden-print class etc), everyone can optimize it for his local layout, every browser supports \"print to pdf\", done. reply philistine 15 hours agorootparentprevTeX at this point has entered computing legend.

Maybe[1]. CSS and HTML needs a lot more functionality though. They have no page counter, no chapter counter, section counters, etc. No river detection, run detection, orphan detection, etc. No automatic reference manager[2], no automatic referencing of chapters, sections, tables, figures, etc. Missing correct hyphenation breakpoints. Additionally, some things are there, but in a poor (for typesetting) way - inter-paragraph spacing must be faked (no, `:after` isn't a good way to specify `inter` spacing), no way to prevent what should be an atomic element (say ... an mbox containing a paragraph and an image) being broken across pages, no way to float an element to the next point in the document where it will fit (LaTeX does this by default, and it annoyed me no end when I could not find a way to get HTML documents to stop breaking my pretty short table across a page, and instead just place it on the next page). Another thing that I think are a poor fit, but others think are superior, are the scripting facilities for creating new commands: doing `ewcommand or ewenvironment` is a lot less friction than doing an entire custom element. It's so little friction, that for an invoice I can simply do `ewcommand{\\client}{\\textbf\\emph{The Client PTY LTD}}` and then use `\\client` everywhere in the document. I'm looking forward to a new LaTeX/TeX that fixes all those things. Maybe CSS+HTML would eventually get them, but many of those things are table stakes for typesetting, and yet they are not even on the horizon (or roadmap) for CSS+HTML. [1] Could be I'm wrong. Like I said in another response, I'm no expert in CSS or HTML. [1] This can be easily resolved with a custom web component > And that way is CSS.

WeasyPrint implements its own rendering engine and might support some specific @page properties that Chromium does not but given the complexity of CSS and web browsers, you're generally better off sticking with Chromium due to its history.

For those interested in giving it a try, please contact us at support at cx-reports dot com. We are providing complimentary licenses to users who are eager to collaborate with us during this phase.

I’m amazed it’s still in use. reply nsim 8 hours agorootparentIt does the job very nicely, and I can easily embed on-the-fly generated images. Not sure there is a better option in the Java ecosystem. Thanks for your long lived contribution. reply kayo_20211030 16 hours agoprevThis might be great, and it might not. It's hard to tell as a lot of the documentation is missing, or has broken links. It would be really nice if the docs were more complete, and didn't require a sign-up to kick the types. Is it fundamentally better than, say Apache FOP? Multi-page tables with overflow/keep together control is hard. Does this do it better? I can't tell as all the templates seem to be single page. reply amcaskill 17 hours agoprevThis looks awesome, congratulations. I think you’re onto something here. I work on an OSS reporting and analytics tool (https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence) and the amount of time and effort that goes into a really good “print pdf”, and how valuable people find it, has been one of the more surprising parts of the project to me. reply cholmon 16 hours agoprevWhat is the pricing like, e.g., per-template created, per-PDF rendered, or per-API call? I don't see any pricing info on the public site. reply kelvinzhang 16 hours agoparentPricing info is in a modal under the user dropdown, it's currently based on a monthly credit system. If there's another pricing model you'd prefer, let me know! reply ihaveajob 16 hours agorootparentMy feedback is that I was ready to move on after I searched for pricing, and it appears that it's not shown anywhere unless I sign up. I'll give it a try because it looks interesting and I'm looking for something similar. reply jppittma 18 hours agoprevOh, is this like a paid version of pandoc? reply kelvinzhang 18 hours agoparentYou can probably get away with Pandoc depending on your use-case, this is primarily built for: - having a web editor interface without needing to re-run a CLI command - people who don't want to deal with packages/dependencies on their own system - users that just want an affordable and easy-to-use API to generate PDF documents instead of having to set up their own servertask queueworker system which would usually cost more - in the future, teams that want to collaborate together on a document reply chrisfinazzo 11 hours agoprevWeasyprint has a bunch of options to do almost anything you can think of, but in my case, it's just a generator. To your point that htmldocs supports more modern CSS features, I can see the advantage. Although the most complicated things I needed - aside from @page rules - were a replacement for a 2nd page header (solved w/ Flexbox) and automatic page breaks that would display correctly (a few lines of CSS processed w/ Weasyprint came out better and didn't require me to print to PDF manually.) reply NanoWar 12 hours agoprevI have used Gotenberg [1] in a production environment. Dockerized in a Kubernetes Cluster. It just works! I can absolutely recommend it. Uses Chromium under the hood and was able to render gradients and text shadow, nice! [1] https://gotenberg.dev/ reply criddell 10 hours agoprevThere’s a similarly named html -> pdf tool called htmldoc: https://www.msweet.org/htmldoc/ It’s crazy fast, but doesn’t handle Unicode well or have much support for CSS. reply taulien 18 hours agoprevHi @kelvinzhang, the burger menu does not work on firefox for android reply atoav 17 hours agoparentSame for me. I get a blue focus ring, but no menu. reply gazook89 16 hours agoparentprevDoes not work in FF on iOS either (WebKit) reply kelvinzhang 16 hours agoparentprevFixed! Sorry about that reply shanecleveland 14 hours agoprevThis looks well implemented. I will play with it some. I have a couple projects that rely on html interface to pdf output (or at least print > save to PDF reliability). I would love to be able to remove the management of internal dependencies. reply cpr 18 hours agoprevGreat stuff! Yes, please open source it. reply benoror 14 hours agoprevHad a similar scrapped idea a few years ago: https://benoror.github.io/laystack-landing/ reply jdthedisciple 18 hours agoprevAwesome idea, been looking for something like this every now and then, esp right now. But could use some performance improvements... Maybe you tested this on your state of the art workstation but my i7 8th gen is getting choked to death... EDIT: It doesn't seem to work: I picked the resume template and set the margin and padding on `li` to 0 but nothing changed in the output. reply kelvinzhang 18 hours agoparentI think it should be on thetag. See https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_li... reply nimalu 19 hours agoprevPlease open source it!! I've looked for a solution like this multiple times. Well done! reply thinkindie 17 hours agoprevThe landing page after login resembles Gdoc but that's ok. One small thing, when signing up with Gmail, it still asks for my Name and Surname when supposedly it's something you can get out of the OAuth APIs. reply kitd 14 hours agoprevGood luck with the project. About 20 years ago, I did something along similar lines, except going the HTML-XML-XSL/FO-Apache FOP. That was ... \"fun\". reply shafyy 16 hours agoprevWould love to see an open-source version. Also, are you thinking of making a version that one could run locally with the command line? reply anilgulecha 18 hours agoprevDoes jsreport already cover the usecases listed? https://playground.jsreport.net/ reply awongh 18 hours agoprevCool service! I like that it’s just HTML/CSS but the front end editor looks quite cool. I also just open sourced part of my app that does PDF generation, but it’s completely bare bones. I basically wanted a wrapper around the pdf generating part of chromium so that i could generate pdfs on pages within my own app. Its here if anyone wants to check it out: https://github.com/awongh/bakso-doc reply Dowwie 13 hours agoprevrun headless chrome to render your web page to pdf reply kevin_thibedeau 17 hours agoprevYou pretty much spelled out the use case for XSL-FO. reply 20 hours agoprev [–] [deleted] GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
